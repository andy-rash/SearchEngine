      <text xml:space="preserve">The communication and exchange between actors in the political context constitutes the realm of &quot;diplomatic history.&quot; Not altogether different from a history of war, or peace, or of great women and men, diplomatic history illuminates the efforts of those who sought the interests of their political incorporation-- or themselves, as well as the complex and ever-changing relationships amongst actors at all levels of political discourse: international, state, and individual. 

The Diplomatic History journal, run out of the University of Colorado is primarily concerned with &quot;international history and foreign relations, broadly defined, including grand strategy, diplomacy, and issues involving gender, culture, ethnicity, and ideology,&quot; comparing issues in global and comparative contexts.

These are the issues through which diplomatic history is analyzed and framed.

Numerous factors can affect national interests besides climate, geography and natural resources.  These can include many aspects of culture, history, demographics and politics.

History can include long-ago or recent events that continue to shape a country's actions.  These can include wars and injustices leading to rivalries between nations with little ostensible reason for animosity.  History can powerfully affect a country's national interest.  Bitterness over historical events can last for centuries, while gratitude and goodwill are perhaps more ephemeral.

:After [[wikipedia:en:World War 1|World War 1]], Germany's economy was hardstruck by the effects of the [[wikipedia:en:Treaty of Versailles|Treaty of Versailles]], leading to a national sense of bitterness towards countries like France and the United Kingdom, which help set the stage for [[wikipedia:en:World War 2|World War 2]], when Germany invaded many of its neighbors.  After World War 2, Japan adopted a constitution that does not allow the creation of a military force, hampering the country's ability to help in military operations with the [[wikipedia:en:United Nations|United Nations]] and allies like the United States.

:In the run-up to the [[wikipedia:en:2003_occupation_of_Iraq|2003 occupation of Iraq]], many American commentators expressed bitterness over France's refusal to support the invasion.  Many perceived a lack of gratitude for American aid during World War 2, while France's defenders pointed out that country's aid during the American War for Independence.

Culture includes a society's language, religion, lifestyle, clothing, decor and many other aspects.  Cultural splits within countries sometimes lead to strife because different parts of the country have different interests.  The [[wikipedia:en:American Civil War|American Civil War]] is an example of a country torn apart by the opposing interests of culturally distinct regions.

:More recently, religious animosity has led to violence and chaos in many Middle-Eastern countries, especially Israel.  The creation of Israel was prompted by fears of [[wikipedia:en:anti-Semitism|anti-Semitism]] leading to a repeat of the attempted genocide of the Jews during the [[wikipedia:en:Holocaust|Holocaust]], and Israel's foreign relations have long been affected by fears of anti-Semitism harming Jews abroad.  Conflicts over religion, geography, ethnicity and other issues have led to ongoing violence with [[wikipedia:en:Palestinians|Palestinians]] and Arab neighbors like Syria and Egypt.

:Cultural ties between peoples living in different countries has caused strife and war.  For example, the [[wikipedia:en:Kurd|Kurd]]s live in several countries, including Iraq and Turkey, the latter a key US ally in the region.  With Kurdish leaders calling for an independent Kurdistan, the US was torn between supporting its Kurdish allies and the Turkish government, which believed that any independence for Iraqi Kurds could spur a revival of similar hopes among Turkish Kurds.  [[wikipedia:en:Nationalism|Nationalism]] plays an important role in this phenomenon, which has also included calls for a [[wikipedia:en:Greater Somalia|Greater Somalia]], a view that has twice led to war with Ethiopia over the Somali [[wikipedia:en:Ogaden|Ogaden]] region, and [[wikipedia:en:Greater Serbia|Greater Serbia|]], a motivation for the [[wikipedia:en:Kosovo War|Kosovo War]].

Demographics are the make-up of a country.  Some countries have a very young population, such as Zambia, while others have a large elderly population, such as Sweden.  Some countries are made up nearly entirely of one ethnic group speaking a single language, such as Iceland, while others are a melting pot of dozens or hundreds of ethnic groups, such as many of the equatorial African contries like the Republic of the Congo.

:Demographic conflict has long been a source of strife on the diverse continent of Africa.  In South Africa, for example, a white minority long controlled a huge black majority ([[wikipedia:en:Apartheid|Apartheid]]), eventually straining relations with countries like the United States, which imposed an embargo as a result.

:Ethnically diverse states such as most of the Sub-Saharan African countries were created from European colonies in the region, which had no basis in rational geographic or cultural boundaries.  As a result, many of the earliest leaders in these countries pursued as a high priority the formation of a national identity; this occurred in nations across Africa, including [[Wikipedia:en:Zambia|Zambia]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Sudan|Sudan]].  In the rush to create a distinctive culture, minorities and dissenters were often marginalized or oppressed, leading to revolutions and civil strife..

Politics can occur within a single country or among countries.  Activities involving the internal political landscape of a country can have an affect on national interests and foreign relations through the election or installment of leaders who enact foreign policy, while laws passed by a particular country may have an affect on the economy of a different country.

:Internal conflicts between political blocs of capitalists and socialists led to a polarization of international relations.  Countries like the United States, France and Italy jockeyed for power with the Soviet Union and satellites in newly-independent countries across Africa, South America and Asia (see [[wikipedia:en:Cold War|The Cold War]]).

:Following the internationally divisive US-led occupation of Iraq in 2003, foreign countries around the world were forced to pay close attention to the American political landscape.  Some, like Israel, were supportive of the conservative right, while others, like France, supported the liberal left.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Forth language is a stack-based language designed for rapid interactive programming in limited-resource environments. Forth is interesting because it can be simple and small, yet it allows for remarkably powerful extensions to be written in Forth itself; most fully-fledged Forth systems are implemented partially in Forth. Forth is most often used to write [[Embedded Systems|embedded applications]].

Forth emphasizes a number of classic computer ideas, such as
* one pass compilation
* factoring and subroutines
* interactivity &lt;!-- &quot;and visibility into the subroutines&quot; - huh? --&gt;
* making an application to get a result greater than the sum of its parts.
Many ritual necessities of other languages and required designer syntax falls away.

Forth is an extensible language, giving the user great flexibility to extend it.  This is both a pro and a con.  As with modeling clay, in the hands of an architect with a clear philosophy it can work wonders, or it can create a hodgepodge.  Much Forth programming consists of &quot;adding words to a dictionary&quot; and learning someone's program, the words they have chosen to create, and their significance is often confused with learning the language itself.

In September, [[en:1941|1941]], [[en:Enrico Fermi|Enrico Fermi]] designed what became known as the [[en:Chicago Pile|Chicago Pile]], the first controlled [[en:nuclear|nuclear]] reaction.  This proved that [[en:nuclear energy|nuclear energy]] was real, and usable, and gave impetuous to those who would use nuclear power for more destructive purposes.  Built out of a lattice of [[en:Uranium|Uranium]], it used [[en:Graphite|Graphite]] as a controlling substance, to slow down the rate of [[en:fission|fission]]. December 2, 1942 marked the first successful test of Fermi’s Chicago Pile.

On December 6th, 1941, the [[en:Advisory Committee of Uranium|Advisory Committee of Uranium]] created the first timetable for the development of a Nuclear Bomb. 

May 23, 1942, marked the decision to proceed with all methods for isotope separation and plutonium production that had been developed to this point. 

In June, 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed head of the bomb development group, and investigated the theoretical aspects of the design. Group members include Hans Bethe, Robert Serber, Emil Konopinksi, John Va Vleck, Felix Bloch, Richard Tolman, and Edward Teller. Tolmer suggests [[en:fission|fission]] by [[en:implosion|implosion]]. 

[[Image:MED_Map.jpg|250px|right]]

On September 17th, 1942, [[en:Leslie Groves|Leslie Groves]] was appointed military head of the project, at which point went about obtaining large amounts of high-grade uranium, created the [[en:Oak Ridge|Oak Ridge]] site for development of fissionable uranium, and gave the [[en:Manhattan Project|Manhattan Project]] the top secrecy rating. November, 1942, marked the acquisition and development of the [[en:Los Alamos|Los Alamos]] site for development of the bomb platform. 

In January, 1943, a large tract of land was acquired in Washington for the construction of the reactors that were to produce plutonium.
February 1943 marked the construction of a Y-12 electromagnetic Uranium separation plant begins  at Oak Ridge. The next month, construction of Oak Ridge's X-10 reactor site chemical separation plant began.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called F8DLJ. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name F8DLJ~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Ceviche (or cebiche) is traditional Latin-American dish in maritime areas. In its classic form, it is composed of chunks of raw fish, lime juice, chopped onion, and minced ''ají limo'' or ''rocoto'', both types of [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|chile]]s.  The recipe below for '''Ceviche of Shrimp and Sea Bass''' is not &quot;authentic&quot; but should be edible.

==Ingredients==
*1 pound (450 g) [[Cookbook:Shrimp|Shrimp]] (16/20 per pound), peeled and cleaned
*2 pounds (900 g) meaty [[cookbook:Fish|white fish]], such as [[Cookbook:Sea bass|Sea bass]], boned, and cut into large dice
*1 red [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]], minced
*1 piece [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]], peeled, minced

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to update the kernel, you need to have knowledge of the hardware on your system, or have a prepared .config file compatible with the new kernel.

== Reasons for updating ==
The Linux kernel is an active interface between the hardware and the
operating system. All [[Linux]] operating systems have a kernel. After sometime the kernel may become out of date, or you (the user) may
require additional functionality that the current kernel cannot
provide. So a kernel update/upgrade is required.

== Quick reference ==
* Download kernel from http://www.kernel.org (via HTTP, FTP, RSYNC)
* &lt;code&gt;make menuconfig&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;make [[w:xconfig|xconfig]]&lt;/code&gt;)
* &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt; cp /usr/src/&lt;linuxkernel&gt;/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-&lt;kernel version&gt;
* edit your [[w:bootloader]] (ie. [[w:GRUB|GRUB]] or [[w:LILO|LILO]]) configurations, adding a new boot option which points to the new kernel.
&lt;/code&gt;

== Updating the kernel ==
*Download kernel
To start going to the kernel website located at http://www.kernel.org/ via HTTP, FTP, or RSYNC

 wget ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/VERSION/FILE
...where &lt;code&gt;VERSION&lt;/code&gt; is a kernel version 
(like [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4 v2.4] or [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6 v2.6]) and where &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; is an archive in [[w:TAR|tar.gz]] or [[w:bzip2|tar.bz2]] format: ([ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.32.tar.bz2 linux-2.4.32.tar.bz2] (30.4 MB) or [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.32.tar.gz linux-2.4.32.tar.gz] (37.7 MB) or [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2 linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2] (38.2 MB) or [ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.14.tar.gz linux-2.6.14.tar.gz] (47 MB).

Here you can download complete kernels or kernel patches. On writing this article the most up to date kernel is 2.6.11.10. The 6 means that it is a stable release (even is stable, odd is unstable). So 2.5 would have
been a testing kernel. The 10 refers to the version number for the current 2.6 kernel.

Depending on what kind of computer you have, you will probably want the
most up-to-date version, so that it has the greatest support.

* Install the kernel
If you have downloaded a '''bz2''' file 

type: '''tar -xjvf filename.bz2''' to unzip 

If you have downloaded a '''gzip''' file use 
type: '''tar -xzvf filename.gz'''

To keep with file system convention this file should be untared (unziped) to
'''/usr/src/''', where all your source code should be stored.

*Compiling the Kernel
If you have an already existing .config file that is compatible with the current kernel you &quot;can&quot; copy that into this dir and run make menuconfig, but a fresh install would be advisable.
type: '''make menuconfig'''

You will see that you have been given a menu that you can browse using
your cursor keys and enter button.

In another prompt using the command '''lspci'''.
You can see a list of the hardware on your computer. You
want to make sure that the key components on that list are installed
on your computer. Unfortunately this HOW-TO cannot tell you what to install, but reading the help pages provided will give useful advice.

After you have completed selecting the components for your kernel.

type: '''make'''

this will then compile your new kernel.

*Installing new kernel
If this has been completed with no errors

type '''cp /usr/src/&lt;kernel-version&gt;/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-kernel-version'''

be sure to keep your old kernel just in case something goes wrong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Pentatonic scales all have five notes, although this is really a coincidence. They are called pentatonic scales because each note in the scale is a fifth (seven semitones) relative to another note.&quot; 
:I don't think this is true; it only holds true for the major pentatonic. -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 08:49, 18 May 2004 (UTC)

I'm not 100% sure about it myself, but I think other &quot;pentatonic&quot; scales are just modes of the major pentatonic...I should perhaps look into this further. Speaking of modes, they already have [[Music:Modes|their own chapter]]. They don't need to be discussed here, just mentioned in brief with a cross-reference.

I think the parts showing the scales really belonged on their own lines. On my video resolution the scales are currently word-wrapped, which is jarring and inhibits clarity. The only way to ensure they won't wrap is to put them on their own lines.

--[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 11:22, 18 May 2004 (UTC)

Well, as it is it renders for me like this:

:Here are two versions of the chromatic scale, one with sharps, the other with flats, each on its own line: C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B

Maybe what you want is this

:Here are two versions of the chromatic scale, one with sharps, the other with flats, each on its own line: &lt;br /&gt;C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B &lt;br /&gt;C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B
-- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 18:49, 18 May 2004 (UTC)

Ah, yeah, sorry. I should check my previews more carefully...

--[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 01:39, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

== Tables ==

Do we really need those tone/semitone tables? I don't really think it's a good use of table markup. --[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 15:02, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Can the derivation of the pentatonic scale be discussed further?  After reading the [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/music/pythag.html#c1 docs] on pentatonic intervals, I'm a bit confused over the statement that all tones are in relation by a fifth.  If one bases that statement on the circle of fifths, then the statement is somewhat true with the exception of E does not repeat to C again.  I found the above link very interesting in regards to the derivation of a pentatonic scale.

In summary, to generate a pentonic scale, using the Pythagorean method.  Use 5/4f to calcuate a fifth and 4/3f to calculate a forth (note however that the forth is not actually part of the pentatonic scale).  So using the Pythagorian method, it looks something like:

*C = 1f
*D = 3/2f - 4/3f
*E = ((3/2f - 4/3f) + 3/2f) - 4/3f
*G = 3/2f
*A = (3/2f - 4/3f) + 3/2f
*c = 2f

That looks confusing, but really it's just a cycle of C up a fifth to G, down a forth to D, up a fifth to A, and back down a forth to E (C -&gt; G -&gt; D -&gt; A -&gt; E).  The high c is in there, but really it can't be derived using this natural cycle.  It's just there to show an octave.

As you play with the numbers, you'll find an exact even interval of 9/8f between C&amp;D,D&amp;E, and G&amp;A, and two larger intervals of 32/27f between E&amp;G and A&amp;c.

A pentatonic scale can also be derived using straight harmonic calculations of:

*C = 1f
*D = 9/8f
*E = 5/4f
*G = 3/2f
*A = 5/3f
*c = 2f

If all these ratios look confusing, just think of 5/4f as f + 1/4f or the base/tonic freq plus a quarter of it's value.  2f of course being double the freq to achieve an octave.

So there you have it, two pentatonic scale derived naturally.  The first is called Pythagorean temperament, the second is called Just temperament.  Both are interesting in their own respects.  The Just temperament uses natural harmonics for all notes.  However the interval between each note varies.  The Pythagorean temperament is interesting in that the intervals between each tone is exactly 9/8f!

Using the Pythagorean model, a daitonic scale can be produced by splitting the two larger intervals of 32/27f into 9/8f + 256/243f.  That 256/243f interval is the definition of a Pythagorean semitone or half tone.  When done, you have five 9/8 intervals and two 256/243 intervals in a WWHWWWH pattern and hence the definition of what a diatonic scale is.

I should point out that as cool as the Pythagorean method is, it's not exact.  That's because the semitones between E &amp; F and B &amp; c are not exactly a half step (ie: half of 9/8f), it's something like 256/243f.  For that reason, the Pythagorean scale is great for music written in one key like so many folk tunes.  If one was to switch musical keys with instruments tuned to Pythagorean temperament, one would have to switch instruments as well (ie: one instrument for each musical key).  This lead to the adoption of Even termperament.  Even temperament essentially devides an octave into 12 equally tuned semitones.  This has the advantage in that an Even tuned instrument can be played in any key.  The disadvantage of Even temperament is that none of the actual tones in the scale are exact to natual harmonics (other than tonic and octave).  The difference is very slight, but it does exist.

The calculations and comparisons between Just, Pythagorean, and Even respectively look something like:

*C: J=1f, P=1f E=1f
*D: J=9/8, P=9/8f, E=2^(2/12)f
*E: J=5/4f, P=81/64f, E=2^(4/12)f
...
--[[User:Releppes|releppes]] 16:18, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

What about another table for the simple interval section with # intervals as 1 axis and # semitones as the other axis to show how the notation of music deals with the actual number of semitones between notes? i.e. a 13 (including 0)x 8 grid. I have found no such grid when trying to help my daughter with her grade iv theory and wanted to explain the whole concept.  C Knox</text>

__NOTOC__
A ''ceviche'' is a seafood dish, originating in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peru]], that relies on acid rather than heat to cook the fish.  This recipe adds a bit of a [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] twist by adding sliced [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]] to the dish.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Scallop|bay scallops]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (125 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] (about 3-4 lemons)
*4 red [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], roasted, peeled, and seeded
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
*2 tablespoons (30 mL) extra-virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]], ground
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]], to taste
*1 [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]], peeled and sliced

==Procedure==
#In a non-reactive bowl, combine the scallops and lemon juice, add more juice as needed to cover the scallops. Refrigerate, covered, and stir often for 2 hours, until the scallops become opaque.
#For the [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]], add the bell peppers, vinegar, oil, cayenne, and salt into a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] or [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], and [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]].
#To serve, spoon the sauce onto individual plates, drain the scallops and place on the sauce.  Garnish with slices of avocado.

Serves 4 as a main dish, 6 as an appetizer.

==Variations==
*For a more [[Cookbook:Southwestern cuisine|Southwestern]] flavor, replace 1/4 cup lemon juice with [[Cookbook:Lime|lime juice]], and replace the bell peppers with New Mexico [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]].

==Warning==
Eating raw seafood is an effective way to get sick if the ingredients are not fresh.

==Subjunctives==
The Subjunctive is one of the three different moods a Latin verb can take. The two other moods are the Indicative and the Imperative. The subjunctive is perhaps the most common and also most difficult to grasp, and there are a great number of different subjunctive uses.

The subjunctive mainly expresses doubt or potential and what could have been. Whereas the indicative declares &quot;this happened&quot; or &quot;that happened,&quot; the imperative is called 'jussive,' which is from 'iubere' - to command, bid.

;Examples
*&quot;Let me go&quot; and &quot;May I go?&quot; are statements of potential; the speaker is not entirely certain his/her command will be followed.
*&quot;Were I a king, I would have a golden throne.&quot; -this expresses what could be true, but is not. Speaker is not a king, and so will not get the throne.
*&quot;May the force be with you!&quot; expresses the hope/potential that the force (star wars) will be with you. The essential word here is 'may' - &quot;''May'' the force be with you.&quot;

&quot;''If'' this ''were'' to happen,&quot; or &quot;May this happen!&quot; or &quot;I ask you to make this happen&quot; are all possible uses of the subjunctive.

There are four subjunctives: present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect. There are no subjunctives in the future tense, which already incorporates an element of doubt.

===The Present Subjunctive===
The present subjunctive is similar to the present indicative, except marked by a change of the theme vowel.

''present stem'' + ''theme vowel change'' + ''ending''

====Form====
In the present subjunctive, the theme vowel for every conjugation changes; in effect, the first conjugation masquerades as the second conjugation and all the other conjugations take on the appearance of the first.

{|
|1st Conjugation || ''a'' || becomes || ''e''
|-
|2nd Conjugation || ''e'' || becomes || ''ea''
|-
|3rd Conjugation || ''e'' || becomes || ''a''
|-
|3rd -io and 4th || ''i'' || becomes || ''ia''
|}

Some ways to remember this are in the following collapsed table.

===Example Conjugation===

''porto, port'''a'''re, portavi, portatus'' (1st conjugation - to carry)

====Present Indicative====
This is the present active indicative form of ''portare'', which has already been covered.
{{Latin/verb|porto|portas|portat|portamus|portatis|portant}}

Remember the join vowels.

====Present Subjunctive====
The present active subjunctive of ''portare'' would be conjugated as follows: 

{{Latin/verb|portem|portes|portet|portemus|portetis|portent}}

Notice:
*The ''-a-'' vowel has changed to an ''-e-''.
*The personal endings ''-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt'' are used, as is done for regular indicative verbs.

====Present Subjunctive of Esse====
The present active subjunctive of ''sum, esse'', the verb &quot;to be&quot;, is conjugated as follows: 

{{Latin/verb|sim|sīs|sit|sīmus|sītis|sint}}

Unlike the conjugation of the present active indicative form, the present subjunctive is regular. The same personal endings are affixed to ''si-''.

=====Present Subjunctive of Posse=====
{{Latin/verb|possim|possīs|possit|possīmus|possītis|possint}}
Translates as &quot;May I/you/he/we/you/they be able&quot;

===Imperfect Subjunctive===
The imperfect subjunctive is formed by adding the personal endings ''-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt'' to the present infinitive (often the second principal part).( or passive endings ''-r, -ris, -tur, -mur, -mini, -ntur''. In other words, for

''voco, vocare, vocavi, vocatum''

The imperfect subjunctives are formed thus:
{{Latin/verb|vocarem|vocares|vocaret|vocaremus|vocaretis|vocarent}}


For deponent verbs, whose second principal part is the passive infinitive (e.g., conari, vereri, pati, expediri) a pseudo present infinitive is used (e.g, conare, verere, patere, expedire; although these forms do not exist as stand-alone infinitives, they actually ARE the singular imperatives for these deponent verbs)

The imperfect subjunctive of the verb to be (sum, esse) is conjugated regularly, as are ALL irregular verbs, e.g.: possem, vellem, nollem, ferrem, irem)
{{Latin/verb|essem|esses|esset|essemus|essetis|essent}}

==Uses of the Subjunctive==
Verbs in the subjunctive mood may assume special meaning in specific constructions.

===Volitive or Optative Clauses===
Subjunctives in independent clauses are often translated as volitive/optative (that is, as a wish). Volitives/optatives show an intention for an action to occur; e.g. &quot;amet&quot; may be translated in volitive/optative context as &quot;may he love&quot;

====Hortatory====
A suggestion or command in first person (most often plural); e.g. &quot;cedamus&quot; as an hortatory subjunctive is &quot;let us depart&quot;

====Jussive====
A suggestion or  command in third person; e.g. &quot;cedat&quot; as a jussive subjunctive is &quot;let her depart&quot;; &quot;deprehendatur&quot;= &quot;Let him be seized&quot;

====Potential====
The potential or possibility of something happening, in any person:  (Fortasse) te amem. &quot;Perhaps I may love you.&quot;

'''All  of these Subjunctive types can be used in an independent (main) clause.''' 
Note that all can be translated with &quot;let&quot; or &quot;may&quot;; the differences lie in how English will represent the subjunctive verb:

*Wish (Volitive): May we be friends forever!
*Hortatory (Suggestion): Let us be friends!
*Jussive (Command): Let them be friends!
*Potential (Possibility):  They may be friends; we may be friends; you may be friends.

===Purpose Clauses===
A purpose clause is a dependent clause used, as the name shows, to show purpose. Often initiated by an indicative verb, the clause contains a subjunctive verb in either the present or imperfect tense. Present and imperfect verbs in purpose clauses should be translated with the auxiliary verbs &quot;may&quot; and &quot;might,&quot; respectively. For example, &quot;Marcus urbem condidit ut regeret&quot; should be translated as &quot;Marcus built the city so that he would rule.&quot; These appear frequently in Latin.

===Relative Clauses===
A relative clause is an independent clause introduced by a relative pronoun.  When the verb of a relative clause is in the subjunctive mood the clause may express result, purpose, or characteristic. 

*Result: The field is so large that he could not plow it in one day.
*Purpose: He sent envoys who would pacify the city.
*Characteristic: Who is so ill-prepared who would fight without a shield?

== Early Civilizations of Mexico and Mesoamerica ==

===The Olmec===
The Olmec rule lasted from 1200 BC to 600 AD in the swampy lowland regions of Mexico.  To deal with this climate, the Olmec built permanent city-temple complexes at sites such as at San Lorenzo, Tenochtitlán, La Venta, Tres Zapotes, Chalcatzingo, and La Mojarra. Olmec culture originated at San Lorenzo, where distinctively Olmec features began to appear at about 1150 BC. As in Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt and other early civilizations, the emergence of the Olmec civilization was assisted by fertile, well-watered alluvial soil.

The Olmec were known for their art, which usually reflected their religion. They created ceramic vessels, figurines, and the unexplained enormous carvings of heads. The jaguar is an important motif throughout Olmec art.

In about 900 BC, San Lorenzo was all but abandoned, and La Venta became the primary city. The reasons behind this move are unknown, but it may have been due to environmental changes or invasions. By 400 BC, La Venta also came to an end.

===Teotihuacan===

===The Mixtec===

===The Zapotec===

==The Toltecs==

== Rise and Fall of the Maya ==
One of the three most powerful and interesting cultures to thrive during the Precolumbian period was that of the Maya, which centered around the city of Tikal in the Peten section of Guatamala (delete&quot;the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico&quot;.  Though the Maya had existed for some time beforehand, the dates of 300 BC to 800 AD are the most accurate for the height of Maya culture.  The Golden Age of the Maya might be described as about 500 to 850 AD, during which the most complex and fascinating parts of Maya culture were invented or built.  The Maya political system involved, like other early civilizations, a system of city-states.  However, a single king held sway over all the principalities.  Mayan religion and daily life were very intertwined.  Because of the importance of maize (corn) in their culture, the Maya believed the gods had created them from a stalk and water.  They also created elaborate rituals involving dance, sacrifices, and some blood-letting to please their gods.  They based their faith on a heaven, the earth (in the middle) and an underworld.

Maya life centered on agriculture.  Because of the ease of its growth, the Maya relied heavily on maize as their staple crop.  In addition, cotton was grown in abundant quantities and the Maya are known for their cotton textiles.  Because the Maya had no large animals, slavery became widespread as a way to solve the labor shortage created by the animals' absence.  The Maya were sufficiently developed enough to have a class of skilled artisans and a priesthood.  Social structure held the King and nobles at the top, followed by priests, the merchant class, the peasants, and finally slaves.  As in other ancient cultures, the peasants and slaves made up the majority of the Mayan population.  The slaves were used to construct massive cities, such as Tikal and Chichen Itza.  The tiered temple at Chichen Itza (the place of the Itzas or priests) is the greatest remaining relic of the Maya, and is similar in construction to Egyptian step pyramids. During the Fall Equinox on September 22 (and also at the spring equinox on March 21) you can witness the incredible accuracy of Mayan astronomy as it was integrated into architecture. The equinox phenomenon can actually be viewed in Chichen Itza on the El Castillo pyramid for up to four days. During the equinox the sun casts its rays on the pyramid, forming seven isosceles triangles that resemble the body of a serpent 37 yards long slithering downwards until it joins the huge serpent’s head carved in stone at the bottom of the stairway. It is said this snake is trying to make its way to the Sacred Cenote well of sacrifice which is in a straight line from the pyramid. Also at another nearby site, Dzibilchaltun, September 22 at 5 AM is the official day and exact time of the fall equinox when the sun sends its beams through the two windows of the Temple of the Seven Dolls providing a lovely spectacle of Mayan exactitude.

The Maya developed a complex scientific and mathematical knowledge throughout their existence.  Their precise astronomical observations allowed them to develop a calendar almost as accurate as our own today.  In mathematics, they developed a number system based on bars and dots, and pioneered multiplication and division.  They were also the first in the New World to come up with the concept of &quot;zero&quot; (which is not just as in nothing - think as a placeholder in the number 10,000).  The number system was also highly accurate.  An ingenious alphabet allowed the Maya to record information on their monuments and temples, giving anthropologists an excellent way to learn about Maya life and culture.  The system of writing the Maya developed was based on pictograms.  Modern science has managed to decipher much of the alphabet.

The Maya began to decline in about 800 AD until the Maya disappeared completely from observable history.  Although the cause is unknown, the standard answers of disease, drought, famine, or internal unrest are given.  New evidence seems to lend some credence to the thought of a drought-famine connection, but this is unconfirmed.  Whatever the reason, the Maya began to abandon their cities which shrank back into the jungle to await discovery by modern archaeologists.  Interestingly, a small group of ethnic descendants still live in the jungles of the Yucatan, where they practice a mix of Christianity and traditional religions, as well as speak the same language as their Mayan ancestors.

===The Putan Maya===
After the fall of the Maya and a period of unrest, the city-state of Chichen Itza developed a confederacy in the north of the Yucatan.  The confederacy limped along until around the 13th century when the center of activity was removed to Maryapan, whose rule lasted until about 1450 AD.

Further south, a relatively powerful group known as the Putan Maya established itself in the southwest of the Yucatan peninsula.  The main city of Xicalango became the center of a powerful post-classical period maritime trading network which flourished from around 900 AD until the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.  The Putan Maya also established trade centers at Cacaxtla and Xochicalco, for interaction with the Toltec.  The Putan Maya were heavily influenced by the culture of the Toltecs.  In addition to the Putan Maya, several small kingdoms existed throughout Mesoamerica and Mexico under Mayan control, which made the area more resistant to invasion when the conquistadors arrived than their unfortunate cousins in Tenochtitlan.

==The Aztecs ==
The Aztecs were one of the most memorable of all of the ancient Mesoamerican empires. They were located in central Mexico right where Mexico City is today.

==Early civilizations in South America and the Inca ==

===The Moche===

===The Nazca===

===The Sican and Chimu cultures===

===The Inca===

==Native American cultures north of the Rio Grande==
Native American cultures were not as sophisticated as the Mesoamerican or Andean civilizations. Even Cahokia, the largest Precolumbian settlement in the modern United States, had only a small fraction of the population of cities like Teotihuacan or Cuzco. There was no writing north of Mexico, and the ancient civilizations of the Mississippi and the Southwest had long crumbled away by the time Europeans made substantial contact with the natives there. Therefore, study of the history of North America heavily relies on archaeology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What sort of thing do people want to see on this page? Code examples? Philosophical differences? An overview of .NET? Or is there anything else I haven't thought of?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This page has some innaccurate information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Presentation and business logic is intermixed while ASP.NET can be writen in several .NET compliant languages like C#, VB.NET and business logic can be clearly seperated from Presentation logic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;False. It is just as easy to intermix or separate presentation and business logic with both ASP and ASP.NET. You can write ASP.NET just by typing out a aspx file and intermixing 'Response.Write' calls along with any other code. Alternately you can use HTML in your ASP files, and SSI jscript files or COM object (such as what ATL was designed for) to seperate the two. They are just different approaches than the methods used by default in the VS.NET IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that ASP does not support this is just wrong. ASP does support it, but differently than in ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET features auto wiring up of event handlers, you may just want to say that instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ASP had maximum of 4 built in classes like Request,Response, Session and Application whereas ASP.NET using .NET framework classes which has more than 2000 in built classes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very misleading. ASP has 4 classes that are COM interfaces which are automatically created for you at startup. ASP.NET does not auto create 2000 classes for you at startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP has many objects (too many to count) that are there waiting for you to use. Just open up the registry and see how many entries there are under CLSID, and remember, most of those ship with every version of Windows and also contain many other aggregated objects not listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is an unofficial guide to programming your HP calculator. It will teach you the basic commands mentioned in the official manual but will also include some other commands, such as easter eggs and glitches.

The fact that HP calculators are programmable means that they are not calculators but computers. Although the language used by the calculators is simple it is similar to many of the complex languages used on PCs, making it a great starting point for people who want to learn more about programming.

=='Hello World' Example==
 '''1►L:
 '''DISP L; &quot;Hello,&quot;:
 '''DISP 2; &quot;World!&quot;:
 '''FREEZE:

This program basically does the following:
*Store 1 to the variable, 'L'
*On line 'L' (1) display 'Hello,'
*On Line 2 display 'World!'
*Freeze the calculators display so that the text displayed doesn't dissapear.
Type this example into a new program so you can see what it does.

BTW: 'Hello, World!' is a standard program for most programming tutorials and guides. It has no real significance that I know of.
==Storing and Retrieving Variables==
On HP calculators you can store numbers into variables. This is done with the '►' or '1►L:
DISP L;' symbol, like in the example above. In the example above we store 1 in the variable, 'L'. This means that 'L=1&quot;.

On HP calculators there are only prescribed variables, see the variable reference to see them all. Because all variables are prescribed there is no need to declare them at the start of the program like in most languages. Most of the time the A...Z and θ are the only variables used in programs.
==Program Commands==
Program Commands are instructions for the calculator. A program can contain any number of commands. When your calculator reads a command it will take the appropriate action; however , sometimes we might want that action to be slightly different each time we call it. This is why we have arguments after the command seperated by a semicolon. Some commands have an unlimited number of arguments but most have somewhere between 0 and 8 arguments.

So that means that commands are formatted as:
 '''COMMAND &lt;arg1&gt;; &lt;arg2&gt;; ... &lt;arg#&gt;
The arguments can be of various types. Sometimes they are numbers and sometimes they are strings (a collection of letters and symbols with quotation marks on each side). The 'DISP' command, for example, uses a number and a string for its arguments. It has the format:
 '''DISP &lt;line#&gt;; &lt;string&gt;
The first argument is a number and the second argument is a string. This command basically tells the calculator to write 'string' on line 'line#'. If you want a more detailed description check the command reference.

Also, at the end of every command or variable asignment we need to put a colon so that the calculator knows that the command has ended.
==Using Menus==
Because it can be slow to type the commands and variables manually and they are easy to mis-spell you can select them from menus. These menus can be accessed by pressing the '''MATH''' button for commands and the '''VAR''' button for variables.

==Early Africa==

==Empires in West Africa==

===Mali===
The powerful Mali empire existed from about 1235 to 1645 AD.  By this time, Islam had become the dominant religion of the region.  Traders from the Islamic strongholds of North Africa traveled south through the Sahara on camelback (new to Africa) to the region of Mali.  They came for the immense amount of gold to be found in the area, and it ''was'' truly immense.  When Mali came to power, it did so partly through its strategic trading powers.  

The greatest ruler of Mali was probably Mansa Musa, who built the captial of Timbuktu.  The city was renowned as a place of Islamic learning, especially at the Sankore University, and was the center of culture for Islam for several centuries.  Education in Sankore's guilds and madrasas (schools) was free, and scholars and craftsmen arrived to benefit from them from throughout the Muslim world.  The great mud mosque in the city still stands.  Also, whereas the kindom had previously been a reincarnation within the boundaries of Ghana, Musa expanded it far beyond this paltry territory.  

In 1307, pistolero helps the body to retain water, something with special significance in the world's hottest man alive had a pistola porqu and dryest region.  Other Malese items of demand by the Muslim empires were slaves and ivory.  Coming into Mali were cloth, gold, pottery, and other textiles.

===Swahili Culture===
The Swahili Culture was formed in Eastern Africa when Arabic traders established ports along the coast of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique.  The language of Swahili, widely used in that area, is a combination of Arabic and the local Bantu languages.

===Nubia and Axum===

==== Nubia ====

===== Forms of Government =====

Before the initiation of Nubia first centralized government, probably during the Kerma period, Nubians lived in disintegrated tribes. A tribe was formed of members who are blood related. Obviously some of these tribes were relatively large, since Old Kingdom armies had often failed to defeat rebelling tribes. Tribes had a hierarchical system of authority allocation; elders of the subsections head the extended families that top the single households. The work, whether economic, military, or other, was defined and divided among tribe members. Chiefs of the tribe are the strongest and most wise or religious members; the youth provide for courageous and brave soldiers at war.


===== Agriculture =====

Agriculture along the narrow strip of the Nile valley provided Nubians with their necessary food supply. Therefore most of the Nubian populations were farmers. Each year the Nile flooded Upper Nubia providing silt for the agricultural lands. Kushites used the Shaduf (a traditional device operated manually for raising water from a lower depression that is connected to a source of water, to a higher depression where the water is distributed to farther depressions to irrigate the field/s) for watering their farms, and around the 6th century BC, they transformed to the use of Saquia (a water wheel), which was brought to Nubia from Southwest Asia. There are numerous hafirs (a depression dug on flat ground to collect rain water) discovered in Nubia including many at Musawwarat es Sufra. However hafirs would not have provided enough water for watering the farms. The only Kushite Dam used for water storage was found at Shaq el Ahmar.

	The main food crop seems to be sorghum; evidence for this is found on Kushite pottery. Dates are one of the available crops grown along the Nile, especially in Upper Nubia. In the sixth century AD Nubians were well known by the Arabs for their good date-wine production. The extensive production of doam (palm fruit) is also evident from the New kingdom Egyptian relieves, as Nubians are often depicted carrying doam as gifts to the Egyptian pharaohs.


===== Trade =====

Throughout history, Nubia was the closest trade partner with Egypt. Egyptian relieves dating to the Old Kingdom depict Nubians presenting Egyptian pharaohs with gold, ivory, Ebony, ostrich feathers, doam (palm fruits), and exotic products, and animals like giraffes.  Exotic animals and other products from Nubia were exported to the Mediterranean world via Egypt. A frescos in a Minoan palace in Thera (Greece), depicts antelopes. In other Minoan palaces in Crete and Thera several frescos depict monkeys.

	One of the most products Nubia import was bronze. Bronze was first introduced to the Nubian by the Hyksos in the seventeenth century. Bronze was extensively used by the Nubians. The type of metal was the best available for making swords and daggers in the ancient world. The Nubians must have imported most of their bronze from Egypt.  
Nubians also imported oils. Strabo, a first century AD Roman historian and geographer, wrote “They (the Nubians) have no oil, but use fat instead” [Strabo, The Geography of Strabo: Literally Translated, with Notes, trans. H. C. Hamilton, esq., &amp; W. Falconer (London: H. G. Bohn, 1854-1857)]. Olive oil for example was abundantly imported from Lebanon via Egypt.
Cedar trees were also imported and used as building materials. Temples and royal buildings in Nubia were mostly roofed with cedar trees. The Amun temple at Napata for example was roofed by cedars that Taharqa has imported especially from Lebanon as recorded on his stele at Jebel Barkal (Sudan).


===== Writing =====

Although steles, dating to 1600 BC, are abundantly found at Kerma, traces of writing on their surfaces did not survive. Thus, we don't know if Nubians had a writing system at that time or not. All the evidence, we have for a Kushite written language is for the period after the sixth century BC; these were found in Napatan constructions built of durable materials, such as backed bricks and sandstone. The durable-material built walls, as well as steles that were kept safe in temples and palaces were inscribed and painted extensively with ancient Nubian. However, due to lack of archaeological work, we can not say for sure that the Nubian language was written before the sixth century BC.

Reading not your thing? Much of the content below is explained in audio and video [http://audio-video.gnu.org/ here].

== Intro / Concept ==

=== What does FLOSS stand for? ===

FLOSS stands for &quot;Free/Libre Open-Source Software&quot;.  

Legally, Free Software and Open-Source take quite different attitudes to sharing source code and what obligations those who share legally require.  The different attitudes are a product of political ideology and cannot be easily reconciled - though they can be neutrally explained (only) by referring to the legal concepts of 'share-alike' and a 'consortium'.  The term FLOSS emerged to simply avoid having to discuss or define these ideas to ordinary users who want to know about the implications for end users.  Which do not normally include the legal negotiations between contributors.

=== What is free software? ===
Free software is software that anyone is free to use, copy, improve, examine or distribute, either free of cost or for a price. More precisely, it refers to four fundamental freedoms, which users of the software should have: 
*Users should be able to run the software for any purpose. (freedom 0 &amp;mdash; many things in computers start at 0)
*Users should be able to closely examine and study the software and should be able to freely modify and improve it to suit their needs better. (freedom 1)
*Users should be able to give copies of the software to other people for whom the software will be useful, either gratis or for a fee. (freedom 2)
*Users should be able to improve the software and freely distribute their improvements to the broader public so that they, as a whole, benefit. (freedom 3)

There is nothing new or special about this. This is how software used to be developed in the early 'Big Iron' days of companies which made money by selling hardware. But then, software companies came in, they started changing the rules of the game. They saw software only as a means of making money rather than as a means of making life easier, and with the advent of the 'Shrink-Wrap-License' even the need to provide a properly tested program was obviated.

Legally, free software is defined by a license to use and distribute the software that guarantees all four of these freedoms.  Any user who grants all of these freedoms to other users retains their access to the software.  In strict legal terms, the software is share-alike but only to those users who uphold these obligations.  All others are disqualified and may lose their right to use, extend, distribute or derive new works from it.

=== It isn't open content, which has its own rules ===

Some related share-alike movements do not accept the so-called freedom 0 - it remains highly controversial.  Accordingly those movements are neither free software nor open-source.  They are part of the broader open content movement however.  A typical license that restricts use by certain people or groups but permits it under share-alike terms to others is CC-by-nc-sa (the Creative Commons attribution-non-commercial-share-alike license) that is extremely popular among content and code developers that do not wish to grant commercial entities the power to build on their work without paying.

=== As a user, why would I want to examine and modify my software? ===

What is important is not that you modify or view the sources, but that you cannot be prevented from doing so or having it done (for you) and are not dependent on a particular person or entity to do it. Not to mention the fact that companies do go out of business - taking their proprietary products down with them - sometimes leaving the users who relied on them without any means of supporting some critical product.

As technology evolves, hardware, software and users' requirements change. And software, being a tool to make life easier, too has to be subject to easy and quick modification. So, even if you personally cannot change or modify the software, you want to be sure that you are not subject to monopoly power, or even simply the whims and fancies, of whoever created the software.

That apart, it is necessary to be able to examine the software, to see if it has malicious features. For example, to check whether the program is spying on you. One version of Windows was designed to report to Microsoft all the software on your hard disk. But Microsoft is not alone: the KaZaa music sharing software is designed so that KaZaa's business partner can rent out the use of your computer to their clients. You (or anyone else) need to be able to examine and modify your software to be able to protect yourself against such mistreatment. Even if you don't know what bad things to look for, someone who does will soon find this &quot;bad thing&quot; in the program and spread the word about it.

There are other reasons such as being able to 
[[FLOSS_Concept_Booklet#But_what_about_bugs?_Surely_free_software_is_more_likely_to_be_virus_prone?|fix bugs]], and 
[[FLOSS_Concept_Booklet#Okay,_but_why_would_I_want_to_modify_my_software_anyway?|modify programs to your needs]]. These will be explained a little later.

=== Doesn't &quot;free&quot; mean that I do not have to pay for the software? ===
No. The word &quot;free&quot; has two meanings in the English language. 
# The &quot;free&quot; in &quot;free beer&quot;, which refers to zero cost.
# The &quot;free&quot; in &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;free market&quot;, which refers to freedom.
The free in free software refers to the freedoms that we've talked about above that people have. There's nothing in the definition of free software that says that you cannot sell it to someone for a price. Indeed, there are companies whose entire business model is centred around collecting, compiling and selling free software. However, since someone to whom free software is licensed is free to sell or give it away in turn, you can almost always easily find it openly (and legally) downloadable on the Internet [http://www.freedomtoaster.co.za/ or other places].

When you hear of &quot;free software&quot;, think of liberty, freedom, and &quot;free enterprise&quot;.

=== Well, what's not &quot;free&quot; about other kinds of software? ===
Most non-free software in the world today is not sold, it is licensed. From complex operating systems to tiny games or screen savers, the end users of the software have a license to use it under conditions laid out in an End User License Agreement. This agreement lists out the conditions under which the user can use the software – often restrictions are imposed on the use to which the software can be put. In almost all cases, users are explicitly prohibited from &quot;taking the software apart&quot; to study how it works, cannot modify or improve it, are only allowed to make a single copy of the software (for backup purposes) and are strictly prohibited from giving copies to other people.

=== What do you mean by &quot;copyleft&quot;? What's wrong with copyright? How is this different? ===

Legally, a copyleft is a share-alike clause in a license that requires certain conditions (or &quot;freedoms&quot;) be upheld by the user, distributor or anyone basing a derivative work on the original.  One of those conditions is to treat all other users, distributors and derived work authors equally under the conditions of the license.  One of those equal conditions is the withdrawing of all rights under the license from anyone who does not do so.

Free software historically implemented copyleft by requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free software as well, using the copyright in the program (and associated rights to restrict use of it or derivations of it) as leverage.  This did not deal with every problem.  In particular, it did not prevent authors of derived works from filing a software patent on their improvements, nor anyone from building a web service on the original software and extending it by 'mashup' methods.  ''These deficiencies are supposed to be addressed in the GPL version 3.0.''

The original GPL, despite deficiencies, was an attempt to build a very minimal consortium among all users who would agree to its four freedoms.  To understand this we must review the alternatives.

The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain, uncopyrighted. This allows people to share the program and their improvements, if they are so minded. But it also allows uncooperative people to convert the program into proprietary software. They can make changes, many or few, and distribute the result as a proprietary product. People who receive the program in that modified form do not have the freedom that the original author gave them; the middleman has stripped it away. Also the developers of free software will be forced to compete with improved versions of their own software (which open-source does permit).

Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it.  If they do not, they lose their rights.  As Stallman puts it, &quot;Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom, and ensures that somebody does not remove the freedom from free software.&quot;

To copyleft a program, first state that it is copyrighted; then add distribution terms in the form of a license document – they comprise a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's code or any program derived from it but only if the distribution terms are unchanged. Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable.

According to the Free Software Foundation, &quot;Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users' freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom. That's why we reverse the name, changing 'copyright' into 'copyleft'.&quot;  Historically however the term was simply a joke or pun added to a letter to Richard Stallman by Don Hopkins who had put &quot;copyleft - all rights reversed&quot; as one of many annotations.

The most popular copyleft license is the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License].

=== What licenses exist to protect free software? === 
There are many licenses that make a piece of software free. But only some of them preserve user freedom aka copyleft. The non-copyleft license include X11, BSD, Artistic... The strongest copyleft and most widely used free software license is the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License], or GNU GPL for short. 

For a more complete list of licenses check out [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html the GNU website].

=== Okay, so I can see that free software is legal but surely if I duplicate something that means that someone is losing out somewhere along the way? === 

We in the free software community feel that the harm caused by obstructing software use cannot be justified by the profit obtained through selling software. We use other means to earn money. 

Also, chances are if someone didn't get the software for no price, they wouldn't have gotten it at all. Take all the people that get proprietary software illegally from peer-to-peer programs for example.

Contrary to your assumption that allowing distribution and modification causes loss, Richard Stallman lists three levels of material harm caused by restrictions on distribution and modification:
# Fewer people use the program.
# None of the users can adapt or fix the program.
# Other developers cannot learn from the program, or base new work on it. 

For a detailed analysis, check out the essays [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html &quot;Why Software Should Not Have Owners&quot;] and [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html &quot;Why Software Should Be Free&quot;] by Stallman.

=== This freedom with software programs is interesting. Can this be extended to other forms of information like books? ===

Yes. Most user manuals for free software programs, for example are released under either free or copyleft licenses. Already, much literature is available under permissive terms, such as the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)] and [http://creativecommons.org Creative Commons] Commercial-Attribution(-ShareAlike). 

But unlike software, books and articles contains speech and personal opinion.  And, personal credit for specific work is important.  So, the benefit of unlimited modification is not always desirable in literature, science or other content.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_content open content] movement accordingly focuses more on share-alike clauses.

These clauses are not restricted to those free software or open-source require.  They include for instance the Creative Commons NON-Commercial licenses which prevent use by commercial parties unless they negotiate a parallel commercial license (which may also be a share-alike license or may be more like a proprietary license).  Other share-alike clauses have been proposed to require specific processes of dispute resolution, scientific method or journalism be followed by creators of derived works.

Like the original free software foundation, each such clause would create a global consortium relying mostly on the license to enforce its rules and using the leverage of rights to use or improve the content as the leverage.

FSF itself has recognized the difference between open content and free software.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFDL GNU Free Documentation License] used by both Wikipedia and Wikibooks itself contains clauses that deny the right to use the content to anyone who does not credit authors or other contributors, but these are similar to the free software conditions.  GFDL does clearly and explicitly permit commercial use and it supports annotations and &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; that can reliably qualify the origin or reliability of the material or summarize objections to it - though these are not used by Wikipedia or Wikibooks at present, they serve necessary purposes for those services that do not allow every user to edit.

== History of Free Software ==
[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman.jpeg|thumb|right|Richard Stallman started the GNU project and created the General Public Licence.]]
=== When did this whole free software thing start? ===

Software sharing is as old as computers. But the Free Software Movement traces its history to a software sharing community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Richard Stallman became a member of this software sharing community when he joined the lab in 1971.

In the early 1980s due to a series of events, the hacker community collapsed. Richard Stallman was one of the few hackers left out in the lab and he was faced with a stark moral choice. He could accept the world has changed and start using proprietary software. Or he could create a free operating system which could recreate a community of cooperating hackers. In short, he could either change himself or change the world. 

Stallman decided to change the world. And thus the GNU (pronounced Guh-new, it rhymes with canoe) project, a free replacement for the Unix operating system was born. In January 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT and began writing GNU software. One of the first pieces of GNU software that Stallman wrote was the Emacs text editor. Slowly more hackers joined Stallman and started putting together a complete body of free software. This ranged from tiny programs like ls and cp to the huge packages like the GNU compiler collection and the Bash shell.

=== Okay, but now what is Linux? When did that come about? ===

Until 1991, most of the programs required to create a complete operating system had been created by the GNU project, except for one
important piece - the kernel. In a nutshell, the kernel is software that provides secure access to a machine's hardware and decides what software get to use what hardware when. By then, a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds had written a free Unix compatible kernel called Linux (pronounced Lee-nux or Lin-ux). The kernel combined with the rest of GNU packages formed a complete usable operating system. Today this combination is called GNU/Linux, although it is [http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html often  inaccurately called just Linux].

== Open Source ==

=== What is this open source thing? ===

Open source is similar to free software. The biggest difference is that open source sees FLOSS as just a way of making better software, and doesn't value the freedom of the people.

=== How did open source start? ===

In 1998, some free software developers figured that by keeping quiet about ethics and freedom, and talking only about the practical benefits of free software, they might be able to spread free software better, especially to businesses. The term &quot;open source&quot; is offered as a way of doing this.

=== Why are open-source and free/libre software often grouped together? ===

Most (''not'' all) open-source software can also qualify as free software, and vice versa.

=== What's better? Free Software or open-source software? ===

The two terms virtually always apply to the same software programs, but free software as a movement is better, because it values your freedom and offers a superior model for software development, whereas open-source only advocates a development model.

== Production Methodology ==

=== How is Free Software actually made? ===
The same way other software is made. People sit on the computer keyboard and type in commands and code and compile them.

To properly understand how free software is made, we need to have a good idea how all software – free and proprietary - is made.

Follow this link to find more about ''Who is doing it?''
http://widi.berlios.de/paper/study.html

=== Okay, how is software made then? ===
A software program is simply a set of instructions to a computer to do something. Since the computer is a machine without any capacity to think for itself, it can only understand instructions written in a particular language – this format is called &quot;object code&quot;. Unfortunately, to human beings, object code looks like gibberish. While they are creating software, humans use a particular format that they can easily understand called &quot;source code&quot;. Source code uses letters, numbers and punctuation and, like any human language, can be understood by humans who learn to do so. So now we have source code, a format that programs are written in or created by humans but which looks like gibberish to a computer and object code – a set of instructions that a computer can understand but which look like gibberish to a human. A special program called a compiler transforms the source code into the object code. To reiterate, a human being writes down what it wants the computer to do in a format called source code. It's then translated into the only language that computers understand – object code. A special program called a compiler does this translation.

=== So now that I understand how software is made, how is free software made? ===
Remember, most humans cannot easily understand object code. Therefore, if a human wants to closely study, modify or improve a piece of software, they has to have access to the source code of the software. Since being free to examine, modify or improve software is central to the concept of Free Software, it follows that humans have to have access to the source code of a piece of software for it to be considered free.

Unlike proprietary software where only the original software creators (or those they explicitly provide access) have access to the source code, anyone who is interested can get access to the source code of free software. Therefore, if a user of free software wants to modify or improve it, she is free to do so. In many cases, the people who make the improvements make the improved software available to the broader public via the Internet. By definition and in practice, people who, in most cases, are connected to each other just through the Internet create free software collaboratively. One critical aspect of the creation of free software that is often overlooked is the feedback in the form of complaints and suggestions from normal users. This feedback is actively sought and many tools exist that make it easy for lay users to integrate these complaints, bug reports and suggestions into the production methodology.

=== So how is this different from the production of other kinds of software? ===
Typically, entities that produce non-free software usually have very tight restrictions on who has access to the source code of their programs and distribute their software only in object code format. The reason for this is that while it is very easy to compile source code into object code, it is very difficult to get the original source code from the object code. An analogy would be curds. While it's easy to make curds from milk, it's pretty much impossible to get milk from curds. 

=== What kinds of people make free software? ===
Many people who write free software are volunteers, they probably have an unrelated day time job. These people spend their free time developing free software.

Commercial organizations that benefit from free software distribution or that provide free software support also develop free software by
investing portions of their profit. An example of such an organization is Red Hat.

There are many non-profit organizations that raise funds to develop free software, through donations from free software users. The Free Software Foundation is one such organization. Other examples are SPI, GNOME Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and the like. 

Some free software packages are developed by universities. The Festival text to speech engine, Octave - the Matlab clone are examples of software developed by universities.

Many commercial organizations also contribute to the development of free software, because these organizations benefit from the existing free software code base. For example IBM maintains the port of Linux to PowerPC CPUs, because it needs an OS for its CPU.

=== But I still don't understand why anyone would want to give away their work for free? What's in it for them!? ===

For love or for money.

Yes, people do make money by releasing software created by them as free software. Corporate bodies like MySQL and Red Hat to name a few, make money because they release software created by them as free software (and offer support contracts for free software). And they do find that they are able to make more money than they ever would have made if they kept the software as non-free.

It's misleading to use the term &quot;give away&quot; to mean &quot;distribute a program as free software&quot;. It implies the issue is price, not freedom. One way to avoid the confusion is to say &quot;release as free software&quot;.

There are many reasons why people write free software. Some people might just want their work to spread out to the world. Many people would like to live in freedom. They contribute to free software so that they can continue to live in freedom. Some people write free software just for the fun of it. They love programming and hence use their programming skills to do something useful. 

You might want to read Eric Raymond's paper titled [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ Homesteading the Noosphere]. Eben Moglen in his paper titled [http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/my_pubs/anarchism.html Anarchism Triumphant: Free Software and the Death of Copyright] explains &quot;Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday's Law&quot;. This law also explains why people develop free software.

== Arguments for using Free Software ==
=== I'm still not convinced. Surely a big computer company knows best when it comes to designing software? Why would I want to use software designed by an amateur? ===

Free software is NOT created by amateurs. The free software development process is open and transparent. If you want to include your code into a free software project, it will be scrutinised by several people. Amateur and or badly written code will be rejected outright.

Though your assumption that &quot;big companies&quot; are better at designing software is questionable, &quot;big companies&quot; are free to develop free software too. And they do develop free software. For example Red Hat, Sun, Novell, and IBM, all develop free software.

If there are a group of people who would like to have a particular software written, they can bring together funds, hire a programming company, get the software written by professionals and then release it as free software. There is no reason why free software has to be written by amateurs.

Even if the free software designed by an amateur is inferior to the non-free software designed by a professional, you might want to use the free software because it gives you freedom, which is more important. Also, a better programmer who likes the idea could contribute to the project.

It is certainly not true that larger companies know more about designing software. They depend on a small group of programmers and are not generally in close contact with the users as in the case of free software. Thus, free software developers are often more aware of the needs of the users and their complaints about the existing versions. Some large companies allow technically incompetent marketing experts to make software design decisions that prioritize marketing requirements over user's needs and software soundness. 

In any case, examinations of many free software applications show that today they are as good as or better than equivalent non-free applications, or are reaching there fast. And a large fraction of free software developers are not amateurs. And how do you know if the big company which sells non-free software did not hire an amateur programmer to write that code?

What we use depends on what we want. For computer users, software that can do the things they want done is a necessity. If such software does not exist, then they cannot do that particular kind of work. How well the work can be done, and how quickly, depends on the quality of the software and hardware available. It is, therefore, desirable to have software that enables the users to do the work with the least effort and to get the best possible output. These qualities of the software generally improve with time, the term 'standing on the shoulders of giants' applies to free software, so improvement begets improvement. Under non-free software it's always a matter of 'reinventing the wheel', or worse, to circumvent proprietary restrictions for another company or person to improve the code.

But more important than all these is the quality of freedom that the software has. If the software is restricted, and the company that makes it withholds all information about how the software is created and in what format the files are created, then the users become dependent on the company, and subject to exploitation. Because these are much more important in the larger context, it is important to use free software rather than non-free software.

=== But what about bugs? Surely free software is more likely to be virus prone? ===

The question involves two different types of computer related problems - bugs and viruses. 

Bugs are unintentional errors in programs. With free software when you find a bug in the program, you have the freedom to exercise freedom two, the freedom to help yourself and correct the program. If you are not a programmer you are free to report the bug to the maintainer of the software or hire any programmer and correct the program. You are not under the mercy of any single organization. By submitting the bug fixes to the maintainer of the package the software package becomes better and better.

Virus is a malicious program that infects other programs by embedding a copy of itself in them. For more on these security risks, see the section below.

=== Since the source code is available, won't it be easy for someone to find out a security loop hole and exploit it? ===

Yes, but before the source gets to the hands of people who exploit loopholes, it passes through hands of people who develop free software. And they usually fix such loopholes.

And with free software, exploitation of a loophole is very, very, very quickly reported and fixed, often within hours.

Look at it this way, since the source is available, it would be easy for someone to find out a security loop hole, and make a patch for it, even before its exploited!

Also, the GNU operating system was designed with security in mind from the start.

=== So you're saying that free software actually evolves at a faster pace than non-free software? ===

Free software tends to evolve extremely rapidly. This is primarily because of the way it involves its users, who contribute bug reports and even code patches to the tool's development. The path and the pace of development is extremely open and only features and issues that are needed ever get done. Release fast and release often is the main 'mantra' of this kind of development. 

Note however that this benefits only tools which have reached the stage of being in popular use. Once this happens it is in the interest of the users too to promote and actually contribute to the development. In a way this ensures only the deserving and useful tools gets supported in this manner. 

Contrary to popular assumptions this model is [[:w:Laissez-faire|laissez faire]] in the truest and most efficient manner as possible. Demand and supply works best with more suppliers and consumers. And this is what happens here.

The pace of evolution is actually controlled by the popularity and the usefulness of the software. The more popular a piece of software is, the faster it evolves. In fact if something hinders this pace in any manner, like a dis-interested maintainer or an abandoned company, often other people step up as developers of the project. Or sometimes, forks of the project spring up (not that they don't always at other times) to continue with the development, under another banner since the original source is free to be used or maintained by anyone.

Compared to the isolated model of development employed by proprietary software, this is a tremendous plus. There exists no question about the continuity of the tool either, which is the ultimate barrier in the path of software evolution. 

This concept is explained really well in Eric Raymond's paper [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ The Cathedral and the Bazaar].

=== Free software is only something used by computer enthusiasts, right? ===

Wrong. 

Free software is used by people who value their freedom more than anything else.

Many millions of people the world over use free software without actually realizing it the moment they access popular sites on the Internet - see the section below.

=== Have any established organizations actually used free software to their advantage? ===

*This page is hosted on a server running free software ([[#Okay, but now what is Linux? When did that come about?|GNU]]/Linux, Apache/1.3.29 (Unix), PHP/4.3.4).
*More than 98% of all the Domain Name Servers, which identify the machine on which a page (like http://wikibooks.org/) is situated, use free software called BIND.
*More than 80% of all web servers use free software, called Apache, to serve their sites. But sadly, since Apache isn't [[#What do you mean by &quot;copyleft&quot;? What's wrong with copyright? How is this different?|copylefted]], many of these servers run proprietary versions of Apache.
*More than 60% of all network servers run the Linux kernel, another free software.
*The TCP/IP implementation on most computers, (including those running non-free operating systems) is free software.
*&quot;Digital Domain used 105 DEC Alphas running Red Hat [GNU/]Linux to simulate and render water for [[w:Titanic (1997 movie)|James Cameron's ''Titanic'']]&quot; -- http://www.computer.org/computer/homepage/0202/ec/

== Personal Relationship to Free Software ==
=== What kinds of problems might I expect to encounter using free software? ===

Exactly the same kind of problems you face with non free software.

Some problems with free software today are, 
* Incoherence. Take manuals for example. Some free software comes with info manuals, some with man pages, some with HTML documents, some others with plain text files, and yet others with only source code comments! 
* Inability to use certain patented algorithms. But that is not a problem with free software as such.
* Non-availability of drivers for certain devices, especially &quot;WinModems.&quot;
* Free software cannot be legally used (at least in the US) for certain activities that involve copy-protection techniques. This includes playing encrypted DVDs.

=== Okay, but why would I want to modify my software anyway? ===

There are plenty of reasons. Say for example a software does not support your local language. You would like this software to be available in your local language so that you can use it. If the software is proprietary you will have to go and beg the &quot;owner&quot; of the software. If he finds making the change wouldn't be profitable, he will not make the change. With free software, you can make the change yourself or you can go to a programming company and ask them to make the changes for you (which is how Richard Stallman supported himself for some time). With free software you are not helpless.

Also consider this ever plausible situation. Some time during your education, you would have written a project, or thesis or dissertation. In all probability, you may have used a computer belonging to a friend or the university to create this work. There is no assurance that you  would get the same software or package which you used to create this file a few years from now, when in a nostalgic mood, you decide to go through your past work. This is a time when you will feel like modifying whatever is available to read a new file format.

If you are any kind of organisation which needs (or as often happens, is obliged by law) to retain certain information over a long time, the right to modify your software through a third party vendor is 'the' most important right.

=== Look, I'm no computer whiz! Isn't it easier for me to just use packaged software? Who do I turn to when something goes wrong? ===

Using free software is all the more important if you are not a computer expert. That way, you do not have to depend on the company from whom you purchased non-free software.

First, read the documentation that came with the software. If that doesn't help, try searching the web with a search engine like [http://www.mozdex.com/ mozDex]. ''Last'' try one of the things below.

If you are looking for &quot;free of cost&quot; help, there will always be a free software user group or Linux User Group in your locality. Find one. Or ask any of the innumerable mailing lists or forums which provide support. You will be surprised at the response and support you receive. One forum is [http://www.nuxified.org/forums/ Nuxified.org]&lt;!--Domain name may change soon, be sure to edit if it does.--&gt;. There are more popular forums, however some don't set a good example - by having nonfree software (e.g. vBulletin) power their sites.

If you are willing to spend money, you can always hire a company or a consulting programmer to help you.

You can also buy support from expert companies. Since the software itself is open, the support vendor cannot lock you down like happens with proprietary software. You are always free to go to another support vendor. 

Also if your requirement is pretty huge, it will be highly cost effective to have an in house software development and support team who will take the free software and customize it for your needs and constantly maintain it.

=== But how do I know I can trust someone not linked to a big company that has a reputation to uphold? ===

Several big companies do provide support for free software. Several big companies charge several times more than several individual or small companies for their services. Remember, in the free software scenario, you are paying only for the services, not the product or package. So, there will be immense savings, and companies or consultants who work on free software will always have less turnover, even if they are experts and market leaders in their field.

Plus a little-known company/person can gain a bad reputation.

=== Which GNU/Linux distribution (or distro for short) should I use? ===
There are many publicly available GNU/Linux distros. [http://distrowatch.com/ Distrowatch] maintains a list of distros with summaries of their features. [http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora Core] (formerly Red Hat), [http://en.opensuse.org OpenSuse] and [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] are popular ones for new users (listed in alphabetical order). There are also many more distros such as Damn Small Linux, Gentoo, Morphix, Slackware, etc. 

[http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] is a distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux but aimed at being easy to use. They have non-free software available, but it is not enabled by default. It has a Live CD available, which allows you to test the distro without installing it on your computer.

[http://en.opensuse.org OpenSuse] is a powerful yet easy-to-use distro. Their Evaluation edition has non-free software, but the Open Source Software edition does not.

[http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora Core] is also new-user friendly. 

Try Debian if you are good with computers and have a little working knowledge of the GNU/Linux system. The primary strength of Debian is the sheer number of packages. It also has support for many different architectures. Debian also has distributions which don't use Linux as the kernel such as Debian GNU/Hurd and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD. Use these only if you are really interested in developing free software. Be warned though, Debian has nonfree software in its package repositories that are suffixed with &quot;-nonfree.

To avoid non-free software you should avoid Mandriva (formerly Mandrake), MEPIS, KNOPPIX, Linspire... These distributions come with non-free software packages by default.

If you are looking for a 100% free distribution, you should try [http://www.gnewsense.org gNewSense] or [http://www.trisquel.info/en Trisquel].

Depending on your needs there are even specialised GNU/Linux distributions. There is one which plays only Video CDs. There are several which are used only as firewalls. Some distros run from one or two floppy disks. Some distros are intended to be used as rescue disks. There are also distros even for musicians and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Most major distros come with several Compact Disks, but you can have a running and usable system with usually the first one or two CDs.

=== Where can I find free software? ===
Some good sources are:
*[http://directory.fsf.org/ Free Software Directory]
*[http://savannah.gnu.org/ GNU Savannah]
Note: The next two also list non-free software, although most of it is free.
*[http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge]
*[http://freshmeat.net/ FreshMeat]

=== I have some software for Windows that I can't find a replacement for on GNU/Linux! Where can I find one? ===
Look [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeSoftwareAlternatives Free software alternative page on Ubuntu community] and [http://www.gnu.org/software/for-windows.html GNU Software for Windows].

=== Okay, so how would I begin to install free software on my machine? ===

Once again, the same way you begin to install non-free software on your machine. You can buy computers with free software pre-installed. Or you can get a friend to do it for you. Or find a professional to do it.

If you decide to do it yourself, try lots of different software until you find what you like.

Most distributions have a built-in way of easily installing software and finding all its dependencies, called a package manager. Some package managers are:
*[http://labix.org/smart Smart] supports many types of repositories, including yum, apt, apt4rpm and urpmi.
*[http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/yum/ Yum] for Fedora Core
*[http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/index.en.html Apt] for Debian
*[http://apt4rpm.sourceforge.net/ Apt4RPM] for RPM distributions
*[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1 Portage] for Gentoo
*[http://www.freebsd.org/ports/ Ports] for FreeBSD

=== How can I make software I've written free software? ===
See [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC4 the last section of the GNU GPL]. Be sure to write [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html free documentation] (or get someone else to do it)!

=== How can I make money off of free software? ===
The easiest is selling free software. Be sure to explain to them that it's a matter of freedom, not price. Distributing this book with the software might be a good idea. Remember that if the software's under the GNU GPL and you distribute binaries, you must include the source with the binaries and/or offer the source separately.

You could also write [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html free documentation] and sell that. The same things in the above paragraph applies here.

Another way is, if you can write software, put yourself for hire to add/change something in free software. If you are the maintainer of the software, you could have people pay you to make a(n) addition/change higher on the priority list for the project. This is how Richard Stallman used to support himself, and he's still here.

      <comment>Transcendentalism Revived</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Newport Beach, CA - Kurt Kawohl, author of a newly released book called
&quot;Transcendentalism - A New Revelation&quot; is attempting to reinstitute
Transcendentalism in the USA. Kurt was born in Germany in 1941 and now lives
in California where he is a Real Estate Broker. It is his belief that the
American Transcendental movement would have survived and thrived today if
their philosophy had been more compatible with the majority American
religious beliefs of spiritual inspirations and revelations together with
insight as being acceptable communicators of the truth.

In his book Kurt explores the origin of religious beliefs and religions.
Although he credits most past religious leaders, writers and portrayed
prophets of the &quot;Holy Books&quot; with having experienced spiritual interaction
with a spiritual existence, Kurt attributes their mind's interpretation of
these events as being blended with superstitions which was the norm of that
time period. It is the author's claim that his concept of a spiritual deity
is also derived through his own spiritual experiences and that the spiritual
existence in the spiritual realm is in actuality a spiritual collective; the
progressive and accumulative spiritual intelligence of the universe; an
agglomeration of all of the righteous souls who have passed into the
spiritual realm.

In New England in the 19th-century Transcendentalists were known as writers
and philosophers who adhered to an idealistic system of thought based on a
belief in the essential unity of all creation, the innate goodness of man,
and the supremacy of insight over logic and experience for the revelation of
the deepest truths. The term Transcendentalism was derived from the German
philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) who considered it a philosophy which
holds that reasoning is the key to understanding reality and called &quot;all
knowledge transcendental which is concerned not with objects but with our
mode of knowing objects&quot;. Ralph Waldo Emerson's interpretation of
Transcendentalism was that it was a transcendental character or quality, a
philosophy which stressed intuition and spirituality. Kurt's opinions are
closely tied to Emerson's philosophy.

Kurt states in his book, &quot;Transcendentalism Today can influence the
beginning of a new integration of rationality into many religions. In this
21st Century, the Age of Technology, we are still plagued by religious
beliefs that is a contributing cause toward terrorism, killings and wars
between nations. Belief in a deity who caused catastrophes, punished people
and created the universe out of nothingness as if by magic was brought about
by hysteria and superstitions. This thought process needs to be reassessed
and brought up to date. Open-minded people must use common sense to
determine whether this so-called deity was incorrectly perceived,
misinterpreted and misunderstood by the masses of a bygone era. When
peoples' concept is flawed, corrections, truth, logic and common sense
thereof must eventually prevail. It is the attributes of human
characteristics to exercise upon others power, control, dominance,
destruction, punishment, revenge, judgment and not the attributes of a
deity. Everyone is personally responsible for his own soul's destiny, the
only requirement for achieving spiritual continuity is righteous living. The
destruction of civilizations, most sufferings and premature deaths are due
to human frailties, stupidity or imperfections and are not a deity's doings.
The deity that mankind calls by several names exists in a spiritual realm
and never has and never will interfere with anything on earth or in the
universe.&quot;

Will the author’s concept of Transcendentalism Today survive? Only time will tell. Kurt has had dialogue with religious leaders worldwide and supplies the
evidence thereof in his book. On a website catering primarily to active and
retired military personnel, at Military.com Kurt has posted his
Transcendentalism opinions on who/what &quot;God&quot; is and supplied the website
where his book can be accessed free of charge. Surprisingly over 10,000
people have visited there within a one year time period with many expressing
their approval.
-------------------

Lt. Colonel - US Air Force (retired) Melvin J. Beitscher wrote an email to
Kurt stating, &quot;As I near the end of your book and turn each page, I marvel
at the insight, research and reading you have done to come to this point in
your life and how you now affect so many more lives. Sometimes I lose a
little hope for mankind but with you, and I know there are many like you, I
realize that there is hope that we may transcend that which separates us.
You have started that vital journey with a remarkable thesis in your book
&quot;Transcendentalism -A New Revelation&quot;. Your courage to fly in the face of
organized religion and see the truth behind the basics of all religion
deserves a Nobel Prize. The courage you display in listing the
correspondence with other learned people even though it may be at odds with
your statements is to be commended. Christopher Phillips writes &quot;It is not
enough to have the courage of your convictions, you must also have the
courage to have your convictions challenged&quot;. You have that courage and
wisdom. Congratulations on a work long needed&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== That's Just not True :-P ==

This is my take on this whole talk page... maybe I didn't understand the problem? Well this makes sense to me :)

-to random ip address guy

Your logic assumes that the concept of probability actually exists but it doesn't, it's just a mathematical concept to simplify the world. In actuality all things that happen always have a 100% chance of happening and all things that don't happen always have a 0% chance of happening. It's like watching a movie. The same events will always happen unless they are altered even before they can be predicted by probablity. No matter how much you rewind a movie, or even if you were rewinding time itself, the same events always happen. Now thinking of probability just as a mathematical concept certain things just happen more often that others and this is simplified into saying that there is a greater chance of such and such happening again. So if we took that random male voter from your example we could indeed say that there is a 55% chance he voted for Bush. Sure, at the end of the day he either did vote for him or he didn't but if you look at it that way probability is irrelevant and non-existant.

But anyway, I think the answer to this puzzle needs to be corrected. Correct me if I'm wrong but this is how I interpretted it: a marble is chosen randomly and it happens to be white and another marble is to be chosen from the same bag. We can eliminate bag 2 from the equation since that can't be the bag that we're concerned with. This means it's either bag 1 or 2. In bag 1 we will always choose a white marble because there are only white marbles, a 100% chance. In bag 3 we will always choose the black marble since if this is the bag at hand, the white marble was already removed, a 0% chance of choosing a white marble. So the average is a 50% chance of choosing a white marble. I'm not sure if you meant the white marble that's chosen is removed from the bag or replaced, if it's replaced the answer should be a 75% chance.

That got long, sorry if you read all that ^_^ thanks though. So did I get it?

--[[User:Moonta|Swizzly]] 00:46, August 15, 2005 (UTC)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the fact that you have picked a white marble does indeeed tell you that you have picked either bag 1 or bag 3.

Before vandalizing module like thi you should consult with others here, if you don't want module resumed to it's previous state. Thank you. --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 10:06, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:if by any chance after reading comment you want to put &quot;either 0.0 or 1.0&quot; please don't. &quot;0.0 or 1.0&quot; is not a probability. It is the outcome. Probability indicates how often would this outcome happen. By saying probability is 2/3, we mean that if we pick a random bag and draw a white marble out of it 100 times, and after each event draw another one, ~67 of theese marbles will be white. *this* is the probability. --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 05:31, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Removed fallacious argument from main page ==
COMMENT: Once we get to the point described in the puzzle the probability that the second ball will be white is either 1.0 or 0.  It can be nothing else.

Probability has to do with the situation PRIOR to an event.  Once the outcome is determined probability is no longer a factor.  In the case of the scenario presented by this puzzle, the outcome has already been determined.  The fact that we don't know the color of the second ball doesn't change the fact that its color is fixed.  That we don't see the color doesn't mean there is any chance that it can be different from what it is. Only one outcome is possible when the second ball if taken out of the bag.

It's true that if we were asking, before we started, what the probabilies are that we WOULD get certain outcomes the probability of getting bag, white ball, white ball is twice that of getting bag, white ball, black ball.  But that's not the question asked by the puzzle. The puzzle says we've already selected a bag.  That means the colors of both balls have been determined. If it happens to be the bag with one white and one black there's probability associated with different color outcomes just prior to selection of the first ball, but after that first ball is selected there is no subsequent possibility of different scenarios.  Only one scenario is possible even if we don't know what that scenario is.

Here's another example:  Exit polling data indicate that 55% of males who voted in the last election voted for Bush.  So, before we do anything, we can say that if we randomly select a male who voted there's a 0.55 probability that it'll be somebody who voted for Bush.

But once we select the person, that person either voted for Bush or he didn't.  If we say there's a 0.55 probability he voted for Bush, we are not being accurate.  There are only two possibilities at that point.  Either he voted for Bush (1.0) or he did not (0).

Same with flipping a coin.  Before the coin is flipped you can say there's a 0.50 probability it'll be heads.  If you say ahead of time that you're going to call heads there's a 0.50 probability that you'll be right.  But once it's been flipped it is what it is.  If you say heads you're either right or you're wrong.  If the coin beneath the hand covering it is tails it is tails whether you can see that or not.  If you say heads at that point your probability of being right is zero.</text>

:The '''Spanish American War''' started in 1898.  The United States won, resulting in the Treaty of Paris, and the handing of ownership of the Spanish colonial empire in Asia to the United States. The Philippines, however, did not agree to the handing of it to the Americans; in which, resulted to the Philippine-American War.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Flatbread|Flatbread]] | [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|Vegan Cuisine]]

'''Hard tack''' is a cracker/biscuit flat-bread used during long sea voyages and military campaigns before the introduction of [[canning]] as a primary food-source.  Mostly inedible for dry and hard preservation, it was  usually dunked in water, brine, coffee, or other liquids, or cooked into a skillet meal.  This cracker was little more than flour and water which had been [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] hard and would keep for months as long as it was kept dry. Also known as a sea biscuit, sea bread, or ship's biscuits.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*¾ cup water
*¾ teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)

Optional/not traditional adjustment:
This will make the crackers more palatable but mean that unlike traditional hard bread they will eventually spoil, even if properly stored.
*1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]

==Procedure==
# Mix all the ingredients into a dough and press onto a cookie sheet to a thickness of ½ inch.  
# Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F (205°C) for half an hour. Don't cut now
# Remove from oven, cut dough into 3-inch squares, and punch four rows of holes, four holes per row into the dough (a fork works nicely). 
# Flip the crackers and return to the oven for another half hour.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
{{wikipedia|Hardtack}}
* Some recipes also recommend a second baking at 250°F (120°C) to thoroughly dry out the bread.
* Scale ingredient quantities equally if more dough is required.

== Introduction ==
The cuisine of South Africa reflects the diversity of the various ethnic groups that make up the population of South Africa. The variety of different culinary traditions combined with the great variety of fresh food present a cuisine that caters for every taste sensation. Although the historical traditions are evident in the cuisine, modern food trends also influence its development.

South African cuisine is strongly influenced by Dutch, German, English, French, Malaysian, Portuguese, Indonesian, Indian, Native African and even Asian cuisines. As a result, we have a great variety of dishes.

== South African history's influence on culinary tradition ==

The first European settlers in South Africa were the Dutch, who established a trading post in the Cape in 1652. Many men from Germany also came to work in the Cape. Towards the end of the 17th century, Malay slaves were imported. The French Huguenots, after fleeing their country due to religious persecution, came to South Africa and started our fine winemaking tradition. Britain gained control of the Cape in 1806. The discovery of gold and diamonds lead to further British colonizations in South Africa. Under their rule, Indian indentured labourers were imported as cheap labour. Later Britain gave South Africa its independence. The Portuguese influence came mostly from Mozambique and Angola, two of South Africa's neighbouring countries. Long ignored are also the African influences in South African cuisine, now much more popular since the passing of Apartheid.

Meat dishes are very popular, especially amongst European descendants commonly known as the Afrikaners. There's an old joke that states that a Boer eats mutton, beef and bacon for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and when he feels like some vegetables, he eats chicken.

Braais (barbecues) are very popular.

In April, 1943, [[en:Los Alamos|Los Alamos]] was opened. The work at Los Alamos centered around the development of a delivery system, and the two methods considered were the gun method and the implosion method. The gun method called for two non-critical elements to be fired at each other, contact turning them critical, but it was rejected as being to large for aerial delivery. Implosion called for the collapse of non-critical wedges, which would become critical when brought into contact, and it was the method that was eventually used. 
In February, 1944, the first slightly enriched Uranium (13% U-235) arrived at Los Alamos. 

In September, 1944, 63% Uranium 235 arrived at Los Alamos, and the designs for Fat Man and Little Boy were finalized.  [[en:Fat Man|Fat Man]], composed of [[en:Plutonium|Plutonium]] shell within an array of shape charges wrapped around it, had a diameter of 60 inches, a length of 128 inches, and a weight of 10,000 pounds. [[en:Little Boy|Little Boy]], composed of a long cannon with a Uranium (235) bullet, and U-235 target rings in the muzzle, had a diameter of 28 inches, and a length of 120 inches, and a weight of 9000 pounds.

On December 17th, 1944, the 509th composite bomber group, composed of specially modified [[en:B-29|B-29]] Superfortresses designed to carry atomic bombs, was formed to deliver the bomb to targets in [[en:Japan|Japan]].

In March, 1945, the S-50 plant at [[en:Oak Ridge|Oak Ridge]] came fully online, and began to supply Los Alamos with 85% enriched U-235.

On July 16th, 1945, the first nuclear bomb test occurred at the [[en:Trinity test sight|Trinity test site]] in [[en:New Mexico|New Mexico]]. It was the Fat Man design, and it was successful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hallo, Ik ben Hogersluys, in het verleden nog eens actief op Wikipedia NL, maar door een sabbathjaar nog slechts uitzonderlijk online.  Bij het rondneuzen wat Wiki in al zijn gedaanten te bieden heeft, ben ik op het intrigerende project van de Wikibooks terecht gekomen.  En meteen verliefd op het concept.  Ik heb me meteen aan een paar vertalingen gewaagd, en hoop vlug een georganiseerde bende medewerkers te vinden, die het Nederlandstalige project helpen ontwikkelen.  Enige namen kwamen me alvast bekend voor.  

Ook hier geldt de regel: als je geen ruchtbaarheid geeft aan je activiteit, valt het na verloop van tijd in slaap.  Ik wil dus wel een eind vertalen, als ik maar de werktuigen in handen krijg die de basisbladzijden toegankelijk maken: ik lees nog steeds liever iets in mijn eigen taal, dan het te moeten vertalen vanuit een vreemde taal; vertalen is één ding, maar instructies en verklaringen komen me liever over in mijn eigen moerstaal.  Wie helpt me op weg? 

Mail me gerust als je dat wil, mijn mail staat open voor elke welwillende medewerker.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why do you damn Mandriva? ==

You state: &quot;You should stay out of Mandriva (formerly Mandrake)&quot; because it &quot;comes with non-free software packages by default&quot;

Mandriva has Free Software edition, which doesn't contain any non-free packages on installation image and even doesn't enable non-free repositories by default. I didn't found this edition less functional or less user friendly than One which isn't completely free (it's only a bit more difficult to install proprietary Nvidia driver)

Also, you could add urpmi to the list of package managers. It has many advanced features: mirrors (as yum), flexible dependency tracking (e.g, you are not obligated to install some vendor chosen icon theme for OpenOffice.org as in Ubuntu, or install MySQL client for Drupal if you want to use it with PostgreSQL)

Hi everybody,

I would like to translate this article to German for de.wikibooks.org. Do you think this makes sense already at this point, or shall I wait until it has become a revised version?

== What does &quot;FLOSS&quot; mean ? ==

What is the target audience of the &quot;FLOSS Concept Booklet&quot; ?
What does &quot;FLOSS&quot; in the title mean ?

Is it just a typo -- should be &quot;FOSS (Free/Open Source Software)&quot; ?

If we're never going to use the acronym in the article, maybe we should spell it out in the title also.


--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 01:20, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Free (Libre) and Open Source Software is the acronym used in the UK public policy on - well, FLOSS.

== History section ==

The way the history has been presented, I guess the questions in the history section can be removed. It is also not possible to see the history separately as Stallman, Linus, GNU... It is all iterconnected.

[[User:Vijaykumar|Vijay]]

== Summarise ==

This
[[FLOSS_Concept_Booklet#I'm_still_not_convinced._Surely_a_big_computer_company_knows_best_when_it_comes_to_designing_software?_Why_would_I_want_to_use_software_designed_by_an_amateur?|question]]
has gathered a lot of meat. Can somebody summarise it?

[[User:Vijaykumar|Vijay]]

== Rephrasing question and answer ==

I am moving the following question to the talk page. I am replacing it with a different question and answer.

Hold on a minute. I thought “User” just meant someone who uses a piece of software.

Interesting point. Yes, you are right. Our common understanding of the term “User” does suggest someone who simply ‘uses’ software. One of the most interesting characteristics of Free Software is the way in which this distinction between “user “ and “creator” begins to blur. Creators of Free Software are also its users and, those engaging with Free Software are also often (though not always) involved in the creation of the software. We’ll talk more about this point later.

[[User:Vijaykumar|Vijay]]

== Removing question ==

This stuff could be adapted and added to the history section.

What does GNU GPL stand for? ***should we have this*** ?
GNU is the name of an operating system that is similar to UNIX, an operating system that has been in heavy use among academic and engineering circles since the late 1970s. Since the term UNIX is trademarked, GNU cannot legally call itself UNIX, no matter how similar it might be to it. To remove any threat of violating the trademark and as a tongue-in-cheek remark, GNU actually stands Gnu is Not UNIX. GNU is also the name of an influential foundation that propagates and promotes free software. A huge amount of free software in the world today is licensed under the GPL – the General Public License. This license is a copyleft license that incorporates the terms given in ***sec earlier***

[[User:Vijaykumar|Vijay]]

== Removed a question ==

The FLOSS booklet is a mini booklet, to be given as a handout. Right? So it is better to keep it short and sweet as posssible. Though the following question does bring a lot of understanding, I feel it is too much involved for a new comer. What do us say guys?

[[User:Vijaykumar|Vijay]] 04:44, 31 May 2004 (UTC)

End User License Agreements such as the one from Microsoft treat the users of software very differently from the way that users are treated and thought of in Free Software. How do these two differ ?

In general, a large part of the Microsoft EULA concerns itself with limiting your use of the software, and with absolving Microsoft from any responsibilities it may have with respect to the warranty. In contrast, Free Software Licenses spend most of their time specifying the rights allocated users, and the responsibilities for the use of the software from the perspective of software distributors or programmers who incorporate GPL code. Few user-level restrictions are evident.

(adapted from http://voidmain.is-a-geek.net/docs/comparing_the_gpl_to_eula.html )

Broadly, all users of free software are, at the bare minimum considered to be potential creators of free software. The licenses reflect this by making sure that it is extremely easy for someone to transition from being a mere consumer of the software to a co-creator.

Broadly, all users of commercial software are considered to be mere passive consumers of the software. Great pains are taken to ensure that the passive user remains passive, regardless of any possible desire to be more involved with the software. What few rights commercial software licenses grant users are given grudgingly.</text>

== Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese ==
I am against two different textbooks. I think it will be better to use only one textbook and point the differences. [[User:Marlosfabris]] 02:06, 06 Oct 2006 (UTC)
:Couldn't agree more. We are talking about a begginer's course here, diferences in spelling and use of words isn't big enough to justify such a thing, really. - anon - 30 August 2006 

::I'm very happy there is something like a portuguese and a Brazilian book. I have a portuguese girlfriend, and I've noticed that one is easily corrected as &quot;noo, you don't say that, that's brazilian, not portuguese.&quot; In fact, I'm happy because this is one of the few sources on portuguese from Portugal. [[User:Mindyou|Mindyou]] 17:17, 26 Nov 2007

::: Heh. I have a girlfriend who tells me &quot;noo, you don't say that, that's portuguese, not brazilian portuguese.&quot; I don't know if this is a good strong argument for having separate language learning books. It certainly ''seems'' like the two sides regard their dialects as very different when you ask them about it. The question is, is there ''enough'' of a difference? Is it worth the extra effort and dilution of collaboration, to build two different sets of lessons? I think we're seeing the answer. Different people get excited about developing different sets of lessons. They might have progressed further if they had worked together somehow, but then at least one of them probably wouldn't have got so excited about it in the first place.
::: In any case the horse has bolted. We have a split. It would be a lot of effort to undo that and merge back into one Brazilian &amp; Portuguese set of lessons. But there is some merging that we ''do'' need to do because of the separate Brazilian Portuguese wikibook (following discussion)
;:: -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|talk]]) 13:56, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Separate wikibook [[Brazilian Portuguese]] ==

There is now an entirely '''separate wikibook [[Brazilian Portuguese]]''' (The above comments pre-date this) This means that we now have ''three'' sets of lessons planned out, and some confusing duplication which, in my opinion, we should definitely resolve. [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[Portuguese/Contents#Courses for Portuguese spoken in Brazil]] are both sets of Brazilian Portuguese lessons. They have quite different styles, but nonetheless, their missions overlap too much and this just creates confusion.

I'm not really sure what the best solution is...
:'''Option A''': remove [[Portuguese/Contents#Courses for Portuguese spoken in Brazil]], merging into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] wikibook
:'''Option B''': remove [[Brazilian Portuguese]] wikibook, merging to [[Portuguese/Contents#Courses for Portuguese spoken in Brazil]]

To be clear...  I'm ''not'' proposing a merge between Brazilian Portuguese and Portuguese Portuguese (That's a different discussion above)

Option A leaves this wikibook being entirely Portuguese Portuguese. A clean separation. We'd have to build and maintain ''all'' sections of the book separately for both dialects (Not just the lessons, but vocab lists and appendices). Option B involves removing a wikibook, which maybe would require some special procedure? (actually looking at the non-existent procedures for ''starting'' a wikibook... I guess not) This option involves bringing all content together in this wikibook, which would allow us to share some sections, but then some vocab words would be different in the different dialects I presume, so maybe that's not all that useful.

I'm kind of favouring Option A, but I think we also need some prominent labels to encourage awareness of parallel efforts between the two wikibooks.

== Wikiversity courses ==

I've just come across [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Portuguese Wikiversity Topic:Portuguese] - Two more different courses on our sister site Wikiversity.

Don't know how the Wikiversity and WikiBooks communities deal with such crossovers normally but... well this follows nice from the above discussion on duplicated wiki effort and proliferation of different courses! 

-- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Harry Wood|contribs]]) 15:21, 7 September 2012 (UTC)

== Pronunciations ==
Would it be possible to include pronunciations with the words, at least for the earlier lessons?  Better yet, a link to a sound file (say, in .ogg format) so you could hear the correct pronunciation of words.  [[Mraj]] 08:35 EDT, 15 May 2006

:Being a native speaker myself, I wouldn't mind giving you a hand in such a complex matter. I can record sound files if you need to, fix the grammar, etc. As for the differences in European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese, I believe different textbooks should be kept, in order to avoid the unnecessary hassle for those getting started with this new language.

== Commonly used adjectives &amp; adverbs ==
I am not sure if it is a good idea to have pages for &quot;commonly used adjectives&quot; and &quot;commonly used adverbs&quot; in portuguese separately since so many words can be used as both. -- [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 09:01, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:It's likely best to have a separate section for the copula; especially considering that Portuguese, as Spanish, has two verbs 'to be' and these are a point of difficulty for learners of Portuguese as a foreign language.  Let me see what I can cook up. --[[User:Wtrmute|Wtrmute]] 15:02, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Introductory section ==
I am wondering, would it be wise to have an introductory section, for example, a getting started page with phrases like &quot;Bom dia&quot;, &quot;boa tarde&quot;, &quot;boa noite&quot;... that you need to start speaking? And perhaps a bit about Brazillian Portuguese?

--[[User:Jonojet|Jonojet]] 31 October 2004

== Lesson structure ==

As it stands this is really a guide to Portuguese grammar, not the actual language?
Should we restructure this to resemble the Spanish or French wikibooks where each lesson contains a little grammar, vocab, pronunctiation etc?

-- anonymous 23 February 2005

:I really think that this should be more of a coursebook (like the Spanish, French, German Wikibooks).  That is, I second the above. - anon 12 April 2005

::-[[User:Serge]] - 16 April 2005

::: It looks okay, but what are we going to do about dialect issues?

:::: I've added a picture and prettied up a little - [[User:Serge]] 27 May 2005 

Hey guys, no-one seems to be showing much interest in expanding this book, so I've tried to make it a little better. I've planned level one, and I hope it's not too packed with grammar. One thing we have to be careful of is introducing too much grammar too quickly. Also try to use very little grammatical terms, (I know I've used too much) and introduce things slowly. I think it's better if we structure the lessons so that vocabulary can be introduced gradually rather than all in one table which is tedious. What does everyone think? (P.S) I know lesson One is a bit awful (sorry) but please feel free to try to make it more user friendly...Hope everyone likes what's been going on... --[[User:Serge|Serge]] 31 May 2005

:Sorry to intrude, I think you should abstract the problem from the book structure, consider providing information on  Portuguese in general and point the particulars, you could even leave space for other Portuguese speaking communities (PALOP) to participate, if you just keep stuff with a distinct legend so a reader and future editors can  treat the content.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

== Expanding Out==
OK, here's the drill. I've planned fifteen lessons for our course. Here is a list of what could be covered in each lesson. But in the great spirit of the Wiki please please make adjustements because I'm far from a teacher.

* Lesson 1 - Saying Hello - Introductions and Greetings, verb 'estar'.
* Lesson 2 - I Like... - Verb 'gostar', adjectives, gender, definite articles.
* Lesson 3 - What Are You Going To Do? - Future using 'ir' and infinitives.
* Lesson 4 - Where Do You Come From? - more on adjectives and plural nouns
* Lesson 5 - Going Shopping - verb 'querar', negation, indefinite articles
* Lesson 6 - The Train - question words
* Lesson 7 - What Time Is It? - Numbers and time.
* Lesson 8 - Meeting People - more introductions, o/a/os/as senhor/a/s, verbs 'saber' and 'conhecer'.
* Lesson 9 - Let's Go Shopping - 'This' and 'that' and 'those', comparisons.
* Lesson 10 - My House - verbs 'ter' and 'haver'

'''Level 2'''
* Lesson 11 - The Weekend - verbs in present progressive (Brazilian and Portuguese usage)
* Lesson 12 - Whose Is This? - Possesive adjectives &amp; pronouns
* Lesson 13 - At The Doctor - Body parts, idiomatic uses of 'ter'
* Lesson 14 - Eating Out - Regular 'ar' verbs
* Lesson 15. - The Telephone Call - Regular 'ir' and 'er' verbs.

However I don't have nearly enough time to write this so please - could someone just jump in and write some with me ? Because I seem to be the only one creating content at the moment.

In a lesson we might consider the following approach:
 
*A dialogue to start off with (or at least sometime during the lesson)
*Some new grammar, which should be covered from a layperson's point of view. Use plenty of examples. BUT (always a but) try (it's hard) not to overload the lesson with too much grammar.
*Explain differences between Portuguese and Brazilian usage
*Point out some grammar
*Give new vocabulary - that is, nouns and adjectives until verb conjugation is introduced (I've deliberately left this until later, because I think in pretty much all actual school courses this is left until more fundemental and easy points are covered). After this new verbs can be added sparingly.
*Until conjugation is introduced, try to give one or two verbs (doesn't necessarily have to be full conjugation of verb yet).
*Point out some pronunciation.
*Exercises. These should be a mix of easy to harder, but all necessary vocab should have been introduced. Make sure it's not always just translations, because these can get monotonous.

Thanks to anyone who wants to help - your support would be fantastico. And if you're not all that keen on doing lessons, please help with grammar appendices and (start a new section if you feel like) vocabulary appendices, including slang.  Also, because I can hardly speak any Portuguese myself, please oh please correct mistakes, revise, and improve. Because that's what wiki is all about.

-- [[User:Serge|Serge]] 1 July 2005 

== Missing Orphan page that should belong here ==

I was rummaging around the Wikibooks orphan pages and I found one that may be useful to you here:

&quot;Portuguese:Commonly used nouns&quot; ''[since renamed &quot;[[Portuguese/Contents/Days, Months, Seasons]]&quot;]''

I am not as familiar with the layout of this Wikibook, so I'm going to leave it to the &quot;regulars&quot; on where to put the contents of this Wikibook module. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:20, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

== Audio files ==
hi,

Unfortunately none of these files are available to listen to.

http://languagelab.bh.indiana.edu/portuguese_p100-p135-p150.html

They are password protected.

anon - 25 November 2005

== Second paragraph ==

Should this paragraph be here ? :

''&quot;The Portuguese spoken in Brazil is quite different from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal in that the Brazilians tend to be more liberal with their use of the language. Also, the informal second person pronoun &quot;tu&quot; is almost never used. The word order is slightly different in certain circumstances, as is the preferred synonym for the same word. It is often easier to learn for beginners, and you will still be understood in Portugal.&quot;''
 
It looks like it's trying to convince people to learn Brazilian Portuguese instead of European Portuguese. If we really have to keep it, shouldn't it be moved to the Brazilian Portuguese section? 

- anon - 30 August 2006 

:I'm completely rewriting this paragraph because it's biased towards Brazilian Portuguese, it's too vague (what does it even mean to be &quot;liberal&quot; in using a language?) and contains an incorrect statement (&quot;tu&quot; is used very often in dialects in the southern and northeastern regions of Brazil). [[User:Hokstein|Hokstein]] 12:35, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

== Verbs ==
I made some tables of the forms of Portuguese irregular verbs in different tenses in the German Wikibook, for instance [[:de:Portugiesisch: Unregelmäßige Verben: Präsens]]. Links to other tenses can be seen [[:de:Portugiesisch:_Inhalt#Verben|here]] (tenses of ''unregelmäßige Verben''). Perhaps you might have o look on them. By the way: there is something wrong with your present tense of regular verbs, it's not shown correctly. [[:de:Benutzer:Wau|de:Wau]] --[[User:62.158.50.113|62.158.50.113]] 11:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== opening section &quot;Feature word&quot; ==

In the opening section here. It says &quot;Why not start with the feature word?&quot;. What does that mean? -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|talk]]) 09:24, 7 June 2008 (UTC)

== Pronounciation ==

I notice that there is no section for pronounciation, I think this would be particularly helpful, maybe added as an appendix? [[User:V85|V85]] ([[User talk:V85|talk]]) 22:32, 27 December 2009 (UTC)

== A real effort ==
A real effort should be made in bringing this up to date with orthographic accord, signed by most nations (I think Angola has not yet signed) but that involves a very limited set of uses.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:39, 11 February 2012 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Chicagopile.gif]]

In September, [[en:1941|1941]], [[en:Enrico Fermi|Enrico Fermi]] designed what became known as the [[en:Chicago Pile|Chicago Pile]], the first controlled [[en:nuclear|nuclear]] reaction.  This proved that [[en:nuclear energy|nuclear energy]] was real, and usable, and gave impetuous to those who would use nuclear power for more destructive purposes.  Built out of a lattice of [[en:Uranium|Uranium]], it used [[en:Graphite|Graphite]] as a controlling substance, to slow down the rate of [[en:fission|fission]]. December 2, 1942 marked the first successful test of Fermi’s Chicago Pile.

==== Digestive Biscuits and Graham Crackers ====

These two items are fairly different, but are used similarly (e.g. to make crumb crusts for a cheesecake).  Graham crackers are sweeter, and are available in different flavors, e.g. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], chocolate.  Digestive biscuits are richer, and while slightly sweet, are often used eaten with cheese.  They are also available coated on one side with milk or dark [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]].

==== Chips and French Fries (Australia) ====
In Australia, the term &quot;chips&quot; is generally used, but the term &quot;French fries&quot; is used to describe very finely cut chips (about 1/5&quot; across.)

==== Cornflour (Australia) ====
In Australia (and New Zealand?), cornflour is frequently made from wheat. [[w:Food Standards Australia New Zealand|FSANZ]] regulations require such cornflour to declare that it contains wheat and gluten, and it is usually described as wheaten cornflour. There are some brands of cornflour that are made from maize, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the most commonly acknowledged principles of design are alignment, balance, contrast, proximity, repetition, and white space. These are all elements of graphic design &quot;composition.&quot; Additionally, compositions are evaluated based on the use of (and the successes or failures of) harmony, emphasis, gestalt, pattern, movement, rhythm, proportion, and unity.

==What is Graphic Design?==
Graphic design is the art of visual communication through the use of images, words, and ideas to give information to the viewers. Graphic design can be used for advertising, or just for entertainment intended for the mind.

==Alignment==

Alignment in graphic design is the keeping of related objects in line.

==Balance==
Designs in balance (or equilibrium) have their parts arrangement planned, keeping a coherent visual pattern (color, shape, space). &quot;Balance&quot; is a concept based on human perception and the complex nature of the human senses of weight and proportion. Humans can evaluate these visual elements in several situations to find a sense of balance. A design composition does not have to be symmetrical or linear to be considered balanced, the balance is global to all elements even the absence of content. In this context perfectly symmetrical and linear compositions are not necessarily balanced and so asymmetrical or radial distributions of text and graphic elements can achieve balance in a composition.

==Contrast==
Distinguishing by comparing/creating differences. Some ways of creating contrast among elements in the design include using contrasting colors, sizes, shapes, locations, or relationships. For text, contrast is achieved by mixing serif and sans-serif on the page, by using very different type styles, or by using type in surprising or unusual ways. Another way to describe contrast, is to say &quot;a small object next to a large object will look smaller&quot;. As contrast in size diminishes, monotony is approached.

==Emphasis==
Making a specific element stand out or draw attention to the eye. Emphasis can be achieved in graphic design by placing elements on the page in positions where the eye is naturally drawn, by using other principles such as contrast, repetition, or movement. Bold and italic type provides emphasis for text. Graphic elements gain emphasis through size, visual weight, color, complexity, uniqueness, placement on the page, and other features.

==Gestalt==
Sometimes considered a distinct principle of design, gestalt is the concept that &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; Gestalt is a concept from psychology, where theorists note the propensity of humans to conceptually group things together to make a meaningful whole. When viewing designs, humans apply this principle unconsciously by seeing connections and relationships among and between the elements in the design. The overall perception of gestalt in a design is created through harmony, unity, balance, proportion, proximity, and other visual cues. Designers can use this principle to create visual connections and relationships that clarify and strengthen the overall &quot;feel&quot; and meaning of the design.

==Harmony==
As with music, graphical elements can be said to be working in harmony - the individual parts come together as visually compelling and a meaningful whole. Disharmony can also be used just as it is in musical compositions: to enhance the emotional complexity, to challenge the viewer, and to give a contrast within the overall composition.

==Movement==
Movement is creating an instability, making motion to blur the image. Movement can be achieved by using graphic elements that direct the eye in a certain direction such as arrows that point the way overtly or a series of lines or dots that get progressively larger or smaller, creating a more subtle sense of movement. Movement can be accomplished simply by using a photograph or clip art of something moving - a runner - as opposed to something stationary - a person standing.

==Proportion==
This indicates the relative visual size and weight of particular graphical elements in a design composition.

==Proximity==
Closeness or distance of individual design elements. Close proximity indicates a connection.

==Repetition==
Repeating a sequence; having it occur more than a few times. In design, repetition creates visual consistency in page designs, such as using the same style of headlines, the same style of initial capitals, or repeating the same basic layout from one page to another.

Excessive repetition (monotony) may lead to boredom and uninteresting compositions. If one cannot avoid excessive repetitions for any reason, do not forget to add some visual breaks and white spaces where eyes can rest for a while.

==Rhythm==
Successful designs have an effective ebb and flow. Text and Graphics should seem to be paced and patterned. Spacing is an effective application of this principle. Second, human beings are more comfortable with variation in general. Psychologically, most any serious lack in variation of anything (a solid, a line, a sound, a situation) can become very boring. Adding a little variation at non-specific intervals (every now and again) gives most any design an interesting appeal as long as it is not overdone. 

In setting type, rhythm can be created or disrupted. Compare the gibberish strings, &quot;as erav mono ewone zenao oro remuna oravanam&quot; and &quot;githol urtym reislyt quadirit&quot;.  Notice how the latter seems to be more organic and readable than the former. This is resultant of two things. One, the eye more easily follows abnormalities and variation, like an ocular foothold.   Too-narrow columns result in over-hyphenation. Images that interrupt a passage of text can break the rhythm for the reader and they could disturb the visual appearance of the page.

==Unity==
Unity creates a feeling of wholeness. Unity is usually achieved when the parts complement each other in a way where they have something in common. Unity can be achieved by use of the same color, or different tints of it, or using a similar graphic style for illustrations.

==White Space==
Areas of a design devoid of text or graphics. White space includes margins, gutters, space between lines of type (leading), off-set of text from images (text wraps) and any other part of the page that is empty. White space is also analogous to &quot;negative space&quot; where &quot;positive space&quot; is defined as images, blocks of text, and other graphical elements. In graphic design, the white space, or negative space, is considered an important element of the overall design. It is used - and evaluated - based on the same criteria as the rest of the elements in the design. White space can add to or detract from the balance, unity, harmony, rhythm, and overall success of a design. White space can give emphasis, contrast, and movement. It can be used for repetition and pattern, and work within various relationships with other elements of the positive and negative spaces in the design.

'''The imaginary unit'''
# Compute &lt;math&gt;i^{25} = i&lt;/math&gt;
# Compute &lt;math&gt;i^{100} = 1&lt;/math&gt; 
# Compute &lt;math&gt;i^{1000} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:The pattern of &lt;math&gt;i^{1},i^{2},i^{3},...&lt;/math&gt; shows that &lt;math&gt;i^{4n} = 1&lt;/math&gt; where n is any integer.  This case applies to questions 2 and 3.  For question 1, &lt;math&gt;i^{25} = i^{24}\times i^{1} = i&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Complex numbers as solutions to quadratic equations'''
# Convince yourself that ''x = 3 - 2i'' is also a solution to the equation.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x &amp; = &amp;3 - 2i &amp;\\
x^2 &amp; = &amp; (3)^2 + 2(3)(-2i) + (-2i)^2 \\
&amp; = &amp; 5 - 12i\\
x^2 - 6x + 13 &amp;=&amp; 5 - 12i - 6(3-2i) + 13\\
&amp;=&amp; 0\\ 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
# Plot the points A(3, 2) and B(3, -2) on a XY plane. Draw a line for each point joining them to the origin.
# Compute the length of AO (the distance from point A to the Origin) and BO. Denote them by &lt;math&gt;r_1 \ \mbox{and} \ r_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. What do you observe?
#*&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13}&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;r_2 = \sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{13}&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;r_1 \ \mbox{and} \ r_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same
# Compute the angle between each line and the x-axis and denote them by &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \ \mbox{and} \ \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;. What do you observe?
#*&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 = \tan^{-1}(3/2) \approx 56&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\phi_2 = \tan^{-1}(3/-2) \approx -56&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \ \mbox{and} \ \phi_2&lt;/math&gt; differ only in the sign of the number
# Consider the complex numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp; = &amp; r_1 \cdot (\cos{\phi_1} + i\sin{\phi_1})\\
w &amp; = &amp; r_2 \cdot (\cos{\phi_2} + i\sin{\phi_2})\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute ''z'' and ''w'' into the quadratic equation above using the values you have computed in Exercise 3 and 4. What do you observe? What conclusion can you draw from this?
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{13} \cdot (\cos{\tan^{-1}(3/2)} + i\sin{\tan^{-1}(3/2)})  &amp; = &amp; 2+3i\\
w &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{13} \cdot (\cos{\tan^{-1}(3/-2)} + i\sin{\tan^{-1}(3/-2)})&amp; = &amp; 2-3i\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the quadratic equation will equal 0 since z and w are equal to the solutions we found when solving the equation.

'''Addition and multiplication'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x &amp;=&amp; 3 - 2i \\
y &amp;=&amp; 3 + 2i
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Compute:
# x + y
#* (3 - 2i) + (3 + 2i) = 6
# x - y
#* 3 - 2i - (3 + 2i) = -4i
# x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
#* (3 - 2i)(3 - 2i) = 9 + (2)(3)(-2i) + 4i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5 - 12 i
# y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
#* (3 + 2i)(3 + 2i) = 9 + (2)(3)(2i) + 4i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5 + 12 i
# xy
#* (3 - 2i)(3 + 2i) = 9 + 6 i - 6i - 4i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 13
# (x + y)(x - y)
#* ((3 - 2i) + (3 + 2i))((3 - 2i) - (3 + 2i)) = (6)(-4i) = -24i

'''Division'''
Convince yourself that the product of zw is always a real number.
&lt;math&gt; zw = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 - abi + abi -b^2i^2 = a^2 - b&lt;/math&gt;

'''Complex Conjugate'''
Convince yourself that the multiplication law is also true.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp;= &amp;a + bi\\
w &amp;= &amp;c - di\\
\\
x &amp;=&amp; z \times w \\
&amp;=&amp; (a + bi)(c - di)
&amp;=&amp; ac + bci - adi - bdi^2
&amp;=&amp; ac - bd + (bc - ad)i
\\
\bar{x}&amp;=&amp; ac - bd - (bc - ad)i
\\
\\
\bar{z} \times \bar{w}&amp; =&amp; (a - bi)(c + di)\\
&amp;=&amp; ac - bic + adi - bdi^2\\
&amp;=&amp; ac - bd - (bc + ad)i \\
&amp;=&amp; \bar{x}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''The complex root'''

1. Find (3 + 3i)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp; = &amp; 3 + 3i \\

w &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{z}\\
w^2 &amp; = &amp; z\\

 &amp;=&amp; \frac{9}{4} -3b^2 -b^4 \\
\\
c &amp;=&amp; b^2 \\ 
0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{9}{4} -3c -c^2 \\
c &amp;=&amp; \frac{--3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 -4\times \frac{9}{4} \times -1}}{2\times-1} \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{18}}{2} \\
b^2 &amp;=&amp; \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{18}}{2} \\
b &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{\frac{-3 +\sqrt{18}}{2}} \\

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
3 &amp;=&amp;  2ab\\
a &amp;=&amp; \frac{3}{2b} \\
  &amp;=&amp; \frac{3}{2\frac{\sqrt{6(\sqrt{2}-1)}}{2}} \\

  &amp;=&amp; \frac{\sqrt{6(\sqrt{2}+1)}}{2}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus the solution for (3 + 3i)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{3+3i} = \pm (\frac{\sqrt{6(\sqrt{2}+1)}}{2} +\frac{\sqrt{6(\sqrt{2}-1)}}{2} \times i)
&lt;/math&gt;

\\
c &amp;=&amp; b^2 \\ 
0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{4} -1c -c^2 \\
c &amp;=&amp; \frac{--1 \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 -4\times \frac{1}{4} \times -1}}{2\times-1} \\

  &amp;=&amp; \frac{\sqrt{2(\sqrt{2} +1)}}{1} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus the solution for (1 + 1i)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{1+1i} = \pm (\frac{\sqrt{2(\sqrt{2}+1)}}{2} +\frac{\sqrt{2(\sqrt{2}-1)}}{2} \times i)
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Find i&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp;=&amp; i \\
w &amp;=&amp; z^{1/3} 
w^3 &amp;=&amp; z \\
\\
w &amp;=&amp; (a + ib)\\
w^3 &amp;=&amp; (a^2 - b^2 + 2abi) \times (a + ib)\\

a &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus the solution for i&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt[3]{i} = \pm (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times i)
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Bases'''
# The following numbers are written in base 2. Write them out in base 10:
## 101011 (base 2) = 43 (base 10) =   2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;= 32+8+2+1
## 001101 = 13
## 10 = 2
## 011 = 3
# Write those numbers out in base 10 as if they were originally in base 5.
## 101011 (base 5) = 3256 (base 10) =  5&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 3125+125+5+1
## 001101 = 151
## 10 = 5 
## 011 = 6
# How many numbers could I write out in base 5 with only the first 4 columns?&lt;br/&gt;
:Answer: 625 = 5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (each new column multiplies the number of possibilities by 5)
# In computing, each 1 or 0 is called a ''bit''. They are stored in groups of 8. Each group is called a ''byte''. How many bytes are possible?&lt;br/&gt;
:Answer: 256 = 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;  (values from 00000000 through 11111111 binary, or 0 through 255 base 10)
# Question: When editing the bytes directly, writing out 10110001 is too long and hexadecimal is used instead (in this case, B1). How many digits of hexadecimal are needed to cover all possible bytes?&lt;br/&gt;
:Answer: 2 digits (16&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = number of possible 2-digit hexadecimal numbers = 256 = number of possible bytes)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[The Once and Future King]] - Book I: [[The Sword in the Stone]] - '''Chapter 1'''

==Plot summary==

Chapter 1 introduces us to [[Arthur (OaFK)|Wart]] and [[The Once and Future King/Kay|Kay]], [[Sir Ector (OaFK)|Sir Ector]], Kay's father, and [[Sir Grummore (OaFK)|Sir Grummore]], a visiting knight to Sir Ector's castle.

Sir Ector and Sir Grummore discuss the need for Kay and Art to be 'eddicated', that is, educated.  They decide that a tutor is required, and that one must be found via a quest.  

It is July, and hay-making season.  The entire castle goes to work in the field, with Sir Ector directing the operations.  A lengthy description is given of the hay-making process, and the roles the two boys play in it.  Wart loves hay-making, and is good at it.  Kay is not so good at it, but hates to be beaten, so works at it until exhaustion.  

A storm breaks and ends the days hay-making, at which point Kay and Wart decide to take [[Cully (OaFK)|Cully]], the castle's [[en:Goshawk|goshawk]], from The Mews and go [[en:Hawking|hawking]].  Wart is concerned as to whether Cully is in a fit state for hawking, as he is deep in the [[en:Moult|moult]]; Kay rashly overrules, however, and off they go.  Wart's fears were not unfounded, it turns out, as the chapter ends with Cully brooding away from his masters in a tree.

==Analysis==

'''Anachronisms''' - Sir Ector Guinevere and Grummermore Grummersum are drinking [[w:Port_wine|port]], a modern wine, as they discuss the need for an eddication.  [[w:T.H. White|White]] reveals that they are in fact drinking [[w:Metheglyn|metheglyn]], but asserts it is easier for the reader to get the feel if port is mentioned. Similarly, Sir Grummore is said to suggest sending the boys to [[w:Eton_College|Eton]] for their education, but White then notes that Sir Grummore's actually talking about a similar institution, as Eton wasn't founded until 1440. Kay and Wart go rabbit hunting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cooknav}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Cuisine of Japan]]

In Japanese cuisine, '''sushi''' (寿司, 鮨, 鮓) is vinegared rice, usually topped with other ingredients including fish (cooked or uncooked) and vegetables. Outside of Japan, sushi is sometimes misunderstood to mean the raw fish by itself, or even any fresh raw-seafood dishes. In Japan, sliced raw fish alone is called sashimi and is distinct from sushi, as sashimi is the raw fish component, not the rice component. The word sushi itself comes from an outdated grammatical form of a word that is no longer used in other contexts; literally, sushi means &quot;it's sour.&quot;

Sushi must contain rice, typically contains nori (and sometimes seaweed), and virtually always includes fillings or toppings such as of various types, such as seafood, chicken, tuna etc., the possibilities of which are endless.  Similar to Western appetizers (although sushi is often intended to be the main course), sushi should be served in a manner that will allow eating by hand, usually in a bite or two. Many types of sushi are individually made by the cook to the appropriate size or are cut by the cook to this size before serving.  Although sushi may be prepared in a wrap or roll format prior to serving, traditional ingredients lack the structural strength needed to allow them to be eaten by hand as an entire roll or wrap.     

Sushi, in its simplest forms, is made by first cooking rice, then cooling it, molding by it hand or in a mold and adding a topping, or wrapping the rice in nori and adding fillings to make a roll, using a bamboo mat to help, which is then cut into smaller pieces. Usually served cool and with soy sauce, sliced ginger, and [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]].  

Sushi can be eaten as served by the cook or dipped into (or, using sliced ginger as a 'brush', wiped with) soy sauce and then eaten, with additional wasabi added by the brave.  As a general rule, it is always appropriate to eat sushi by hand, unless it is obvious that you cannot avoid getting rice or other ingredients stuck to your fingers, in which case chopsticks should be used.

Much care is put into the creation of the dish and the many methods of preparing the food indicate the importance of appearance to the educated consumer.

==History==
Beginning as a method of [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickling]] [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] centuries ago, '''sushi''' has evolved into an artful, unique dining experience. In its earliest form, fish was placed between two wads of [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], producing a moderately complex chemical reaction as the fish fermented, helping to preserve it. Sometime between the 14th and 16th centuries, rice vinegar started to be added to the rice to help speed up the process which took several months. Around this time the rice also started to be consumed with the fish it was used to preserve. ''[[Cookbook:Nori|Nori]]'' (red algae [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] paper) was added about this period as a way to keep one's fingers from getting sticky, thus creating the first ancestor of modern 'makizushi', or rolled sushi.

Sometime in the mid to late 18th century, a restaurant in Edo (modern Tokyo) started serving sushi rice alone with thinly sliced fresh fish pressed into it.  This was the start of Edo-Mae sushi, which is also known as 'nigirizushi', or pressed sushi. 

Sometime after this, a chef took this one step further and eliminated the sushi rice all together: the birth of sashimi.  It is important to note that sashimi specifically refers to thinly sliced raw or mostly raw fish and shellfish.

It is hard to tell when exactly the wasabi and pickled ginger were added, but it is probable they came in with the Edo-Mae sushi, as this was when the focus of sushi became enjoying the taste of the exceedingly fresh fish, and the condiments heighten the experience.

==Types of Sushi==
Sushi types include ''makizushi'', ''nigirizushi'', ''oshizushi'', and ''inarizushi''.

===Makizushi===
Makizushi (''rolled sushi''), or maki for short, is the kind that is most common to North American consumers (see [[Cookbook:California Roll|California Rolls]]) as it is basically sushi layered on top of nori, rolled into a tube, and cut into thick slices.  Easy to make and even easier to mass produce, it has found a wide proliferation as a new form of fast food, but still manages to be found in Japanese restaurants that still respect the tradition.

===Nigirizushi===
Nigirizushi (''hand formed sushi''), or nigiri for short, is, as stated above, a hand-formed small bed of rice with an ingredient on top (ranging from [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]] or [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] to [[Cookbook:Eel|eel]] or [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]).  Nigiri sushi that is served without the rice is called ''sashimi''.  Gunkanmaki (''battleship roll or boat sushi'') is a nigirizushi where an oval piece of sushi rice is surrounded by nori and topped with a topping such as fish eggs.

===Oshizushi===
Oshizushi (''pressed sushi'') is similar to nigirizushi but it is formed by pressing with the aid of an oshibako, a wooden mold.  Generally, the topping is placed in the oshibako first, the rice is added on top, then the combination is pressed together with the oshibako top or lid.  After pressing, the sushi is removed and cut to serving sizes.

===Inarizushi===
Inarizushi (''stuffed sushi'') is generally a pocket or pouch containing the rice and other ingredients.  Materials used to make the pocket include tofu, bean curd, egg, and cabbage leaves.

===Sashimi===
Sashimi (basically sliced raw seafood, mostly fish without any rice) is often the most artistic form, with thin slices of fish and shellfish being formed into a range of different shapes, especially flowers.  While technically not sushi, sashimi is often grouped together with the different types of sushi.

===Saikuzushi===
Saikuzushi is an artistic type of sushi, which makes a beautiful image. It is quite difficult to make this, and also quite expensive when bought. Rice is tinted with different colors and later sliced to make an image. 

===Chirashizushi===
Chirashizushi, is scattered sushi with rice in a box or bowl and seaweed on top. Different kinds of seafood and fish are placed on top, including octopus, squid, tuna, alongside with chopped cucumbers and green onion. Chirashizushi has two main regional types, the version of Tokyo, and the Osaka Version.

===Edomae or Temakizushi===
Edomae, or Temakizushi, is one of the most common types of sushi, with rice and fish rolled up in seaweed. Crab, octopus, tuna, shrimp, and several other types of seafood is rolled up inside the rice. It is even found in convenience stores in Japan.

== Eating Sushi ==
An authentic sushi-eating experience can include [[Cookbook:Miso_Soup|miso soup]], [[Cookbook:Sushi/Maki|makizushi]] (sushi rolls), [[Cookbook:Sashimi|sashimi]] (pieces of fish with no rice), [[Cookbook:Sushi/Nigirizushi|nigirizushi]] and garnishes of [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]], [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] and pickled ginger. Hot, fresh, green tea is an excellent beverage to drink with your meal, as is beer or plain water. While sake can be consumed with sushi, because it is made from rice it is considered to be too much rice in one meal.

In Japan, sushi chefs will apply a small amount of wasabi to the appropriate types of sushi during preparation. For example, sushi that features its own unique sauce will be prepared sans wasabi so as not to compromise the flavor. Western sushi chefs may do this, but some may not apply wasabi to any sushi.

Sushi can be eaten with chopsticks or by hand; nigiri sushi in particular may be eaten by hand because the rice is packed lightly and may fall apart if eaten with chopsticks. 

Start your meal with simple miso soup but do not spend too much time on any one item as this is the proper [[wikipedia:Customs and etiquette of Japan#Eating and drinking|Japanese etiquette]]. Instead, rotate through your meal to appreciate the quality of each aspect. Many people start with a mild sushi, such as tamago (a sweet, cold omelette on rice), and end with a stronger taste at the end of the meal, like a darker fish. Between different items it is recommended that a piece of pickled ginger be eaten to cleanse the palate and ensure that none of the subtle flavours of the sushi is missed.

Enjoy!

==Serving Sushi==
There are different types of seafood used for sushi, and the most common ones are tuna, salmon, squid and octopus. Using expensive seaweed makes sushi taste much better. Expensive seaweed is darker in color, and is less likely to break when folded or rolled. Cheap seaweed is usually greenish in color. The type of soy sauce (shoyu) used also affects the taste of the sushi; the most commonly used brands are Kikkoman and Yamasa. Many people like to mix wasabi, which is a green coloured, spicy condiment with their shoyu, which makes it quite spicy and wakening.

===Condiments===
Sushi is generally served with
* [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]]
* green [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]] (a cheap wasabi substitute)
* gari ([[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]])
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* kabayaki sauce ([[Cookbook:eel_sauce|eel sauce]]) (often served on some sushi, may be used for dipping instead of soy sauce)

For the Wikimedia projects written in Vietnamese, ''ngày'' or ''hôm'' is usually included in the article, but is not part of the page title or link.
|}

Vietnamese does not give months, days of the week, or years special names. Rather, Vietnamese merely uses the number. For example, &quot;July 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2004&quot; would be written:

:''ngày 31 tháng 7 năm 2004'' '''or''' ''hôm 31 tháng 7 năm 2004''
:(literally, &quot;day 31 of month 7&quot;)

Similarly, &quot;Saturday,&quot; the seventh day of the week, is:

:''thứ 7''
:(literally, &quot;the seventh one&quot;)

The exception is &quot;Sunday,&quot; which in Vietnamese is ''Chủ nhật'' or ''Chúa nhật''. Also, &quot;January&quot; is either called ''tháng 1'' (''tháng một'') or ''tháng giêng''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rules for forming the feminine of adjectives are different from those for [[../Formation of the feminine in nouns|the noun]]

'''Regular inflection of the feminine.'''

If a word ends in a vowel, the feminine replaces that vowel by ''a:'' ''el libro rojo, la casa roja.'' If a word ends in a consonant, the feminine adds an ''a:'' ''el libro inglés, la casa inglesa.''

'''When adjectives are inflected'''

Adjectives are inflected or not depending on the ending of the masculine-gender form.
*''o:'' inflected. ''el libro nuevo/la casa nueva.'' Exception: ''el departamento piloto/la casa piloto''.
*''a:'' not inflected. ''el amigo barsa/la amiga barsa.'' (''Barsa'' is a slang term; a better example is sought.)
*(*)''e'':'' never inflected. ''el libro verde/la casa verde.''
*''ante:'' not inflected. ''el piojo cargante/la mosca cargante.''
*(*)''ente:'' never inflected. ''el alumno ausente/la alumna ausente''.
*Stressed vowel: not inflected. ''El libro café/la casa café''.
*(*)Consonant: not inflected, but see regular exceptions below. ''El libro azul/la casa azul.''
*''ín, ón'': inflected. ''El camello bailarín/la jirafa bailarina''. (*) Exception: ''el libro marrón/la casa marrón''.
*''or'': inflected. ''el cable conector/la cuerda conectora''. (*) Exceptions: comparatives such as ''mayor, menor, mejor, peor, anterior, poterior, superior, inferior.''

Adjectives of nationality ending in ''és'' are inflected: ''el libro portugués/la casa portuguesa.''

(*) indicates that the rule is different for adjectives and for nouns. For example: ''el superior/la superiora'', but ''el libro superior/la casa superior.''

[[Image:Tsukiji fish market thuna knife.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A tuna being filleted in Japan]]
'''Tuna''' are several species of ocean-dwelling fish in the family Scombridae. Unlike most ocean fish species, which have white flesh, the flesh of tuna is pink. This is because the tuna's muscle tissue has a higher oxygen storage capacity than other fish species.

Tuna is a popular seafood. Some varieties of tuna, such as the bluefin, are endangered because of overfishing, while others are part of well maintained fisheries, such as the bigeye or yellowfin, and are listed as a &quot;best choice&quot; on the Monterey Bay Aquarium's ''Seafood Watch''  [http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_regional.aspx program.]
Tuna's flavor and texture are preserved when it's seared on the outside but raw on the inside. In fact, beyond medium rare most tuna tastes like cat food. Exception is canned tuna.

Mercury levels are oftentimes relatively high in tuna, as they sit fairly high in the food chain and mercury is not metabolized by most animals, causing mercury to accumulate in predators. 

Types include:
*Bluefin, which can grow to 1,500 lb (680 kg).
*Yellowfin
*Albacore
*Bigeye
*Bonito, in some countries (&quot;tuna&quot; designation is disputed)

==An Entire Korean Wiki Project==
I am currently working on an entire Korean wiki project. It's still in it's starting stages. I have plans to make it the best, most extensive, and most clear way of learning Korean and Korean grammar. Anyone interested in joining aboard? I see a lot of dedicated people on here, but doesn't seem like much is getting done here these days.

http://www.koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/

The goal is to eventually to have explanations in English, Japanese and Chinese as those are the most the most common languages of people who study Korean.

==Korean lessons plans==
'''Attention contributors:''' please review or contribute to [[Korean/Courses plan]] before making significant changes to the structure of the courses and lessons in the Korean Wikibook. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 01:02, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

==Title change==
15-July-05 from Frank

Changed title of 'lessons' section because I think 'lessons' title doesn't fit in with the other sections which may be lessons too.

==Request for textbook==
Hello, can someone please add to the korean textbook? I'm trying to teach myself korean.

- There, I filled in a bit more of the lesson on colors and put in some Chinese characters, which might as well be in this textbook, after all, they are still part of the official language. - ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=218.53.194.44]218.53.194.44)

==Structure change==

도와드릴께요^^

I'll try to help, but to be honest I think there need to be some changes to the structure here. The 'conversation' section should perhaps be renamed 'lessons', and the grammar section should be incorporated into it. There need to be a lot more lessons... And 여보세요 doesn't count as advanced. Anyway, I hope no one is too offended if I change some things around. --[[User:Chamdarae|Chamdarae]] 14:29, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

: I agree that the grammar section should merge into the conversation section.  Let's begin that merger by completing [[Korean/Courses plan|the course plan]].  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 03:25, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

You spelled &quot;도와드릴께요&quot; wrong, it should be 도와드릴게요 :D

== Teaching how to read and write ==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Korean step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Korean than in English), common personal names, Korean words that have entered English, English words that are used in Korean, words that both Korean and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Korean, I'd be glad to help you. I can read it ok, though I hardly know any of the language. Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 17:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].

: The 4th Unilang Language Learning Month will most likely be about Korean (24 hours left to vote and Korean is in advance), so there will be a group of at least 20 people from all over the world looking to learn Korean online, starting early September. Even though I know that it's hard to write a lot until then, I'd like to try and at least give them some more help. I can't write anything about Korean grammar or the like, but I'll start [[Korean/Writing lessons plan]] in order to make a list of recognisable words that can be used for reading practise and I'd really appreciate it if others could contribute words to it too or make recordings. Thanks!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 09:25, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

== Mind if I do some work? ==

I was a student of Korean for a while and also lived in the country for two years.  I've tried to look for good 'learning korean' websites on the net, but have been met with great disappointment.  I'm at a somewhat high-intermediate to advanced level, but with a few major gaps in my vocabulary, but my grammar is sure up to par.  If anyone doesn't mind, I'd like to start a bit of an overhaul of this area, but keeping the same 10-lesson format.  The parts that I see need the most help are the beginner parts, such as how to write, read, and basic verb conjugation.  I'll start today, but if anyone has objections to the changes, please tell me and they or I can remove them and such.  Thanks!

(P.S. I'll register with a name soon, &quot;iamgravity&quot;).

*edit* Registered, and started up Korean Orthography, no stroke order yet! - [[User:Iamgravity|Iamgravity]] 03:49, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

*edit - Added an Essential pronounciation guide, still working on it.  Will do an advanced pronounciation guide with more obscure rules.  I have books as sources for this information, as well as stuff I learned in korea, do I need to cite that stuff? - [[User:Iamgravity|Iamgravity]] 05:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==

I propose that romanization in this book be limited to all but the lessons that specifically teach 허글, and perhaps a few of the most basic lessons. If one cannot read the script, one ought to go ahead and learn it, and if one can read the script, romanization doesn't help. --[[User:Tarnjp|Tarnjp]] 02:37, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

That seems sensible.  Similarly, there doesn't seem to be much reason to include hanja.  It seems more distracting than helpful and perhaps even confusing for English-speaking readers to whom this may be the first exposure to Korean.  The intro paragraph used to read something like this:

:In the Republic of Korea, the language is most often called 한국말 (韓國말, ''Han-gung-mal''), or more formally, 한국어 (韓國語, ''Han-gug-eo'') or 국어 (國語 ''Gug-eo''; literally &quot;national language&quot;).  In North Korea and Yanbian, the language is most often called 조선말 (朝鮮말, ''Chosŏnmal''), or more formally, 조선어 (朝鮮語, ''Chosŏnŏ'').

So, being bold, I removed the hanja and added links to the dictionary entries for each hangeul term.  The interested reader can then just click to see the hanja forms and etymology of each hangeul word.  OK? [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 20:24, 13 May 2007 (UTC)



== I'm back ==

I'm back after a whole year.  Noticed lesson one and two got uber upgrades.  I'll be starting from lesson three, and yes, I'll be minimizing the roman characters. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:72.129.224.160|72.129.224.160]] ([[User talk:72.129.224.160|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/72.129.224.160|contribs]]) 2007-06-26T19:24:27.&lt;/small&gt;

:Glad you're back.  Do you have a Wikibooks username?  Regardless, check out [[Korean/Courses plan#Conversation]].  It looks like some of the topics in lessons 1 and 2 should be shuffled into later lessons in order to cover the most important concepts first.  Or, just edit lesson 3 and things will be shuffled as we go.  :-)  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 20:30, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

::Yeah, I'm planning on something like, every two three lessons of conversation, there should be some type of list lesson.  If we do it that way, then numbers would be a fine third lesson, but still not sure.  In anycase, it needs to be revamped.  I'll wait for a reply before I start editing and meanwhile I'll compile a third conversation lesson as well as a number lesson.  BTW, I do have an account, it should be iamgravity.  Just too lazy to log on atm because I come home from work very late. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:72.129.224.160|72.129.224.160]] ([[User talk:72.129.224.160|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/72.129.224.160|contribs]]) 2007-06-28T07:53:47.&lt;/small&gt;

::: Coolness.  If you build out lesson three as the numbers lesson and we later decide it belongs elsewhere, we can always move it, so feel free to dig in.  :-)  If you want to help with [[Korean/Courses plan#Conversation|the lessons plan]] instead, go right ahead.

== Punctuation anyone? ==

I think we need to have lessons on punctuation or at least tell them that there are no punctuations in Korean if there are none. --'''''&amp;nbsp;[[User:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:125%;color:#00CC00&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#AAAAAA&quot;&gt;YSON&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;1991&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''''' 00:23, 4 December 2007 (UTC)
: Er, Korean punctuation rules are more or less the same as English. Albeit there are some minor differences (I don't recall seeing colon, semicolon, or various dashes (em-dash, en-dash, hyphen) in Korean writing), at least the uses of period and comma is more or less the same (er, no apostrophe either, since Koreans either don't shorten phrases, or *really* shorten them by something akin to acronym). Having said that, I don't know what the lesson would say ... other than that &quot;.&quot; corresponds to a full stop and &quot;,&quot; corresponds to a half stop. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 10:56, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

Korean does use colons, although it is common practice when typing in hangeul to leave a space before and after a colon. 12 July 2014

== Altaic ==

I have removed [[Template:Altaic languages]], since the inclusion of Korean in Altaic is not generally accepted.

See the discussion at [[Template talk:Altaic languages#Japanese and Korean]].

== Beginner Section needs editing ==

I'm planning on merging the Taxi and Public transportation chapters so that students can learn how to ask/give directions and handle other basic tasks like buying tickets and finding out schedules, etc.  The Medical and Body Parts chapters need to be merged as well. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scott Stinson|Scott Stinson]] ([[User talk:Scott Stinson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scott Stinson|contribs]]) 2008-06-06T09:10:04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: The &quot;Recreation / In a taxi&quot; chapter (at [[Korean/Lesson I5]]) was designated as a &quot;Beginner&quot; lesson, but &quot;public transportation&quot; chapter (at [[Korean/Lesson II4]]) is supposedly a &quot;High beginner&quot; chapter.  I suppose that's because complete beginners might be able to get around in a taxi, but it could take more language skills to purchase the right ticket for public transportation and to read the maps.  But, both of those lessons are far from complete, so if you think they might both work for complete beginners, feel free to merge them.  Whether you merge them or not, have fun building them out.  There's plenty of vocab to add and the whole thing should probably work more like a lesson than a simple phrase list. :-)  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] ([[User talk:Rodasmith|talk]]) 18:17, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

== Pronounciation ==

Is Revised-Romanization standard of these book? I'd like to contribute here.--[[User:Kwj2772|Kwj2772]] ([[User talk:Kwj2772|talk]]) 07:55, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

== Book Suggestion ==

I've been away from wikibooks for a few months, and recently decided to peek around.  I've been looking for a good public domain book for the Japanese book for quite some time.  I found some by the FSI back in the late 60s / early 70s.  Since it's a government derived work, it's not protected by copyright and placed into public domain.  However, there may be some slight issues with outdated vocabulary, so I would tread lightly.  [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 08:19, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

== Audio? ==

While ''a picture is worth a thousand words'', I would hazard that ''a soundbite is worth a thousand glyphs''.  The [[w:IPA|IPA]] is all well and good (and an [[w:India_Pale_Ale|India Pale Ale]] might be even better for some folks and situations), but a few snippets of audio recordings of the various conversation bits (or even just the hangul themselves for starters!) would go ever so much further.  -- Erik Anderson, [[Special:Contributions/67.182.137.135|67.182.137.135]] ([[User talk:67.182.137.135|talk]]) 08:39, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

I registered an account to say just this. If a native speaker could help out or if someone could cut together some public domain audio clips it would help out a lot! --[[User:Kaminix|Kaminix]] ([[User talk:Kaminix|talk]]) 12:53, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

: There don't seem to be any active contributors to this wikibook. Should you know any native speakers, feel free to try to recruit them. You could also try to post requests on language related message boards or something similar. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:49, 7 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Isomalt''' is produced by turning normal [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] into a chemical that the human body treats as a dietary fiber.  Because of this, it does not produce an insulin response and is safe for diabetics.  Isomalt is also undigestable by oral bacteria, reducing the damage they can cause to teeth and gums (and through remineralisation, it even helps to build dental enamel, thus reducing the formation of plaque).  Isomalt is a registered trademark of [http://palatinit.de Palatinit].

In cooking, isomalt can be substituted 1:1 for [[Cookbook:Sugar|granulated sugar]], and since it is made from sugar, it performs almost identically in most tasks.  This makes isomalt an ideal substitute for [[Cookbook:Sugar| sugar]] if you are cooking for diabetics, or are just trying to make low calorie food.

Isomalt is used in some processed foods, such as Quest bars. It is also used heavily in the art of pulled or blown sugar because it maintains a workable texture for longer, does not get as sticky, and has a stronger crystaline structure.

'''Rueda de Casino''' is a way of dancing Cuban [[w:Salsa (dance)|salsa]] where pairs form a circle (in Spanish, ''[[wikt:rueda|rueda]]'' means &quot;wheel&quot;), and partners frequently swap. A ''[[wikt:cantante|cantante]]'' (Spanish for &quot;singer&quot;) gives commands. This list is a quick lookup to remind yourself of the commands - click on the names of the moves to see more complete descriptions.

Please also help to make this wikibook educational and interesting, by adding new commands and editing the existing commands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">: Theresa,

: Hello :-) wasson

Just to start with a mention of appreciation of the task you are undertaking here with a GCSE textbook in electronic media, (especially on a Wiki). Having worked at UWIC in Teaching and Learning, I know how much work teachers have to do to produce such works, and to provide real learning value for the students.

To this end, I hope you will find some interventions (constructive criticisms and suggestions) useful in your project. Although I have not studied this subject since O Level Physics, Biology and Chemistry in 1987, I attempt continuous education and have read/watched much material on science in general over the passing years.

:Hence, to start, the photocopier.

During my years in secondary and later education, I was always disappointed when I found some earlier knowledge given to explain one lesson was later overturned (often completely contradicted) by a later lesson.

In the case of the photocopier, you appear to have given light some special properties (assuming that the students have not received preparatory lessons):

; '''Light carrying energy''' : At a point were the reader of your materials is yet away of light travelling in straight paths, and the effects of the primary methods of distortion - reflection and refraction. Later again we learn that light may be considered as a particle/wave with properties including 'carrying certain energies'&lt;br/&gt;'''''Suggestion'''''&lt;B&gt;:&lt;/B&gt; Avoid mentioning energy being carried by the light, and state that light has 'this effect' (accelorated discharge, but 'discharging' has not been discussed yet) on Statically Charged Surfaces.

; '''Angle of Reflection in the Stage 2 diagram''' : The light source appears to originate from Stage 1, and the angle of the emerging light does not have any similarity (it is supposed to have equivalency) to the angle of the origin. In other words, the image reflected on to the plate would be offset and divergent, magnified and elongated. Although we would not expect the student to know or appreciate this fact at this point of the course, the image shows three rays of light and the effects of a reflection - providing a (possible) first impression that may cause later confusion, (disappointing contradictory learning experiences).&lt;br/&gt;'''''Suggestion'''''&lt;B&gt;:&lt;/B&gt; Remove the light source and the arrows approaching the page, but leave the arrows from the page to the plate. The reflection will intuitively look like the effect of a mirror, without questions of what light is reaching the plate and from where.

; '''Pages Per Minute''' : A good modern photocopier would not use the process you describe, (they use digital processing and a laser to produce the positive charged, toner [hot]spots), and few are capable of 60ppm.&lt;br/&gt;'''''Suggestion'''''&lt;B&gt;:&lt;/B&gt; Revise to one page in less than five seconds.

Hope these help.

[[User:Ray Cherry|Ray]] 12:24, 24 May 2004 (UTC)

:Ray firstly thank you for you comments. I see you points about the diagram and will make the change you suggest to the picture. As for your other suggestions '''I''' am not going to impliment them, because '''you''' are. Just go ahead an edit the text. Don't be shy :-) I'm assuming you have not come here from wikipedia else you would not be so hesitant, but all books here are collaborative. I will not be any wayy offended if you edit my work. It's only a first draft, I'm hoping that lots of people will edit it until it becomes the best text book ever written, far better than any book written by only one or two authors. So please make any changes to this or any other page that you think will improve things. Don't worry about if I will like it or not, it's very easy to revert things back to the way they were anyway, so nothing you do can't be undone.

:What can I say? &quot;Yes Miss Knott.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Quid-pro-quo? Perhaps you could have a read through this work I have started,&lt;br/&gt;and provide some feedback: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Ray_Cherry/Conceptionary

[[User:Ray Cherry|Ray]] 22:41, 26 May 2004 (UTC)

:OK. Photocopier smelly speed adjustments completed. But the explanation of how light might assist the positively charged plate to loose its charge is going to require a change to the structure of the preceding page/section - '''Static Electricity (GCSE Science)'''.

===Ideal voltage sources===
[[File:Voltage Source.svg]]

:An ideal voltage source is a fundamental electronics component that creates a constant voltage between two points regardless of whatever else is connected to it.  Since it is ideal, some circuit configurations are not allowed, such as short circuits, which would create infinite current.  (I = V / 0)

: A water analogy would be a pump with pressure sensors on both sides.  The ''difference'' in pressure between the in port and out port is constantly measured, regardless of the absolute pressure of each side, and the pump speed is adjusted so that the pressure difference stays constant.

: ''Real'' voltage sources, such as batteries, power supplies, piezoelectric disks, generators, steam turbines, wall outlets, etc. have an internal source impedance (in series with the ideal voltage source), which is very important to understand.

===Ideal current sources===
[[File:Current Source.svg]]
: An ideal current source is an electronics component that creates a constant current through a section of circuit, regardless of whatever else is connected to it.  Since it is ideal, some circuit configurations are not allowed, such as open circuits, which would create an infinite voltage.

: A water analogy would be a pump with a flow meter.  It measures the amount of water flowing by per unit time and changes the speed of the pump so that the current flow is constant.

: ''Real'' current sources, such as batteries, power supplies, piezoelectric disks, generators, etc. have an internal source impedance (in parallel with the source), which is very important to understand.

: Real sources generally behave more like voltage sources than current sources, because the internal impedance in series is very low.  A current source can be created from a voltage source with a circuit such as a ''current mirror''.

===Dependent Sources===

: A dependent source is either a voltage or a current source which is dependent upon another value within the circuit, usually another voltage or current.  Typically, these are used in circuit modeling and analysis.

There are four main types of such sources.  

====Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)====

: This is a voltage source whose value is controlled by another voltage elsewhere in the circuit.  Its output will typically be given as &lt;math&gt;V_o=AV_c&lt;/math&gt;, where A is a gain term and V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;is a control voltage.

: An example of a VCVS may be an idealized [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier amplifier], where A is the gain of the amplifier.

====Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS)====

: This is a voltage source whose value is controlled by a current elsewhere in the circuit.  Its output is typically given as &lt;math&gt;V_o=AI_c&lt;/math&gt;, where A is a gain term and I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is a control current.

====Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS)====

: This is a current source whose value is controlled by a voltage elsewhere in the circuit.  Its output is typically given as &lt;math&gt;I_o=AV_c&lt;/math&gt;, where A is a gain term and V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is a control voltage.

====Current-controlled current source (CCCS)====

: This is a current source whose value is controlled by a current elsewhere in the circuit.  Its output is typically given as &lt;math&gt;I_o=AI_c&lt;/math&gt;, where A is a gain term and I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is a control current.

: An example of a CCCS is an idealized [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor bipolar junction transistor], which may be thought of as a small current controlling a larger one.  Specifically the base current, I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the control and the collector current I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the output.

===Switch===

: A switch is a mechanical device that connects or disconnects two parts of a circuit.

[[File:Closed Switch.svg|150px]]&lt;br/&gt;
: A switch is a short circuit when it is on.

[[File:Open Switch.svg|150px]]&lt;br/&gt;
And it is a open circuit when it is off.

: When you turn a switch on it completes a circuit that allows current to flow.  When you turn the switch off it creates an air gap (depending on the type of switch), and since air is an insulator no current flows.  

: A switch is a device for making or breaking an electric circuit.

: Usually the switch has two pieces of metal called contacts that touch to make a circuit, and separate to break the circuit. The contact material is chosen for its resistance to corrosion, because most metals form insulating oxides that would prevent the switch from working. Sometimes the contacts are plated with noble metals. They may be designed to wipe against each other to clean off any contamination. Nonmetallic conductors, such as conductive plastic, are sometimes used. The moving part that applies the operating force to the contacts is called the actuator, and may be a rocker, a toggle or dolly, a push-button or any type of mechanical linkage.

====Contact Arrangements====

: Switches can be classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. Some contacts are normally open until closed by operation of the switch, while normally closed contacts are opened by the switch action. A switch with both types of contact is called a changeover switch.

: The terms pole and throw are used to describe switch contacts. A pole is a set of contacts that belong to a single circuit. A throw is one of two or more positions that the switch can adopt. These terms give rise to the following abbreviations.

: [[Image:Electronics_Switches.PNG]]

* S (single), D (double).
* T (throw), CO (changeover).
* CO = DT.

(single|double) pole ((single|double) throw|changeover)

* '''SPST''' = single pole single throw, a simple on-off switch.
* '''SPDT''' = single pole double throw, a simple changeover or on-off-on switch.
* '''SPCO''' = single pole changeover, equivalent to SPDT.
* '''DPST''' = double pole single throw, equivalent to two SPST switches controlled by a single mechanism.
* '''DPDT''' = double pole double throw, equivalent to two SPDT switches controlled by a single mechanism.
* '''DPCO''' = double pole changeover, equivalent to DPDT. 

: Switches with larger numbers of poles or throws can be described by replacing the &quot;S&quot; or &quot;D&quot; with a number.

====Biased Switches====
: A biased switch is one containing a spring that returns the actuator to a certain position. The &quot;on-off&quot; notation can be modified by placing parentheses around all positions other than the resting position. For example, an (on)-off-(on) switch can be switched on by moving the actuator in either direction away from the centre, but returns to the central off position when the actuator is released.

: The momentary push-button switch is a type of biased switch. This device makes contact when the button is pressed and breaks when the button is released.

====Special Types====
: Switches can be designed to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (the float switch), the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (the limit switch or microswitch).

: The mercury tilt switch consists of a blob of mercury inside a glass bulb. The two contacts pass through the glass, and are shorted together when the bulb is tilted to make the mercury roll on to them. The advantage of this type of switch is that the liquid metal flows around particles of dirt and debris that might otherwise prevent the contacts of a conventional switch from closing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Van Dwelling|How to live full time in your car, truck, or van}}


Welcome to the Van Dwelling book.  This book will cover all the information you will need to successfully live in your van or other vehicle on a part-time or full-time basis.  Let's start out with a few reasons why someone would ''want'' to live in their vehicle in the first place.

==Why live in your van full time?==

''Save money on rent.'' 

Housing costs take up the largest portion of most people's budgets.   If you live in an expensive area, such as San Francisco or New York, housing costs can take up 50% or more of your total income.  If you live in a van, you can slash housing costs dramatically.  Even in cities like San Francisco or New York, it's possible to find a place to park your vehicle for free.  For example,   And even if you decide to rent a space, the costs are low, and need not be more than $100.00/month.  

''Save money on property taxes.''

No property, no property taxes.  Even if you still want to own a traditional home, you could buy an inexpensive home in a small community far from the city center.  You could then live and work in the van in the city during the week, then commute to your place in the country on the weekends.    Alternatively, you could live in your van full-time, until you save up enough to buy a house

''Travel.''

What do you want to do when you retire?  Many people will say &quot;I'd really like to travel.&quot;   But why wait until you're too old and decrepit to travel?  Vans can be parked almost anywhere.  If you get tired of where you're living, all you have to do is put the van into gear, and go.  You can follow the seasons, follow the band, follow your whims.  

''Live your dreams.''

Many people say &quot;If I only had enough money I'd [write a screenplay, take acting lessons, travel].&quot;  Then they spend half their income paying rent, paying utility bills, buying furniture, and all the other accoutrements of fixed living.  If you live in a van, most of those expenses can be dramatically reduced or eliminated.  The money that would've gone to a house or car payment, could then be spent on making your dream a reality.  

''See your friends.''

As people have become more mobile, family and friends are often spread out over the country.  Some friends/family you never see except at reunions or weddings.  With a van, you can visit your far-flung friends much more often, and you can bet they'll always have big smiles on their faces when your park your van in front of their house.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Although I haven't got a VW - I bought [How to Convert Volkswagen Bus or Van to Camper] and it's brilliant. I have three books on van converting and this is definately the best. It's given me ideas for making my own high top. selecting the right upholstery materials and it's given me the confidence to do the whole conversion myself.&quot;

__NOTOC__
==Reformulating Newton==

In the last chapter we saw how to reformulate Newton's laws as a set of second order ordinary differential equations using arbitrary coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}-
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

It is often far easier to solve a problem by starting with the Lagrangian than by explicitly using Newton's laws. The Lagrangian is also more useful for theoretical analysis.

However, the Lagrangian approach is not the only useful way to reformulate Newton. There is a second, related, approach which is also highly useful for analysis; namely, writing the equations of motion as a set of first order ordinary differential equations in a particularly natural way.

To do this we will use a standard technique, familiar from your calculus studies.

==Derivation==

Consider the function

:&lt;math&gt;H(q,p,t)=\dot{q}_i p_i -L(q, \dot{q}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the generalised coordinates, the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are a set of new variables whose meaning we will soon see, ''H'' is to be a function of the ''p''&amp;lsquo;s and ''q''&amp;lsquo;s alone, and the summation convention is being used.

Then we have 

:&lt;math&gt;dH=\dot{q}_i dp_i + p_i d\dot{q}_i 
-\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} d\dot{q}_i 
-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} dq_i -\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} dt \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

but, since ''H'' is a function of the ''p''&amp;lsquo;s and ''q''&amp;lsquo;s alone we can also write

:&lt;math&gt;dH=\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}dq_i + 
\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}dp_i + \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}dt \quad (2)
&lt;/math&gt;

For these two equations to both be true the coefficients of the differentials must be equal.

Equation (2) does not contain a term in &lt;math&gt;d\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt;, so the coefficient of that term in equation (1) must be zero. I.e, 

:&lt;math&gt;p_i=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives us a definition of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Using this in Lagrange's equations gives

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_i=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

and equation (1) simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;dH=\dot{q}_i dp_i - \dot{p}_i dq_i  
-\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} dt&lt;/math&gt;

A comparison of coefficients with equation (2) now gives the desired set of first order equations for the motion,
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i=\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \quad 
 \dot{p}_i=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

These are called ''Hamilton's equations'' and ''H'' is called the ''Hamiltonian.

==Physical meaning of H and p== 
To see what ''H'' and the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s actually are, let's consider a few typical cases.

''First,'' let's look at a free particle, one subject to no forces. This will let us see what the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s mean, physically. 

If we use Cartesian coordinates for the free particle, we have

:&lt;math&gt;L = T=\frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2+  \dot{y}^2+  \dot{z}^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are the differential of this with respect to the velocities.

:&lt;math&gt;p_x=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}=m \dot{x} \quad
p_y=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}}=m \dot{y} \quad
p_z=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}}=m \dot{z} &lt;/math&gt;

These are the components of the momentum vector.

If we use cylindrical coordinates, we have

:&lt;math&gt;L = T=\frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{r}^2+  r^2\dot{\theta}^2+  \dot{z}^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;p_r=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}}=m \dot{r} \quad
p_{\theta}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}}=m r^2 \dot{\theta} \quad
p_z=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}}=m \dot{z} &lt;/math&gt;

This time, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of momentum is the ''z'' direction, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the radial momentum, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular momentum, which we've previously seen is the equivalent of momentum for rotation.

Since, in these familiar cases, the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are momenta, we generalise and call the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s ''conjugate momenta''.

Note that from Hamilton's equations, we see that if ''H'' is independent of some coordinate, ''q'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_q=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

so the momentum conjugate to ''q'' is conserved. This connection between conservation laws and coordinate independence lies at the heart of much physics.

''Secondly'', to see the physical meaning of ''H'', we'll consider a particle moving in a potential ''V'', described using Cartesian coordinates.

This time the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L= T-V = \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2+  \dot{y}^2+  \dot{z}^2 \right)-V(x,y,z)
&lt;/math&gt;

We find that the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are 

:&lt;math&gt;p_x=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}=m \dot{x} \quad
p_y=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}}=m \dot{y} \quad
p_z=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}}=m \dot{z} &lt;/math&gt;

so, again, they are the momenta

Now lets calculate ''H''.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
H &amp; = &amp;  \dot{x}p_x+ \dot{y}p_y+ \dot{y}p_y &amp; - &amp; L &amp; &amp;\\
 &amp; = &amp; m  \left( \dot{x}^2+  \dot{y}^2+  \dot{z}^2 \right) &amp; 
- &amp; \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2+  \dot{y}^2+  \dot{z}^2 \right) &amp; + &amp; V\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2+  \dot{y}^2+  \dot{z}^2 \right) &amp; &amp; &amp; + &amp; V\\
&amp; = &amp;  T &amp;  &amp; &amp; + &amp; V \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so ''H'' is the total energy, written as a function of the position and momentum.

This is not always true, but it will be true for all common systems which conserve energy.

In general, if we know how the energy of a systems depends on speeds and positions, we know everything about the system.

Physicists will often start work on a problem by writing down an expression for ''H'', or ''L'', and never bother calculating the actual forces.

==Deeper meaning==

If we compare Hamilton's equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i=\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \quad 
 \dot{p}_i=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt;

with the equations of geometrical optics.

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i=\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k_i} \quad 
 \dot{k}_i=-\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

we see that both sets of equations have the same form.

If we made a substitution of the form,

:&lt;math&gt;H=\alpha \omega \quad p=\alpha k &lt;/math&gt;

for any &amp;alpha;, the two sets of equations would become identical.

Now, geometrical optics is an approximation to the full solution of any wave equation, valid when the wavelength is small.

Since classical mechanics is just like geometrical optics, classical mechanics could also be small wavelength approximation to a more accurate wave theory.

This is not a proof, ''could be'' is not the same as ''is'', but it does show that classical mechanics is compatible with wave theories, contrary to intuition. 

We will see later that this is not a coincidence, classical mechanics really is a small  wavelength approximation to a more accurate wave theory, namely quantum mechanics, and that, in that theory, the energy of matter waves is proportional to frequency and the momentum to wave number, just as the substitution above requires.

Hamilton's equations can also be used to construct a mathematical gadget, called a Poisson bracket, which lets us write the equations of classical mechanics in a way which makes the connections with quantum mechanics even clearer, but an explanation of how would be beyond the scope of this book.
&lt;!--A tease, but it should encourage the reader to look deeper --&gt; 

Since classical mechanics is just like geometrical optics, there should be an analog to Fermat's principle, that light takes the quickest path, and there is.

Where light takes the quickest path from ''a'' to ''b'', matter takes the path of ''least action'', where the action is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b L(x,\dot{x},t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proved that this integral takes extremal values if and only if the system obeys Lagrange's equations. Saying matter takes the path of least action is equivalent to saying it obeys Lagrange's equations, or Newton's laws.

Furthermore, it turns out that in general relativity, the action is proportional to the time taken, so matter is also really taking the quickest path between two points.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Substitution Cipher''' is similar to a [[../Caesar cipher/]], but instead of using a constant shift left or right, the plain alphabets and the cipher alphabets are mixed arbitrarily.

For example:

 Plain Alphabet:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 Cipher Alphabet: Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A

With the above, the Plain text &quot;This is a sample&quot; would encrypt to &quot;Gsrh rh z hznkov.&quot; This particular substitution cipher, which relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards, is known as an [[Cryptography/Atbash cipher|atbash cipher]].

With Substitution Ciphers, the secret is in the mapping between the plain and cipher alphabets.  However, there are several analytical techniques to help break these ciphers with only the ciphertext.  See [[../Frequency analysis/]]

==Solving substitution ciphers==
English-language ciphers be solved using principles such as these:
*Single-letter words are almost always A or I.
*As [[w:Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe]] points out in ''[[w:The Gold Bug|The Gold Bug]]'', &quot;E predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.&quot;
*Apostrophes are generally followed by S, T, D, M, LL, or RE.
*Repeating letter patterns may be common letter groups such as TH, SH, RE, CH, TR, ING, ION, and ENT.
*Double letters are most likely to be LL, followed in frequency by EE, SS, OO, and TT (and on to less commonly seen doubles).
*Two-letter words almost always have one vowel and one consonant. The five most common two-letter words, in order of frequency, are [[wiktionary:of|OF]], [[wiktionary:to|TO]], [[wiktionary:in|IN]], [[wiktionary:is|IS]], and [[wiktionary:it|IT]].
*The most common three-letter words, in order of frequency, are [[wiktionary:the|THE]], [[wiktionary:and|AND]], [[wiktionary:for|FOR]], [[wiktionary:was|WAS]], and [[wiktionary:his|HIS]].
*The most common four-letter word is THAT. An encrypted word beginning and ending with the same letter is likely to be [[wiktionary:that|THAT]]. Others are [[wiktionary:aqua|AQUA]], [[wiktionary:area|AREA]], [[wiktionary:aura|AURA]], [[wiktionary:barb|BARB]], [[wiktionary:blab|BLAB]], [[wiktionary:blob|BLOB]], [[wiktionary:boob|BOOB]], [[wiktionary:bulb|BULB]], [[wiktionary:chic|CHIC]], [[wiktionary:dead|DEAD]], [[wiktionary:DEED|deed]], [[wiktionary:died|DIED]], [[wiktionary:dyed|DYED]], [[wiktionary:EASE|ease]], [[wiktionary:EDGE|edge]], [[wiktionary:else|ELSE]], [[wiktionary:fief|FIEF]], [[wiktionary:gang|GANG]], [[wiktionary:gong|GONG]], [[wiktionary:hash|HASH]], [[wiktionary:hath|HATH]], [[wiktionary:hush|HUSH]], [[wiktionary:kick|KICK]], [[wiktionary:lull|LULL]], [[wiktionary:maim|MAIM]], [[wiktionary:neon|NEON]], [[wiktionary:noon|NOON]], [[wiktionary:noun|NOUN]], [[wiktionary:onto|ONTO]], [[wiktionary:orzo|ORZO]], [[wiktionary:peep|PEEP]], [[wiktionary:pimp|PIMP]], [[wiktionary:plop|PLOP]], [[wiktionary:pomp|POMP]], [[wiktionary:prep|PREP]], [[wiktionary:prop|PROP]], [[wiktionary:pulp|PULP]], [[wiktionary:pump|PUMP]], [[wiktionary:rear|REAR]], [[wiktionary:roar|ROAR]], [[wiktionary:says|SAYS]], [[wiktionary:seas|SEAS]], [[wiktionary:sees|SEES]], [[wiktionary:tact|TACT]], [[wiktionary:tart|TART]], [[wiktionary:tent|TENT]], [[wiktionary:tilt|TILT]], [[wiktionary:tint|TINT]], [[wiktionary:toot|TOOT]], [[wiktionary:tort|TORT]], [[wiktionary:tuft|TUFT]], [[wiktionary:urdu|URDU]], and [[wiktionary:whew|WHEW]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''One Time Pad''' (OTP) is the only potentially unbreakable encryption method.  Plain text encrypted using an OTP ''cannot'' be retrieved without the encrypting key. However, there are several key conditions that must be met by the user of a one time pad cipher, or the cipher can be compromised.

* The key must be random and generated by a non-deterministic, non-repeatable process. Any key generated by an algorithm will not work. The security of the OTP relies on the randomness of the key. Unfortunately, the randomness of a key cannot be proved.
* The key must never be reused.  Use of the same key to encrypt different messages, no matter how trivially small, compromises the cipher.
* The key must not fall in the hands of the enemy.  This may seem obvious, but it points to the weakness of system in that you must be able to transmit large amounts of data to the reader of the pad. Typically, one time pad cipher keys are sent via diplomatic pouch.

A typical one time pad system works like this:
Generate a long fresh new random key.
XOR the plaintext with the key to create the ciphertext.
To decrypt the ciphertext, XOR it with the original key.
The system as presented is thus a symmetric and [[cryptography/Symmetric Ciphers#Reciprocal Ciphers | reciprocal cipher]].
Other functions (e.g., addition modulo n) could be used to combine the key and the plaintext to yield the ciphertext, although the resulting system may not be a reciprocal cipher.

If the key is random and never re-used, an OTP is provably unbreakable.  Any ciphertext can be decrypted to any message of the same length by using the appropriate key.  Thus, the actual original message cannot be determined from ciphertext alone, as all possible plaintexts are equally likely. This is the only cryptosystem for which such a proof is known.

The OTP is extremely simple to implement.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.infoanarchy.org/en/One-Time_Pad_Cryptosystem Infoanarchy wiki: One-Time Pad Cryptosystem]
(mirror:
[https://web.archive.org/web/20131117135456/http://www.infoanarchy.org/en/One-Time_Pad_Cryptosystem])
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are limitations. Re-use the key and the system becomes extremely weak; it can be broken with pencil and paper. Try to build a &quot;one-time-pad&quot; using some algorithm to generate the keys and you don't have a one-time-pad, you have a [[stream cipher]]. There are some very secure stream ciphers, but people who do not know one from a one-time pad are probably not able to design one. It is unfortunately fairly common to see weak stream ciphers advertised as unbreakable one-time pads.

Also, even if you have a well-implemented OTP system and your key is kept secure, consider an attacker who knows the plaintext of part of a message. He can then recover that part of the key and use it to encrypt a message of his own. If he can deliver that instead of yours, you are in deep trouble.

== Example ==
First, an OTP is selected for the plaintext:

 Preshared Random Bits = &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;101001001010101011101&lt;/span&gt;0010000101011110101001110100011
            &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Plain text = 110101010101010010100&lt;/span&gt;
    Length(Plain Text) = 21
               Key(21) = &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;101001001010101011101&lt;/span&gt;

{{Wikipedia | Padding (cryptography) }}
The example indicates that the plaintext is not always the same length as the key material.  This can be handled by methods such as:
*appending a terminator to the plaintext before encryption, and terminating the cyphertext with random bits.
*prepending the length and a preamble terminator to the plaintext, and terminating with random bits.
Such signaling systems (and possibly the plaintext encoding method) must be designed so that these terminators are not mistaken for plaintext.  For this example, therefore, it is assumed the plaintext already contains endpoint/length signaling.

For increasingly long plaintext/key pair lengths, the [[w:cross-correlation|cross-correlation]] gets closer to zero.

===Encryption===
 Key(21)    = &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;101001001010101011101&lt;/span&gt;
 Plaintext  = &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;110101010101010010100&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;bitwise    &lt;u&gt;|||||||||||||||||||||&lt;/u&gt;
 cyphertext = &lt;span style=&quot;color:green;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;011100011111111001001&lt;/span&gt;

For increasingly long plaintext/cyphertext pair lengths, the [[w:cross-correlation|cross-correlation]] also gets closer to zero.

===Decryption===

 Preshared Random Bits = &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;101001001010101011101&lt;/span&gt;0010000101011110101001110100011
            cyphertext = &lt;span style=&quot;color:green;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;011100011111111001001&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;bitwise    &lt;u&gt;|||||||||||||||||||||&lt;/u&gt;
            &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Plain text = 110101010101010010100&lt;/span&gt;


An astute reader might observe that the decryptor needs to know the length of the plaintext in actual practice.  This is done by decrypting the cyphertext as a bitstream (i.e. xor each bit as it is read), and observing the stream until the end-of-plaintext ruleset is satisfied by the signals prepended/appended to the plaintext.

== Making one-time pads by hand ==
[[Image:Scrabble tiles en.jpg|right|thumb|A full English-language Scrabble tile set. See [[Scrabble letter distributions]] for other languages.]]

One-time pads were originally made without the use of a computer and this is still possible today.  The process can be tedious, but if done correctly and the pad used only once, the result is unbreakable.

There are two components needed to make a one-time pad: a way to generate letters at random and a way to record two copies of the result. The traditional way to do the latter was to use a [[w:typewriter]] and [[w:carbon paper]]. The carbon paper and [[w:typewriter ribbon]] would then be destroyed since it is often possible to recover the pad data from them. As typewriters have become scarce, it is also acceptable to hand write the letters neatly in groups of five on two part [[w:carbonless copy paper]] sheets, which can be purchased at office supply stores. Each sheet can given a serial number or some other unique marking.

Historically, the key material for manual one-time pads was distributed as a pad of many small pages of paper.
Each small page typically had a series of 5-digit groups, each digit randomly selected from 0 to 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirk&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A one-time pad set consists of two identical pads.
Some writers refer to the two as &quot;two identical originals&quot;, to emphasize that no copies should ever be made of the key material.&lt;ref name=&quot;erolet&quot; /&gt;

Traditionally two-way communication requires two pad sets (a total of 4 pads):
One person gets the &quot;IN&quot; pad of one set, and the &quot;OUT&quot; pad of the other set.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirk_manual&quot; /&gt;

Each small page typically contains 50 groups of 5 random decimal digits 0...9, enough for one normal message, and a unique &quot;page number&quot; of five digits.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirk_manual&quot; &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A conversion table is used to convert the letters of the plaintext message to numbers, and the numbers of the decoded message back to letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;anonymous_pi&quot; /&gt;
Perhaps the simplest conversion table is A=01, B=01, ... Z=26,
but historically some sort of straddling checkerboard was usually used,
such as

etc.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/table.htm &quot;Checkerboard Variations&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The key material for a one-time pad was sometimes written as 50 groups of 5 random letters A...Z.&lt;ref name=&quot;crypto_museum&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The key material for cryptograpic machines, including one-time pad systems, was often punched in a binary code on long, narrow paper tape -- a &quot;one time tape&quot; OTT.&lt;ref name=&quot;crypto_museum&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=== letter tiles ===

The simplest way to generate random letters in the Roman alphabet is to obtain 26 identical objects with a different letter of the alphabet marked on each object. Tiles from the game [[w:Scrabble]] can be used, as long as only one of each letter is selected.  Kits for making name charm bracelets are another possibility. One can also write the letters on 26 otherwise identical coins with a marking pen. The objects are placed in a box or cup and shaken vigorously, then one object is withdrawn and its letter is recorded. The object is returned to the box and the process is repeated.

=== 10-sided dice ===
Another way to make one time pads is to use [[w:ten-sided dice]].  One can generate random number groups by rolling several ten-sided dice at a time and recording a group of decimal digits -- one decimal digit from each die -- for each roll.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirk_manual&quot; /&gt; This method will generate random code groups much faster than using Scrabble tiles.  The plaintext message is converted into numeric values with A =01, B =02 and so on. The resulting numeric values are encrypted by adding digits from the one time pads using [[modular arithmetic|non-carrying addition]]. One can then either transmit the numeric groups as is, or use the straddling checkerboard to convert the numbers back into letters and transmit that result.

=== 6-sided dice ===
Another way to make one time pads is to use 6-sided dice.&lt;ref&gt;

It is possible to generate random decimal digits (to make a traditional decimal one-time pad) using 6-sided dice.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirk_manual&quot; /&gt;

If the message is converted into two digit [[w:Senary|base-6]] numbers, then ordinary [[w:Dice#Ordinary_dice|six-sided dice]] can be used  to generate the random digits in a one time pad. Digits in the pad would be added modulo-6 to the digits in the plaintext message (again without carry), and subtracted modulo 6 from the ciphertext to decrypt. For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|+ Table for converting messages to base-6
|-
| PT || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9  
|-style=&quot;background: aqua&quot;
| CT || 00 || 01 || 02 || 03 || 04 || 05 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13
|-
| PT || A || B || C || D || E || F || G || H || I || J || K || L || M 
|-style=&quot;background: aqua&quot;
| CT || 14 || 15 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 30 || 31 || 32 || 33 || 34
|-
| PT || N || O || P || Q || R || S || T || U || V || W || X || Y || Z  
|-style=&quot;background: aqua&quot;
| CT || 35 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44 || 45 || 50 || 51 || 52 || 53 || 54 || 55
|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|+ Table for converting messages to base-6
|-
|    || || right || digit
|-
| left digit
|-style=&quot;background: aqua&quot;
|    || x0 || x1 || x2 || x3 || x4 || x5
|-
| 0x ||  0 ||  1 ||  2 ||  3 ||  4 ||  5
|-
| 1x ||  6 ||  7 ||  8 ||  9 ||  A ||  B
|-
| 2x ||  C ||  D ||  E ||  F ||  G ||  H
|-
| 3x ||  I ||  J ||  K ||  L ||  M ||  N
|-
| 4x ||  O ||  P ||  Q ||  R ||  S ||  T
|-
| 5x ||  U ||  V ||  W ||  X ||  Y ||  Z
|}

Using this table, &quot;Wikipedia&quot; would convert to 52 30 32 30 41 22 21 30 14.  If the pad digits were 42 26 21 35 32 34 22 62 43, the ciphertext would be 34 50 53 05 13 50 43 32 51.  (Note that 6 = 0  modulo 6).

== Key Exchange ==

In order to use this algorithm, each party must possess the same random key. This typically involves meeting the other party in person or using a trusted courier. Other methods are sometime proposed, such as or both users to have identical devices that generate the same semi-random numbers, however these methods are essentially [[w:stream cipher]]s and are not covered by the security proof of one time pads.

Is there maybe an option of linking to a dictionary to add the various names of plants, diseases and insects in several languages??


If so, I've got a lot to add to this (mainly biological info).
Finding out the translations of all is much nicer if I can add them in a dictionary for all to see ;)


anyone, please let me know.

== Convert to Wiki ==

Dear author. I've seen you did a lot of work in copying Bailey's (1858-1954) [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9550 Manual of Gardening] book into Wiki. I would suggest, you put the original title and author's name more prominently on the first page (that it is a ''historic'' book of gardening. Also, please use Wiki markup in the chapters.. for example &lt;nowiki&gt;== section ==&lt;/nowiki&gt; for different sections. Thanks --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:35, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:It also needs an awful lot of updating - getting the terminology and scientific names up to date, and conversion to standard international metric measurements (in particular to get rid of that awful archaic Fahrenheit cr@p) - before it can be considered a useful item to refer to - [[User:82.39.130.135|82.39.130.135]] 16:44, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Use this as a basis for something practical? ==

I think it's a good idea for Wikibooks to have a gardening manual - it's a companion to the [[Cookbook]] - but this at present isn't it.

Well done for uploading this, but I think we should try to convert it into something more practical and less historical. I mean, have you read the entry on garlic? It can only just restrain itself from calling garlic filthy foreign muck! I'm changing that, and soon. The framework is something we can use but we need to encourage work on the entries.

[[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 10:35, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah, that's wrong, unfortunately. We can still call garlic '''putrid and revolting''' though. That ought to do. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

==Cross-referencing==

I've just created the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{gardeningpar|Whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in en.wikipedia.org for your cross-referencing pleasure. Cheers. --[[User:Bleh fu|bleh fu]] [[User talk:Bleh fu|&lt;small&gt;talk fu&lt;/small&gt;]] 20:19, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Link: [[w:Template:gardeningpar]] --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:09, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

== move to Garden? ==

That would save 3 keystrokes whenever I don't have the prefix ready to paste. &quot;Gardening&quot; would of course redirect to &quot;Garden&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

== maybe start over ==

This is awful. We could just delete it. A fresh start would really help I think. The book has and/or suffers from:

*needlessly complex wording
*big meandering blatherings
*generally obsolete tools, like horses
*obsolete ideas, like selling your herbs to the local store
*generally non-wiki style
*a &quot;completed&quot; or &quot;finished&quot; feel that is uninviting for editing
*a &quot;personal opinion&quot; feel that is uninviting for editing

As evidence, the book has been sitting this way for ages and is not getting fixed.

Probably this should be two separate books anyway. You can make a productive garden, or useless decorative nonsense. The two are very different.
The useless decorative nonsense could go in a [[Landscaping]] book.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:55, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

== Feeling a bit daunted... ==

I was surprised and happy to find this book here, then saw the non-wikied problems. I'm not sure whether to work from what's here, or start over? I do think a wiki encyclopedia of garden would be nice to have on wikibooks. (Gardening &quot;encyclopedias&quot; are mostly how-to, so better here than on the 'pedia, perhaps (with lots of crosslinking, of course). I am opening a category for gardening... a few friends and I want to write some books on the subject. I assume these books should be new projects, not edits of this book. (Are there project pages on wikibooks? See [[w: Wikipedia:WikiProject_Horticulture_and_Gardening|The wikiproject on horticulture and gardening]]. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 12:26, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:No, do not work from this book. See '''[[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Gardening]]'''. The consensus so far is that we will move the public domain text to Wikisource, then delete this book. You can start a different horticulture and gardening book if you want. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:47, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

== Merge, new book, etc. ==

Because of the odd nature of this book (seems to be mostly a transcription of an outdated text), I think it's better to work on a new one. I've made a small start with [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]], which will need some formatting decisions (multivolume?, what goes in each volume?, etc.). Probably best to just leave this one be and use the original version as source material when appropriate. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 16:10, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there and welcome to kelvSYC's little corner of Wikibooks!

I'm a contributor to the various game guides here at Wikibooks.  Among my significant projects include the [[Pokémon|Wikibooks Pokémon Guide]], which tries to be the companion to the English Wikipedia's [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Pokédex]], and [[MegaMan Battle Network]], a book dedicated to the video game series.

I am also an administrator here at Wikibooks (and in no other Wikimedia wiki).  If you have some important Wikibooks-related admining to do, then you should leave a message at my [[User talk:kelvSYC|talk page]].  I will try to check VFD and speedy weekly and delete all the filth there, as a continued commitment to an admin.  I also intend to strictly enforce the intention of Wikibooks as a repository of instructional material.

== My admin philosophy ==
Many people (wikipedians especially) are in the belief that Wikibooks is just a repository of book-length material, and thus believe that Wikibooks can be a place to expand Wikipedia articles in the hopes of making it an in-depth encyclopedia.  This is contrary to [[WB:WIN]].  I do aggresively seek out article forks and nominate them for VFD, but I do this infrequently due to the possibility of organic growth and the fact that I have better things to do.

I am also a proponent for enforcing the Wikibooks [[WB:NC|naming conventions]], but I rarely do so due to other commitments and the acknowledgement that it is a gradual process (MediaWiki, however, is very weak in regards to managing how books are organized - tree-like subpage or graph-like namespace conventions are still very arbitrary and have weak back-end support).

Let me remind you that Wikibooks is a place for '''instructional material'''.  VFD precedents have shown that an encyclopedia article or a long biography is not instuctional material in and of itself.

== My projects ==
Here are the big books I've been working on lately:

=== [[MegaMan Battle Network]] ===
I'm the founder of this book, which attempts to be a complete strategy guide to the game.  Currently I am working on the walkthrough of BN5, others may come later.

The following is my BN5 to-do list

==== To do ====
* ''Team ProtoMan'' dialog
* finish price lists in Higsby's chip order
* finish patch code list for infinite chips in folder
* how do I fit in Number Trader codes, NCP compress codes, etc...?

=== [[Pokémon]] ===
Pokémon is another book that I have created, among which [[Wikibooks Pokédex]] is the big part (and constitutes one of the larger Wikibooks).  Since WB Pokédex is the largest part of [[Pokémon]], currently a lot of it is data (and thus not very instructional in nature).  I hope that contributors can help put more emphasis on teaching others how to finish the game.

The following is my WB Pokédex to-do list

==== To do list ====
* Update all move lists for Emerald
* FL/E move tutor moves
* Links to Wikipedia's Pokédex (although I'd have to deal with some merge talk there)
* Perhaps go over the level-up movelists for each series and check if the evolution section needs to be updated (eg. a lower form learns a move but the higher form does not) — or perhaps just eliminate the evolution section altogether...
* More Japanese/English parity - eg. only the English cards are listed here so far...
* ''EX Emerald'' card lists...

When WP started, MediaWiki was in its early 1.3 stages, and templates containing links didn't work as most people planned it to work (eg. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{foo|bar=[[baz|]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; had two template parameters and not one, so you could never use piped links).  But now that it works, I may want to redo the evolution templates.

The major obstacle to making templates out of the move tables is the 5 inclusion limit currently in MW 1.3.  I'd like to standardize widths and mess with the look with CSS a bit later on, so that there is more uniformity in each entry.  Now that it's resolved in 1.4, the conversion process can get under way, although it will take a while as I try to perfect my styles.

Other plans for Wikibooks Pokédex include:
* Attack index for the RPGs (I'm currently considering whether to include them in the Pokédex or put them elsewhere)
* ''Super Smash Bros'' movelists for the relevant Pokémon (or at least a link to the appropriate book...)
* Petitioning for a separate namespace, or alternatively, moving to use the standard subpage convention?

;AC : Alternating current.  Consists of a periodic oscillation between two different voltages.  Usually said to look like a sine wave, but is not always.  

;AM : Amplitude modulation.  In radio communications, a signal controls the amplitude of a carrier wave that is at a much higher, constant frequency.  The carrier wave is filtered out and a loudspeaker plays based on the amplitude of the signal.

'''Tarbes salad''' is a sweet and sour salad that is both tasty and easy to make.

== Ingredients ==

=== Salad ===

*1 white or yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*Half a head of your favorite [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]]
*About 5 [[Cookbook:Walnuts|walnuts]], broken into bits
*1 ripe [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]], cut into small pieces
*Small chunk of hard blue or Roquefort cheese, diced

=== Dressing ===

*50 ml extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*25 ml [[Cookbook:Balsamic vinegar|Balsamic vinegar]]
*1 teaspoon whole grain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*A squirt of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

Makes 1 generous salad

== Procedure ==
Cut the onion into half moons and brown it in a bit of olive oil. Make it nice and crispy. Once it's done, put it aside in a bowl and squirt a bit of lemon juice on it.

As the onion is cooking, wash the lettuce thoroughly. Soak it several times. Nothing is worse than gritty lettuce in a salad. Break the lettuce into bite-size pieces and drop them in your spinner under running water. Once it's washed, spin it until it's dry. Wet lettuce will dilute the dressing.

Once the lettuce is dry, put it in a bowl. Add the onions, walnuts, orange and cheese.

To make the dressing, just mix the ingredients in a jar and give them a good shake.

Toss everything together in a big bowl and serve.

== Notes, tricks, and variations ==

*Prepare the lettuce and onions early. Add the onions to the lettuce (once they've cooled down) and cover the bowl. This will allow the onions to flavor the lettuce.

*Put a bit of beer in with the onions as you brown them, or even white wine or vermouth.

*Add some minced garlic either to the dressing or to the onions.

*Use a ripe pear or a kiwi instead of the orange.

*Add a sliced up, deeply browned zucchini in addition to or instead of onion.

*If you're in a hurry, skip the onion/zucchini.

*Brown the walnuts with the onions in olive oil.

*Turn the salad into dinner by adding strips of chicken or turkey (heavily salted and peppered, browned in butter).

*Double the dressing ingredients and save yourself the trouble the next day. Also, you can wash and break up all of your lettuce at once and store it in an airtight bag in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.

''What is this for?''

== Power equation in Load section ==

Please don't crucify me if I'm wrong here.  I'm not an electronics wiz.  In fact, I came here because I want to read about electronics, not write about it.  But I do know some algebra, and I believe there is a mistake under the Load section where Ohm's law is substituted (substituDed?) into the power equation.

If &lt;math&gt;P=VI\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V=IR\!&lt;/math&gt;, then wouldn't &lt;math&gt;P=\left(IR\right)I\!&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;I^2R\!&lt;/math&gt;, instead of &lt;math&gt;IR^2\!&lt;/math&gt;?

If &lt;math&gt;P=VI\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then wouldn't &lt;math&gt;P=V\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;, instead of &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;?

I'd just like to say that this page is very informative - keep up the good work! [[User:81.77.59.126|81.77.59.126]] 16:42, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

'''Carbohydrates''' are one of the fundamental classes of macromolecules found in [[biology]]. Carbohydrates are commonly found in most organisms, and play important roles in organism structure, and are a primary energy source for animals and plants. Most carbohydrates are sugars or composed mainly of sugars. By far, the most common carbohydrate found in nature is glucose, which plays a major role in cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Some carbohydrates are for structural purposes, such as cellulose (which composes plants' cell walls) and chitin (a major component of insect exoskeletons). However, the majority of carbohydrates are used for energy purposes, especially in animals.  Carbohydrates are made up of a 1:2:1 ratio of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen 
(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

==Simple Carbohydrates (Monosaccharides)==


'''These are used only for energy in living organisms.''' 
Simple carbohydrates are also known as &quot;Monosaccharides&quot;.The chemical formula for all the monosaccharides is CnH2nOn.  They are all structural isomers of each other.
There are two main types of monosaccharides. The first type are aldoses, containing an aldehyde on the first carbon, and the second type are ketoses, which have a ketone on the second carbon (This carbonyl group is always located on the second carbon). 
  Name            Formula            Aldoses                Ketoses 
  Trioses         C3 H6 O3           Glycerose              Dhydroxyacetone
  Tetroses        C4 H8 O3           Erythrose              Erythrulose
  Pentoses        C5 H10 O5          Ribose                 Ribulose
  Hexoses         C6 H12 O6          Glucose                Fructose
  Heptose         C7 H14 O7          Glucoheptose           Sodoheptulose
The suffix -oses is kept for the aldoses &amp; the suffix -uloses is kept for the ketoses.
Except fructose ketoses are as common as aldoses.The most abundant monosaccharide in nature is the 6-Carbon sugar -i.e.D-Glucose. All aldoses are reducing sugars. Many ketoses are also considered reducing sugars because they can isomerise to aldoses.
===Monomers===

There are two main forms of monomer, aldoses and ketoses, of which, all have the same backbone. The simplest for of monomers are trioses. The trioses consist of three carbons in the backbone. 

                                                                        
===Fructose===
Fructose is a ketohexose with the molecular formula of C6H12O6 ; which is same as the molecular formula of Glucose but different structure.
The structure of fructose differs from glucose at carbon 1 and 2 by the location of the carbonyl group. Fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar.  Fructose is also called levulose and fruit sugar; fructose is also found in fruits, root vegetables(such as sweet potato and onion) and honey. It is a isomer of glucose and a ketose simple sugar. Fructose has the highest solubility among all sugars.
Fructose can be converted to its isomer glucose, after it enters the blood stream.

===Glucose===
The hexoses glucose,galactose, and fructose are important monosaccharides.Glucose is the most prevalent monosaccharide in diet.
The most common hexose, D-glucose, C6H12O6 also known as dextrose and blood sugar, is found in fruits,vegetables, corn syrup, and honey.
Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides(sucrose,maltose,lactose) and polysaccharides ( glycogen,cellulose,starch).
In the body, excess glucose is converted to glycogen and then stored in the muscle and liver.

                     CH2OH

===Galactose===
Galactose is a sugar component of the disaccharide lactose, as found in milk. It is not as sweet as glucose and is separated from the glucose in lactose via hydrolysis.In addition, galactose is an aldohexose that does not occur in the free form in nature; galactose has an important role in the cellular membrane of the brain and nervous system. 
D-galactose has a structure similar to D-glucose and the only difference between them is  in the arrangement of the –OH group on carbon number 4.
Galactose can be found in human breast milk and is incorporated into the structure of Human Milk Oligosaccharides. The backbone of Human Milk Oligosaccharides is the disaccharide lactose, which is formed by the linkage between galactose and glucose sugars.

 Oligosachharides
Tha oligosachharides yields 2 to 10 monosachharides on hydrolysis. Disachharides are most common oligosachharide found in nature.

===Disaccharides===
Monosaccharides are simple forms of sugars consisting of one sugar, disacharides on the other hand, consists of two. The two sugars are bonded together via a glycosidic bond. Most linkages between sugars occur between the first and fourth carbon on the sugars. 

===Polysaccharides===
Sugars do not stop at disaccharides, they are much more complex than that. Multiple sugars are linked together forming many polysaccharides. Polysaccharides are made up of monosaccharides linked together.

==Compound Carbohydrates (Disaccharides)==
These are used by living organisms for energy.  They are composed of two monosaccharides joined together by the process known as dehydration synthesis.  In this process, one molecule loses one hydrogen atom, while the other loses one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom. The reverse of this is hydrolysis, where water is added to break down a molecule into two or more simpler molecules.
Disaccharides have the chemical equation C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.  The reason it does not follow the 1:2:1 ratio is, obviously, due to the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O taken way from it.  Some examples of disaccharides are:

===Maltose===
#Chemistry-
Maltose is a white crystal sugar, also known as malt sugar and a reducing disaccharide                                made from two glucose units. The bonding of two glucose units is called 1-4 glycosidic linkage which joins the carbon number 1 of one glucose to carbon number 4 of the second glucose.In the presence of enzyme maltase,1-4 linkage of two glucose is broken down and maltose is hydrolized into glucose
#occurrence-
Maltose is present in sprouting barely. It is the major product of hydrolysis of starch.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sucrose===
3Occurrence-
It is the costituent of sugarcane. it is also found in Beet,carrot,etc. Nector of flower is particularly rich in sucrose.
3Chemistry-
Sucrose is white crystal sugar.When heat above its melting point it forms a brown substance known as &quot;Caramel&quot;. it is non reducing sugar. Sucrose is formed by the C1-C2 glucosidic bond between glucose &amp; fructose. Sucrose on hydrolysis yield equimolar mixture of glucose &amp; fructose which is offen called as &quot;invert sugar&quot; by the &quot;enzyme&quot;.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Lactose===
3 Occurrence-
It is found in milk of animal. It is also Milk sugar''. The percentage of latose in human milk is 6.8 % &amp; in cow milk is 4.8 %
3 Chemistry-
Lactose is made by the C1-C4 glycosidic bond between galactose &amp; glucose. 
The hydrolysis of Lactose gives the monosacchride: glucose + glactose by the enzyme lactase. Lactose can be a reducing sugar.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Complex Carbohydrates (Polysaccharides)==
Polysaccharides, also called as glycanes, are high molecular weight which on hydrolysis yield monosaccharides.  Some sources of complex  carbohydrates are pasta, bread, rice, cereals, crackers, corn, beans, potatoes, pumpkin, and peas.
Digestion of complex carbohydrates could take more time because digestive enzyme have to work harder to break down the chain into individual sugars.  Complex carbohydrates contain hundreds of sugar units.  Studies show that glucose levels both rise and fall more slowly after the consumption of bread compared to sugars or fruit, suggesting slower digestion.&lt;ref&gt;Wolever, Thomas M. S. (2006), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=_UkSoDwCN80C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=sugar+absorbed+more+rapidly&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kAr3UMrzFZC68wTalYFo&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sugar%20absorbed%20more%20rapidly&amp;f=false The Glycaemic Index: A Physiological Classification of Dietary Carbohydrate]'', CABI, pg. 65, ISBN 9781845930516. “Indeed, blood glucose responses elicited by pure sugars and fruits suggest rapid absorption because the blood glucose concentration rises more quickly and falls more rapidly than after bread (Wolever ''et al''., 1993; Lee and Wolever, 1998).”&lt;/ref&gt;  
Both monosaccharides and disaccharides are used only for energy.
Another difference is that while monosaccharides and disaccharides can be used for energy immediately, polysaccharides release their energy slowly.  Research shows that the carbohydrate oxidation rate rises more slowly after the consumption of bread rather than sucrose following an overnight fast.  The carbohydrate oxidation rate is also lower over a six-hour period following the consumption of bread in lieu of sucrose.&lt;ref&gt;Daly ME, Vale C, Walker M, Littlefield A, Alberti KG, Mathers JC (2000). &quot;[http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/6/1516.full.pdf+html Acute fuel selection in response to high-sucrose and high-starch meals in healthy men].&quot; ''Am J Clin Nutr'' 71, 1516-1524. See Figure 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemically , the polysaccharide may be distinguished into homopolysachharide &amp; heteropolysachharide.
Homopolysachharides which on hydrolysis yield only single monosachharide. Eg. starch, cellulose, etc. Hateropolysachharide which on hydrolysis yield two or more monosaccharide. Eg. heparin, chondroitin, etc.                                   
                                      POLYSACHHARIDE
                             
                    Homopolysachharide              Heteropolysachharide
                   Starch                          Mucopolysachharids
                   Glucogen                        Chondroitin
                   Inulin                          Hyaluronic acid
                   Cellulose                       Keratosulfate
                   Pectin                          Heparin
                   Chitin                          Vegetable gum
                   Xylan                           Agar agar 
polysachharide may be classified on the basis of functional aspect as Nutritive &amp; Structural. Nutritive- starch,glycogen,inulin etc. Structural- cellulose,chitin,pectin,etc. 
===Cellulose (Fiber)===
Cellulose is a special kind of carbohydrate.  It is insoluble and most organisms can not produce enzymes to break it down. It is made by β-D-glucose. It is found only in plants, and it's found in the cell wall. It is composed of β glucose molecules, which create a more rigid structure. Cotton used to make clothes etc. is cellulose from around the seeds of the cotton plant.  Fibre helps the plant keep a strong structure.  Humans can't digest fibre.it gives no color with iodine.It is completely absent in meat, egg, fish &amp; milk.

===Starch===
Starch is the energy storage molecule of plants.It is formed by long chains of α glucose molecules linked together. It is mostly found in potato. Starch is actually a mixture of 2 types of molecules, amylose and amylopectin. These large polysaccharides are very good for energy storage because they have lots of glucose molecules crammed into a small space which can then be easily broken off, one at a time, by hydrolysis and then used for energy. It is hydrolysed by enzyme Amylase.It is non reducinh sugar. It gives blue,purple colour with iodine

===Glycogen===
Glycogen is the energy storage molecule of animals.  It is formed by branched chains of alpha glucose molecules with 1-4 glycosidic bonds on the main chains and 1-6 glycosidic bonds to form the branches.  Humans store small amounts of glycogen in the liver and muscles.  It is created when there are high blood sugar levels.  The pancreas secretes insulin, which stimulates the creation of glycogen from glucose and signals the body to use glucose as its main form of energy. It is non reducing sugar. It gives red colour with iodine.

'''Louis Dressing''' is a salad dressing commonly used with [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] salads, such as [[Cookbook:Crab Louis|Crab Louis]] and Shrimp Louis. It can also be used as a dip or sandwich spread, or many other uses.  The dressing is creamy, yet has a little spicy kick.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (235 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
*1/4 cup (60 mL) cup mild [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]], the salsa must have green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]
*1/4 cup (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (7 mL) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|worcestershire sauce]]
*Hot sauce (e.g., Tabasco, Crystal), to taste

Makes 1 1/2 cups of dressing.

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], and process till smooth.  The goal is to have a pink smooth sauce with little green flecks.
#Pour the sauce into a bowl and chill covered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to use.

==Notes, tips and variations==
# This is not the &quot;traditional&quot; recipe, but it is the easiest for untrained cooks to succeed at.  For the traditional recipe, replace the salsa and ketchup with 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce|chile sauce]] (or store bought chile sauce), and three tablespoons each of finely minced [[Cookbook:Green Onion|green onion]] and green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]].  Instead of using the blender, whisk the ingredients in a bowl.
# Keep refrigerated

I've just read the article on tenses and I think it's one of the best explanations of Indonesian tenses I've seen anywhere. I'm a begginner at learning Bahasa Indonesia and I found it very helpful. Very nice work.

== editing ==

I hate to edit something so well written and designed, but the section on Past Perfect seemed to be referring to present perfect, so I've edited it to reflect that.

== move to Grammar/Tenses? ==

Should we move this section to Grammar/Tenses so that there aren't two same topics (Indonesian Tenses)? [[User:Bennylin|Benny Lin]]

== confusion of tense and aspect == 

This section confuses the grammatical concepts of [[w:Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[w:Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. Aspect markers like ''sedang''/''lagi'' (progressive aspect) and ''sudah''/''telah'' (perfective aspect) should be distinguished from other temporal markers.</text>

==Introduction to Nutrition and Metabolomics==
Metabolomics has been widely adopted in pharmacology and toxicology but is relatively new in human nutrition. The ultimate goal, to understand the effects of exogenous compounds on human metabolic regulation, is similar in all 3 fields. However, the application of metabolomics to nutritional research will be met with unique challenges. Little is known of the extent to which changes in the nutrient content of the human diet elicit changes in metabolic profiles. Moreover, the metabolomic signal from nutrients absorbed from the diet must compete with the myriad of nonnutrient signals that are absorbed, metabolized, and secreted in both urine and saliva. The large-bowel microflora also produces significant metabolic signals that can contribute to and alter the metabolome of biofluids in human nutrition. Notwithstanding these possible confounding effects, every reason exists to be optimistic about the potential of metabolomics for the assessment of various biofluids in nutrition research. This potential lies both in metabolic profiling through the use of pattern-recognition statistics on assigned and unassigned metabolite signals and in the collection of comprehensive data sets of identified metabolites; both objectives have the potential to distinguish between different dietary treatments, which would not have been targeted with conventional techniques. The latter objective sets out a well-recognized challenge to modern biology: the development of libraries of small molecules to aid in metabolite identification. The purpose of the present review was to highlight some early challenges that need to be addressed if metabolomics is to realize its great potential in human nutrition.

===What is Metabolomics?===
Metabolomics is newly developing field studying the products and effects of the metabolism on the pathological and physiological states within biological samples. Metabolomics offers the possibility of discovering the reasons and causes of certain phenotypes. Another discovery from Metabolomics is the discovery of biomarkers, which reveal changes in health and disease, and can reflect dietary habits. Metabolomics is essential in the study of how specific diets interact with the human body, one of the most important aspects of nutrition. 

Koulman, A., and D. A. Volmer. &quot;Perspectives for metabolomics in human nutrition: an overview.&quot; Nutrition Bulletin 33.4 (2008)

Small molecule metabolites, the end product of cellular processes, are the most accurate marker of the responses of biological systems resulting from changes either genetic or environmental.  There are approximately 2,900 biochemicals (metabolites) that are the key to cellular phenotypes. 

Milburn, Michael. &quot;Using Metabolic Profiling Technology to Advance Cell Culture Development.&quot; BioPharm International June 2009, p.28-34

===Limitations of Metabolomics===
Metabolic profiling has been conducted for over 50 years, which has provided a lot of very helpful information but currently there is not enough data nor a standard way to collect and record data for the study of metabolomics to really be helpful now. Metabolomics has the potential to discover early warning signs of certain diseases as well as determine the effects of certain foods and drugs on the body. This potential could be much greater if more data is collected and recorded accurately and precisely into a database. By recording the effects of age, gender, race, ethnicity, body composition, health, dietary intake, physical activity, stress, and many more factors, people would be able to better interpret their new metabolomic data and advance the general metabolomic knowledge. Without this there is no baseline or control group with which to compare data which greatly hinders proper research and theory creation.

===Future Of Metabolomics===
The future of Metabolomics seems to be coming ever clearer in the wake of increasing scientific innovation in the area of the genome.  Through the use and study of various aspects of the genome there has been great scientific improvement which has laid the groundwork for more relevant innovations.  Such innovations would include proteome (the study of entire protein complements of cells tissues or fluid compartments), and the metabolome (the study of entire metabolite complements in cells, tissues or fluids) which will support modern nutrition (1). With these scientific leaps in genomic research, Metabolomics, lead by Nutrition, has the potential to reduce disease in both individuals and entire populations.  This is all made possible by several innovative and relatively new technologies such as the gene array which performs global gene expression analysis (1).  This is just one of the many feats of engineering which have made it possible for us to quantify and understand the human gene and how it relates to Nutrition.

==Nutrition, Metabolomics, and Disease==
Dysregulation at the level of primary metabolic organs and tissues form the foundation of many diseases. Some primary tissues of current interest include adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, the intestine and liver. The metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity may all be understood as ecological phenomena where metabolism is the primary intermediary between diet and health outcomes. The assessment of essential nutrient status and a comprehensive understanding of metabolic response (e.g. metabolic phenotype) to ecological risk factors is necessary for the identification of effective disease prevention strategies as well as interventions in the clinical treatment of metabolic disease.

===Nutrition and Oral Disease===
The below is not medical advice, and is not (as prohibited by government regulation) designed to treat, or prevent any illnesses. The information is currently under review for quality and accuracy. 

Nutrition plays a key role in the prevention of many oral diseases, dental caries, dental erosion, developmental defects, oral mucosal diseases and periodontal disease. Poor nutrition can lead to a breakdown in tooth enamel and an increase in oral mucosal. The consumption of soft drinks, which are heavy with acid, has been shown to lead to significant dental erosion.  A balanced diet and proper nutrition are essential to the maintaining of a healthy oral system, as well as the rest of the body. Bacteria can also cause periodontal disease, gum disease, and erosion. Chewing antibiotics is one way to prevent periodontal disease.

Periodontal disease, an oral infectious disease involving inflammation and loss of bone and supporting tissues, progresses more rapidly in undernourished developing populations around the world.  Many local and systematic factors influence the severity and longevity of progression of the common yet preventable disease.

Malnutrition however exacerbates the severity of oral infections, which are contributing factors to other life-threatening diseases. Deficiencies in vitamin C lead to scurvy, while deficiencies in vitamin A, D and other protein-energy components are associated with enamel hyplosia and salivary gland atrophy. Antioxidant intake in foods, such as pomegranate seeds, green or black teas, have been used as buffers of reactive oxygen species that lead to tooth decay.  Antioxidants are found in high fruit and vegetable diets and have been determined to contain anti carcinogenic properties. Diet plays an important role in the dynamic equilibrium of dimineralization-remineralization of the tooth surface. Therefore, food's form,  frequency of sugar and alcohol intake, and combination of vital nutrients and minerals play an important role in maintaining a healthy oral system.

===Nutrition and Celiac disease ===
Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory small intestinal disorder that can lead to severe villous atrophy, malabsorption, and malignancy. It is triggered by the gluten proteins of wheat, barley, and rye. All patients express the antigen presenting molecules human leukocyte antigen-DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) and/or HLA-DQ8, which bind gluten peptides and thus activate destructive intestinal T cells. Patients with untreated CD have circulating IgA autoantibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG), a component of endomysium. Testing for serum IgA tTG has a high predictive value. Therapy of CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Counseling by an expert dietitian and association with a celiac support group are important in helping the patient embark on a healthy gluten-free diet. Current research focuses on non-dietary therapies and treatment of refractory (diet-unresponsive) CD.

Kelly, Ciaran P., Dennis, Melinda D., Schuppan, Detlef. “Celiac Disease: Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Nutritional Management”. Nutrition in Clinical Care (April 2005).

There is an estimated prevalence of 1% in North America.  Typically symptoms become present in early childhood and consist of abdominal cramps, diarrhea, malabsortption and nutrient deficiencies.  A link has been found with giving infant cereal, which contains gluten, too young and developing Celiac disease.  Parents are advised to wait until 4-6 months of age before giving babies infant cereal.  In a study of over 1500 children 51 developed the disease and those who were exposed to infant cereal before 3 months were at 5 times more likely to develop the disease.

===Nutrition and Childhood Obesity ===
The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is alarming, particularly in light of its many medical and psychosocial consequences.Due to the multifactorial etiology of overweight and obesity, action is needed concurrently at many levels. Physicians should screen for overweight and obesity regularly in order to address the problem at an early stage. One promising approach is to introduce healthy eating habits, focusing on portion control and a diet rich innon-starchy vegetables, fruits, and legumes, and sufficient in moderate-glycemic index/load foods, protein,healthy types of fat, and reduced-fat dairy foods. In addition, it is important to decrease sedentary behaviors and increase physical activity. The earlier a healthy lifestyle is introduced into a child's life, the more likely it is to become a way of life. Parents have a major role to play in controlling what their young child eats and in reinforcing healthy eating at an early age, serving as role models themselves. Interventions that include the whole family in the process are likely to have the most success in the prevention and treatment of childhood overweight and obesity.

Philippas, Niki G, Lo, Clifford W. “Childhood Obesity: Etiology, Prevention, and Treatment”. Nutrition in Clinical Care. (April 2005).

===Nutrition and the link between Childhood Obesity and Severe Adult Obesity ===
Childhood obesity not only affects the health and nutrition of a child’s life, but also puts them at a higher risk of having severe adult obesity. In a study done by Ilonna and Alfred Rimm where they conducted a questionnaire completed by 73,532 women, they found that a large portion of severely obese women were also obese children. The data found from their study also suggests that the risk of an overweight child developing severe adult obesity is significantly greater than that of non-obese children. Since adult obesity can be linked to so many health problems and adult diseases, this study shows the importance of weight control through childhood.

==Obesity and the Link to Malignant Cancer==
Not only does being obese contribute to things like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, research has shown that it can also be linked to an increased risk of cancer. Researchers estimate that excess weight may account for 14 percent of cancer death in men and 20 percent of cancer deaths in women. As far as preventable risk factors for cancer go, only smoking rates higher. There is a major connection between cancer and insulin, which happens to be one of the main hormones that responds to obesity. The more obese the individual, then typically the more insulin they will have in their system. Also, concentrations of hormones that cause inflammation may rise with fat concentrations, which also may set cancer in motion Any of these fluctuations in hormone levels could work together to initiate cacinogenesis.

==Maternal Influence on Nutrition==
Adequate nutrition and balance of vitamins has a huge effect on human growth before we are even born. During pregnancy, it is important for mother’s to maintain proper balances of vitamins and minerals in order to support the long term develop and health of the metabolism in her child. A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine indicated the importance of Vitamin A, for example. The article notes that “vitamin A deficiency in a mother during pregnancy could have lasting adverse effects on the lung health of her offspring” by not providing the child with the support it is needs to build healthy alveoli of the lungs (West et. Al 2010). Properly developed lungs, help contribute to the overall health of an infant. Other research has also determined the importance of micronutrients in a mother’s diet that help support a healthy baby. Mother’s who maintained diets high in micronutrients and vitamins found in green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk tended to have larger and healthier babies.  The study also notes that mother’s who had high levels of glucose; insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides during pregnancy increased the chances that their child would develop higher insulin resistance, which is one of the main causes of diabetes (Yajnik 2006).

===Iodine Deficency in Pregnacny===

Iodine is necessary for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones. Nearly 80 percent of the iodine in the body is found in the thyroid gland, most of it is the thyroid hormones. The amount of iodide, a form of iodine, in drinking water generally depends on the iodine content of local soil. Some 10 percent of the world population is at risk of developing iodine deficiency because they live at high altitudes where the drinking water is low in iodide. To counteract low iodine levels iodide is sometimes added to commercial table salt. 

In iodine deficiency, the thyroid gland attempts to capture more iodide for the synthesis of thyroid hormones and enlarges. The iodide level in the blood and urine is very low. A pregnant woman who is deficient in iodine may have a baby whose brain is improperly developed because of iodine deficiency. This condition is called cretinism (Beers: 1999). Cretinism is marked by irreversible mental and growth retardation (Tatsumi: 1992).

==Nutrient specific sections==

The are many types of vitamins classified by the materials in which they will dissolve, two of which are: Fat Soluble and Water Soluble. Others are Calcium, Fish Oil, Flax Seed, Iron, Vitamin K, Vitamin E, and Vitamin D.

===Calcium===
Calcium is mineral that is the most likely to be deficient in the human diet. 99% of the calcium in the human body is stored in the bones and teeth. It is the most supportive element in bones and teeth and makes up 70% of bone weight and accounts for bone strength. The last 1% floats in the bloodstream and performs a variety of functions throughout the body. It also helps in contracting muscles and regulating the contractions of the heart. It also plays a key role in the transmission of nerve impulses and in blood clotting. It is also involved in the stimulation of contractions during childbirth as well as milk production. In order for the body to absorb calcium, there needs to be Vitamin D in the blood. Vitamin D is a key ingredient that enables calcium to pass from the digestive system into the bones or blood. Even though everyone knows that calcium is important in a healthy adult diet, some people still don’t get enough and end up being deficient. Calcium deficiency causes the bones to weaken and thin out and can even cause them to be brittle. It also causes osteoporosis which means that the bones have developed tiny holes and increases risk of fracture. Osteoporosis seems to affect women more often than men. So, for the average adult, ingest 1000mg of calcium and you will continue to grow up big and strong.

At the other end of the spectrum, a study was done by Taru K Pilvi et al. to investigate energy restriction and its effect on weight loss. As a further investigation, this study also aimed to explain &quot;whether the [weight-loss] effect of energy restriction can be further enhanced by modification of dietary protein source and calcium.&quot; They found that the increased levels of dairy protein and calcium had a &quot;significant effect on hepatic lipid changes.&quot; The mice of this study that were fed a diet with increased levels of whey protein and calcium exhibited a reduction in &quot;the relative level of potentially diabetogenic ceramides and diacylglycerols to the level observed in lean animals.&quot; Another study showed similar effects of increased dairy in the diet of obese subjects. This study done by Zemel MB et al. showed a direct association between increased dietary calcium and lipid utilization. Both of these studies concluded that increased calcium consumption during energy restriction results in augmented weight loss in obese individuals.

===Fat Soluble Vitamins===
Fat soluble vitamins can be very important to some people more than others for many reasons. The American Society for Nutrition claims that, &quot;fat-soluble vitamins are needed for maintaining optimal function of innate and adaptive immune cells.&quot; In that case, fat soluble vitamins can help improve immune response to tumors. However, that is not the only thing that fat soluble vitamins can help improve. There are a variety of fat soluble vitamins that can improve health. The beneficial effects can vary considering that they can improve different aspects of the human body. Fat-soluble vitamins -- vitamins A, D, E and K -- dissolve in fat before they are absorbed in the blood stream to carry out their functions. Excesses of these vitamins are stored in the liver. Because they are stored, they are not needed every day in the diet.

===Fish Oil===
Fish oil is found in omega 3 and is part of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. It a natural oil usually produced from the body of cold-water fish. The generic name is vitamin A and the brand names are A-25, A/Fish Oil, Aquasol A which comes in a capsule form with soft gel liquid inside. It is known as the marine oils and are essential fatty acids that are found in fish. There are two main ingredients to fish oil. One is the 20 carbon eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The other is the 22-carbon docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The average fish oil supplement is 20 EPA and 10 DHA for a total of 30 omega-3, which may help to keep block triglycerides in check and help protect against atherosclerosis. Studies have found that fish oil may help precent crohn’s disease, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and rheumatoid arthritis. Fish oil is also good for the brain because the brain is one of the largest consumers of DHA. It can be known as brain food.

In one Australian study, fish oil supplements taken by women during pregnancy were associated with improved hand-eye coordination of their children. It is also suggested that high doses of fish oil are beneficial in the last weeks of pregnancy and further research is being done to determine the ways in which it is.

Populations that consume large amounts of fish have been associated with reduced incidences of breast cancer. LIke it has been said, fish oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), and research is being done to determine whether it is that aspect of fish that seems to contribute to protection against breast cancer.

===Flax Seed===
According to health experts, the seed of the blue-flowering flax plant that can be easily found on Canadian and Mesopotamian soil, is packed with disease-fighting nutrients and fiber. It is also loaded with two fatty acids that are necessary for our bodies: omega-3s and lingans, which also work as natural antioxidants. The omega-3s in the flax seed help remove toxins from the human body, as well as helping with the prevention of heart disease and inflammation. The lignans aid with the prevention of cancers and provides 700 times the amount of fiber that can be found in legumes or whole grains. This fiber is also great for fighting bad cholesterol and type 2 diabetes. Omega-3 and lignan are essential to every membrane and cell in the human body, making them extremely beneficial.  Flax seed has the ability to fix radical oxygen atoms.  Radical oxygen molecules can cause molecular damage to DNA, shortening and damaging it.  They are associated with the deterioration of the body often associated with aging.  

Flax seed also has notable effects on the menstrual cycle.  It prolonges the fertile stage of the menstrual cycle, the luteal phase.  It also helps regulate the release of an ovum.  Women that regularly consume flax seed are more likely to release an egg for every menstrual cycle they have than women who have a low fiber diet withno flax seed supplements.  Two phytochemicals in flax seed are linked to changes in the female hormonal cycle associated with these changes in the menstrual cycle.  They are absorbed in the intestines and affect the ratios of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone during different times in the menstrual cycle. A study at Duke University found that men scheduled for prostate cancer surgery who began eating two teaspoons of flaxseed oil daily, showed that within 30 days the flax seed halted tumor growth and many of the cancer cells had self-destructed. Although all parts of the flax seed including the seed, oil, or both would benefit our diets, shopping for flaxseed can prove difficult as there are so many processed variations of the plant, each of which with its own care instructions. Be sure to read the back of all packaging’s to make sure you choose the best one for you.

===Iron===
Iron is split into two categories.  HEME iron can be obtained only from meat, fish and poultry and is an easier type of iron for the body to break down and use as a nutrient.  NON-HEME iron can be obtained from fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and grains and is more difficult for the body to absorb.  The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for males aged 19 to 50 is 8mg/day.  Females in the same age range are suggested to consume 18mg of iron per day.  Iron deficiency is the number one nutritional disorder in the world.  It can be caused by a low dietary intake of iron or the inability to absorb the iron consumed.  Also, excessive blood loss is another factor.  Women are at a higher risk for iron deficiency because of the consistent menstrual blood loss experienced during their menstrual cycle.  To help fight iron deficiency many breakfast cereals are iron-fortified shown on the nutrition label.

Iron is both an essential nutrient and a potential toxicant to cells, requiring a highly sophisticated and complex set of regulatory approaches to meet the demands of cells as well as to prevent excess accumulation. For humans, iron plays a central role in oxygen transport and the synthesis of haemoglobin, myoglobin, and some important enzymes to energy production. Many studies have demonstrated that iron deficiency may impair the performance of athletes, so normal iron status in athletes is especially important. Exercise alone may not lead to a true iron deficiency, but probably results from dietary choices, inadequate iron intake, and menstruation. Iron deficiency affects particularly pregnant women, young children, and adolescents. Iron is a micro-nutrient and is required for regulation of brain neurotransmitters by altering the pathway enzymatic system. Studies have shown that iron deficiency in infants can negatively impact neurological development necessary later in life. It is thought that early iron deficiency can possibly impair the development and function of the hippocampus in the brain, which plays an important role in developing and retaining long-term memories. Iron deficiency in infants might also impair the dopamine system. It is possible that those adolescents who were exposed to chronic and sever iron deficiency in their infant stages may exhibit deficits on tests in things like Spatial Working Memory, Rapid VIsual Information Processing, Pattern Recognition Memory, and Spatial Recognition Memory.

====Vitamin K and Vitamin E Interactions====
As noted above each vitamin is necessary &quot;for maintaining optimal function of innate and adaptive immune cells&quot; yet it is important to remember that each vitamin also interacts with the others.  Interestingly, some studies have indicated that Vitamin E may decrease Vitamin K's addition to the immune system.  Though the connection has not been proven, preliminary clinical trials have reflected that Vitamin K's metabolism is slowed with an excess of Vitamin E.  One hypothesis is that Vitamin K and E compete for the enzyme.  So far only rats have been tested, though it has been observed with statistical significance that when an excess of Vitamin E is present there are far fewer MK-4's (the metabolized Vitamin K).  

Vitamin A is a vitamin that is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of a specific metabolite, the light-absorbing molecule retinal. This molecule is necessary for both scotopic and color vision. Vitamin A also functions in a very different role, as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinoic acid, which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods: Retinol which is the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources. The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin (all ofwhich contain beta-ionone rings), function as vitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals. The discovery of vitamin A may have stemmed from research dating back to 1906, indicating that factors other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were necessary to keep cattle healthy. Adequate supply of Vitamin A is especially important for pregnant and breastfeeding women, since deficiencies cannot be compensated by postnatal supplementation. However, excess Vitamin A, especially through vitamin supplementation, can cause birth defects and should not exceed recommended daily values. Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, disposing of any excesses taken in through diet is much harder than with water-soluble vitamins B and C, thus vitamin A toxicity may result. This can lead to nausea, jaundice, irritability, anorexia vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hairloss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. Toxic effects of vitamin A have been shown to significantly affect developing fetuses. Therapeutic doses used for acne treatment have been shown to disrupt cephalic neural cell activity. The fetus is particularly sensitive to vitamin A toxicity during the period of organogenesis.

== Vitamin D ==
Vitamin D is sometimes known as the “sun-shine vitamin” due to it's ability to fight off infections. It is also important for bone health. It can protect against osteoporosis, arthritis and other bone problems. In the study of Osteoporotic fractures in men study, researchers found that low vitamin D levels were connected to a greater possibility for arthritis, whereas men with higher vitamin D levels had reduced chances of developing arthritis. With a sufficient intake of Vitamin D, it is possible to build a defense against arthritis, as the vitamin D helps to regulate the development and maintenance of bone and cartilage. 

Vitamin D has been recently found to have many additional health benefits outside of bone health. People with sufficient vitamin D levels have been found to have increased testosterone and muscle mass. Gaining your vitamin D solely through sunshine is generally not enough to maintain a healthy level. 

Vitamin D supplements are widely recommended for people who live in environments that don’t receive an adequate amount of sunshine. Vitamin D is one of the body’s essential vitamins and a 2010 study by Japanese researchers suggest there might be a link between vitamin D and flu prevention. Although more studies will be necessary to make a conclusive link, there was an 8% decrease in flu diagnoses among children who received the recommended 700-1000 IU a day as compared to those receiving a placebo. 
 A lack of Vitamin D has been known to be a leading cause of rickets; soft and weak bones. Low levels of vitamin D have also been related to heart disease and some forms of cancer. This vitamin can be attained through direct sunlight or food fortified with vitamin D. Individuals with darker skin require more sunlight exposure to take in as much vitamin D as a fair-skinned person. 

Vitamin D is one of many important body essential vitamins that help balance the body. It is known to be an immune system regulator. Researchers states that, “the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], has been shown to inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).”  In total reverse of proper Vitamin D intake and low counts of Vitamin D receptors, it can result in accelerated inflammatory bowel disease. Dietary calcium can help trigger the effects of Vitamin D on the immune system because it has its own independent effects on inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of mice on low-calcium diets can improve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.

Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids, the two major physiologically relevant forms of which are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D2 or D3 or both. Vitamin D is produced in the skin of vertebrates after exposure to ultraviolet B light, and occurs naturally in a small range of foods. In some countries staples such as milk, flour and margarine are artificially fortified with vitamin D, and it is also available as a supplement in pill form. Vitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcidiol. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, either in the kidneys or by monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, defending the body against microbial invaders. When synthesized in the kidneys, calcitriol circulates as a hormone, regulating, among other things, the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream, promoting the healthy mineralization, growth and remodeling of bone, and the prevention of hypocalcemic tetany. Vitamin D insufficiency can result in thin, brittle, or misshapen bones, while sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, and, together with calcium, helps to protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D also modulates neuromuscular function, reduces inflammation, and influences the action of many genes that regulate the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells. Important that Washington citizens try to find time to get out in the sun and get there vitamin D. there are a vast array of consequences for the human body that does no obtain enough vitamin D. So get out there and get your sunshine.

There was a study done about the correlation between milk consumption and prostate cancer. The study, although far from having definite answers seemed to find a pattern in the decreased rates of prostate cancer in men who take in lots of vitamin D. The vitamin D seems to have some sort of preventative effect on prostate cancer. It was certainly found that men who take in less vitamin D have a greater chance of getting and dying from prostate cancer. The study did find that the calcium in milk decreases the production of vitamin D3 which in turn cancels out the beneficial effects of the vitamin. In other words vitamin D from milk, although still good for you, does not have to preventative effect on prostate cancer as a healthy does of pure vitamin D does.

===Water Soluble Vitamins===
B-complex vitamins and vitamin C are water-soluble vitamins that are not stored in the body and must be replaced each day.These vitamins are easily destroyed or washed out during food storage and preparation.The B-complex group is found in a variety of foods: cereal grains, meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk, legumes and fresh vegetables. Citrus fruits are good sources of vitamin C. The use of megadoses of vitamins is not recommended and in some cases can have undesirable results. In 2010, Canadian researches studied 238 people with chronic kidney disease, challenging earlier studies that had suggested B vitamins could protect the kidneys because they lower blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that is linked to a higher risk of kidney damage. Yet after three years of studies it was found that those who got the high-dose B vitamins had a greater decrease in kidney function that those who received the placebo.
Vitamins are essential nutrients found in foods. The requirements are small but they perform specific and vital functions essential for maintaining health.
Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored; they are eliminated in urine. We need a continuous supply of them in our diets. The water-soluble vitamins are the B-complex group and vitamin C.

Water-soluble vitamins are easily destroyed or washed out during food storage or preparation. Proper storage and preparation of food can minimize vitamin loss. To reduce vitamin loss, refrigerate fresh produce, keep milk and grains away from strong light, and use the cooking water from vegetables to prepare soups

== Merge all nutrition content? ==

With the creation of [[Nutrition:Vitamin C]] I though that I should link it back to [[Nutrition]]. I have noticed that there is a duplicate [[Cookbook:Nutrition]] section (and [[Cookbook:Vitamins]] too), so I added it there too. We really should decide how things should be split between the two, or if they should be merged.

I want to discuss the content of the article. The last section states that all humans need
in a lifetime is 1 cup of vitamins. I'm hoping for a reference. Also I wanted to ask if the 
author has considered the following: mineral deficient soil, old age, disease states,
orthomolecular psychology, poor understanding of nutrition by the public, history of  
nutritional disease (pellagra, beriberi, rickets, microcytic anaemia, megaloblastic  
anaemia, creationism due to iodine deficiency), bioavibility of nutrients, special religious 
diets and similar diets (Hindu, Buddhist, Seventh Day Adventists, Muslims, vegans, and 
vegetarians for instance), gender differences in need, special concerns for infants and 
children, the effects of heavy metals and other poisons on nutritional needs, etc. [[User:69.72.254.10|69.72.254.10]] 05:49, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

Hello, I am new to Wikibooks and will be on here quite often from now on.  I am currently a registered dietitian and will be contributing to this Nutrition page quite extensively.  My plan is to create an on-line textbook similar to the printed books I used in college.  I will also be adding recent research articles and, if people would like, tips for dieting, exercise, diabetes, and any other topics people would like to speak with a dietitian about.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Mdahlheim|Mdahlheim]] ([[User talk:Mdahlheim|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mdahlheim|contribs]]) 16:43, 2 Dec 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Page needs cleanup  ==

This page needs to be organized. 

An introductory section should discuss Metabolomics, nutrition and general health implications/applications.

A second section should link to independent pages discussing the metabolomics of specific nutrients.

# Once the onions are cooked, add the chili puree to the pan.
# [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 15 minutes.
# Return mixture to the blender, and puree.  See [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce#Warning|warning]].
# Pour sauce through a [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]].  Use a spoon to stir and press the mixture against the sieve to extract all the sauce.
# Add salt to taste.  If the sauce is a little bitter, some sugar can be added to compensate.

== Notes ==

Makes about 2 cups.  Freezes well.

Sauce may stain certain materials, including some plastics.  Store in glass to avoid staining.

== Warning ==

Use caution when handling [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]].  Wearing rubber gloves is recommended, and be sure to wash the gloves, and your hands, thoroughly after handling the chili peppers. If rubber gloves are not available, rub some oil onto your hands before handling the chilies. The capsaicin in the chili peppers, the chemical that makes them hot, will burn the eyes, nose, or mouth on contact, and exposed skin if left for long. (but you're planning to eat this...)

Use caution when pureeing hot liquids in a blender.  The hot liquid can spill out the top of the blender.  Either allow the sauce to cool first, or hold the lid in place during blending, using a towel or oven glove to protect your hand.  Only fill the blender half full, do multiple batches if required.

:I agree with the comment that appeared on 27 May 2004.  The page should be renamed &quot;Right triangle trigonometry&quot;.

Im going to at least add some headers so we know what we're dealing with. It looks like some of the proofs in there are useful but should be moved to their appropriate sections (I can start on that after I've labeled everything...) [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:56, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

OK, the headers are added. It looks like whoever wrote the stuff knew what he or she was talking about but did not really look into what the rest of the book was about, it seems to assume some knowledge of calculus, which the author kind of put there out of the blue like, oh by the way you can approximate it with a polynomial... the complex number stuff is quite in-depth, is there a wikibook on complex analysis or something we can put that in? I'm sure we can condense the author's proof to something workable for the target audience. -- [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 03:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

: I've moved the [[Trigonometry/Derivative_of_Sine|derivatives of sine]] and [[Trigonometry/Derivative_of_Cosine|cosine]] into new pages.

== &quot;Construction of Right Triangles&quot; - Unclear Directions ==

If followed, it would seem that the directions in this section would not create a Right Triangle.  In fact, it seems like it would create anything but a right triangle.  Can someone create an image to demonstrate these directions? [[Special:Contributions/63.65.189.106|63.65.189.106]] ([[User talk:63.65.189.106|talk]]) 20:31, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

:Your correct that these directions are not that great, maybe we should add some different explanations of how to construct a right triangle.  In the mean time I will at least point out that they do in fact always produce a right triangle.  This is a consequence of [[w:Thales' theorem|Thales' theorem]].  The reason this explanation seems unclear is probably because it is not at all obvious the result will be a right triangle, unless you already knew this theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Metallic bonds|next=Intermolecular bonds}}

Covalent molecules are bonded to other atoms by electron pairs. Being mutually negatively charged, the electron pairs repel the other electron pairs and attempt to move as far apart as possible in order to stabilize the molecule. This repulsion causes covalent molecules to have distinctive shapes, known as the molecule's '''molecular geometry'''. There are several different methods of determining molecular geometry. A scientific model, called the VSEPR (valence shell electron pair repulsion) model can be used to qualitatively predict the shapes of molecules. Within this model, the '''AXE method''' is used in determining molecular geometry by counting the numbers of electrons and bonds related to the center atom(s) of the molecule.

{{Wikipedia|VSEPR}}
The VSEPR model is by no means a perfect model of molecular shape! It is simply a system which explains the known shapes of molecular geometry as discovered by experiment. This can allow us to predict the geometry of similar molecules, making it a fairly useful model. Modern methods of quantitatively calculating the most stable (lowest energy) shapes of molecules can take several hours of supercomputer time, and is the domain of computational chemistry.

&lt;/center&gt;

The hybridization is determined by how many &quot;things&quot; are attached to the central atom.  Those &quot;things&quot; can be other atoms or non-bonding pairs of electrons.  The number of groups is how many atoms or electron pairs are bonded to the central atom.  For example, methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is tetrahedral-shaped because the carbon is attached to four hydrogens.  Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is not trigonal planar, however.  It is trigonal pyramidal because it is attached to four &quot;things&quot;: the three hydrogens and a non-bonding pair of electrons (to fulfill nitrogen's octet).

==Tetrahedral Shape==
[[Image:Methane-3D-space-filling.svg|thumb]]
Consider a simple covalent molecule, methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Four hydrogen atoms surround a carbon atom in three-dimensional space. Each CH bond consists of one pair of electrons, and these pairs try to move as far away from each other as possible (due to electrostatic repulsion). You might think this would lead to a flat shape, with each hydrogen atom 90&amp;deg; apart. However, in three dimensions, there is a more efficient arrangement of the hydrogen atoms. If each hydrogen atom is at a corner of a tetrahedron centered around the carbon atom, they are separated by about cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(-1/3) ≈ '''109.5&amp;deg;'''—the maximum possible.

===Hybridization===
To align four orbitals in this tetrahedral shape requires the reformation of one s and three p orbitals into an sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbital.[[Image:Methane-2D-small.png|thumb|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a tetrahedral molecule.]]

===Lone Electron Pairs===
The VSEPR model treats lone electron pairs in a similar way to bonding electrons. In ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for example, there are three hydrogen atoms and one lone pair of electrons surrounding the central nitrogen atom. Because there are four groups, ammonia has a tetrahedral shape but unlike methane, the angle between the hydrogen atoms is slightly smaller, '''107.3&amp;deg;'''. This can be explained by theorizing that lone electron pairs take up more space physically than bonding pairs. This is a reasonable theory: in a bond, the electron pair is distributed over two atoms whereas a lone pair is only located on one. Because it is bigger, the lone pair forces the other electron pairs together.

[[Image:Ammonia lone electron pair.svg|thumb|100px|left|The lone pair occupies more space than a bonding pair, decreasing the angles.]]
Testing this assumption with water provides further evidence. In water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) there are two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs, again making four groups in total. The electron pairs repel each other into a tetrahedral shape. The angle between the hydrogen atoms is '''104.5&amp;deg;''', which is what we expect from our model. The two lone pairs both push the bonds closer together, giving a smaller angle than in ammonia.


==Linear and Planar Shapes==
===Electron-Poor Atoms===
In some molecules, there are less than four pairs of valence electrons. This occurs in electron deficient atoms such as boron and beryllium, which don't conform to the octet rule (they can have 6 and 4 valence electrons respectively). In boron trifluoride (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), there are only three electron pairs which repel each other to form a flat plane. Each fluorine atom is separated by cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(-1/2) = 120&amp;deg;. A different set of hybrid orbitals is formed in this molecule: the 2s and two 2p orbitals combine to form three '''sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals'''. The remaining p orbital is empty and sits above and below the plane of the molecule.

Beryllium, on the other hand, forms only two pairs of valence electrons. These repel each other at cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(-1) = 180&amp;deg;, forming a '''linear''' molecule. An example is beryllium chloride, which has two chlorine atoms situated on opposite sides of a beryllium atom. This time, one 2s and one 2p orbital combine to form two '''sp hybrid orbitals'''. The two remaining p orbitals sit above and to the side of the beryllium atom (they are empty).

=== Bent vs. Linear ===
[[Image:Sulfur-dioxide-ve-B-2D.png|thumb|100px|left|The non-bonding pair causes sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization, leading to a bent shape.]]
[[Image:Carbon-dioxide.png|thumb|100px|right|No non-bonding pairs causes sp hybridization, leading to a linear shape.]]
Some elements will have a bent shape, others have a linear shape. Both are attached to two groups, so it depends on how many non-bonding pairs the central atom has.

Take a look at sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Both have two oxygen atoms attached with double covalent bonds.  Carbon dioxide is linear, and sulfur dioxide is bent.  The difference is in their valence shells.  Carbon has four valence electrons, sulfur has six.  When they bond, carbon has no non-bonding pairs, but sulfur has one.

==Five and Six Groups==
Recall that some elements, especially sulfur and phosphorus, can bond with five or six groups.  The hybridization is sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d or sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a trigonal bipyramidal or octahedral shape respectively.  When there are non bonding pairs, other shape can arise (see the above chart).

== How The Shapes Look ==
The yellow groups are non-bonding electron pairs.  The white groups are bonded atoms, and the pink is the central atom.  This is referred to as the ''AXE method''; A is the central atom, X's are bonded atoms, and E's are non-bonding electron pairs.

{{SideBox|Molecules are not static; their bonds are continually twisting, stretching and bending.  According to quantum theory, the energies of these bond movements are quantized, and this fact forms the basis of '''infrared spectroscopy''', an important chemical tool in analyzing organic molecules.}}

== Balancing Equations ==

Chemical equations are useful because they give the relative amounts of the substances that react in a chemical equation.  For example, from the chemical equation for the formation of ammonia, we can see that one mole of nitrogen gas will combine with three moles of hydrogen gas to form two moles of ammonia gas.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{2} + 3{\hbox{H}_{2}} \to 2\hbox{NH}_{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


In some cases, however, we may not know the relative amounts of each substance that reacts. Fortunately, we can always find the correct '''coefficients''' of an equation (the relative amounts of each reactant and product).  The process of finding the coefficients is known as ''balancing the equation''.

During a chemical reaction, atoms are neither created or destroyed.  The same atoms are present before and after a reaction takes place; they are just rearranged.  This is called the '''Law of Conservation of Matter''', and we can use this law to help us find the right coefficients to balance an equation.

For example, assume in the above equation that we do not know how many moles of ammonia gas will be produced:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{2} + 3{\hbox{H}_{2}} \to {\color{Red}?}\hbox{NH}_{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


From the left side of this equation, we see that there are 2 atoms of nitrogen gas in the molecule N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2 atoms per molecule x 1 molecule), and 6 atoms of hydrogen gas in the 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (2 atoms per molecule x 3 molecules). Because of the Law of Conservation of Matter, there must also be 2 atoms nitrogen gas and 6 atoms of hydrogen gas on the right side. Since each molecule of the resultant ammonia gas (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) contains 1 atom of nitrogen and 3 atoms of hydrogen, 2 molecules are needed to obtain 2 atoms of nitrogen and 6 atoms of hydrogen.

=== An Example ===

{| style=&quot;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=10px cellspacing=10px
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_2 + {\hbox{H}_{2}} \to \hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

| This chemical equation shows the compounds being consumed and produced; however, it does not appropriately deal with the quantities of the compounds. There appear to be two oxygen atoms on the left and only one on the right.  But we know that there should be the same number of atoms on both sides. This equation is said to be '''unbalanced''', because the number of atoms are different.  
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{O}_{{\color{Blue}2}} + {\color{Blue}2}{\hbox{H}_{2}} \to {\color{Blue}2}\hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| To make the equation balanced, add coefficients in front of each molecule as needed.  The 2 in front of hydrogen on the left indicates that twice as many atoms of hydrogen are needed to react with a certain number of oxygen atoms.  The coefficient 1 is not written, since it assumed in the absence of any coefficient.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{2} + {\hbox{H}_{2}} \to \hbox{NH}_{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| Now, let's consider a similar reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen.
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{{\color{Blue}2}} + {\hbox{H}_{2}} \to {\color{Blue}2}\hbox{NH}_{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| Typically, it is easiest to balance all pure elements last, especially hydrogen. First, by placing a two in front of ammonia, the nitrogens are balanced.
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{{\color{Blue}2}} + {\color{Red}3}{\hbox{H}_{\color{Blue}2}} \to {\color{Blue}2}\hbox{NH}_{\color{Red}3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| This leaves 6 moles of atomic hydrogen in the products and only two moles in the reactants. A coefficient of 3 is then placed in front of the hydrogen to give a fully balanced reaction.
|}


{{Yellow Warning|When balancing a reaction, only coefficients can be changed because changing a subscript would give a different reaction.}}


== Tricks in balancing certain reactions ==

===Combustion===
A combustion reaction is a reaction between a carbon chain (basically, a molecule consisting of carbons, hydrogen, and perhaps oxygen) with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, plus heat. Combustion reactions could get very complex:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{C}_6\hbox{H}_6 + 15\hbox{O}_2 \to 12 \hbox{CO}_2 + 6\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Fortunately, there is an easy way to balance these reactions.

First, note that the carbon in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can only appear on the product side in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, we can write a coefficient of 6 in front of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Next, note that the hydrogen in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can only go to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Thus, we put a 3 in front of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
CR7 rules..hala Madrid 


We have 15 oxygen atoms on the product side, so there are &lt;math&gt;\frac{15}{2}&lt;/math&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules on the reactant side. To make this an integer, we multiply all coefficients by 2.

=== Another Example ===
{{Helpful hint|hint='''Note:''' Fractions are technically allowed as coefficients, but they are generally avoided.  Multiply all coefficients by the denominator to remove a fraction.}}

{| style=&quot;background:white;&quot; cellpadding=10px cellspacing=10px
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_{4}\hbox{H}_{10} + {\hbox{O}_{2}} \to \hbox{CO}_{2} + \hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| As reactions become more complex, they become more difficult to balance. For example, the combustion of [[w:butane|butane]] (lighter fluid).
|-
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_{\color{Red}4}\hbox{H}_{\color{Blue}10} + {\hbox{O}_{2}} \to {\color{Red}4}\hbox{CO}_{2} + {\color{Blue}5}\hbox{H}_{\color{Blue}2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| Once again, it is better to leave pure elements until the end, so first we'll balance carbon and hydrogen. Oxygen can then be balanced after. It is easy to see that one mole of butane will produce four moles of carbon dioxide and five moles of water.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\color{OliveGreen}2}\hbox{C}_{4}\hbox{H}_{10} + {\hbox{O}_{\color{OliveGreen}2}} \to {\color{OliveGreen}8}\hbox{CO}_{2} + {\color{OliveGreen}10}\hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| Now there are 13 oxygen atoms on the right and two on the left. The odd number of oxygens prevents balancing with elemental oxygen. Because elemental oxygen is diatomic, this problem comes up in nearly every combustion reaction. Simply double every species except for oxygen to get an even number of oxygen atoms in the product.
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{C}_{4}\hbox{H}_{10} + {\color{Blue}13}{\hbox{O}_{\color{Blue}2}} \to {\color{Blue}8}\hbox{CO}_{\color{Blue}2} + {\color{Blue}10}\hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|The carbon and hydrogens are still balanced, and now there are an even number of oxygens in the product. Finally, the reaction can be balanced.
|}

==Overall Structure==
The general structure of information in the book was developed from pages already here. It seems to make sense logically, and works quite well as a wiki.

*Topic 1
**Module 1
**Module 2
*Topic 2
**Module 1
**Module 2

Each topic is one reasonably defined area of study (e.g. Acids and Bases, Basic Quantum Chemistry). Each module should contain one specific concept or idea to learn (e.g. Covalent Bonding, Lewis Acids and Bases). Each module is one page, but can contain multiple subheadings.

This layout corresponds roughly to Chapters and Subchapters in a &quot;paper and ink&quot; textbook.

'''Note: Chemistries of the Various Elements''' should ''not'' contain details like melting point, boiling point, mass, and a list of every possible use and source of the element.  That is what Wikipedia is for.  Rather, it should point out the most unique and interesting properties of the elements, and more importantly, supply some significant chemical reactions involving the elements.

==Technical Points==
Each page should begin with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:GeneralChemTOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; so people can find their way around.

Each page should end with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to put the page in the proper category (General Chemistry).

      <comment>/* Acid Dissociation Constant */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Chemical Equilibria/Le Chatelier's Principle|next=Chemical Equilibria/Solutions in Equilibrium}}

Consider an acid, HA, in water. According to the Brønsted-Lowry acid/base theory, the acid should protonate the water to form hydronium and the ''conjugate base'', A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. There will be an '''equilibrium''' between the acid and water, and hydronium and the conjugate base.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HA} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{A}^-&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This equilibrium can be used to calculate the concentrations of species in the solution.

==Acid Dissociation Constant==
Like all equilibria, an acid/base dissociation will have a particular '''equilibrium constant''' which will determine the extent of the reaction (whether it lies to the left or right of the equation). As the equilibrium constant approaches zero, the reaction tends to form 100% reactants. As the equilibrium constant approaches infinity, the reaction tends to form 100% products. The equilibrium constant K=1 states that there will be 50% products and 50% reactants.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{[\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+][\hbox{A}^-]}{[\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}][\hbox{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{Helpful hint|hint=Strong acids/bases dissociate completely, so their equilibrium constants are overwhelmingly large.}}
Because the equilibrium is used for calculating the concentrations of weak acids, very little water actually reacts. The concentration of water during the reaction is, therefore, a constant, and can be excluded from the expression for K. This gives rise to a special equilibrium constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, known as the '''acid dissociation constant'''. It is simply K multiplied by the concentration of water.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_a = \hbox{K}[\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}] = \frac{[\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+][\hbox{A}^-]}{[\hbox{HA}]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

''The K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of a weak acid determines how acidic it is, i.e., how far its equilibrium lies to the right.'' The K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of weak acids can and have been determined experimentally.

==Base Dissociation Constant==
A similar equilibrium exists when a weak base is dissolved in water. The base will accept a proton from water and form a conjugate acid, BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{B} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{OH}^- + \hbox{BH}^+&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This equilibrium has its own special constant, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, known as the '''base dissociation constant'''. Like the acid dissociation constant, it is defined as the equilibrium constant multiplied by the concentration of water.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_b = K[\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}] = \frac{[\hbox{BH}^+][\hbox{OH}^-]}{[\hbox{B}]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Ion Product Constant==
A special equilibrium exists between ordinary water molecules. Occasionally, one water molecule will act as an acid, and donate a proton to another water molecule (which acts as a base). This is the ''auto-ionization'' of water.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \leftrightarrow \hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+ + \hbox{OH}^-&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

By the Le Chatelier Principle, we can see that if the hydronium ion concentration is increased (by adding an acid), the equilibrium will move to the left and there will be a ''lower'' concentration of hydroxide. Thus, hydronium and hydroxide concentration are inversely related—an increase in one will result in a decrease in the other, and vice versa.

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is given a special name, K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;. Because it simplifies to the product of hydronium and hydroxide concentration, it is sometimes called the '''ion product''' constant. The value of this constant is 1.0 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&amp;deg;C.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_w = [\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+][\hbox{OH}^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This expression can be used to find the pH of pure water. Recall that pH is the negative logarithm of hydronium ion concentration. If we set the hydronium ion concentration in the above expression to be x, we can derive the pH. The hydroxide ion concentration must also be x (since each molecule of hydroxide is a result of a molecule of hydronium forming). We have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x^2 &amp;=&amp; 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \\
x &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{1.0 \times 10^{-14}} \\
x &amp;=&amp; 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \\
\hbox{pH} &amp;=&amp; -\log{1.0 \times 10^{-7}} \\
\hbox{pH} &amp;=&amp; 7.0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This technique can be used to determine the pH of any solution if either one of the ion concentrations are known.

==Conjugate Base Expressions==
The conjugate bases of weak acids have a  relationship with their parent acids. Consider the equilibrium expression of the conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, of the weak acid HA.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_b = {\frac{[\hbox{HA}][\hbox{OH}^-]}{\hbox{A}^-}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If we multiply the expression for an acid by the expression for its conjugate base, the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base cancel and we obtain the ion product constant for water! This allows us to calculate the K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; of a base if the K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its conjugate acid is known (and vice versa).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{[\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+][\hbox{A}^-]}{[\hbox{HA}]} &amp;\times&amp; \frac{[\hbox{HA}][\hbox{OH}^-]}{[\hbox {A}^-]} &amp;=&amp; [\hbox{H}_3\hbox{O}^+][\hbox{OH}^-] \\
K_a &amp;\times&amp; K_b &amp;=&amp; K_w \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Summary==
The definitions of the acid and base '''dissociation constants''' are very important. They are presented here for reference.

&lt;center&gt;

== Functions have an Independent Variable and a Dependent Variable  ==

When we look at a function such as &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac {1}{2}x,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;we call the variable that we are changing--in this case &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;--the independent variable.  We assign the value of the function to a variable we call the dependent variable.  The reason that we say that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is independent is because we can pick any value for which the function is defined--in this case real &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is implied--as an input into the function.  Once we pick the value of the independent variable the same result will always come out of the function.  We say the result is assigned to the dependent variable, since it depends on what value we placed into the function.  

Equating &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;with our function &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y = \frac {1}{2}x,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; 2y = 2(\frac {1}{2}x),&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; 2y = x,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; g(y)= 2y.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The independent variable is now &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and the dependent variable &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.\,&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Note:''' &lt;u&gt;this is a very unusual case&lt;/u&gt; where the ordered pair &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(g(y),y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is reverse mapped &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\mapsto x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and corresponding reverses (dependent, independent), (range, domain), and now &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;must be singular for each and every &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;corresponding to an &lt;u&gt;horizontal&lt;/u&gt; line test of function! It would be less desireable to rotate or swap the positions of axes, the order of coordinate pairs &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and (abscissa, ordinate).

Have we used Algebra to change the nature of the function? Let's look at the results for three functions

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; !! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;g(y) = 2y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; !! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;h(x)=2x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;
|-
| 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; !! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; 
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;2\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-2\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-1\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
|| 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; !! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;g(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; 
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;2\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-1\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;|| &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-2\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
|| 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; !! &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;h(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; 
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;2\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-1\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;-2\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
|}

If we look at the table above we can see that the independent variable for &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;gives the same results as the dependent variable of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;g(y).\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;We can see what this means when we look at the values for &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;h(x).\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;The function &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;g(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is the same as the function &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x),\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;but when we switch which variable we use as the independent variable between &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;g(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;h(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;we see that we have discovered that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;g(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;h(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;are inverse functions.

Let's take a look at how we can draw functions in &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and then come back and look at this idea of independent and dependent variables again.

=== Explicit and Implicit Functions ===

Variables like &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;formulate a 'relation' using simple algebra. &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;g,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;h\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;commonly denote functions. Function notation &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x),\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;read &quot;eff of ex&quot;, denotes a function with 'explicit' dependence on the independent variable &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;By assigning variable &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;to &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x),\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y=f(x),\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is now an 'implicit' function of &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;using equation notation. If &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{2},&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{x}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; [ &lt;math&gt;y(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;would denote an 'explicit' function of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; ]. A relation is also a function when the dependent variable has one and only one value for each and every independent variable value.

==The Cartesian Coordinate System==

The Cartesian Coordinate System is a uniform retangular grid used for plane graph plots. It's named after pioneer of analytic geometry, 17th century French mathematician René Descartes, whom's Latinized name was Renatus Cartesius. Recall that each point has a unique location, different from every other point.  We know that a line is a collection of points.  If we pick a direction of travel for the line that starts at a point then all of the other points can be thought of as either behind our starting point or ahead of it.  Finally, a plane can be thought of as a collection of lines that are parallel to each other. We can draw another line that is composed of one point from each of the lines that we chose to fill our plane.  If we do this then we can locate the other lines as behind or ahead of the line with the point we chose to start on.  Descartes decided to pick a line and call it the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis, and to then pick a line perpendicular to this line and call it the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis.  He then labeled this intersection point &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; (0,0)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and origin '''O'''. The points to the left (or behind) of this point each represent a negative number that we label as &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(-x,0).\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;The points to the right (or ahead) of this point each represent a positive number that we label as &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; (x,0).\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;The points on the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis that are above &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; 0,0\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;are labeled as positive &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; (0,y),\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and the points on the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis below &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; 0,0\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;are labeled as negative &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; (0,-y).\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;A point is plotted as a location on the plane using its coordinates from the grid formed by the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -axes.  If you draw a line perpendicular to the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis from a point you pick then that point has the same &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt; -coordinate as the point where that line crosses the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis.  If you draw a line perpendicular to the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis from your point then it has the same &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -coordinate as the point where that line crosses the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -axis.

An equation and its graph can be referred to as equal. This is true since a graph is a representation of a specific equation.  This is because an equation is a group of one or more variables along with one or more numbers and an equal sign ( &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x=1,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=x+1,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=x^2+2x+1\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;are all examples of equations).  Since variables were introduced as way of representing the many possible numbers that could be plugged into the equation. A graph of an equation is a way of drawing the relationship between the numbers that can be input (the independent variable) and the possible outputs that would be produced.  For example, in the equation: &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=x+2,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;we could choose to make the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;the independent variable and the output number would be two more than the input number every time. The graph of this equation would be a picture showing this relationship. On the graph, each &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,&lt;/math&gt; -value (the vertical axis) would be two higher than the (horizontal) &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x\,&lt;/math&gt; -value that is plugged in because of the &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; +\, 2\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;in the equation.

==Linear Equations and Functions==

This section shows the different ways we can algebraically write a linear function. We will spend some time looking at a way called the &quot;slope intercept form&quot; that has the equation &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y = f(x) = m x + b\,.\, &lt;/math&gt;
*[[Algebra/Linear Equations and Functions|Linear Equations and Functions]]

Unless a domain for &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; x \, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is otherwise stated, the domain for linear functions will be assumed to be all real numbers &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and so the lines in graphs of all linear functions extend infinitely in both directions.  Also in linear functions with all real number domains, the range of a linear function may cover the entire set of real numbers for &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y\,,\, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;one exception is when the slope &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; m=0 \, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and the function equals a constant. In such cases, the range is simply the constant. Another would be a squaring function where the range would be non-negative when &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;b=0\,.\,&lt;/math&gt;

==The ''y''-intercept constant ''b''==

It was shown that &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)=mx+b\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;has infinite solutions (in the UK, &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=mx+c\,;\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;also common &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=ax+b\,,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=a_1x+a_0\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y=-\frac{A}{B}x-\frac{C}{B}\,&lt;/math&gt; ). Points &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;will be mapped with independent variable &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;assuming the horizontal axis and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;vertical on a Cartesian grid. By assigning &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;to a value and evaluating &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;a (single) point coordinate solution is found. When &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x=0\,,\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then by [[wikipedia:zero-product property|zero-product property]] term &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m\times x=0\,&lt;/math&gt; , &amp;nbsp;and by [[wikipedia:additive identity|additive identity]] terms &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;0+b=b=y\,.\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;The point &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(0,b)\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is the unique member of the line (linear equation's solution) where the y-axis is 'intercepted'. More about intercepts link: &amp;nbsp;[[Algebra/Intercepts|The &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;Intercepts]]

== What does the m tell us when we have the equation &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; y = f(x) = m x + b \, &lt;/math&gt; ? ==
&lt;math&gt; m \, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is a constant called the '''slope''' of the line.
Slope indicates the steepness of the line.

====Slope====

Two separate points fixed anywhere defines a unique straight line containing the points.  Confining this study to plane geometry ('''&lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt;''') and fixing coordinates for unique points at &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x_{1},y_{1})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x_{2},y_{2})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;a straight line is defined relating two variables in a linear-equation mappable on a graph-plot. When the two points are identical, infinite lines result, even in a single plane.  When &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_{1}=x_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then a vertical-line mere relation is defined, not a function. Functions are equation-relations evaluating to singularly unique dependent values. Only when (iff) &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_{1}\neq x_{2},\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;then is the line containing the points a linear 'function' of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a linear function, the slope can be determined from any two known points of the line.  The slope corresponds to an increment or change in the vertical direction divided by a corresponding increment or change in the horizontal direction between any different points of the straight line.
&lt;br&gt;  
Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta y=\,&lt;/math&gt; increment or change in the &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; -direction (vertical)   and&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt; \Delta x=\,&lt;/math&gt; increment or change in the &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; -direction (horizontal).&lt;br&gt;
For two points &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x_{1},y_{1})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x_{2},y_{2}),\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;the slope of the function line m is given by: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac {y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} &lt;/math&gt;

*This formula is called the formula for slope measure but is sometimes referred to as the slope formula.

For a linear function, fixing two unique points of the line or fixing the slope and any one point of the line is enough to determine the line and identify it by an equation.  There is an equation form for a linear function called the '''point-slope form''' of a line&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which uses the slope &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;and any one point &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(x_{1},y_{1})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;to determine a valid equation for the function's line:
&lt;math&gt; y - y_1 = m (x - x_1) \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[Algebra/Standard Form and Solving Slope]]

===Intercept Form of a Line===
There is one more general form of a linear function we will cover.  This is the '''intercept form''' of a line, where the constants a and b are such that (a,0) is the x-intercept point and (0,b) is the &lt;br&gt;y-intercept point.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {x}{a} + \frac {y}{b} = 1 \qquad &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where a &amp;ne; 0  and  b &amp;ne; 0&lt;/center&gt;

Neither constant a nor b can equal 0 because division by 0 is not allowed.  The intercept form of a line cannot be applied when the linear function has the simplified form y = m x because the &lt;br&gt;y-intercept ordinate cannot equal 0.

Multiplying the intercept form of a line by the constants a and b will give

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;b x + a y = a b \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which then becomes equivalent to the general linear equation form A x + B y + C where A = b, B = a, and C = ab.  We now see that neither A nor B can be 0, therefore the intercept form cannot represent horizontal or vertical lines.  Multiplying the intercept form of a line by just b gives  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {b}{a} x + y = b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

if we subtract &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {b}{a} x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we get:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = b - \frac {b}{a} x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which can, in turn, be rearranged to:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = - \frac {b}{a} x + b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which becomes equivalent to the slope-intercept form where the slope m = -b/a.

----
'''Example:''' A graphed line crosses the x-axis at -3 and crosses the y-axis at -6.  What equation can represent this line? What is the slope?

'''Solution:'''  intercept form: &lt;math&gt; \qquad  \frac {x}{-3} + \frac {y}{-6} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Multiplying by -6 gives &lt;math&gt;\frac {-6}{-3} x + y = -6&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = -2 x - 6 \ &lt;/math&gt;

so we see the slope m = -2.

[[Image:Intercept_Form_Example1.PNG|Line y = -2 x - 6 showing intercepts]]&lt;small&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Graph of y = - 2x - 6 showing intercepts.&lt;/small&gt;


The line can also be written as &lt;math&gt;-6 x - 3 y = (-3)(-6) \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;6 x + 3 y = -18 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
----
'''Example:''' Can the equation 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {x}{2} + \frac {y}{4} = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

be transformed into an intercept form of a line, (x/a) + (y/b) =1, to find the intercepts?

'''Solution:''' No, no amount of valid mathematical manipulation can transform it into the intercept form.  Instead multiplying by 4, then subtracting 2x gives 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = -2 x \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which is of the form y = m x where m = -2.  The line intersects the axes at (0,0).  Since the intercepts are both 0, the general intercept form of a line cannot be used.

[[Image:Intercept_Form_Example2.PNG|Line y = -2 x crossing through (0,0)]]

----
'''Example''': Find the slope and function of the line connecting the points (2,1) and (4,4).

'''Solution''': When calculating the slope of a straight line from two points with the preceding formula, it does not matter which is point 1 and which is point 2.  Let's set (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) as (2,1) and (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as (4,4).  Then using the two-point formula for the slope m:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; m = \frac {4 - 1}{4 - 2} = \frac { 3 }{ 2 }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



[[Image:Slope_From_2Points.PNG]]

'''Using the point-slope form:'''

One substitutes the coordinates for either point into the point-slope form as x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  For simplicity, we will use x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2 and y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y - 1 = \frac {3}{2} (x - 2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y - 1 =  \frac {3}{2} x - 3 \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \   y =  \frac {3}{2} x - 2  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


----
'''Using the slope-intercept form:'''

Alternatively, one can solve for b, the y-intercept ordinate, in the general form of a linear function of one variable, y = m x + b.  


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; b = y - m x \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Knowing the slope m, take any known point on the line and substitute the point coordinates and m into this form of a linear function and calculate b.  In this example, (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is used.



:&lt;math&gt; b = y_1 - m x_1 \, &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; b = 1 - \frac {3}{2} \cdot 2 = 1 - 3 = -2 &lt;/math&gt;


Now the constants m and b are both known and the function is written as 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = \frac {3}{2} x - 2  &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or alternatively as &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac {3}{2} x - 2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;small&gt;__________&lt;u&gt;end of example&lt;/u&gt;__________&lt;/small&gt;


For another explanation of slope look here:

[[Algebra/Slope | Slope]]



----
'''Example''': Graph the equation  5x + 2y = 10 and calculate the slope. 

'''Solution''': This fits the general form of a linear equation, so finding two different points are enough to determine the line.  To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x.


                   &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 5x + 2 \cdot 0 = 10 = 5x \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

                     &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x = 10/5 = 2 \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


so the x-intercept point is (2,0).  To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y.


                   &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 5 \cdot 0 + 2y = 10 = 2y \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

                      &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = 10/2 = 5 \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


so the y-intercept point is (0,5).  Drawing a line through (2,0) and (0,5) would produce the following graph.

[[Image:Linear_Equation_Intercepts.PNG|Line 5x + 2y = 10 showing intercepts]] &lt;small&gt;Graph of 5x + 2y = 10 showing intercepts&lt;/small&gt;

To determine the slope m from the two points, one can set (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) as (2,0) and (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as (0,5), or vice versa and calculate as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m = \frac {y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac {5 - 0}{0 - 2} = - \frac {5}{2} = - 2.5  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;small&gt;__________&lt;u&gt;end of example&lt;/u&gt;__________&lt;/small&gt;

==Summary of General Equation Forms of a Line==

The most general form applicable to all lines on a two-dimensional Cartesian graph is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A x + B y = C \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

with three constants, A, B, and C.  These constants are not unique to the line because multiplying the whole equation by a constant factor gives a new set of valid constants for the same line.  When B = 0, the rest of the equation represents a vertical line, which is not a function.  If B &amp;ne; 0, then the line is a function.  Such a linear function can be represented by the '''slope-intercept form''' which has two constants.  

slope-intercept form:  &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = m x + b \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The two constants, m and b, used together are unique to the line.  In other words, a certain line can have only one pair of values for m and b in this form.  

The '''point-slope form''' given here

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y - y_1 = m (x - x_1) \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

uses three constants; m is unique for a given line; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are not unique and can be from any point on the line.  The point-slope cannot represent a vertical line.  

The '''intercept form''' of a line, given here,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {x}{a} + \frac {y}{b} = 1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a &amp;ne; 0  and  b &amp;ne; 0&lt;/center&gt;

uses two unique constants which are the x and y intercepts, but cannot be made to represent horizontal or vertical lines or lines crossing through (0,0).  It is the least applicable of the general forms in this summary.  

Of the last three general forms of a linear function, the slope-intercept form is the most useful because it uses only constants unique to a given line and can represent any linear function.  All of the problems in this book and in mathematics in general can be solved without using the point-slope form or the intercept form unless they are specifically called for in a problem.  Generally, problems involving linear functions can be solved using the slope-intercept form &lt;br&gt;(y = m x + b) and the formula for slope.

==Discontinuity in Otherwise Linear Equations==

Let variable&amp;nbsp;''y'' be dependent upon a function of independent variable&amp;nbsp;''x''
:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; also&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;y(x)=f \,.&lt;/math&gt;
''y'' is also the function&amp;nbsp;''f'', and ''x'' is also the argument&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). Let ''y'' be the expressed quotient function
:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{2x^2-5x+3}{x-1} .&lt;/math&gt;
The graph of ''y'''s solution plots a continuous straight line set of points '''except''' for the point where ''x'' would be 1. Evaluation of the denominator with &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; results in division by zero, an undefined condition not a member element of '''R''' and outside algebraic closure. ''y'' has a '''discontinuity''' (break) and no solution at point 1,-1. It becomes important to treat each side of a  break separately in advanced studies.&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Discontinuous_Linear_Function.PNG]]

''y'''s otherwise linear form can be expressed by an equation '''removed''' of its '''discontinuity'''. Factor &lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;/math&gt; from the &lt;math&gt;2x^2-5x+3&lt;/math&gt; numerator (use '''synthetic division''').
:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{2x^2-5x+3}{x-1} .&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{(2x-3)(x-1)}{(x-1)} .&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y=2x-3 \,,\;x\neq1&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(for all x except 1) .

Reducing its (x-1) [[Wikipedia:multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]] factors (reciprocals) to [[Wikipedia:multiplicative identity|multiplicative identity]] (unity) leaves the &lt;math&gt;(2 x - 3)&lt;/math&gt; factor (with implied universal-factor 1/1). Limiting this simpler function's domain; 'all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; except &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;, where ''x'' is undefined' or simply 'and x ≠ 1' (implying 'and '''R&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;''' ');  equates it to the original function. This expression is a linear function of x, with slope m = 2 and a y-intercept ordinate of -3. The expression &lt;math&gt;2x-3&lt;/math&gt;  evaluates to -1 at x = 1, but function y is undefined (division by zero) at that point. There is a '''discontinuity''' for function y at x = 1. Practically the function has a sort of one-point hole (a skip), shown on the graph as a small hollow circle around that point.  Lines, rays and line segments (and arcs, chords and curves) are shown discontinuous by dashed or dotted lines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: non-linear equations may also be discontinuous--see the subsequent graph plot of the reciprocal function y = 1/x, in which y is discontinuous at x = 0 not just for a point, but over a 'double' [[Wikipedia:asymptote|asymptotic]] [[Wikipedia:extremum|extremum]] '''pole''' along the y-axis. As x is evaluated at smaller magnitudes (both - and +) closer to zero, y approaches no definition in both the - and + mappings of the function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Example:''' What would the graph of the following function look like?

:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac {x^2 - 4}{x + 2} .&lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution:'''
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac {x^2 - 4}{x + 2} = \frac {(x + 2)(x - 2)}{(x + 2)} .&lt;/math&gt;

Reduce the reciprocal (x + 2) factors to unity.  This makes y = x - 2 for all x except x = -2, where there is a discontinuity.  The line y = x - 2 would have a slope m = 1 and a &lt;br&gt;y-intercept ordinate of -2.  So for the final answer , we graph a line with a slope of 1 and a y-intercept of -2, and we show a discontinuity at x = -2, where y would otherwise have been equal to -4.

[[Image:Example_Discontinuity_Linear_Function.PNG]]

'''Example:''' Write a function which would be graphed as a line the same as y = 2 x - 3 except with two discontinuities, one at x = 0 and another at x = 1.

'''Solution:''' The function must have a denominator with the factors

&lt;center&gt;denominator = (x - 0)(x - 1) = x (x - 1) .&lt;/center&gt;
to have 'zeros' at the two x values. The function's numerator also gets the factors preserving an overall factor of unity, the expressions are multiplied out:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = \frac {(2 x - 3) x (x - 1)}{x (x - 1)}= \frac {2 x^3 - 5 x^2 + 3 x}{x^2 - x} . &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;small&gt;__________&lt;u&gt;end of example&lt;/u&gt;__________&lt;/small&gt;</text>

| style=&quot;vertical-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px&quot;&gt;This project discovers the history of Modern Europe, starting at the Hundred Years War and ending at the present time.

A chronological perspective of history is attempted within this text. Although this is the case, it is also important to understand patterns within European History, therefore chapters will attempt to cover a breadth of material even though their titles might be that of a specific pattern in history rather than a time period.

We don't need to economize on words to fit some book-length constraint, so I believe that textbooks here should encourage multiple explanations for topics.

[[File:Pompeiii.Europa.iFresco.jpg|thumb|right|A fresco from Pompeii showing a scene from the myth of Europa. This scene represents the capture of Europa by Zeus who had disguised himself as a bull.]]

This book presents a broad overview of European history, from the end of the Roman empire to the present day, roughly from the fifth century to the twentieth century. This is, of course, a somewhat arbitrary period, but not a wholly unuseful one. Though archaeological evidence shows a Europe of continuous settlement over tens of thousands of years, the evidence for the political and sociological order of these communities is scarce if not completely absent. The history of early Europeans is therefore a history of their tools and settlements.  

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neolithic Era (7,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Neolithic period is characterized by the spread of agriculture and pottery. Tools such as the stone axe and microflint are common throughout this period though their origins predate the Neolithic. The stone axe, though rudimentary in its design, is perfectly capable of forest clearance. It is only natural to presume that tools made of wood were also available to Neolithic man and with the rise of agriculture the need for wood yokes and ploughs. However wood is not a durable material and therefore archaeological finds are rare. Evidence for agrarian societies dates back to 9,000 BCE on the Asian continent and it is believed that agricultural practices spread over the course of two millennia into Europe. There is an argument for independent development of technologies not influenced by any other source except the internal ingenuity of the community itself though further investigation will be needed to give full credence to this idea. For our purposes we will view the spread of Neolithic technology as reliant on societies being in contact with one another and will adhere to the east to west advancement theories. 

&lt;b&gt;The Aegean Sea and Southern Europe&lt;/b&gt;

The earliest evidence for European agriculture is found at Knossos, Crete and dates from the sixth millennium BCE. The Aegean sea with its numerous islands within short distance from one another and clement weather provided ideal conditions for settlement. Successive waves of migration by different tribal peoples from the east led to the establishment of communities throughout the Aegean and also along the coastal areas of modern day Turkey and Greece. It is no coincidence that the Romans believed themselves descendants of Aeneas; the legendary hero of Troy; for in the legends and myths of Classical europe lies the eastern pantheon of gods and heroes. Crete as one of the largest islands in the Aegean and situated between the coast of North Africa, the Southern European peninsula and the coast of Asia Minor with natural resources more abundant than smaller Aegean islands and a land mass large enough to support a sizeable population was ideal for colonization. The settlers of Crete arriving in 6,500 BCE brought with them the agricultural practices of the East and seafaring skills; two factors that were to play a large part in their eventual rise as a major force in the Aegean. 

On the mainland of central Greece in the region of Thessaly; hundreds of neolithic dwellings have been discovered through field archaeology, arial mapping and spectrum analysis by satellites. The alluvial plains of the region were attractive to communities based on agriculture and animal husbandry. The analysis of sherds and dwellings show a common culture amongst these sites with the pottery showing a distinctive style and the &quot;wattle and daub&quot; technique of architecture. 

&lt;b&gt;Northern Europe&lt;/b&gt;

The prehistoric Pile Dwellings of Vingelz in Switzerland (3,000 BCE) with its stone axe &quot;factory&quot; and dwellings near a water source are typical of other agrarian sites found in France, Germany, Austria and many other parts of Europe. These neolithic &quot;villages&quot; built near the lake shores and wetlands of the Alps show a continous settlement of 4,500 years. The Alps were no impediment to trade with archaeological finds of sherds, stone tools and dwelling structures showing similarities that can only be explained by contact and mutual exchange. These neolithic &quot;villages&quot; were probably trading and intermarrying across the Alps though this was in some respects limited by small population numbers and structured by family and tribal identification rather than nationhood.   

It must be borne in mind by the reader that the regions of Europe developed at different times though extensive trade networks across Europe existed at this period. This fact does allow for a certain degree of uniformity within periods so that we can group early European periods according to archaelological finds; normally to do with tools, utensils and weapons. 

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Bronze Age (3,000 BCE to 700 BCE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The rise of the Minoan (3000 BCE to 1100 BCE) and Mycenaean civilizations and their influence on the Aegean islands and mainland Greece shapes the earliest history of Southern Europe. The discovery of these early civilizations was a result of investigations by a new breed of archaeologists in the 1800s who studied the classical literature of the Ancient world for its historical value rather than its mythical content. The decriptions of kings and cities mentioned in the Iliad were investigated for ethnographical and geographical clues as to their location. Heinrich Schliemann and Arthur Evans were two pioneers in this type of investigation. Schliemann went in search of the city of Troy on the coast of modern day Turkey and Arthur Evans searched for the lost cities of the Aegean islands. Schliemann who had made his fortune from Crimean War contracts turned to an area of Turkey now called Hisarlik. Earlier investigations of the Hisarlik site had led some to propose that this was the fabled lost city of Troy mentioned in the Iliad which thousands of years later is still known to modern audiences by the tale of the wooden horse. Schliemann was the first major excavator of this site and his discovery of Troy is considered to be the first modern investigation of classical history in relation to its myths and literature. It was not long after Schliemann's discovery that Arthur Evans discovered the Minoan civilization on Crete. Schliemann was to make one more great discovery; the Mycenean civilization that dominated the Aegean islands. Of special importance to Europeans is the discovery of the Linear B tablets at Knossos (Crete) by Arthur Evans. These clay tablets contain a form of archaic Greek from the 2nd millennium BCE. This is the oldest Greek (European) written language known to us and therefore its importance in relation to Homer's Iliad is fundamental to our understanding and investigation of the Aegean world during the Bronze Age. 

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Classical Period (700 BCE to 500 CE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

[[File:The Parthenon in Athens.jpg|thumb|right|The Parthenon in Athens.]]

The rise of the Greek city state from 1000 BCE onwards is in part a continuation of the hegemony that the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations imposed upon the region. However the Greeks took a distinctly different view of the city state and developed forms of government that relied on citizen participation of which Athens in the fifth century BCE is considered to be the high point. One of the unusual aspects of Greek society was the existence of the city state of Sparta situated on the Southern Peloponnese. Sparta was a formidible regional military power and a rival to Athens throughout the classical period. It was of interest to such Athenians as the philosopher Plato who examines the various forms of government in his book &lt;i&gt;The Republic&lt;/i&gt; including the warrior caste system as found in Sparta. The action of the 300 Spartans who defended the pass at Thermopylae against the invading army of Persia is still considered as encapsulating the essence of the Spartan city state. In the other city states of Greece, whether ruled by a dictator, king or democracy, the Spartan austerity and discipline directed towards the formation of a military state ruled by an elite oligarchy was both admired and feared. The history of mainland Greece is tied to the conflict between Athens and Sparta; both forming alliances with other Greek city states to create leagues. The Delian League representing the interests of Athens and her allies with its counterpart The Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. The idea of the city state as an independent power was so strong that Greek city states only overcame their enmity when faced with a foreign invasion that equally threatened them all. Once a foreign threat was removed the city states reverted back to open hostility towards one another. Eventually this internal friction between the Greek city states allowed the Macedonians to gain control of all Greece. The Romans viewed this Macedonian expansion as a threat and the conflict that would later arise would lead to Roman domination of all Greece.      

The height of Athens in the 5th century BCE is also the starting point for the expansion of a Rome which was then a city surrounded by other tribes and city states. Rome's expansion started initially as a form of alliances or aggressions against other Latium kingdoms with a view to securing a central role in the region. Eventually as Rome's strength grew so did its expansion and soon the city states of Magna Graecia (Greek cities of southern Italy) felt obliged to form an alliance with Rome. Internal tribal divisions in Italy led to Rome's war with the Samnites (central Italian tribe) who were threatening the Greek city states of Italy. Rome's wars with Carthage further entrenched Rome's position in the region. Rome had subdued the Etruscans north of its city and the surrounding tribes. It had fought and been victorious against tribes in the central region. Southern Italy now came under Rome's hegemony as a guard against further Carthaginian expansion through their political alliances with Aegean kingdoms opposed to Roman power. Rome had become master of all Italy by 272 BCE. This domination of Italy led Rome to feel confident enough to launch military operations against Carthage. Italy which had for so long defended itself against Carthage's military was now on the offensive. Eventually Rome would attack Carthage itself in 148 BCE and divest them of their Aegean interests and Spain after they sued for peace. Rome had now extended its control to the whole of the Aegean and coastal areas of Spain. Carthage was destroyed and habitation of the city was disallowed by the Romans.  

Rome's empire reached its zenith during the Augustan period (50 BCE to 20 CE). Though Rome as a republic already had extensive territorial conquests, it was during the reign of Augustus that the empire achieved its greatest territorial expansion. From that period on Rome the Republic would never exist in anything except the imaginations of its historians and people. The reign of Augustus heralded the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire. Though the banner &quot;SPQR&quot; (Senatus Populusque Romanus - The Senate and People Of Rome) flew, its stated republican values now bowed to the will of the emperor. The Augustan period is seen as a golden age for Rome - the relative peace and stability during the reign of Augustus allowed Roman writers and arts to flourish. For the next 400 years Rome would be the greatest power in the world, though eventually, during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, the pressures of empire led to Rome relinquishing its hold over its provinces. 

Whilst the collapse of the Roman empire from the 4th century CE onward saw a contraction of the connections that tied the urbanized centers of Europe together (as evidenced in the decline of road building and maintenance), it did lay the foundation for the inward-looking reorganization of Roman provinces, which by the eleventh century had created an abundance of small regional states. From the eleventh century onward these small regional states started to change into the precursors of today's modern European nations. This was in part driven by the invention of banking, international commerce and the rise of mercantile states like Venice which controlled the trade from the East. The fifth century CE is, then, a useful starting point, for it forms a historical boundary between the ancient and modern.

==Geography==

Europe is not a discrete geographical unit, and it is too easy to see it as such, when in reality the cultures of Europe flow across its borders. The medieval peasants of Italy or Spain, for instance, shared far more in common with their close neighbours in North Africa than they did with their counterparts in Germany or England. Similarly, large parts of Eastern Europe, most particularly Russia, show significant cultural influence from Asian cultures, and were historically more closely connected with the east than the west.

A significant problem, therefore, is the porous nature of Europe's geographical borders. In the south, Europe's Mediterranean countries are only a short sail from the ports of North Africa. In the south-east, Europe is separated from Asia by nothing more than the short channel of the Bosphorus, and the most significant cultures in this region, such as the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Turks, were spread between modern Greece and Turkey. In Europe's far eastern reaches the continent is separated from Asia by the Ural mountains, and weather, rather than geography, is the most significant bar for travel between east and west. It is only to Europe's west, with the Atlantic Ocean, that we see a clear and significant geographical barrier.

The response to this problem is to accept that treating Europe as a discrete unit is somewhat arbitrary. It is essential, in any history, to define one's field of study, and to treat Europe as a unit is one way of achieving this aim. Providing one bears this in mind, the problem of European geography is not a problem at all. The somewhat arbitrary geographical borders of Europe need not detract from attempts to investigate the history of individual regions within the continent.

==How To Approach Historical Investigation==

History is frequently seen in narrative terms, as a story concerning the activities of our collective ancestors. It is true, to a great extent, that history is a form of storytelling, after all. However, unlike other forms of storytelling, history is closely based on real events and, as such, is shaped by certain rules and guidelines.

The most important of these govern how the historian reads source material. Before the historian can confidently say that a particular event occurred, he or she requires evidence. Much of the evidence is documentary in form, such as written records left by past generations in the course of everyday life. It is rare for these documents to have been written for the consumption of future generations, so it is important for the historian to understand the forces that shaped the production of these documents.

There are a number of criteria for this:

* What ''motivated'' this person to act?
* What were the ''prevailing attitudes'' at the time regarding this issue?
* How did ''previous events'' cause this one?
* What are ''similar events'' and how did they turn out?
* How will this event matter in the ''future''?
* Why does this event ''occur now'' rather than earlier or later?
* How was this event or person affected by ''forces in society''?  These forces could include the church, economic conditions, the government, geography, the education of the person as well as the general education of society, technology, nationalism, culture and traditions, and the class of the person.

This can be summed up in the 'ADAPTIL' method of evaluating historical sources:

* 'A' - consideration of the '''author''' of the source
* 'D' - consideration of the '''date''' of the source
* 'A' - consideration of the source's intended '''audience''' 
* 'P' - consideration of the '''purpose''' of the source
* 'T' - consideration of the '''tone''' of the source
* 'I' - consideration of what the source '''implies''' (inference)
* 'L' - consideration of the '''limitations''' of the source

Using these techniques will allow you to better grasp the events documented throughout this wikibook, and they will allow you to apply your knowledge outside of simple memorization.

All of our contributors hope you find this wikibook a useful method to learn more about European history - whether you are preparing for the Advanced Placement European History Test, a college final, or even if you simply desire to learn more about European history.

== Fall of the Roman Empire == 
[[Image:Constantine Chiaramonti Inv1749.jpg|right|thumb|Colossal head of Emperor Constantine the Great. Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor. (Marble, Roman artwork, 4th century CE)]]

It is normal to speak of the fall of the Roman empire, but in many ways this description is too simple, and can be misleading.  Certainly, the centralized state ruled by Augustus Caesar and his successors disappeared from history.  However, the laws and language that Rome had given to a wide area of Europe persisted in its influence long after the empire had collapsed. 

The Roman empire's later period was riddled with political and social turmoil. Much of the turmoil involved the failing Western empire. From the 3rd century, the Roman empire was under constant attack by internal and external forces. Tribes that Rome had never fully brought under &lt;i&gt;Pax Romana&lt;/i&gt; saw in a weakened Rome the chance to either expand or raid. The cost of maintaining the furthest flung outposts and borders of the empire had meant that a professional army had to be maintained abroad permanently; a costly endeavour for any state in any period. Internally the militarization of the Roman empire meant that the army had become a powerful political force and in the Empire's later stages they played a major role in the choice of Emperor.

Though Rome had conquered east and west, this small city on the Alban Hills in the region of Latium was now finding itself stretched. With a large empire came the need to extend citizenship and this in turn led to emperors being drawn from all over the empire during its last years. These strains upon the very fibre of empire were drawing a line between the eastern and western provinces. The fact that the City of Rome had entered a period of decline and the perennial importance of grain imports from Egypt and other eastern provinces meant that Byzantium (now Istanbul, Turkey, and previously called Constantinople - ''the city of Constantine'') would be used to bind the eastern Roman empire to the west. Constantine I, in attempting to use Constantinople as representative of full intergration of the eastern Roman empire into the Latin western empire, had inadvertently set up the ideal conditions for the breaking of the empire. After Constantine's death the empire in the west saw a period of turmoil as his three sons fought each other for control of Rome. Constantius II eventually became sole emperor after his two brothers were assassinated, and raised his cousin Constantius Gallus to the rank of Ceasar of the eastern empire. The empire was now two distinct powers; a fact that would shape the history of the Medieval period and the course of Christianity for the next thousand years.

The diminishing influence and power of Rome led to a retraction of the roman culture that had once dominated the provinces. Throughout Roman territories, non-Italian citizens whose forbears had adopted Rome as the axis of their world began to give more emphasis to their local identities -- Gauls, Spaniards, Britons, North Africans filled the void left by the departure of Rome's armies and administration by reasserting their own culture and laws. &lt;i&gt;Pax Romana&lt;/i&gt; as decreed by Augustus had already allowed local laws and customs to take precedence over Rome's laws as long as the provinces accepted military and taxation control. In this respect the end of the Roman empire meant that the provinces were now free to organise their own military and economic affairs. However they did not discard all that Rome had offered. Latin had by then become the &lt;i&gt;lingua franca&lt;/i&gt; of politics and trade, and the better traits of Roman law were keenly adopted, especially in regards to codification of laws that were then made accessible to the public and applicable to all citizens. Hostile tribes who had once been repelled by Rome's military might now invaded across the Roman frontier, settling in imperial lands. These tribes were not alien to Roman culture with many of their leaders and people having constant contact with Rome through the political and economic machine of empire. After setting up parallel societies in the areas they invaded, it was only natural that they slowly mixed with the existing Roman population.  This process went on for two to three centuries and resulted in a sweeping change in the makeup of European society within Rome's old boundaries.  The Greek-speaking eastern portion looked now to Byzantium as its centre, and this division of the empire would become permanent in the Europe of later centuries.  

Most significant of Constantine's acts as Emperor was to make a death bed conversion to Christianity. Although the empire moved to Constantinople, the new found papacy remained in Rome, as envisaged by Saint Peter - the symbolic first Pope. To some extent papal power became synonymous with that of the Western Emperor. The secular capital of the Western empire though was at Ravenna. Poor leadership and stress from invasion led to the fall of Rome in 410 to the Visigoths. The Western empire itself fell in 476 at Ravenna.  The remaining Eastern empire was now referred to as the Byzantine empire, after its capital. Italy would not be a unified state again until the 19th century.

== Barbarians Unite ==

As Roman power ebbed, tribes from outside the old borders moved in to fill the vacuum. Visigoths set up a new kingdom in Iberia, while Vandals settled eventually in north Africa. In Britain, Germanic tribes arrived and settled on the east coast in 5CE. These settlers eventually formed small Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which filled the vacuum left by the departure of the Romans. Post-Roman Italy itself came under the sway of the Ostrogoths, whose most influential king, Theoderic, was hailed as a new emperor by the Roman Senate, and had good relations with the Christian pope, but kept his seat of power at Ravenna in northern Italy.  Southern Italy and Sicily were under the sway of the Byzantine Emperor for several centuries during this period.

The province of Gaul, which had been the most prosperous of the Western Roman provinces, came into the possession of the Franks. The Roman-Gaulish society and its leaders eventually assimilated with the Franks, relying on their warriors for security and cementing connections of marriage with Frankish clans.  The new Frankish kingdom came to include much of modern western Germany and northern France, its power within this region made clear by victories over the Visigoths and other barbarian rivals. Today the German word for France, ''Frankreich'', pays homage to the Frankish kingdom of times past. 
 
The Merovingian dynasty, named after the legendary tribal king Merovech, was first to rule over the Frankish realm. Their most skilled and powerful ruler, Clovis, converted to Catholic Christianity in 496 as a promise for victory in battle. At Clovis's death, he divided his kingdom up among his many sons, whose rivalries touched off a century of intermittent and bloody civil war. Some, like Chilperic, were insane, and none were willing to give up lands or power to reunify the kingdom.  The fortunes of the Merovingians ebbed and they faded into irrelevance.

The rise of a new ruling power, the Carolingian dynasty, was the result of the expanded power of the ''Majordomo'', or &quot;head of the house&quot;. Merovingian kings gave their majordomo extensive power to command and control their estates, and some of them used this power to command and control entire territories. Pepin II was one of the first to expand his power so much that he held power over almost all of Gaul. His son, also a majordomo, Charles Martel, won the Battle of Tours against invading Islamic armies, keeping Muslim influence out of most of Europe. &quot;Martel&quot;, meaning &quot;The Hammer&quot;, was a reference to his weapon of choice. 

Martel's son, Pepin III the Short, after requesting support of the papacy, disposed of the Merovingian &quot;puppets&quot;.  The papacy gave Pepin permission to overthrow the Merovingians in order to secure Frankish support of the papal states, and protection against Lombard incursion.  Pepin was declared ''rex Dei gratia'', &quot;King by the grace of God&quot;, thereby setting a powerful precedent for European absolutism, by arguing that it was the Christian God's will to declare someone a king. 

(Both Pepin II and Pepin III were known as Pepin the Younger, as Pepin I was Pepin the Elder. However, Pepin III is also known as Pepin the Short, so that is the name that will be used here.)

[[Image:Karl den store krons av leo III.jpg|thumb|right|''Coronation of Charlemagne'' from the illuminated manuscript Grandes Chroniques de France (1375-79)]]

Pepin the Short was the founder of the Carolingian dynasty, which culminated in his son Charlemagne, &quot;Charles the Great&quot;. Charlemagne was also the first king crowned Holy Roman Emperor -- the supposed successor to the Caesars and the protector of the Catholic Church.  Charlemagne, whose empire expanded by conquest to encompass most of present-day Germany and France, created something of a renaissance for the intellectual world in the Frankish kingdom. Charlemagne set up monasteries and had monks copy out the Bible, in illuminated manuscripts, in rooms called ''scriptoria''. For women, the cloth was one of the few ways they were allowed to expand their intellectual horizons and do something aside from birth children and work in the fields.   

Charlemagne's sons followed Germanic tradition after his death and divided his kingdom between them during the 9th century.  &quot;East and West Francia&quot; emerged, which in the following centuries would be called France and Germany (the latter known as the Holy Roman Empire).  During this time, western Europe's settled regions came under increasing attack by the Vikings or Northmen, independent bands of seagoing warriors from Denmark and Scandinavia whose gods included Thor and Odin, and whose raids on wealthy Christian cities and churches were but one feature of their trade networks, which spanned the Atlantic and Europe from Newfoundland to Byzantium.  Viking activity continued until Norway and Sweden reluctantly accepted Christianity in the 11th and 12th centuries. England, Ireland and French Normandy all saw substantial Viking settlement in this period, with important historical consequences.

In Spain, a Visigothic elective kingdom flourished, with continuous conflicts, until 711, when much of Spain fell quickly to the Muslim invaders. A great Muslim empire, called the Califato de Córdoba, flourished culturally and by arms. In the north mountains, small Christian kingdoms, Galiza, Asturias, Navarra and Aragón, persisted. The border with the Frankish empire, called Marca Hispanica, included Barcelona since 801 -- the origin of the Principality of Catalonia. The Muslims lost their last Spanish kingdom, Granada, in 1492, when the king of Aragón, Fernando, married the Queen of Castille, Isabel, in 1469. The dynastic union, producing grandson Carlos V, maintained the internal borders and different nationalities, laws and institutions of every one of the ancient kingdoms until the 18th century. Navarra was annexed in 1515 and still maintains its own laws and fiscality, as the Basque Country.  Italy&lt;!-- ? The paragraph is about what? Is it Iberia meant? If Italy, should it be better to separate the notion about Italy? --&gt; would begin to split into smaller kingdoms ruled by various different forms of government. However, the papacy would still be able to exert great force over most European people. 

Eastern Europe, more thinly populated and more remote from the Roman borders, experienced numerous invasions and migrations during the 6th to 10th centuries.  From their homeland in southern Russia, Slavic peoples expanded westward in the wake of the Germanic migrations, settling in the Balkans, Bohemia, Poland and eastern Germany and dividing their allegiances among Rome's successors.  The Poles, Czechs, Croats adopted Latin Christianity, while the Bulgarian, Serbian and Russian kings accepted the Greek Byzantine rite. In the middle Bosnians, a small tribe of South Slavs, in highlands of Dinaric Alps, were neither, instead they adopted liturgy of their own and during the 10th century established their Bosnian Church, often confused with Bogomilism since Bosnian rulers showed great deal of tolerance toward them and even protected these people, sometimes with tragic consequences to their own way of life and certainly with historical consequences for entire Balkans. The Magyars, a tribe of mounted warriors ethnically akin to the Huns, entered Europe from the Russian steppes in the 9th century, fought a series of wars with the German emperors who succeeded Charlemagne, and eventually made their home in Hungary as a Latin-Christian kingdom (their king, Stephen, achieving sainthood).  The peoples of the Baltic region, such as the Letts and Prussians, remained largely untouched by the Christian expansion during the early Middle Ages.  In Russia, a kingdom at Kiev had been formed, incorporating both Slavic peoples and Scandinavian elements.

Great Britain was divided into various kingdoms after the Anglo-Saxon-Jute invasion, until the period of the Danish invasions. King Alfred unified much of England into one kingdom in the late 9th century. On October 10th, 1066 William the Bastard, later William the Conqueror, initiated a Norman invasion of England with the Battle of Hastings. French control of England during this period is shown by much of the formal vocabulary in English, which stems from French. 

In 1215 the barons of England forced King John to sign the ''Magna Carta''. King John was particularly despotic. He abused his vassals, killed his child nephew Arthur, and brought the wrath of the Church upon the country in the form of a Papal Interdict (no church services were performed: no marriages, funerals, or masses). His barons ultimately united against him. While he was out hunting, they surrounded him giving him the option of signing the ''Magna Carta'' or death. The ''Magna Carta'' enshrined in law certain rights that the barons were entitled to. Absolute royal power had given way to rule by consensus and the cornerstone for Parliament had been placed.

== Romanesque and Gothic Art == 

[[Image:Notre Dame Altar July 2005.jpg|right|thumb|Gothic architecture: Cathedral of Notre Dame]]

Romanesque is the name given to the architectural style found across Europe from the 10th to 13th century. Borrowing elements from Ancient Roman and Oriental Byzantine architecture in a fusion of opulence and utility. These are the churches of a rich and expanding Christian religion. The rise of religous orders and monasticism; the need to cater for larger congregations as populations expanded; the desire for patronage and remembrance as a christian benefactor and the all powerful need to build churches that reflect the beauty and power of religious sentiment are all key factors in Romanesque architecture. You can be in no doubt when entering the Cathedral at Notre Dame that your corporeal flesh is firmly of &lt;i&gt;terra firma&lt;/i&gt; but your soul belongs to the realms of heaven. Many churches remain from this period which is a testament to the development of new methods of vaulting in masonry rather than wood. The style of the basilica gives way to loftier expressions of  religious architecture. Romanesque architecture is designed to convey the spiritual power and authority of the church. Many castles were also begun at this time and extended later.  The chief characteristics of Romanesque architecture are round-headed arches in windows, doors and arcades, rectangular piers, cylindrical columns, barrel vaults, groin vaults and paired windows.  Late Romanesque churches may have ribbed vaults. Walls are thick and buttresses are flat. Doorways are often surmounted by sculptured tympanum, particularly with sculpture of Christ in Majesty. Interior wall were often frescoed with scenes from the Bible. 

Gothic architecture developed out of Romanesque architecture in France in the early 12th century and spread across Europe, being modified in different regions.  It lasted in some parts of Europe into the 1500s. Gothic architecture, as seen in many of the great churches and cathedrals of Europe, is distinguished by the use of the pointed, ribbed vault.  Later ribbed vaulting became very complex and decorative, particularly in England, Spain and Eastern Europe. The development of projecting buttresses and flying buttresses allowed openings in the walls to be larger and vaults to be higher. Columns and piers often had a cluster of shafts supporting the ribs and mouldings above.  Doors and windows have pointed arches.  Doors were often set into richly carved portals and surrounded by figurative sculpture. Windows became increasingly large and were filled with stone tracery supporting the glazing.  Stained glass became a more important art form than fresco in most of Europe except Italy.  

Manuscript illumination was a major artistic form during the Late Middle Ages.  Manuscripts were copied by hand, often by monks working at the ''scriptoria'' in a monastery.  The books that were thus produced were often ''illuminated'' (decorated with illustrations and ornate borders).  Often the initial letter on a page was illuminated with colour and small scenes.  The style of decoration developed local characteristics, ranging from abstract and floral borders, to detailed landscapes and interior scenes of the Duc du Berry's ''Tres Riches Heures'' by the Limbourg brothers.

Poetry and music were carried between cities by travelling musicians called troubadours. These troubadours would give news from across Europe as they travelled and told songs and stories.  One of the longest Germanic epic poems, ''Beowulf'' tells the tale of the killing of a giant beast that plagued a town.  Another of these epics was the ''Song of Roland'' (based on the attack on the rear guard of Charlemagne's army by the Basques as Charlemagne led his men out of Spain). &lt;br&gt;
:''Merry and bold is now that Emperour, ''  
:''Cordres he holds, the walls are tumbled down,''
:''His catapults have battered town and tow'r.''
:''Great good treasure his knights have placed in pound,''
:''Silver and gold and many a jewelled gown. ''  
:''In that city there is no pagan now''
:''But he been slain, or takes the Christian vow.''

== Papal Power in the Middle Ages ==


The papacy was a powerful institution in medieval Europe. Religion permeated every aspect of society and equally applied to king or farm worker. In medieval Europe the Pope was power-broker and peace-maker with immense spiritual authority in an age where the existence of heaven and hell and one's path to either was examined constantly. The shortness of life, diseases, infant mortality and plague all added to a preoccupation with death and the eternal soul; faith was the medieval mind's medicine. The Popes appointed Bishops, received tithes, issued canonical laws throughout Christendom. They could call for Crusades against any enemy of Christendom; raising armies led by the kings and knights of Europe.  

This must be seen in context by considering the ''nature'' of papal power. Royal power derived from ownership of land, which was essential for raising armies of knights. The papacy held fewer direct assets, and to complicate matters, these could not be passed on by inheritance. This meant that a pope nearing death could only enrich his family by donating Church property, thus siphoning off the assets of the papal court instead of enlarging them. Therefore, the Pope had to rely on other forms of power, and his spiritual authority was always a significant alternative to direct territorial control.

The Pope also attempted through political means to control Europe. He pushed many kings into placing his bishops into powerful secular positions. In response to this European kings chose to put their own bishops into religious positions in a process called lay investiture. Emperor Henry IV sold many bishoprics until he attempted to depose Pope Gregory VII. In response Gregory VII excommunicated him and absolved his vassals of responsibility to him. Henry attempted to hold his kingdom together, but in the face of an angry population terrified for their souls, he went to the Alpine monastery of Canossa to beg the Pope to absolve him, standing outside the walls barefoot in the snow for three days before Gregory VII relented and removed his excommunication. For years the Pope and Holy Roman Empire battled over investiture until Pope Calixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V sat down and executed the ''Concordat of Worms''. The ''Concordat'' gave the Pope the authority to put bishops into religious positions, and the Emperor the authority to put bishops into secular positions. This struggle that ended in the ''Concordat of Worms'' was known as The Investiture Controversy.

The ascetic aspects of Christ had always been prevalent in the lives of christians; from St Augustine to St Francis of Assisi the intellectual introspection and rejection of luxuries had always appealed to those seeking to draw closer to Jesus. This withdrawal to common communtiy had existed in the Middle East at the birth of Christianity. The Jewish sect who hid the Dead Sea Scrolls in caves were just one of many early ascetic communities devoting themselves to a religious life. The Medieval period saw the development of ascetic orders based around monasteries. New orders were formed to follow certain religious aims. St Benedict was the first to mandate a way in which all orders should function. The Benedictine order followed very specific rituals. Among these rituals were precise times for each prayer; it is suggested that this led to the development of the clock, which was developed around the time of the ''Fourth Lateran Council''. The ''Fourth Lateran Council'' set rules for worship for all monastic orders. These rules were heavily based on those of the Cistercians. Citaeux, the father of the Cistercian order, put all of the monasteries into an &quot;Order&quot;, but also allowed them their own regional features. Monks not only developed the intellectual policies of Medieval Europe, but also helped among cities by offering food and services to those in need.

== Society in the Middle Ages ==

Guilds, which controlled who could or could not work in a profession through education and vertical integration, were the first to form universities. Among them were the universities of Salamanca, Paris, and Bologna. ''Scholasticism'', an education philosophy that emphasised teachings of the Bible and Aristotle, was the common form in education.  Renaissance brought forth Humanism and the Liberal Arts. 

Cities began to form as a place to house shops and guilds. Cities were required as centres for trade, and many of the famous medieval cities of Europe were ports. Within these cities money capitalism began to thrive. In the north, the Gilder became a powerful, almost universal currency. Europeans also reopened long-dormant trade routes with China and the Middle East. The Silk Road was traversed once again, and much of Europe's period of exploration and discovery was meant to find easier and faster routes to the East. 

Advances in agriculture were also coming about. Fields became ploughed by large metal grates pulled by draft animals. Europeans also began to leave ground fallow to allow nutrients to come back into the soil, thus starting the concept of crop rotation.  The systems of feudalism and manorialism grew with the new farming methods. Feudalism, the political arm of the Manorial system, organized society into a pyramid structure, with Lords ruling, and below them vassals. A vassal would receive land and in return, they would protect, and answer to those above them. Manorialism, the economic end of this system, was the way in which these large properties were managed. Vassals would farm the land and then trade grain to their Lord for protection, access to storage, a mill to grind the grain, and access to ovens to bake bread produced from this grain. Food was thus provided. However, the flour milled from medieval grain was often very coarse and  harsh on the teeth. Water supplies were often polluted, so grain was also used to make ale which was the main beverage of northern Europeans, while wine remained the potable of choice for southern Europeans.

'''Sauces''' are thickened liquid additions to a recipe, used to enhance the flavor or appearance, or to add moisture.  In the 1800s, the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French chefs]] Antonin Carême and Auguste Escoffier developed a systematic categorization of sauces, based on five &quot;mother sauces&quot;.  All sauces were considered to be a variation of one of these sauces. As other cuisines and ingredients have become more common to world cuisine, the number of mother sauces and sauce families has expanded slightly, but most sauces can be seen as a variation or adaptation of a few basics.

The sauces below are grouped by their family. The first five groups are the traditional sauce families, with the modern additions following. Except for the Dessert family, the top sauce in each family is that family's &quot;mother sauce&quot;. Many of the mother sauces use a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] as the thickening agent.  Roux itself is not really a sauce, as it would not be used alone.

I have programmed a (working) 2D physics system before and I am currently in college as a Physics Engineering major, so I have experience, but I am by no means an industry expert, so I'm going to start this document and hope that either someone who knows this stuff steps in and takes over or guides me so that I can do this correctly.

Also, if my formatting looks bad, any one can feel free to change it.

- Added more to the portion of physics. Hopefully not too lengthy or off-topic.

= About Physics =

Computer programs today simulate physical systems for various purposes, such as realism in games and testing mechanical prototypes before construction.  Added with the current trend of increasing processing power, these physical simulations are continually becoming more complicated and elaborate.  As such where physics is applicable, programs without these capabilities appear more simple and primitive and thus less desirable compared to programs with these abilities.

Not all programs require the full range of computational capabilities.  Most games only require the ability to accurately calculate mechanical processes.  Programs like the ones used to test objects need more complex abilities, like calculating the heat given off by the friction between two surfaces.  Some programs may even find it desirable to perform pseudo-calculations, calculations based upon physics yet tweaked to achieve a more desirable behavior, or they may just represent a very narrow range of processes that can occur.

When programming physics, various different mechanisms of physics, including branching decisions such as collisions between objects, gravity and any other exertional forces taking effect upon objects present, along with various other elements depending upon the given situation, need to be taken into account and compensated for accordingly.

Each different object has its own mass/weight, which is usually dependant upon the size of the object itself. Effectively programming physics generally entails keeping track of the weight of each object, factoring in other forces such as gravity and collisions while calculating the force of each collision, depending on the object weights and perform an action accordingly.

One example of the weight of objects taking an effect on the world around them would be where, when placed upon another object held up by a weak force would then cause that object to lower towards the ground. The types of physics examples that could be programmed to demonstrate this are virtually endless and, for beginners, it is recommended that they attempt basic examples of physics like gravity.

I can write a section on interacting with external programs, like :r ! and :w ! and :make and :K, but I'm not sure where to put it.  Maybe I'll just throw it out there, and if other, better organized people can figure out where to put it.

: Go ahead, but just keep VIM-specific stuff, for example, properly clarified as VIM-specific. Take a look what I did with your .vimrc addition. 
: You could probably create a new page on &quot;interacting with external programs&quot;? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:42, 29 May 2004 (UTC)
----
Idea: should this be put with the section about using other OSS? seems to me like it would fit nicely there. [[User:Dhuss|Dhuss]] 20:01, 2 Sep 2004 (UTC)

: No, some vi versions aren't open source.

== Great book, but split off vim! ==

Hi Dysprosia! I *love* your neat vi book, I am an old vi user too, and I can still find useful hints in there. As you might know, I am in the process of reviewing some of the books to give [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]. Right now I can give your book only 50%, only because of the open sections of the vim part. If you take out the vim part, that doesn`t belong here to my opinion anyway, then I`d give your book a perfect 100%! (also the table of contents is the wrong one for the vim part). Make another book called &quot;vi clones&quot; or something, move those chapters there, and make a link there, like &quot;Other Wikibooks on vi: *...&quot;. Or if you haven`t done it and I have some time, I`ll do it by myself :-)  --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:14, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

Please, consider the following sentence: &quot;Constantine chose to divide the empire among his sons, and because of attacks from barbarians and the fact that Rome was relatively run down chose a new capital at Byzantium (now Constantinople).&quot; This is somewhat misleading. The name of the city is Istanbul. [[User:Smithbrenon|Smithbrenon]] 16:50, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

Please consider rephrasing the following sentence: &quot;Kiev, which would fall under the power of the Mongols in the 13th century and would keep Russia out of European politics until Peter the Great was converted to Christianity in 988 by followers of Methodus and Cyrill...&quot; 
At first read, it sounds like Peter the Great was converted to Christianity in 988! Maybe split the sentence up, change the word order, or punctuation. - James M. Boekbinder

== Constantine ==

&quot;Most significant of Constantine's acts as Emperor was to make a death bed conversion to Christianity.&quot;

That statement doesn't corroborate with the information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I_and_Christianity#Conversion - specifically the following statement:

&quot;Constantine was over 40 when he finally declared himself a Christian.&quot; among others. Constantine was ''baptized'' on his death bed as was common among Christians of that time, but clearly he identified himself as a Christian before his death.
-Brian Beaudry


==Seriously bad == 
You haven't done anywhere near enough research on Romanesque and Gothic architecture to attempt to write about it!  A lot of what is said is ''just plain silly!''  

Also:
*''Manuscript illuminations '''were also a popular artistic outlet''' in Romanesque and Gothic art. ''
: This sounds like cake decoration or scrap-booking.  No, don't use the magazine language &quot;popular outlet&quot;.   
:Try &quot;Manuscript illumination was a major art form of the Middle Ages.'' 
* ''Poetry and music were perpetuated by '''a group of travelling musicians called Troubadours.''''' 
:&quot;A group of travelling musicians&quot;........ Do you really mean a &quot;Group of travelling musicians called Troubadours&quot;?  Think about this!  Were they a &quot;group&quot;?  You have to leave that word out entirely.  

'''Here is a complete rewrite of the architecture section''' 
Some of what is written there now is total and absolute nonsense! 
Before you add this, you need to read it carefully and go over what is in the article, and think about the differences in the information it is really quite simple. 
# you need dates, or else you plainly don't know your stuff
#Romanesque didn't imitate the style of Ancient Rome. It grew out of it, by way of the great Constantinian churches which were built by Romans (OK).  Romanesque was not an imitation. It was a continuing tradition
#Total nonsense about not '''needing''' flying buttresses!  They didn't use them because they hadn't been invented.  Walls had to be thick. 
#Gothic needs a timeframe.  
#Gothic developed from Romanesque. It needs to be said. 
#Differences need to be properly understood, clearly expressed and listed in a logical order so they can be compared.  

* Romanesque architecture is the name given to the style that was found across Europe from the 10th to early 13th centuries and retained some elements of Ancient Roman architecture, in a structurally simplified form.  Many churches remain from this period.  Many castles were also begun at this time and extended later.  The chief characteristics of Romanesque architecture are round-headed arches in windows, doors and arcades, rectangular piers, cylindrical columns, barrel vaults, groin vaults and paired windows.  Late Romanesque churches may have ribbed vaults. Walls are thick and buttresses are flat. Doorways are often surmounted by sculptured tympanum, particularly with sculpture of Christ in Majesty. Interior wall were often frescoed with scenes from the Bible. 
* Gothic architecture developed out of Romanesque architecture in France in the early 12th century and spread across Europe, being modified in different regions.  It lasted in some parts of Europe into the 1500s. Gothic architecture, as seen in many of the great churches and cathedrals of Europe, is distinguished by the use of the pointed, ribbed vault.  Later ribbed vaulting became very complex and decorative, particularly in England, Spain and Eastern Europe. The development of projecting buttresses and flying buttresses allowed openings in the walls to be larger and vaults to be higher. Columns and piers often had a cluster of shafts supporting the ribs and mouldings above.  Doors and windows have pointed arches.  Doors were often set into richly carved portals and surrounded by figurative sculpture. Windows became increasingly large and were filled with stone tracery supporting the glazing.  Stained glass became a more important art form than fresco in most of Europe except Italy.

== Rearranging the content  ==

I was thinking of rearranging the sections so that the introduction and the material from The Fall Of The Roman Empire are together. I would like to move the Geography section and Historical Investigation section to the top.. Historical Investigation followed by Geography. I think its important to outline some of the environmental factors that played a part in Europe's character using geographical descriptions. The topography of Greece should be described to allow readers to understand why Greece looked to the east for trade and more. Also that the islands that form the Aegean cyclades are extensions of the mountain ranges of Europe. A small section on flora and fauna maybe.

If no one objects then I'll rearrange the sections at a later date. Feel free to revert any edits you disagree with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The unit circle in question by definition has a radius equal to 1.  Then the March 20, 2004 definitions of sin, cos, and tan by [[Jedwards]] are correct.  User [[211.29.136.11]] apparently thought that the radius was not specified and set it equal to b, and accordingly divided x and y in the sin and cos definitions by b.  I explained that the unit circle has a radius of 1 by definition, and added a link to the previous section on the unit circle.  The unit circle section is very short and I think I will combine these two sections into one maybe sometime in the future.

German Levels I, II, and III aren't meant to go in order; they're different curriculums. If there was a &quot;Level 1&quot; (as in a year of study), it stops after my lesson 9. This may seem a little small, but the lessons are covering more and more each lesson (for example, I plan to have five times the amount of stuff I have currently on [[German: Beginner Lesson 3|Lesson 3]], plus then there's the problems, answers, and test). I have no idea about the other levels, as to the time it takes to study each lesson.

Thank you for reading what I have in Level I. Honestly, it's the least worked-on of the three levels. It's just less than 3 months old (started on March 6th, 2004), while the rest of the book is about 9 and a half months old (started on October 15th, 2003). Not only that, but I really have been the only writer/editor (see the history for [[German: Beginner Lesson 2|Lesson 2]] for an example). Everyone else on the [[German: Contributors|Contributors page]] is working on Levels 2 and 3. 

Thanks for looking at Level I German. I can't wait for you to finish the European History textbook; it's the one area of history I haven't been taught yet and I won't learn next year, either. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 23:03, 29 May 2004 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ethics is a term.  Many people think ethics has to do with a set of social conventions or a religious decree.  In professional philosophy we do not typically consider this to be the definition of ethics.  Philosophical ethics could be called the study of what is good and bad.  Generally, philosophical ethics concerns itself with discovering a system one may use to determine who or what is good, or with evaluating systems that others have proposed.

The pursuit of moral knowledge dates back to Ancient Greek philosophers, but it is mostly the influence of Enlightenment moral thought that continues to shape ethics today.  There are many well-known figures in the history of ethics, including the Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle, but some of the most important modern influences include such people as Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, D.W. Ross, C.L. Stevenson, Alasdair MacIntyre, and John Rawls.

In ethics, a premium is placed upon defining &quot;the good&quot;.  Different approaches to defining the good, the nature of moral properties, the source of moral knowledge, and the status of moral facts have played an important role in shaping various branches of moral theory.  The three major divisions of ethical philosophy may be called Virtue Ethics, Deontology, and Consequentialism.

Ethical mandates from society and church do not qualify as genuine philosophical ethics.

This last statement causes concern in that it reeks of negative presuppositions.  First of all, ethical mandates ALWAYS have ethical undertones.  It is inescapable.  An ethical mandate may not fit certain schools of thought, but then certain schools of thought can be erroneous.  All ethics are religious by nature, if one defines religion as an attempt to discover the good.  Ethics stem from the question &quot;What is right?&quot;  Whoever decides the answer to that question is a law maker.  Laws are always expressions of religious thought be they theonomic or autonomous.

Ethics is the philosophical attempt to answer Socrates' question of how one should live. This is a very general question, which could for any individual translate to &quot;How should I live?&quot; It is important however to note that not all answers to this question are answers of the ethical type. One could conclude that one should live a self-indulgent life without any kind of logical contradiction. Moral philosophers study this idea, known as “egoism,” as well, and the question &quot;Why be moral?&quot; is because of this distinct from Socrates' question.

It is also important to note that Socrates' question not only allows for non-ethical answers but also answers from different ethical theories. His question is not the same as Kant's question &quot;What is my duty?&quot; or the egoist/utilitarian question of &quot;How can we be happy?&quot; There are many different ways of answering Socrates' question, and answers from the Categorical Imperative to the imperative &quot;Sit on the couch and watch television&quot; are equally answers to it, but Ethics attempts to find through reason the best answer to the question.

Ethics, often called Morality interchangeably, tries to answer &quot;How should one live?&quot; given that we already live in a society. Everyone is born with a place in society even if it is only &quot;Stranger,&quot; and accordingly everyone has expectations for action placed upon them. One is expected to act a certain way as a brother, a friend, and a passer-by. Ethics primarily concerns itself with this realm of individual action. For the most part, ethical theories attempt to develop a system of obligations that we have towards others. Obligations that are common among different theories are the obligation to tell the truth, the obligation to help those in distress, and the obligation not to murder. Of course, most of the theories allow for flexibility based on the situation such as the ability to help in this circumstance and whether one has any other, higher obligations.

The ethical theories of the past have been of many types. Aristotle proposed a theory of virtue, a notion that was already a part of Greek culture. He espoused the view that the good man is one who lives in a way as to allow him to move towards the goal of man-as-such, the telos, and the way to reach the telos is to live a life of virtue.

Another prominent theory has been consequentialism. This theory includes John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism, and its focus is, from its name, on the consequences of one’s actions. General consequentialism will say we have obligations to help people because helping people produces a better result than not helping people. Utilitarianism goes beyond this to mathematize ethics. It quantifies the utility, which it defines as “happiness” or “pleasure,” a given action will produce and weighs that number against the amount of utility produced by another action. Whichever action produces the most utility is the one that is obligated. 

A third common ethical theory is deontology, and its main supporter has been Kant. Deontology is the study of obligations in a very narrow sense. It attempts to divine from reason alone the obligations every man holds simply because he is a rational being. Kant first argues for what he calls the Categorical Imperative, and from that it is possible to derive other universal maxims, which follow the formula “When in situation X, do Y.” Kant has two formulations of his Categorical Imperative. The first is Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. The second, which Kant claims carries the same meaning, is &quot;Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.&quot;

When considering ethics, it is also important to note that the Enlightenment project of justifying morality is judged by some prominent contemporary moral philosophers to have been a failure. These contemporary philosophers take it to be that morality cannot be grounded in reason alone. Three important alternatives are the philosophies of Alasdair MacIntyre, Richard Rorty, and Bernard Williams. MacIntyre advocates a return to the Aristotelian tradition of living out the virtues in reference to the telos, or goal, of man. Rorty is a pragmatist and argues that the question we must ask of every moral obligation is “Is this useful?” He would argue that treating strangers with distrust and keeping promises are good moral principles because they are primarily useful for building a better society. Finally, Williams critiques ethical theory on the whole and the notion of obligation. He also asks why ethics is taken to be a better answer to Socrates’ question than non-ethical answers.

==Types==
'''Normative ethics''' deals with questions of what we ''ought'' to do, or what things are ''good'' to do.
* What behavior (or intentions) are good or bad?
* What kind of things can be adduced as moral justifications (&quot;justifying reasons&quot;) for certain kinds of behavior?
* Is killing another human being (murder) morally acceptable?  Killing an enemy in war?  Ethnic cleansing? Killing a person in self-defense?  Executing a convicted murderer?  Assisting a terminally ill person to die? Killing yourself?  Abortion?  Abortion of a deformed fetus?  Killing of an animal? 
* Do animals have rights?  Do women?  Children?  Mentally handicapped people?
* Is torture ever justified?  Theft?  Lying?  Promise-breaking?
* What is the best way for human beings to lead their lives? 
* What are the justifying reasons for war?  Is there such a thing as a &quot;just war&quot;?
* Can the cultural practices of other times and societies be condemned as immoral?  How about American slavery?  Segregation and apartheid?  Chinese footbinding?  African female genital mutilation?  Mormon or Muslim polygamy?
* What are the proper bounds for the toleration of diversity, or the respect for personal privacy?  Is there a point at which the (proper) toleration of diversity or respect for privacy becomes (improper) passive acceptance of immorality?  What is that point?


'''Meta-ethics''' deals with questions about the nature of ethics.
* What do ethical words such as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;ought&quot; mean?
* What makes a judgment a ''moral'' judgment as opposed to, say, an aesthetic judgment, or an etiquette judgment, or a simple personal preference?
* What is the basis of moral law?  Divine command?  Natural law?  Human nature?  Custom?
* Why should we be moral?  What is the motivational basis of moral behavior?  What &quot;motivating reasons&quot; (as opposed to &quot;justifying reasons&quot; can be made for moral behavior?
* Why do people act morally?  
* Is it possible for some behavior to be right in one society/culture, and wrong in another?
* What is the moral basis for law?  ''Is'' there a moral basis for laws?  ''Should'' there be a moral basis for law?  Should we try to enforce moral behavior by legal means?

'''History of Ethics''' deals with the study of what philosophers have written in the past on the subject of ethics.

The boundary is not always sharply-drawn between questions of normative ethics and meta-ethics.  Ethical questions can easily shade off into other areas of philosophy, for example into philosophy of law and philosophy of religion.  And of course the study of the history of ethical thought is inter-twined with all topics in ethics: almost all ethical questions have been discussed in the past, and ethics continues to progress as an ongoing conversation between living and historical thinkers.

[[Image:Spargel sauce hollandaise.jpg|right|thumb|Sauce Hollandaise on boiled white [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]]]
'''Hollandaise Sauce''' is a warm emulsion of clarified butter and lemon juice using egg yolk to bind them. This sauce is not exactly Hollandaise but tastes exactly the same and almost never fails. This recipe also does not require a double boiler which is often a handicap in preparing Hollandaise.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp.]] [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 1 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* 1½ sticks [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], (170[[Cookbook:Gram|g]] or ¾ cup) cut into small pieces
* 1 tsp. parsley

==Procedure==
# Clarify the butter by heating it until it melts, taking care not to burn the butter. Once melted, allow to cool until solids appear on the top.
# Skim off the milk solids, and keep the clarified butter warm/liquid (in a hot cup will do fine).


#Put eggs, lemon juice, water, salt and cayenne pepper into a non-reactive [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] &lt;ref&gt;N.B. Never use aluminium. It will react with the acid in the lemon juice, discoloring the sauce and giving it an unpleasant taste,&lt;/ref&gt; and beat until smooth.
#Heat on low, beating constantly with a [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]. If the egg starts to solidify, remove from heat, and DO NOT STOP WHISKING ! 
#When the whisk forms streaks in the bottom of the pan (around 8 mins approx), add clarified butter, one teaspoon at a time to begin with, adding more as it combines. Adding the butter too quickly will make the sauce split, and you will have to start over.
#Sauce should thicken as butter is added, when sauce is desired thickness, remove from the heat.
#Add optional parsley and serve.

===Notes===
{{reflist}}

* If '''any''' indication of burning is evident, remove pan from heat and whisk rapidly. If that is not enough, dunk the pan into cold water.
* Using clarified butter will allow for a better (easier) emulsion, although much of the flavour in butter comes from those milk solids not found in clarified butter.

==Alternative Method==
For a more traditional recipe, whisk the egg yolks over a double boiler in which the water is hot rather than [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] (i.e., start off [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]], do it off the heat). Add the butter one piece at a time, making sure each piece is fully incorporated into the sauce before adding the next. Finish off by adding lemon juice.

I'm now working on a European History text which intends to atleast cover the material for the AP test. I'm considering writing test/essay material for it, including DBQs. The AP World History, AP European History, and AP US History essays are each distinct entities. (I've taken all 3 now!) World is minimal SFI, minimal POV, Euro is minimal SFI, heavy POV, US is heavy SFI, minimal POV. For your how-to guide my work would atleast beable to help you develop material for European History. If I do decide to write one, it'll likely be about Absolutism, because the source book I have on my floor is heavy on it, and it's less likely to be copyrighted then something modern. --[[User:Alexbl|Alexbl]] 04:31, 30 May 2004 (UTC)</text>

''Miscelaneous information about mathematics in chemistry.''

==Dimensional Analysis==
Basically, dimensions can be treated as algebraic quantities.  So dimensions can be added and subtracted only if they have the same base.  Simple!  In chemistry you can use this technique to do problems you don't understand on multiple choice tests.  Look at the answers and see what units they are in, then look at the question and see what units are given.  After that use conversion factors to try and cancel them out.

==Significant Figures==
Every measurement entails a degree of uncertainty; this can vary depending on the measure device and skill with which the device is operated.  It is accepted that there is doubt of at least one figure in the last digit.  For example a miniscus occurs when water is stored in glass, it is the thin line that curves upward.  Someone might read the top of the miniscus and another person the bottom, this would cause an inaccuracy in the measurement.

Significant figures are the digits in any measurement that are known with a certainty plus a digit that is uncertain on the end.  For example a graduated cylinder is labeled in one millimeter increments, you can be sure of the number to the last line and then guess if the liquid is half way between the next solid measurement.  

The rules for finding significant figures are as follows:

Rule 1:  In numbers that do not contain zeros, all the digits are significant.  For example the number 3.1228 has 5 significant figures, 3.14 has 3 and 514 has 3 significant figures.

Rule 2: All zeros between significant digits are significant.  For example the number 7.05 has 3 significant figures, 6002 has 4 significant figures and 3.0041 has 5 significant figures.

Rule 3:  Zeros to the left of the first nonzero digit serve only to fix the position of the decimal point and are not significant.  For example 0.00058 has 2 significant figures, 0.0003094 has 4 significant figures, and 0.000001 has 1 significant figure.

Rule 4:  In a number with digits to the right of a decimal point, zeros to the right of the last nonzero digit are significant.  43 has 2 significant figures, 43.0 has 3 significant figures, 43.00 has 4 significant figures, and 0.40050 has 5 significant figures.

Rule 5 is harder to explain and needs an example, suppose a 100 gram brick was measured, in this notation it is impossible to know how precise the measurement was.  It could have been measured to the nearest gram (100 plus or minus 1 g) if so it has 3 significant figures, or it could have only been weighted to the nearest 10 grams (100 plus or minus 10) in which case it has 2 significant figures.  

The mass of the brick should be reported as either 1.00 x 10^2 g (in which case there are 3 significant figures

or

1.0 x 10^2 grams (2 significant figures)

or finally it could be reported as 1 x 10^2 g (only one significant figure)



It is important to remember that when multiplying or dividing, the number of significant figures in the answer should be the same as the number that had the fewest significant figures when working out the problem. 

Example:
A bus leaves a location and arrives in another 8.05 hours later.  Let’s pretend the distance between them was 486.9 miles.  What is the average speed of the bus in miles per hour?

To solve for speed we need to formulate the following equation, speed = distance traveled/time  so filling in the equation it would be s=486.9 miles/8.05 hours.  First calculate the number of significant figures in both numbers, 486.9 has 4 significant figures, and 8.05 has 3 significant figures, so that means our answer must have 3 significant figures.  Now solve 486.9/8.05 which is equal to 60.48447205, however we are only allowed 3 significant figures so the answer is changed to 60.5 miles per hour.  

For addition and subtraction the process is a little different, the number of decimal places in the result will be the same as the number with the smallest number of decimal places.  For example 10.21 + 0.2 + 256 would be equal to 266. 

 The official way to arrive at that number is to add the numbers normally and then change the answer&lt;br&gt; so that it has the corresponding number of significant figures.  However I find it just as simple to&lt;br&gt; ignore the excess decimals during the equation, so instead of working the entire equation out I&lt;br&gt; would simplify it into 10 + 0 + 256, which is equal to 266.  The normal degree of inaccuracy caused&lt;br&gt; by this faster method is generally considered acceptable.&lt;br&gt; This can be important because it simplifies chemistry by shaving off irrelevant information.

== Electric Currents ==

In an electric field, especially in a conductor, charged particles will move according to the electromotive force applied by the electric field. In a practical sense, the charged particles in question are the free electrons in the conductor. Electrons are attracted to the areas of positive charge, and are repelled from the area of negative charge.

The mass-flow of electrons through a conductor is known as electric current. 

=== Units of Current ===

The flow of electrons through a conductor is measured in ''Amperes''. The electric potential that causes electrons to flow is measured in ''Volts''.

== Magnets ==

Since ancient times, people have known about special rocks and materials that display a certain attractive and repulsive force on other such rocks. Termed &quot;magnets&quot;, the force between them operates on a similar principle to the electric force that we have studied so far.

All magnets have two sides or '''poles''', dubbed &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot;. Like positive and negative charges, like poles repel and opposite poles attract. The magnetic force works over distance, with the effect of the magnet decreasing over distance.

== Induction ==

Electric currents, or moving electric fields produce a magnetic force.

== Magnetic Fields ==

Like an electric field, there is a '''magnetic field''' that extends everywhere. the strength of the magnetic field is dependent on the location of magnets in the field. It is a vector field, so every point has both a strength and a direction.

We will discuss the mathematical determination of the magnetic field starting in the next chapter when we discussion the '''Biot-Savart Law'''.

= Preface =

Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a follow-on development to [[Object Oriented Programming]] (OOP), developed with the intention of solving some of the practical limitations of OOP.

OOP aims to manage the complexity of software development by encapsulating data and methods into discrete objects, reducing the dependencies between different software constructs, and polymorphism, or the ability to treat different program constructs as identical for a particular purpose.  Overall, the definition of a well-constructed set of objects standing in explicit relationships with each other allows programmers to 'componentize' the software, working at a small, simple, focussed scale, creating constructs that are easily and safely combined into larger constructs for greater functionality.

The practical difficulty with OOP is that, in any large-scale application, there are aspects that are not easily decomposed into objects/components, or easily used as such.  &quot;Cross-cutting concerns&quot;, or ''crosscuts'', are parts of a larger software project that exist identically in several places, or for multiple objects, where implementing code to answer those concerns effectively breaks encapsulation and increases, rather than decreases, dependencies.  AOP aims to reduce dependencies and complexity by moving the code handling those crosscuts into separate programming constructs that can then be woven back into the OOP source code in an automated fashion by a ''weaver''.  The result is object oriented code that can then be compiled as normal.

== Example ==

The classic example of an appropriate area for AOP is logging.  Often, a programmer will use logging to record the state and flow of a program, both for debugging during development and bug-fixing after deployment.  In an OOP program, this takes several possible forms:

* Every object has access to a global logger object, and calls its methods to log events or state.
* All objects requiring logging repeat the same code to write to the log.
* Each object keeps its own log, possibly to a file.

The essential problem here that AOP tries to solve is that the code is repeated in several places, making it difficult to maintain, and increasing dependencies across different constructs.  Changing the behaviour of the logger requires, in the second and third cases, rewriting the same code in multiple files; changing the use of the logger requires rewriting the same code in all cases.

By defining logging as a crosscut and using an aspect to solve the problem, the programmer writes the aspect code to handle logging and makes use of a ''weaver'' to inject the code into the OOP source, which is then compiled as normal OOP code.  The logging function has been removed from the source code for the classes, put into one location, and treated as another single construct that can be locally defined and implemented, and then used discretely in the rest of the program.

= Overview =

In theoretical terms, AOP is the way to implement ''separation of concerns''.  Objects are often called upon to handle several conceptually different concerns.  An invoice in a sales entry application contains some obvious properties, such as the identity of the purchaser, and the items purchased; but the invoice object may also be required to know how to log its actions, how to persist itself in a database, how to verify the purchaser's credit limit, and how to raise a flag when it is past due.  As a result, the invoice class may become large, complex, and difficult to maintain.  Each of these concerns is legitimate for the class to handle, but by the principles of OOP must be handled internally and invisibly.  If those concerns are shared by other objects with only a distant relationship, then not only do the classes involved have unnecessary complexity, but that complexity is repeated in multiple places.

A few definitions will help:

A ''cross-cutting concern'', or ''crosscut'', is any part of the design of an OOP application that occurs simultaneously in several different parts of the OOP application that are not otherwise related.  Logging is the obvious example, but persistence is another one:  In a banking application, many different objects must be stored and retrieved in the same way (e.g., a relational database).  Persistence is a crosscut on the objects of the application.

A ''join-point'' is a semantically definable point in the OOP code that the weaver can identify.  For our logging example, the programmer may wish to record the call stack, so the logger should record the entry and exit of every function.

A set of join points are identified, collectively, by a ''pointcut'':  The join-points are the actual places in the code that the weaver identifies; the pointcut is the AOP code that defines the join-points to be found.

A pointcut not only identifies join points, but includes code to act on those points.  The code is called ''advice'' or ''advices''.

An ''aspect'', then, is a set of pointcuts defining a particular crosscut to be handled by the AOP module.  In practice, our solution to the logging example is an aspect module that defines pointcuts identifying those join-points where the programmer wants logging to occur.  Having identified the join-points, the programmer writes advices into the AOP module, and the weaver injects that code into the OOP source code as a preliminary step to compilation of the code.

At this point, it looks like AOP is nothing more than a way of pulling utility code out of classes and centralizing it; that is one of AOP's virtues.  However, AOP can separate much more complex concerns.  In our invoice example, we mentioned that invoices have a past due date.  Likewise, our own payables might have a past due date.  This 'past due' concern could be encapsulated as an aspect that defines pointcuts on the construction or initialization of both invoice and payable objects.  At those join-points, a past due date member could be added to both classes, along with code to register the invoice/payable with a past-due monitoring system that generates a daily report of upcoming deadlines.  Code for tracking payment deadlines has been moved to a single module, decreasing the complexity of the invoice/payable objects, eliminating a dependency between the invoice/payable classes and the deadline monitoring system, and making maintenance and changes to the system easier.

= Implementation =

The most popular platform for AOP is currently AspectJ, an extension to the Java language.  It is the language that will be used here for examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The Middle Ages was a period of approximately one thousand years of history; generally accepted as spanning from the fall of the Roman Empire (toward the end of the 5th century) to the Protestant reformation in the 16th century.  This period began with a demographic downturn at the end of the Roman imperial era, with European populations shrinking and many cities and rural estates abandoned.  A cooling climate, disease, and political disorder each played a part in this opening period which saw Classical Mediterranean civilization eclipsed.  Across Europe, there emerged smaller, more localized hybrid societies combining Roman, Christian and Germanic or Celtic barbarian influences.  By the 9th and 10th centuries, populations had reached their minima, and Europe became a largely rural and somewhat backward region. Commerce and learning flourished in the Islamic world, China and India during the same period.  Islamic armies conquered Spain during the 7th and 8th centuries, but were defeated by the Frankish kingdom in 732 when they attempted to enter France.

The turn of the first millennium saw renewed growth and activity, as kings and cities consolidated their authority and began to repopulate lands left empty by Rome's decline.  Warmer weather after 900 allowed more land to be brought into food production.  The feudal system of agriculture, where peasants were tied to their estates by obligations to local lords or to the church, provided a degree of economic stability. This was aided by the arrival in Europe of the horse collar from Asia, which increased crop yields by allowing plows to be drawn by horse, rather than by slower oxen.  Commercial towns flourished in England, France and the Low Countries. German rulers dispatched monks and peasants to clear forests and settle in Eastern Europe and the Baltic regions. The city-states of northern Italy rose in wealth and influence. Islamic Spain became a center of learning and culture where Christians, Muslims and Jews coexisted in relative amity.  Despite many local wars and disputes between knights, the High Middle Ages, from 1000-1250, saw growing populations and prosperity enough to build great cathedrals and send European armies abroad on crusades.  

After 1250, demographic stagnation emerged. Population growth slowed or stopped as the limits of medieval agriculture were reached.  Major conflicts between powerful kingdoms, such as the Hundred Years' War between England and France, became more frequent. The Christian church, previously secure in its spiritual authority, was racked by schisms and increasing financial corruption.  The year 1348 saw a catastrophe as the virulent bubonic plague (the &quot;Black Death&quot;), entered Italy, carried by ships from Asia. It spread across the continent over three years killing, by some estimates, one-third of all Europeans.  Many believed it was the end of the world foretold by Christian myth. Along with its suffering, the plague wrought economic havoc, driving up the cost of labor and making the old feudal system untenable, as surviving peasants scorned its demands.  

The following century and a half transformed Europe from a patchwork of feudal fiefdoms, under loose royal and church control, into a collection of newborn but increasingly unified national states.  Towns became centers of resistance and dissent to the old royal and church authorities.  Former noble and knightly influence declined, and rulers realigned themselves toward the increasingly wealthy and influential burgher and merchant classes. Emergence of the printing press and spreading literacy, increased religious and political conflict in many countries.  By 1500, Christopher Columbus had sailed across the ocean to the New World, and Martin Luther was about to challenge the authority of the Roman Papacy and its right to award dispensation of sins for money. These developments opened the modern era of history, and brought the Middle Ages to their true end.

A number of modern institutions have their roots in the Middle Ages.  The concept of nation-states with strong central governmental power stems from the consolidation of powers by some kings of the Middle Ages.  These kings formed royal courts, appointed sheriffs, formed royal armies, and began to collect taxes - all concepts central to modern government.  A leading example was the French kingdom, ruled by the Capetian dynasty from 987 until the early 14th century.  French provincial nobles and their castles and knights were brought under effective royal control during this time, and national unity benefited.  Conversely Germany, which had strong kings in the 10th and early 11th centuries, suffered a series of political conflicts during the High Middle Ages between rulers and the Church, which weakened national cohesion and elevated regional lords to great influence.

During the Middle Ages, Kings originally called Parliaments to explain their policies and ask for money.  Parliaments at this time represented the three collective estates - the clergy, nobles, and merchants - not individuals.

The idea of limited government also arose, challenging the traditional notion at the time that rulers were all-powerful (such as a Roman emperor or an Egyptian pharaoh).  The most substantial occurrence was in 1215, when the nobles of England asserted their rights against King John in the ''Magna Carta''.  In addition, the notion of parliaments, as explained above, came into existence, and the reciprocal nature of the feudal and manorial contracts laid the most basic groundwork for the concept of the social contract.

In addition, the formation of governmental bureaucracy began during this time, as the royal councils of medieval kings evolved into modern government departments.

Finally, the regulation of goods and services became increasingly prominent during the Middle Ages, as guilds protected the consumer from poor products.

Thinkers of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment tended to look at the Middle Ages with scorn, but the Middle Ages were essential in laying the groundwork for the times to come.

==New Forms of Art==

Both painting and literature received a new burst of life as the [[w:Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] came to an end.

===Painting===

[[w:Giotto|Giotto]] began to express the human form more realistically. Although his forms seem primitive compared to those of the Renaissance artists, he was the first to attempt to bring back the realism of [[w:Rome|Roman]] art. He also began to develop techniques of perspective in paintings to achieve depth. Most of his art was in the form of plaster-based frescoes on the walls of chapels and churches.

===Literature===

As the prestige of the Papacy began to decline, national consciousness began to increase; this nationalism was manifested in literature written in national languages, or vernacular, instead of traditional [[w:Latin|Latin]]. This use of the vernacular opened up such that cultural peculiarities could be more naturally expressed. This allowed literature to feel more realistic and human to the readers, and is why pieces such as ''[[w:The Canterbury Tales|The Canterbury Tales]]'' are considered depictions of life in the times in which they were written. 

While the literacy of laypeople increased as a result of increased vernacular writings, society was still largely based on [[w:oral culture|oral culture]].

:''Abandon all hope ye who enter here.'' 
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-- Canto III, ''Inferno''

[[w:Dante Aligheri|Dante Aligheri]] was born in 1265 in Florence, Italy. His family was not rich but was considered an aristocratic line. He was taught by Brunetto Latini, who trained him in the classical liberal arts, including Latin and Greek. Yet, Dante set out to embrace his vernacular language and began to write ''[[w:The Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]'' in his local Tuscan dialect.  Today he holds a place in history as the first author to do so.  Alighieri considered his work a comedy due to the differences between his Italian writing style and the great Latin tragedy. His three-part epic poem sarcastically criticized the Church and commented on a variety of historical and contemporary individuals.  The most important of these figures is [[w:Virgil|Virgil]], the Latin poet, who plays the role of Dante's guide through the afterlife. Dante's personal feelings towards many people are also evident in his writing. In the deepest layer of hell he punishes those for whom he personally had the greatest disdain.  Much of this personal disdain came from his position as a politician in Florence. One of the victims of his deepest layer of hell is [[w:Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]], a pope whose political policy of expansion he opposed. Each of the poem's parts portray degrees of salvation, with &quot;Inferno&quot; being Hell, &quot;Purgatorio&quot; being Purgatory, and &quot;Paradiso&quot; being Heaven. Inferno includes many of the [[w:archetypical|archetype]] depictions of hell including the [[w:River Styx|River Styx]], and the ferry man Charon who carries people across the river.

====Geoffrey Chaucer  (1340-1400)==== 

[[w:Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[w:The Canterbury Tales|The Canterbury Tales]]'', a collection of stories, exposed the materialistic, worldly interests of a variety of English people. This collection of stories was set in a frame based around a trip to [[w:Canterbury|Canterbury]] as a [[w:pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] to the shrine of [[w:Saint Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]]. The stories are the individual tales of thirty people making this pilgrimage.  The accounts range from romance to family to religion, providing a cross section of society at the time.  A large percentage of the populace, and therefore a large percentage of the characters, seemed more focused on material pleasure than on their eternal souls. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is also useful as a study of English [[w:vernacular|vernacular]] at the time. It is a classical example of [[w:Middle English|Middle English]] that linguists and those studying medieval and early modern England continue to use to this day.

==The Hundred Years War (1337-1453)==

[[File:Joan of arc interrogation.jpg|thumb|Joan of Arc led a French army against the English during the Hundred Years war and succeeded in halting the English advance. She was captured by the English whilst on campaign and was taken to England to stand trial. This later painting (1824) by Paul Delaroche shows Joan Of Arc being interrogated by the Cardinal of Winchester]]

The Hundred Years War was a very complex war, fought between France and England (with the occasional intervention of other countries), over three main conflicts.  In particular, the nations fought over control of the Gascony region in France, rebellions supported by Britain in French cloth production towns, and English claims to the French throne after the death of Charles IV.

The war, initially sparked by a dispute over who would become King of France after the death of King Charles IV, quickly became an amazingly complex and multi-faceted war. King Edward III and his son Edward, commonly known as &quot;The Black Prince&quot;, invaded Aquitaine, a huge region in southwest France claimed by England. As time went on, the Kings of England and France involved themselves in many more operations, ranging from a civil war in Brittany, trade disputes in what became Belgium, even a war in Castile. The three major battles of the Hundred Years War, Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, were resounding English victories, the flower of French nobility being cut down at every battle. However, even though the English won every major battle and many of the smaller ones, relatively poor England was never able to subdue southern France, by far the wealthiest portion of France, which eventually led to the English losing the war.

==The Rise of Towns and Commerce==
From the 6th to 10th centuries, there were few commerce centers and only small merchant classes in Europe.  What long-distance trade there was usually focused on luxury goods for the nobility and church elites, and was mediated by traveling merchants such as Syrians or Jews.  Crafts were carried on locally in manors.  Populations were not large enough to support further economic developments, and Viking and Arab attacks made trade routes hazardous.

During the High Middle Ages of 1000-1500, long distance trading became safer and thus more profitable.  As a result, craftsmen moved into growing centers of trade, forcing lords and serfs to have to get their goods from these centers of trade.  Towns formed leagues and [[w:urban federation|urban federations]], or communes, that worked together to fight crime or deal with monarchs and nobles.  Guilds also arose, allowing for the collective supervision of affairs - the work was done by reliable people, and the guilds provided for vocational education.  The spirit of the medieval economy, however, was to prevent competition.

The rise of towns had an emancipating effect.  They forced the lords to offer freer terms to the peasantry.  Often, peasants earned freedom  in return for an annual payment to the lord.  Allowing large numbers of people to move from agricultural to industrial work in the towns brought economic acceleration.  Indeed, a sort of handicraft industrial revolution took place during the 12th and 13th centuries, especially in the Low Countries where great cloth-making centers such as Ghent and Bruges accumulated much wealth and stimulated growth in Western Europe generally.  The Hansa, a widespread league of North Sea, Norwegian and Baltic trading towns, emerged in this period, opening up Scandinavian resources to supply Western Europe with furs, timber, beeswax, and fish.  

The High Middle Ages also saw Europeans returning from Crusades in the Middle East, where they had developed tastes for goods not produced at home.  These homecomings introduced medieval Europeans to exotic spices, silks, fruits, drugs, and other eastern products for the first time.  Cities around the Mediterranean took part in the trade that developed, with Venice becoming the richest port of entry for Asian goods, the base from which Marco Polo and his companions set forth on their journey to China.

== Growth of National Monarchies ==
During this same time period, the monarchies began to grow, and as a result people began to see the formation of unified nation-states.  Kings sent executive orders and began to institute royal courts, and they lived off of money from the manors that they owned and fees from their vassals.  The king's royal council was a group of his vassals that advised him on state matters, which resulted in the formation of basic departments of government.  When representatives of towns began to meet, this was an early formation of basic parliaments.

These parliaments didn't have the ability to dictate to the king, but could state grievances and the king could act upon them.  This was a basic sort of legislation.

In addition, the formation of these parliaments led to the establishment of the three estates: the first estate, which was encompassed by the clergy; the second estate, made up of the landed and noble class; and the third estate, or the burghers of chartered towns.  England had two houses of parliament - the House of Lords and the House of Commons.  The House of Commons allowed lesser landholders to become members.

==The Black Death==

[[Image:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|250px|Spread of the Black Death in Europe.]]

Black Death, or Bubonic Plague, hit Europe in 1347. Transmitted primarily by fleas and rats, the bacteria ''Y. Pestis'' swept across the continent, killing one third of the population by 1351. The bacteria is thought to have been endemic among rodent populations on the Asian steppes, and jumped to humans in Europe with great virulence.  The onset of the disease was sudden; the symptoms were fever, weakness, delirium, lung distress, and dark-colored swellings (buboes) in the neck, armpit and groin areas. Quite often, those infected died within 1-2 days, including young and previously healthy individuals.

===Causes of the Plague===

The revival of trade and commerce increased the potential for the spread of communicable diseases.  Europe had not suffered a continent wide plague since the plague of Justinian in 535, and the unexposed populations of 1348 had no inherited immunity.  Though prosperity had risen, nutrition and sanitation for most Europeans were very poor by modern standards, decreasing immune resistance in general.  Many adults had also suffered as young children in the Great Famine of 1316-1321, when several years of cold and wet weather caused crops to fail across the continent.  This experience in childhood may also have compromised their resistance to the plague bacillus in later life.

The plague is thought to have been brought to Europe during a Mongol attack on Kaffa (in the Black Sea); when sickness forced the Mongols to abandon their attack, they catapulted a few plague victims into town before leaving. Ironically, this became a common practice for Europeans in castle siege. From there, merchants spread the disease to Constantinople, where it propagated throughout Europe, first by ship to Mediterranean ports such as Messina and Genoa, and then by land in all directions.

A shortage of wood fuel, due to cutting of forests for agriculture, resulted in the shutting down of bath houses which relied on burning wood to heat the water.  Particularly in winter, only the rich could afford to bathe.  This further contributed to poor hygienic conditions. Cities were also very poorly designed for hygiene. Citizens commonly dumped waste into the street which attracted rats, and thus fleas. Living in cities was also very close, which meant that fleas had little area to travel to infect another person. 

The plague was blamed on many things in particular the Jews were a common scapegoat for the plague, including city leaders claiming that members of the Jewish community had poisoned the water supply, or spread a poisonous salve on the gates of the city.

It is important to understand that Europeans did not understand the real cause of the plague. To them the plague was a curse brought on them by their lack of piety, or the failings of the church, the cities' Jewish population, or even the configuration of the stars. Others even attributed the plague to bad air. To combat it, they carried kerchiefs or bags of &quot;aromatics&quot; that they could hold to their noses as needed. (The opinion of Europe's leading medical faculty, at the University of Paris, was that the outbreak was brought on by an unfavorable astrological alignment in the year 1345).  Lacking the real facts, many Europeans' attempts to quell the disease actually helped it spread.

===Responses to the Plague===

Some people thought the plague was punishment by God against sinners.  The [[w:flagellant|flagellants]] arose as a result.  Flagellants whipped themselves to bleed, prayed for mercy, and called upon their congregations to repent sins.  Wandering over plague-stricken central Europe, many groups of flagellants turned to banditry and violence. Towns and feudal lords eventually prohibited them or even tried to wipe them out.  In addition, violence against Jews broke out, and mobs killed all who refused baptism. Many Jews were forced to flee their homes.

Physicians in medieval Europe used a mixture of trial-and-error methods and classical Greek or Roman sources to care for their patients.  Without knowledge of microorganisms, or the role of rats and fleas in spreading the infection, doctors were unable to cure infected victims or limit the spread.  As a result, plague sufferers survived or perished according to the general state of their health, and whatever genetic resistance they happened to possess.

===Consequences of the Plague===

Massive death opened the ranks for advancement in society, and as a result landlords made more concessions to obtain new tenant farmers.  The supply of laborers plummeted, resulting in higher wages for workers.  A low grain demand resulted in the drop of overall grain prices.  Noblemen lost a portion of their wealth, and became more dependent upon monarchs and war for income and power.

Additionally, the plague resulted in the improvement of living standards for the peasantry and the urban working population.  Peasants and artisans now had more luxuries and a better diet, and production shifted from manufacturing for a mass market to a small luxury market.  However, the monetary disparity grew, as fewer people possessed proportionately greater money.

Finally, Europeans saw that the church's prayer did not cure the plague, and that even leaders of the church were dying.  This caused the general populace to lose a great deal of faith in the church, and opened the door to many new and local religious movements which had previously been suppressed, a factor which helped prepare the coming of the Reformation a century later.

==Challenges to Spiritual Authority at the End of the Middle Ages==

The Middle Ages provided many foundations to the Reformation of the 16th century.  During the time, the church provided order, stability, and a framework for the medieval world.  The most essential foundation of medieval life was salvation - and the ultimate life goal of all people was to obtain salvation.  As people lost faith in the church and its ability to provide salvation, the church began to lose its hold on the populace.

===Plague===

As explained earlier, the plague contributed to the people's loss of faith in the church. However, some more ardent believers would have regarded such a plague as being sent from God to punish the world for its sins. The church of the day would have played upon such a notion so as to encourage more ardent belief and to attack any dissenters.

===Heretical Movements and People===

A number of movements and people challenged the authority of the church during the end of the Middle Ages.

====Free Spirits====

The free spirits believed the church was not meeting the spiritual needs of the people, and advocated [[w:mysticism|mysticism]], or the belief that God and humans are of the same essence.

====John Wycliffe (1328–1384)====

John Wycliffe, an English priest and professor at Oxford, founded the Lollard movement. The Lollards argued that salvation didn't have to come through the pope, and that the king was superior to and more important than the pope and religion.    He said that Bible reading and prayer were important to religion, not the interpretation by priests.  He was one of the first to set out to translate the Bible into a [[w:vernacular|vernacular]] language rather than using the [[w:Latin Vulgate|Latin Vulgate]].  He also objected to the extreme wealth of the church and clergy.

====Jan Hus (1369-1415) in Bohemia====

[[w:Jan Hus|Jan Hus]], by forming the [[w:Hussites|Hussites]], attempted to bring about reforms like those attempted by Wycliff in England.  Hus was a priest in [[w:Bohemia|Bohemia]] when he learned of Wycliff's teachings.  While the people around him thought them heretical and forbade them, Jan thought they had a right to be taught.  Through his various disagreements and dealings, Hus came to think the church corrupt, and left his native land to pen ''[[w:On the Church|On the Church]]'', a work which criticized the manner in which it was run.  His teachings appealed to the masses, and he developed a group of followers known as [[w:Hussites|Hussites]].  In 1413, Hus was invited to a council designed to reform the church, but when he arrived he was arrested for his views.  The following trial was in many ways just a formality, as he was guilty the moment he stepped in.  Hus was burned at the stake on July 6, 1415.

===Corruption in the Church===

The vast corruption in the church also led many to doubt and question its authority.  The excess wealth of clergy and the frequency of clergymen having mistresses and illegitimate children was a major concern.  The people also questioned the church's sale of indulgences, or receiving payment to forgive people of their sins; nepotism; simony, or the sale of church office; pluralism, or holding multiple church offices; and the extreme luxury of cathedrals.

===The Great Schism===

[[Image:Great schism 1378 1417.jpg|thumb|left|Allegiances during the Great Schism of 1378.]]

In 1305, the King of France invited the Pope to move the headquarters of the Church away from Rome, a city plagued by warring local factions, to Avignon in the Rhone Valley.  After Pope Gregory XI's return of the papacy to Rome in 1377, elections were convened for a new Pope.  The citizens of Rome, demanding the election of an Italian Pope, forced the Cardinals to elect Urban VI.  Dissenting French Cardinals reconvened in Avignon and on their own elected their own pope, Clement VII. The French popes of the Great Schism, referred to by historians as ''antipopes'', held papal power in some regions of Europe, and for 39 years there were two Popes. In an attempt to reconcile this Schism, Conciliarists held a conference at Pisa to elect a new Pope, but could not depose either of the two in power, resulting in a threefold split in the papacy.  Not willing to give up, the Pisan convention elected yet another Pope, to the same result. 

Finally the Council of Constance (1414-1418) stepped in and called for the abdication of the three popes in power. With the support of the Holy Roman Emperor, the three popes were deposed and Martin V was elected as a single pope, ending the Great Schism. The Council of Constance also took action against John Wycliffe and John Huss, two reformers within the Catholic Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An inductor is the electrical equivalent of a flywheel.  When you introduce energy to an inductor, the current flows slowly at first, just like a flywheel doesn't instantly get up to speed.  And if you try to stop a flywheel instantly, something will break.  If you let current through an inductor, then open the switch, the energy of the inductor must go somewhere - it will arc back across the switch, quickly ruining it - thus the condensor used in coil-type automotive ignition systems: it stores the energy until the inefficiency of the flywheel can turn it into heat.

Inductors are formed of a coil of conductive material.  Normally they are made of copper wire, but not always (Example: aluminum wire, or spiral pattern etched on circuit board).  The material around and within the coil affects its properties; common types are air-core (only a coil of wire), iron-core, and ferrite core.  Iron and ferrite types are more efficient because they conduct the magnetic field much better than air; of the two, ferrite is more efficient because stray electricity cannot flow through it.  Ferrite is more expensive but operates at much higher frequencies than iron cores.

Some inductors have more than a core, which is just a rod the coil is formed about.  Some are formed like transformers, using two E-shaped pieces facing each other, the wires wound about the central leg of the E's.  The E's are made of laminated iron/steel or ferrite. 

Toroidal inductors are most efficient of all, they are wound around a donut shape which is made of ferrite.  They are more difficult to make, because the formed coil cannot be manufactured directly on the toroid - it must be wound onto it.

Important qualities of angf inductor

There are several important properties for an inductor.
*Current carrying capacity is determined by wire thickness.
*Q, or quality, is determined by the uniformity of the windings, as well as the core material and how thoroughly it surrounds the coil.
*Last but not least, the inductance of the coil.

The inductance is determined by several factors.
*coil shape: short and squat is best
*core material
*windings: winding in opposite directions will cancel out the inductance effect, and you will have only a resistor.

(someone add formulas etc. for determining inductance, please.)

:::There is some useful info.  We should probably mention them and talk about them a little, along with other types of power supplies, but we don't need to explain the chemistry or describe every different battery size or talk about recharging them.  Just say that they convert the energy of chemical reactions into electricity and leave it at that.  I also think we should be talking about ideal sources in parallel and series first, and then show how a cell (or generator or opamp output or whatever) behaves like an ideal voltage source with a source impedance. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 16:13, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::::For circuits, it seems that types of (ideal) sources are more important.  (Not sure if this is well covered somewhere...it could be a section on it's own, or combined with cells, or part of 'Other Components'.)

A indication of how long each cell will last for would be nice.  In charge but preferably in Ampere hours.  That is if the cell is rated 1Ah then it can deliver one ampere for one hour or 0.5 amperes for 2 hours.</text>

==Nodes==

A node is a section of a circuit which connects components to each other. All of the current entering a node must leave a node, according to Kirchoff's Current Law. Every point on the node is at the same voltage, no matter how close it is to each component, because the connections between components are perfect conductors. This voltage is called the node voltage, and is the voltage difference between the node and an arbitrary reference, the ground point. The ground point is a node which is defined as having zero voltage. The ground node should be chosen carefully for convenience. Note that the ground node does not necessarily represent an actual connection to ground, it is just a device to make the analysis simpler. For example, if a node has a voltage of 5 Volts, then the voltage drop between that node and the ground node will be 5 Volts.

Note that in real circuits, nodes are made up of wires, which are not perfect conductors, and so the voltage is not perfectly the same everywhere on the node.  This distinction is only important in demanding applications, such as low noise audio, high speed digital circuits (like modern computers), etc.  If we look at how a particular circuit functions an engineer might be able to select check points that are diametrically apposite of each other, this signafies two points of current crossing over to another point this can be another method in testing a circuit to determine how nodes work.

==Nodal Analysis==

Nodal analysis is a formalized procedure based on KCL equations.

Steps:

#Identify all nodes.
#Choose a reference node.  Identify it with reference (ground) symbol.  A good choice is the node with the most branches, or a node which can immediately give you another node voltage (e.g., below a voltage source).
#Assign voltage variables to the other nodes (these are node voltages.)
#Write a KCL equation for each node (sum the currents leaving the node and set equal to zero).  Rearrange these equations into the form A*V1+B*V2=C (or similar for equations with more voltage variables.)
#Solve the system of equations from step 4.  There are a number of techniques that can be used: simple substitution, Cramer's rule, the adjoint matrix method, etc.

==Complications in Nodal Analysis==
#Dependent Current Source
#:Solution: Write KVL equations for each node.  Then express the extra variable (whatever the current source depends on) in terms of node voltages.  Rearrange into the form from step 4 above.  Solve as in step 5.
#Independent Voltage Source
#:Problem:  We know nothing about the current through the voltage source.  We cannot write KCL equations for the nodes the voltage source is connected to.
#:Solution: If the voltage source is between the reference node and any other node, we have been given a 'free' node voltage: the node voltage must be equal to the voltage source value!  Otherwise, use a 'super-node', consisting of the source and the nodes it is connected to.  Write a KCL equation for all current entering and leaving the super-node.  Now we have one equation and two unknowns (the node voltages).  Another equation that relates these voltages is the equation provided by the voltage source (V2-V1=source value).  This new system of equations can be solved as in Step 5 above.
#Dependent Voltage Source
#:Solution: Same as an independent voltage source, with an extra step.  First write a super-node KCL equation.  Then write the source controlling quantity (dependence quantity?) in terms of the node voltages.  Rearrange the equation to be in the A*V1+B*V2=C form.  Solve the system as above.

==Example==
Given the Circuit below, find the voltages at all nodes.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:nodal_example.png]]&lt;br&gt;

node 0: &lt;math&gt;V_0 = 0V\,&lt;/math&gt; (defined as ground node)&lt;br&gt;
node 1: &lt;math&gt;V_1 = 9V\,&lt;/math&gt; (free node voltage)&lt;br&gt;
node 2: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1 - V_2}{1k} = \frac{V_2 - V_0}{3k} + \frac{V_2 - V_3}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
node 3: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2 - V_3}{2k} = \frac{V_3 - V_0}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

which results in the following system of linear equations:
&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{matrix} +11 V_2 &amp; -3 V_3 &amp; = &amp; 54 \\ +1 V_2 &amp; -2 V_3 &amp; = &amp; 0\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

therefore, the solution is:
&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{matrix} V_0 =0.00V \\ V_1 =9.00V \\ V_2 =5.68V \\ V_3 =2.84V\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Another solution with KCL would be to solve node in terms of node 2; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2 - 9V}{1k} + \frac{V_2}{3k} + \frac{V_2}{4k} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is something that someone with a good math background could figure out from what has been previously written in this text, but very few people just starting with electronics will be able to pick up (setting up and solving this system of equations.)  -maxpower

:Somewhat on the same lines as the previous comment, I think that the sterile procedural definition of node analysis is far from adequate from a teaching perspective.  Most persons can figure out basically how to setup the system of equations, but the main confusion usually revolves around getting signs straight.  The text should address this point in some detail and explain something about setting up and utilizing a consistant system for indicating current direction.  Additionally, it would be good if it covered when/why one should add or subtract a current due to the position of the node within the set conventions and the adjacent element's active/passive function.

==Meshes==

A 'mesh' (also called a loop) is simply a path through a circuit that starts and ends at the same place.  For the purpose of mesh analysis, a mesh is a loop that does not enclose other loops.

==Mesh Analysis==

Similar to nodal analysis, mesh analysis is a formalized procedure based on KVL equations.  A caveat: mesh analysis can only be used on 'planar' circuits (i.e. there are no crossed, but unconnected, wires in the circuit diagram.)

Steps:

# Draw circuit in planar form (if possible.)
# Identify meshes and name mesh currents.  Mesh currents should be in the clockwise direction.  The current in a branch shared by two meshes is the difference of the two mesh currents.
# Write a KVL equation in terms of mesh currents for each mesh.
# Solve the resulting system of equations.

==Complication in Mesh Analysis==

1. Dependent Voltage Sources

Solution: Same procedure, but write the dependency variable in terms of mesh currents.

2. Independent Current Sources

Solution: If current source is not on a shared branch, then we have been given one of the mesh currents!  If it is on a shared branch, then use a 'super-mesh' that encircles the problem branch.  To make up for the mesh equation you lose by doing this, use the mesh current relationship implied by the current source (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I_2 - I_1=4 mA&lt;/math&gt;).

3. Dependent Current Sources

Solution: Same procedure as for an independent current source, but with an extra step to eliminate the dependency variable.  Write the dependency variable in terms of mesh currents.

==Example==
Given the Circuit below, find the currents &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Mesh1.png]]&lt;br&gt;
The circuit has 2 loops indicated on the diagram.  Using KVL we get:&lt;br&gt;
'''Loop1:''' &lt;math&gt;0=9-1000I_1-3000(I_1-I_2)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''Loop2:''' &lt;math&gt;0=3000(I_1-I_2)-2000I_2-2000I_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Simplifying we get the simultaneous equations:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0=9-4000I_1+3000I_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0=0+3000I_1-7000I_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
solving to get:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I_1=3.32mA&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I_2=1.42mA&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conflicts of the Cold War==

===Greece (1947)===
Communist successes in 1947-48 enabled them to move freely over much of mainland Greece, but with extensive reorganization and American material support, the Greek National Army was slowly able to regain control over most of the countryside. Yugoslavia closed its borders to the insurgent forces in 1949, after Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia broke with the Soviet Union.

===Italy (1948)===

===Berlin (1948-1949)===
The Soviet Union blocked Western rail and road access to Berlin from June 24, 1948 - May 1, 1949. This Berlin Blockade was one of the major crises of the Cold War. The crisis abated after the Soviet Union did not act to stop American, British and French airlifts ([[w:Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]]) of food and especially winter fuel for the winter of '48~'49, as well as other provisions to the Western-held sectors of Berlin following the Soviet land blockade.

====Study Questions====
#What ended the blockade?
##The crisis abated after the Soviet Union did not act to stop American, British and French airlifts of food and other provisions to the Western-held sectors of Berlin following the Soviet land blockade.
#What made West Berlin such an unusual part of the West German state, and what caused this arrangement?
##In 1945, the victorious Allied Powers reached the [[w:Potsdam Agreement|Potsdam Agreement]] on the fate of postwar Europe, calling for the division of a defeated Germany into four occupation zones (thus reaffirming principles laid out earlier by the [[w:Yalta Conference|Yalta Conference]]), and the similar division of the capital, Berlin, deep within the Soviet occupation zone, into four zones. Thus the French, German, and British sectors of Berlin were deep within the Soviet occupation zones, connected by a narrow land corridor to the maqin Allied occupation zones in Germany, and thus a focal point of tensions corresponding to the breakdown of the U.S-Soviet wartime alliance. (See Origins of the Cold War)
#Why were the Soviets interested in Germany?
##The Soviets sought to create a unified but demilitarized Germany under their tutelage, or as Soviet Foreign Minister [[w:Vyacheslav Molotov|Vyacheslav Molotov]] told U.S. Secretary of State [[w:James F. Byrnes|James F. Byrnes]] in 1946, a united Germany that could be neutralized after Russia received industrial reparations from Germany. This strategy was a response to a 150-year history of repeated Western assaults on Russia, including World War I and Napoleon's 1812 invasion. [[w:Stalin|Stalin]] considered it essential to destroy Germany's capacity for another war, which conflicted with the US desire to rebuild Germany as the economic center of a stable Europe. (Stalin assumed that Japan and Germany could menace the Soviet Union once again by the 1960s.)
#Why was the United States interested in Germany?
##The United States, however, stressed that postwar reconstruction in Western Europe depended on German economic and industrial recovery. The U.S. stance was that if it could not reunify Germany with Soviet cooperation, the West could develop the western, industrial portions of postwar Germany controlled by France, Britain, and the U.S. and integrate the areas into a new European sphere of democracy.
#When did the three western sections of Berlin fuse into the capital of West Germany?
##As outlined in an announcement on March 6, 1948, the [[w:London Conference|London Conference]] declared support for fusing the three Western-occupied zones in Germany into an independent, federal form of government, and bring the fusion of the three Western zones into the U.S.-led economic reconstruction efforts (See [[w:Marshall Plan|Marshall Plan]]).

===Korean War (1950-1953)===
The [[w:Korean War|Korean War]] was a conflict between communist North and anti-communist South Korea. Both sides sabre-rattled incessantly, threatening military action.  However, more importantly, Stalin's interest in an ice-free Pacific seaport for Russia ( Pusan ), was the key motivation for his encouragement of a &quot; blitzkrieg &quot; military reunification of the Korean peninsula.  It was also a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Principal combatants were North and South Korea, the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China, although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the United Nations. The Soviet Union also supplied combat advisors and aircraft pilots, as well as arms, for the North Korean and eventually Chinese troops. In U.S. parlance, Korea was officially termed a U.N. police action, not a war.

====Study Questions====

#What caused the Korean War?
:Korea was a Japanese colony from 1905 effectively and 1910 officially, until the end of World War II in 1945. The Allies agreed that Japanese forces north of 38° north latitude (the 38th parallel) would surrender to the Soviet Union and those south of 38° would surrender to the USA. The Allies pledged that Korea would be a unified, independent country under an elected government but failed to specify the details.
:The United Nations held an election in 1948, but the Soviet Union refused to allow participation in their occupied zone. Instead, they handed over power to the [[w:North Korean Communist Party|North Korean Communist Party]] under [[w:Kim Il-Sung|Kim Il-Sung]], the anti-Japanese Korean partisan forces leader, who had been secretly in exile in Moscow for years, being schooled in Stalin-style communist control and doctrine. In contrast, the South democratically elected the nationalist exile [[w:Syngman Rhee|Syngman Rhee]] as its President.
#Why did China support North Korea?
:The People's Republic of China's recent victory over American-supported Nationalist Chinese forces, was wary of an American-led victorious war in Korea. [[w:Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong]] was concerned that it would encourage American intervention in Asia and would destabilize the region.  General MacArthur's brilliant and rapid counteroffensive pushed North Korean forces almost to the Chinese border, at which point, China fearing invasion, hurriedly threw a million man army into the fray.
#Why did the United States support South Korea?
:American action was taken for a number of reasons. Truman was under severe domestic pressure for being too soft on communism. Especially vocal were those who accused the Democrats of having &quot;lost China.&quot; The intervention was also an important implementation of the new [[w:Truman Doctrine|Truman Doctrine]], which advocated the opposition of communism everywhere it tried to expand.
#How did the Korean War begin?
:On June 25, 1950 North Korean forces moved south in force. Using Soviet massive materiel, military strategists and embedded advisors, together with huge reserves of Soviet-trained manpower, their surprise Blitzkrieg-style attack was a crushing success. Within days South Korean forces were in full retreat. Within three weeks, the South Korean forces, and the small number of Americans, mainly combat engineers rebuilding infrastructure, not military trainers, in Korea, were driven into a tiny area in the far Southeastern tip of the peninsula, around the city of [[w:Pusan|Pusan]]. With the aid of U.N. troops, hastily shipped in, mainly American, American supplies ( war materiel ) and initially sporadic air support, the U.N.-led pitiful ROK forces, almost driven into the sea, managed to stabilize a defensive frontier / holding action, termed the [[w:Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]]. Although more UN support eventually arrived the situation was perilous, and it looked as though the North would defeat the U.N. and, ultimately militarily reunify the peninsula.
#Besides the main powers (North and South Korea, China, US and USSR), what other countries participated in the Korean War?
:Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, South Africa, Turkey, Thailand, Greece, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Colombia, the Philippines, Belgium, and Luxembourg, all under the aegis of the United Nations.
#How did South Korea and UN forces recover from the North's rapid expansion and control of all but the tiny southeastern tip of the peninsula?
:In order to alleviate pressure on the Pusan Perimeter, MacArthur, as UN commander in chief of U.N.'s Korean theater of operations, ordered an invasion at [[w:Inchon|Inchon]], far behind the North Korean troops . This was an extremely risky operation, but it was extremely successful. United Nations troops landed at Inchon, faced only mild resistance and quickly moved to recapture Seoul. The North Koreans, finding their supply lines cut, began a rapid retreat northwards and the ROK and UN forces that had been confined in the south moved north and joined up with those that had landed at Inchon.
#Why did Truman fire General MacArthur?
:MacArthur meeting with ROC President [[w:Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang Kai-shek]] in the role of a U.S. diplomat. MacArthur was also wrong at Guam when President Truman asked him specifically about Chinese troop buildup near the Korean border. Furthermore, MacArthur openly criticized the Commander-in-Chief during press conferences, and was rude and flippant when speaking to Truman. Most significantly, he suggested using nuclear weapons to deter China. MacArthur was succeeded by General [[w:Matthew Ridgway|Matthew Ridgway]].
#Why was Korea significant in the development of the Cold War?
:The Korean War was the first armed confrontation of the Cold War, and a model for many later conflicts, that of conventional, limited warfare, instead of an all out nuclear war. It also expanded the Cold War frontiers, which to that point had mostly been confined to opposing Russian expansion in Central Europe.
#What are some famous artistic interpretations of the Korean War?
:Artist [[w:Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso]]'s painting ''Massacre in Korea'' (1951) depicted violence against civilians during the Korean War. By some account, civilian killings committed by U.S. forces in Shinchun, Hwanghae Province was the motive of the painting. In South Korea, the painting was deemed anti-American, a longtime taboo in the South, that it was prohibited for public display until the 1990s.
:In the United States, far and away the most famous artistic depiction of the war is the book, movie and television series ''[[w:M_A_S_H|M*A*S*H]]'', which depicts the misadventures of the staff of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital as they struggle to keep their sanity through the war's absurdities through ribald humour and hijinks when not treating wounded.

===Space Race (1957-1975)===
The Space Race was an unofficial competition between the United States and the USSR in space exploration and technology, and especially to the race between the two nations to land a human being on the moon in the second half of the 1960s.

The Soviets beat the Americans in most firsts, but did not manage to beat them to the moon. Technology and especially aerospace technology advanced greatly during this period. In the sense that it was contested during the 1960s, the space race is usually considered to have been ended by the joint Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975.

===Iran (1951-1953)===
In 1951, Prime Minister [[w:Muhammad Mussadegh|Muhammad Mussadegh]], a militant nationalist, forced the parliament to nationalize the British-owned oil industry in Iran. Despite British pressure, including a economic blockade which caused real hardship, the nationalization continued. Mussadegh was briefly forced from power in 1952 but quickly returned and forced the Shah to flee. It was assumed Mussadegh would declare a republic, but a few days later the Shah returned and again forced Mussadegh from office on August 19 with U.S. CIA support. Mussadegh was arrested and a new prime minister was appointed.

===Guatemala (1954)===
In 1944, [[w:Gen. Jorge Ubico|Gen. Jorge Ubico]]'s dictatorship was overthrown by the &quot;October Revolutionaries,&quot;a group of dissident military officers, students, and liberal professionals. This started what is sometimes called The Ten Years of Spring, a period of rare free speech and political organizations, land reform, and a perception that great progress could be made in Guatemala. A civilian president, [[w:Juan Jose Arevalo|Juan Jose Arevalo]], was elected in 1945 and held the presidency until 1951. Social reforms initiated by Arevalo were continued by his successor, Col. [[w:Jacobo Arbenz|Jacobo Arbenz]]. Arbenz permitted the communist [[w:Guatemalan Labor Party|Guatemalan Labor Party]] to gain legal status in 1952. This greatly upset the American government which, under pressure from CIA Director Allen Dulles, brother of the U.S. Secretary of State [[w:John Foster Dulles|John Foster Dulles]], denounced the communist tendency of Guatemalan government and decided the Arbenz government had to be overthrown. Despite most Guatemalans' attachment to the original ideals of the 1944 uprising, some private sector leaders and the military adhered to the U.S.-imposed ideas about communist threat and started to view Arbenz's policies as a menace. The army refused to defend the Arbenz government when a United States and [[w:United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] -backed group led by Col. [[w:Carlos Castillo Armas|Carlos Castillo Armas]] invaded the country from Honduras in 1954 and quickly took over the government.

*'''Degree of Rotation''' - Every stepper motor has a '''degree of rotation'''. This value indicates how far the rotor will spin around it's axis for each signal sent.

*'''Number of Coil''' - These motors drive coils in a pattern to advance the rotor position

*'''Driving a Coil''' - This is done by passing current through the coil. In stepper motors, all coils must be driven in both directions over a complete revolution.

*'''Sequencing''' - These motors require the electronic control to change which coil in being driven at the correct time. Without this the motor will hold in one position.

*'''H-Bridge Style Driver''' - ...

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor What's a stepper motor?]

In robotics stepper motors are primarily used in stationary robots as they tend to consume quite a lot of power. They are ideal for movements that have to be accurate and are larger than 180°.

===Common Uses/Part Sources===
*'''Floppy, hard disk, or CD/DVD-ROM drives''' - The heart of most these is the stepper motor. In most of these drives, there are two stepper motors. They position the read/write heads and they spin the medium.
*'''Printers, scanners, plotters, and copy machines''' - Most of these devices utilize stepper motors. They are used primarily to position the print head or optics on an (X,Y) coordinate system. One motor positions on the X axis and the other positions on the Y axis.
*'''CNC machines, routers, scanners, lathes etc''' - Used for X/Y/Z positioning of heads.

The idea of symmetry plays a huge role in physics. We have already used symmetry arguments in the theory of relativity -- applying the principle of relativity to obtain the dispersion relation for relativistic matter waves is just such an argument. In this section we begin to explore how symmetry can be used to increase our understanding of quantum mechanics. 

==Free Particle==

The wave function for a free particle of definite momentum, ''P'',  and energy, ''E'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \exp i(kx-\omega t) = \exp i \frac{Px - Et}{\hbar} &lt;/math&gt;

For this wave function |&amp;psi;|&amp;sup2;=1 everywhere, so the probability of finding the particle anywhere in space and time is uniform - just like the particle energy. 

This contrasts with the probability distribution which arises if we assume a free particle to have the wave function 

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \sin \frac{Px - Et}{\hbar}
\quad |\psi|^2= \sin^2 \frac{Px - Et}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case the probability varies with position and time, which is inconsistent with a uniform probability distribution. This solution is less symmetric than the problem.

==Symmetry and Definiteness==

Quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, in the sense that the predictions it makes tell us, for instance, the probability of finding a particle somewhere in space. If we know nothing about a particle's previous history, and if there are no physical constraints that would make it more likely for a particle to be at one point along the axis than any another, then the probability distribution must be ''P''(''x'')=''constant''.

This is an example of a symmetry argument. Expressed more formally, it states that if the above conditions apply, then the probability distribution ought to be subject to the condition ''P''(''x''+''d'')=''P''(''x'') for any constant value of ''d'' . This can only be true if ''P''(''x'') is a constant. 

In the language of physics, if there is nothing that gives the particle a higher probability of being at one point rather than another, then the probability is independent of position and the system is invariant under displacement in the direction.

The above argument doesn't suffice for quantum mechanics, since as we have learned, the fundamental quantity describing a particle is not the probability distribution, but the wave function . Thus, the wave function rather than the probability distribution ought to be the quantity which is invariant under displacement.

This condition turns out to be too restrictive, because it implies that &amp;psi; is constant but we know that a one-dimensional plane wave, which describes a particle with a uniform probability of being found anywhere along the axis, has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \exp ikx \,&lt;/math&gt;

(For simplicity we temporarily ignore the time dependence.) If we make the substitution ''x''&amp;rarr;''x''+''d'' in a plane wave, we get 

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \exp ik(x+d) = \exp ikd  \exp ikx \,&lt;/math&gt;
The wave function is thus technically not invariant under displacement, in that the displaced wave function is multiplied by the factor exp(''ikd''). However, the probability distribution of the displaced wave function still equals one everywhere, so there is no change in what we observe. 

Thus, in determining invariance under displacement, we are allowed to ignore changes in the wave function which consist only of multiplying it by a complex constant with an absolute value of one; i.e one of the form exp(''i''&amp;alpha;) with &amp;alpha; real. Such a multiplicative constant is called a phase factor, and &amp;alpha; the phase.

It is easy to convince oneself by trial and error or by more sophisticated means that the only form of wave function which satisfies this condition is 

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = A \exp ikx \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a (possibly complex) constant. This is just in the form of a complex exponential plane wave with wavenumber ''k''. Thus, not only is the complex exponential wave function invariant under displacements in the manner defined above, it is the only wave function which is invariant to displacements. Furthermore, the phase factor which appears for a displacement ''d'' of such a plane wave takes the form exp(''ikd''), where ''k'' is the wavenumber of the plane wave.

As an example, let us see if a wave packet is invariant under displacement. Let's define a wave packet consisting of two plane waves:
	
:&lt;math&gt;\psi =  e^{ik_1 x} + e^{ik_2 x} &lt;/math&gt;

Making the substitution ''x''&amp;rarr;''x''+''d'' in this case results in
			 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\psi &amp; = &amp; e^{ik_1 (x+d)} + e^{ik_2 (x+d)} \\
&amp; = &amp; e^{ik_1 d}e^{ik_1 x} + e^{ik_2 d}e^{ik_2 x} \\
&amp; \ne &amp; \left[ e^{ik_1 (x+d)} + e^{ik_2 (x+d)} \right] e^{i\alpha}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
no matter what value &amp;alpha; has.

The impossibility of writing the displaced wavefunction as the original multiplied by a phase factor lends plausibility to the assertion that a single complex exponential is the only possible form of the wave function that is invariant under displacement.

Notice that the wave packet does not have definite wavenumber, and hence, momentum. In particular, non-zero amplitudes exist for the associated particle to have either momentum &lt;math&gt;\hbar k_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\hbar k_2&lt;/math&gt; . This makes sense from the point of view of the uncertainty principle -- for a single plane wave the uncertainty in position is complete and the uncertainty in momentum is zero. For a wave packet the uncertainty in position is reduced and the uncertainty in the momentum is non-zero. 

However, we see that this idea can be carried further: A definite value of momentum must be associated with a completely indefinite probability distribution in position. This corresponds to a wave function which has the form of a complex exponential plane wave. 

However, such a plane wave is invariant under a displacement ''d'', except for the multiplicative phase factor , which has no physical consequences since it disappears when the probability distribution is obtained. Thus, we see that invariance under displacement of the wave function and a definite value of the momentum are linked, in that each implies the other:

:'''Invariance under displacement &amp;hArr; Definite momentum'''

We can compare this with classical mechanics, where we saw that if the energy is invariant under displacement then momentum is conserved, and similarly for generalised coordinates.

&lt;!-- 
The idea of potential energy was introduced earlier. In particular, we found that if the total energy is constant, then the momentum cannot be constant in the presence of spatially varying potential energy. This means that the wavenumber, and hence the wavelength of the oscillations in the wave function also vary with position. The spatial inhomogeneity of the potential energy gives rise to spatial inhomogeneity in the wave function, and hence an indefinite momentum. (may need some adjustment to fit) --&gt;

The above equivalence can also be extended to arbitary coordinates. 

In particular, since the time dependence of a complex exponential plane wave is 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t} = e^{-i \frac{Et}{\hbar}}&lt;/math&gt;

we have by analogy with the above argument that
	
:'''Invariance under time shift &amp;hArr; Definite energy'''

Thus, invariance of the wave function under a displacement in time implies a definite value of the energy of the associated particle.

Another useful instance of this is

:'''Invariance under rotation &amp;hArr; Definite angular momentum'''

since the same connection between rotation and angular momentum holds as in classical mechanics.

In the previous chapter we assumed that the frequency (and hence the energy) was definite and constant for a particle passing through a region of variable potential energy. We now see that this assumption is justified only if the potential energy doesn't change with time. This is because a time-varying potential energy eliminates the possibility of invariance under time shift.

==Compatible Variables==

We already know that definite values of certain pairs of variables cannot be obtained simultaneously in quantum mechanics. For instance, the indefiniteness of position and momentum are related by the uncertainty principle -- a definite value of position implies an indefinite value of the momentum and vice versa. If definite values of two variables can be simultaneously obtained, then we call these variables compatible. If not, the variables are incompatible.

If the wave function of a particle is invariant under the transformations associated with both variables, then the variables are compatible. For instance, the complex exponential plane wave associated with a free particle is invariant under displacements in both space and time. Since momentum is associated with space displacements and energy with time displacements, the momentum and energy are compatible variables for a free particle.

==Compatibility and Conservation==

Variables which are compatible with the energy have a special status. The wave function which corresponds to a definite value of such a variable is invariant to displacements in time. Thus, if the wave function is also invariant to some other transformation at a particular time, it is invariant to that transformation for all time. The variable associated with that transformation thus retains its definite value for all time -- i. e., it is conserved.

For example, the complex exponential plane wave implies a definite value of energy, and is thus invariant under time displacements. At time ''t'=0, it is also invariant under displacements, which corresponds to the fact that it represents a particle with a known value of momentum. However, since momentum and energy are compatible for a free particle, the wave function will represent the same value of momentum at all other times. 

In other words, if the momentum is definite at ''t''=0, it will be definite at all later times, and furthermore will have the same value. This is how the conservation of momentum (and by extension, the conservation of any other variable compatible with energy) is expressed in quantum mechanics. 

We will see later how to describe this in terms of operators.</text>

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has many, many genealogy resourcs. The church is in fact on the forefront when it comes to genealogical research, because of their beliefs in proxy, ''postmortem'' baptism and ordinances. Members of the church and those who work in the centers they run are extremely helpful to the genealogical community at large; almost every genealogist has come into contact with a member of the church one way or another.

==Personal Ancestral File (PAF)==

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) has in the past offered a computer program for organization of genealogical records, but the program is no longer being offered or supported.

''to be written:'' usage guide, etc.

==FamilySearch.org==

[FamilySearch.Net] domain was donated to the church by an individual who refused a large amount of money offered by a private interest. The church now maintains familysearch.org for the use of family history enthusiasts. The database of records on this site is derived from the Ancestral File (AF) project of the LDS Family History Department and from other sources.  AF started as a collection of &quot;4-generation&quot; genealogical submissions from members of the LDS Church, but has grown substantially since the early 1980's when the project originally started.  Many genealogy archivists and Family History Library patrons have contributed data to the collection.  The total number of individuals listed in the database numbers in the millions.

The quality of the information varies considerably within the database, as both professionals and amateurs participated in the submission of data.  For some individuals the data is very well documented, and links to original records can be obtained.  Some data is obviously of poor quality, with perhaps incorrect genders or with the same child listed 4 or 5 times, or having other obvious errors.  Another problem with this database was the method used to match up comparable records, which was done &quot;automagically&quot;, or in other words, through a completely automated process.  When matching individuals with substantial amounts of accurate information (full birth date, place information, death dates, etc.), this works fairly smoothly, but a user can sometimes spot a situation in which a family line moves from one submission to another and has been patched together.

The worst situations occur when there is a &quot;flame war&quot; going on between different branches of a family arguing over what the correct information should be on a common ancestor.  To the credit of the Family History Library, there is a dispute resolution procedure to try and clean up messes of this nature, but it does require formal documentation in the form of birth certificates, wills, etc., that are not normally required for ordinary submissions.

If a user spots errors, there are procedures to try and clean up the database, but it is somewhat bureaucratic to get through.  It is still worth doing if you are cleaning up your own family lines.

You can easily access this website and search its large database of records, and even download some of it as a GEDCOM for inclusion in whatever genealogy software you prefer that supports the GEDCOM format (it's the ''de facto'' exchange format between genealogy programs)

=Introduction=
Thermodynamics deals with the movement of heat and its conversion to mechanical and electrical energy among others.

=Laws of Thermodynamics=

===First Law===
The &lt;b&gt;First Law&lt;/b&gt; is a statement of conservation of energy law:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta U = Q - W
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
The &lt;b&gt;First Law&lt;/b&gt; can be expressed as the change in internal energy of a system (&lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;) equals the amount of energy added to a system (Q), such as heat, minus the work expended by the system on its surroundings (W).

If Q is positive, the system has ''gained'' energy (by heating).

If W is positive, the system has ''lost'' energy from doing work on its surroundings.

As written the equations have a problem in that neither Q or W are &lt;b&gt;state functions&lt;/b&gt; or quantities which can be known by direct measurement without knowing the history of the system.

In a gas, the first law can be written in terms of state functions as

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;
dU = T ds - p dV
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Zero-th Law===

After the first law of Thermodynamics had been named, physicists realised that there was another more fundamental law, which they termed the 'zero-th'.

This is that:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
''If two bodies are at the same temperature, there is no resultant heat flow between them.''
|}

An alternate form of the 'zero-th' law can be described:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
''If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third, all are in thermal equilibrium with each other.''
|}

This second statement, in turn, gives rise to a definition of Temperature (T):  


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
''Temperature is the only thing that is the same between two otherwise unlike bodies that are in thermal equilibrium with each other.''
|}

===Second Law===

This law states that heat will never of itself flow from a cold object to a hot object.

&lt;math&gt;
S = k_B \cdot ln(\Omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant (&lt;math&gt;k_B = 1.380658 \cdot 10^{-23}  \mbox{ kg m}^2 \mbox{ s}^{-2} \mbox{ K}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the partition function, i. e. the number of all possible states in the system.

This was the statistical definition of entropy, there is also a &quot;macroscopic&quot; definition:

&lt;math&gt;
S = \int  \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the temperature and d''Q'' is the increment in energy of the system.

===Third Law===

The third law states that a temperature of absolute zero cannot be reached.

=Temperature Scales=

There are several different scales used to measure temperature. Those you will most often come across in physics are degrees Celsius and kelvins.

Celsius temperatures use the symbol '''Θ'''. The symbol for degrees Celsius is '''
°C'''.
Kelvin temperatures use the symbol '''T'''. The symbol for kelvins is '''K'''.


===The Celsius Scale===

The Celsius scale is based on the melting and boiling points of water.

The temperature for freezing water is 0 °C.
This is called the ''freezing point''


The temperature of boiling water is 100 °C.
This is called the ''steam point''.


The Celsius scale is sometimes known as 'Centigrade', but the CGPM chose ''degrees Celsius'' from among the three names then in use way back in 1948, and centesimal and centigrade should no longer be used. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centigrade Wikipedia] for more details.

===The Kelvin Scale===

The Kelvin scale is based on a more fundamental temperature than the melting point of ice. This is absolute zero (equivalent to &amp;minus;273.15 °C), the lowest possible temperature anything could be cooled to&amp;mdash;where the kinetic energy of ''any'' system is at its minimum.
The Kelvin scale was developed from an observation on how the  pressure and volume of a sample of gas changes with temperature-  PV/T   is  a constant.   If the temperature ( T)was reduced, then the pressure ( P) exerted by  Volume (V) the Gas would also reduce, in direct proportion.   This is a simple experiment and can be carried out in most school labs. Gases  were assumed to  exert no pressure  at  -273 degree Celsius. ( In fact all gases will have condensed into liquids or solids at a somewhat higher temperature) 

Although the Kelvin scale starts at a different point to Celsius, its units are of exactly the same size.

Therefore:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
''Temperature in kelvins (''K'') = Temperature in degrees Celsius (''°C'') + 273.15''
|}

=Specific Latent Heat=

Energy is needed to break bonds when a substance changes state. This energy is sometimes called the ''latent heat''. Temperature remains constant during changes of state.

To calculate the energy needed for a change of state, the following equation is used:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
''Heat transferred, ΔQ (''J'') = Mass, m (''kg'') x specific latent heat capacity, ''L'' (''J''/''kg'')''
|}

The specific latent heat, ''L'', is the energy needed to change the state of 1 kg of the substance without changing the temperature.

The latent heat of ''fusion'' refers to melting.
The latent heat of ''vapourisation'' refers to boiling.

=Specific Heat Capacity=

The specific heat capacity is the energy needed to raise the temperature of a given mass by a certain temperature.

The change in temperature of a substance being heated or cooled depends on the mass of the substance and on how much energy is put in. However, it also depends on the properties of that given substance. How this affects temperature variation is expressed by the substance's ''specific heat capacity'' (''c'').  This is measured in J/(kg&amp;middot;K) in SI units.


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
''Change in internal energy, ''Δ''U (''J'') = mass, m (''kg'') x specific heat capacity, c (''J''/''(kg&amp;middot;K)'') x temperature change, ''Δ''T (''K'')''
|}

'''Ellen's mama's mama''' is an extremely bitter woman who treats Ellen with undue contempt. Ellen's mama's mama resents Ellen and blames her for Ellen's dad's mistakes (most notably Ellen's mother's death).  Ellen has trouble understanding why her grandmother is unable to differentiate Ellen from Ellen's father.

'''Ellen's father''' is a lazy and dirty man who thinks of only himself. He usually isn't around, and when he is around he is usually drunk and prone to sexually harassing Ellen. As a result, Ellen is forced to take care of the bills and make dinner for herself and her father. Ellen talks about wanting to kill her father.

'''Starletta and her family''' are very poor.  Ellen informs the reader that Starletta has been known to eat dirt and is slightly retarded. Their family, however, is kind and generous to Ellen.  They feed her and let her stay with them without asking any questions.  Thus, Starletta becomes Ellen's best friend.  At first, Ellen has mixed feelings towards the family because they are &quot;colored,&quot; but near the end of the novel, Ellen realizes that this was a silly opinion to hold and she apologizes to Starletta.

'''Mama (Ellen’s mother)''' dies very early in Ellen’s life from an overdose of medications. Ellen’s father refuses to take her mother to the hospital making the death partly his fault. When Ellen goes to her grandmother’s house, the reader learns that Mama was very highly regarded by her family. It is not clear, however, why Ellen’s mother married the man that she did instead of pursuing a career.

'''Dora and Nadine''' are a fairly wealthy family who allow Ellen to stay at their house for Christmas. When Dora (Nadine's daughter) asks Ellen what she wants for Christmas, Ellen says that she only wants paper, although she hopes that Dora will get her something better. Dora only gives Ellen paper and Ellen gets upset. Ellen gives Dora a hand drawn painting, for which Dora expresses dislike.

The ''Non-Programmers' Tutorial For Python'' is a tutorial designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language.  This guide is for someone with no programming experience.

If you have programmed in other languages I recommend using [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/ Python Tutorial for Programmers] written by Guido van Rossum.  

If you have any questions or comments please use the discussion pages or see [[../Authors]] for author contact information.  I welcome questions and comments about this tutorial.  I will try to answer any questions you have as best I can.  

Thanks go to James A. Brown for writing most of the Windows install info.  Thanks also to Elizabeth Cogliati for complaining enough :) about the original tutorial (that is almost unusable for a non-programmer), for proofreading, and for many ideas and comments on it.  Thanks to Joe Oppegaard for writing almost all the exercises.  Thanks to everyone I have missed.

== First things first ==
So, you've never programmed before.  As we go through this tutorial, I
will attempt to teach you how to program.  There really is only one
way to learn to program.  ''' You''' must read ''code'' and write ''code'' (as computer programs are often called).
I'm going to show you lots of code.  You should type in code that I
show you to see what happens.  Play around with it and make changes.
The worst that can happen is that it won't work.  When I type in code
it will be formatted like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
##Python is easy to learn
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot; 
&lt;/source&gt;

That's so it is easy to distinguish from the other text.  If you're reading this on the web, you'll notice the code is in color -- that's just to make it stand out, and to make the different parts of the code stand out from each other.  The code you enter will probably not be colored, or the colors may be different, but it won't affect the code as long as you enter it the same way as it's printed here. 

If the computer prints something out it will be formatted like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello, World!
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Note that printed text goes to your screen, and does not involve paper. Before computers had screens, the output of computer programs would be printed on paper.)

If you try this program out and you get a syntax error, check and see what version of python you have.  If you have python 3.0, you should be using the [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3.0]]. This article was made for Python 2.6

There will often be a mixture of the text you type (which is shown in '''bold''') and the text the program prints to the screen, which would look like this:

 Halt!
 Who Goes there? '''Josh'''
 You may pass, Josh

(Some of the tutorial has not been converted to this format. Since this is a wiki, you can convert it when you find it.)

I will also introduce you to the terminology of programming - for example, that programming is often referred to as ''coding''.  This will not only help you understand what programmers are talking about, but also help the learning process.

Now, on to more important things.  In order to program in Python you need the Python software.  If you don't already have the Python software go to http://www.python.org/download/ and get the proper version for your platform.  Download it, read the instructions and get it installed.

=== Installing Python ===
For Python programming you need a working Python installation and a text editor. Python comes with its own editor ''IDLE'', which is quite nice and totally sufficient for the beginning. As you get more into programming, you will probably switch to some other editor like ''emacs'', ''vi'' or another.

The Python download page is [http://www.python.org/download http://www.python.org/download]. The most recent version is 3.1, but any ''Python 2.x'' version since 2.2 will work for this tutorial. Be careful with the upcoming ''Python 3'', though, as some major details will change and break this tutorial's examples. A version of this tutorial for Python 3 is at [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]]. There are various different installation files for different computer platforms available on the download site. Here are some specific instructions for the most common operating systems:

==== Linux, BSD and Unix users ====
You are probably lucky and Python is already installed on your machine. To test it type &lt;tt&gt;python&lt;/tt&gt; on a command line. If you see something like that in the following section, you are set.

If you have to install Python, just use the operating system's package manager or go to the repository where your packages are available and get Python. Alternatively, you can compile Python from scratch after downloading the source code. If you get the source code make sure you compile in the Tk extension if you want to use IDLE.&lt;!-- Is this realistic for people who don't know how to program??? --&gt;

==== Mac users ====
Starting from Mac OS X (Tiger), Python ships by default with the operating system, but you  might want to update to the newer version (check the version by starting &lt;tt&gt;python&lt;/tt&gt; in a command line terminal). Also IDLE (the Python editor) might be missing in the standard installation. If you want to (re-)install Python, have a look at the [http://www.python.org/download/mac/ Mac page on the Python download site].

==== Windows users ====
Some computer manufacturers pre-install Python. To check if you already have it installed, open command prompt (cmd in run menu) or MS-DOS and type python. If it says &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; you will need to download the appropriate Windows installer (the normal one, if you do not have a 64-bit AMD or Intel chip). Start the installer by double-clicking it and follow the procedure.
Python for windows can be downloaded from the official [http://www.python.org/getit/ site of python]

=== Interactive Mode ===
Go into IDLE (also called the Python GUI).  You should see a window that has some text like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 18 2007, 08:51:08) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license()&quot; for more information.


   ****************************************************************
   Personal firewall software may warn about the connection IDLE
   makes to its subprocess using this computer's internal loopback
   interface.  This connection is not visible on any external
   interface and no data is sent to or received from the Internet.
   ****************************************************************


IDLE 1.2.1      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is Python's way of telling you that you are in
interactive mode.  In interactive mode what you type is immediately
run.  Try typing &lt;code&gt;1+1&lt;/code&gt; in. Python will respond with &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.
Interactive mode allows you to test out and see what Python will do.
If you ever feel you need to play with new Python statements, go into
interactive mode and try them out.

=== Creating and Running Programs ===

Go into IDLE if you are not already.  In the menu at the top, select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;New Window&lt;/code&gt;.  In the new window that appears, type the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now save the program: select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; from the menu, then &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt;.  Save it as &quot;&lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (you can save it in any folder you want).  Now that it is saved it can be run.  

Next run the program by going to &lt;code&gt;Run&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Run Module&lt;/code&gt; (or if you have a older version of IDLE use &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Run script&lt;/code&gt;).  This will output &lt;code&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;*Python Shell*&lt;/code&gt; window.  

For a more in-depth introduction to IDLE, a longer tutorial with screenshots can be found at [http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html]

==== Running Python Programs in Unix ====

If you are using Unix (such as Linux, Mac OSX, or BSD), if you make the program executable with &lt;code&gt;[[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities#chmod|chmod]]&lt;/code&gt;, and have as the first line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python2
&lt;/source&gt;
you can run the python program with &lt;code&gt;./hello.py&lt;/code&gt; like any other command.

Note: In some computer environments, you need to write: 
 &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
&lt;/source&gt;

Example for Solaris:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Program file names ====
It is very useful to stick to some rules regarding the file names of Python programs. Otherwise some things ''might'' go wrong unexpectedly.  These don't matter as much for programs, but you can have weird problems if you don't follow them for module names (modules will be discussed later).

# Always save the program with the extension &lt;tt&gt;.py&lt;/tt&gt;. Do not put another dot somewhere else in the file name.
# Only use standard characters for file names: letters, numbers, dash (&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;) and underscore (&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;).
# White space (&quot;&lt;tt&gt; &lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) should not be used at all (e.g. use underscores instead).
# Do not use anything other than a letter (particularly no numbers!) at the beginning of a file name.
# Do not use &quot;non-english&quot; characters (such as &lt;tt&gt;ä&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ö&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ü&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;å&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ß&lt;/tt&gt;) in your file names, or, even better, do not use them at all when programming.

=== Using Python from the command line ===
If you don't want to use Python from the command line, you don't have to, just use IDLE.  To get into interactive mode just type &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; without any arguments.  To run a program, create it with a text editor (Emacs has a good Python mode) and then run it with &lt;code&gt;python program_name&lt;/code&gt;.

Additionally, to use Python within Vim, you may want to visit [http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/pybiblio/tips/elkner/vim4python.php Using vim as a Python IDE]

=== Where to get help ===
At some point in your Python career you will probably get stuck and have no clue about how to solve the problem you are supposed to work on. This tutorial only covers the basics of Python programming, but there is a lot of further information available.

==== Python documentation ====
First of all, Python is very well documented. There might even be copies of these documents on your computer, which came with your Python installation:
'''* The official [http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html Python Tutorial] by Guido van Rossum is often a good starting point for general questions'''.
* For questions about standard modules (you will learn what this is later), the [http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html Python Library Reference] is the place to look.
* If you really want to get to know something about the details of the language, the [http://docs.python.org/ref/ref.html Python Reference Manual] is comprehensive but quite complex for beginners.

==== Python user community ====
There are a lot of other Python users out there, and usually they are nice and willing to help you. This very active user community is organised mostly through mailing lists and a newsgroup:
* The [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor tutor mailing list] is for folks who want to ask questions regarding how to learn computer programming with the Python language.
* The [http://www.python.org/community/lists/#python-help python-help mailing list] is python.org's help desk. You can ask a group of knowledgeable volunteers questions about all your Python problems.
* The Python newsgroup [news:comp.lang.python comp.lang.python] ([http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/ Google groups archive]) is the place for general Python discussions, questions and the central meeting point of the community.

In order not to reinvent the wheel and discuss the same questions again and again, people will appreciate very much if you ''do a web search for a solution to your problem before contacting these lists!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Now for our first lesson, what is a computer program?  A computer program is a set of very detailed instructions that tell a computer what to do.   --&gt;
&lt;!-- TODO add section explaining how to run python programs --&gt;
=== What you should know ===
You should know how to edit programs in a text editor or IDLE, save the file and run the file once the files have been saved to your disk.

=== Printing ===
Programming tutorials since the beginning of time have started with a little program called &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Computer Programming/Hello world|List of &quot;Hello, world!&quot; programs in many programming languages]]&lt;/ref&gt; The syntax changed in Python 3.0. If you are using Python 3.0, you should be reading [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]] instead. So here is the Python 2.6 example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you are using the command line to run programs then type it in with a text editor, save it as &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; and run it with &lt;code&gt;python hello.py&lt;/code&gt;

Otherwise go into IDLE, create a new window, and create the program as
in section [[../Intro#Creating_and_Running_Programs|Creating and Running Programs]].

When this program is run here's what it prints:

 Hello, World!

Now I'm not going to tell you this every time, but when I show you a
program I recommend that you type it in and run it.  I learn better
when I type it in and you probably do too.

Now here is a more complicated program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;
print &quot;to fetch a pail of water;&quot;
print &quot;Jack fell down, and broke his crown,&quot;
print &quot;and Jill came tumbling after.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this program it prints out:

 Jack and Jill went up a hill
 to fetch a pail of water;
 Jack fell down, and broke his crown,
 and Jill came tumbling after.

When the computer runs this program it first sees the line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

so the computer prints:

 Jack and Jill went up a hill

Then the computer goes down to the next line and sees:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;to fetch a pail of water;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

So the computer prints to the screen:

 to fetch a pail of water;

The computer keeps looking at each line, follows the command and then goes on to the next line.  The computer keeps running commands until it reaches the end of the program.

==== Terminology ====
Now is probably a good time to give you a bit of an explanation of what is happening - and a little bit of programming terminology.

What we were doing above was using a ''command'' called &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; command is followed by one or more ''arguments''.  So in this example

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

there is one ''argument'', which is &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that this argument is a group of characters enclosed in double quotes (&quot;).  This is commonly referred to as a ''string of characters'', or ''string'', for short.  Another example of a string is &lt;code&gt;&quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

A command and its arguments are collectively referred to as a ''statement'', so

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

is an example of a statement.

That's probably more than enough terminology for now.

=== Expressions ===
Here is another program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2 + 2
print &quot;3 * 4 is&quot;, 3 * 4
print &quot;100 - 1 is&quot;, 100 - 1
print &quot;(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is&quot;, (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the ''output'' when the program is run:

 2 + 2 is 4
 3 * 4 is 12
 100 - 1 is 99
 (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is 18.5

As you can see, Python can turn your six hundred dollar computer into a 2 dollar calculator.

In this example, the print command is followed by two arguments, with each of the arguments separated by a comma.  So with the first line of the program

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2 + 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument is the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and the second argument is the ''mathematical expression'' &lt;code&gt;2 + 2&lt;/code&gt;, which is commonly referred to as an ''expression''.

What is important to note is that a string is printed as is (the string is what is within the double quotes but doesn't include the double quotes themselves. So the string is printed without the enclosing double quotes.) But an ''expression'' is ''evaluated'', (in other words, converted) to its actual value.

Python has six basic operations for numbers: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Operation 
! Symbol 
! Example
|-
|Power (exponentiation)
| &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;5 ** 2 == 25&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Multiplication 
| &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;2 * 3 == 6&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Division 
| &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;14 / 3 == 4&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Remainder (modulo)
| &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;14 % 3 == 2&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Addition 
| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 == 3&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Subtraction 
| &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;4 - 3 == 1&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Notice that division follows the rule, '''if there are no decimals to start with, there will be no decimals to end with'''. The following program shows this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;14 / 3 = &quot;, 14 / 3
print &quot;14 % 3 = &quot;, 14 % 3
print
print &quot;14.0 / 3.0 =&quot;, 14.0 / 3.0
print &quot;14.0 % 3.0 =&quot;, 14.0 % 3.0
print
print &quot;14.0 / 3 =&quot;, 14.0 / 3
print &quot;14.0 % 3 =&quot;, 14.0 % 3
print
print &quot;14 / 3.0 =&quot;, 14 / 3.0
print &quot;14 % 3.0 =&quot;, 14 % 3.0
print 
&lt;/source&gt;

With the output:

 14 / 3 = 4
 14 % 3 = 2
 
 14.0 / 3.0 = 4.66666666667
 14.0 % 3.0 = 2.0
 
 14.0 / 3 = 4.66666666667
 14.0 % 3 = 2.0
 
 14 / 3.0 = 4.66666666667
 14 % 3.0 = 2.0

Notice how Python gives different answers for some problems depending on whether or not decimal values are used.  

The order of operations is the same as in math:
* parentheses &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;
* exponents &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;
* multiplication &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, division &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and remainder &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; 
* addition &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and subtraction &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;
So use parentheses to structure your formulas when needed.

=== Talking to humans (and other intelligent beings) ===

Often in programming you are doing something complicated and may not in the future remember what you did.  When this happens, the program should probably be commented.  A ''comment'' is a note to you and other programmers explaining what is happening.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Not quite PI, but an incredible simulation
print 22.0 / 7.0    # 355/113 is even more incredible rational approx to PI
&lt;/source&gt;

Which outputs

 3.14285714286

Notice that the comment starts with a hash: &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. Comments are used to communicate with others who read the program and your future self to make clear what is complicated.

Note that any text can follow a comment, and that when the program is run, the text after the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; through to the end of that line is ignored. The &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; does not have to be at the beginning of a new line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Output PI on the screen
print 22.0 / 7.0 # Well, just a good approximation
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Examples ===
Each chapter (eventually) will contain examples of the programming features introduced in the chapter.  You should at least look over them and see if you understand them.  If you don't, you may want to type them in and see what happens.  Mess around with them, change them and see what happens.  

'''Denmark.py'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot;
print &quot;                -- Shakespeare&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
                 -- Shakespeare

'''School.py'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This is not quite true outside of USA
# and is based on my dim memories of my younger years
print &quot;First Grade&quot;
print &quot;1 + 1 =&quot;, 1 + 1
print &quot;2 + 4 =&quot;, 2 + 4
print &quot;5 - 2 =&quot;, 5 - 2
print
print &quot;Third Grade&quot;
print &quot;243 - 23 =&quot;, 243 - 23
print &quot;12 * 4 =&quot;, 12 * 4
print &quot;12 / 3 =&quot;, 12 / 3
print &quot;13 / 3 =&quot;, 13 / 3, &quot;R&quot;, 13 % 3

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Input and Variables ===
Now I feel it is time for a really complicated program.  Here it is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Halt!&quot;
user_reply = raw_input(&quot;Who goes there? &quot;)
print &quot;You may pass,&quot;, user_reply
&lt;/source&gt;

When '''I''' ran it, here is what '''my''' screen showed:

 Halt!
 Who goes there? '''Josh'''
 You may pass, Josh

''Note: After running the code by pressing F5, the Python shell will only give output:''

 Halt!
 Who goes there?

''You need to enter your name in the Python shell, and then press Enter to get the rest of the output.''

Of course when you run the program your screen will look different
because of the &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt; statement. When you ran the program
you probably noticed (you did run the program, right?) that you had to
type in your name and then press Enter. Then the program printed out
some more text and also your name. This is an example of ''input''.  The
program reaches a certain point and then waits for the user to input
some data that the program can use later.

Of course, getting information from the user would be useless if we didn't have anywhere to put that information and this is where variables come in.  In the previous program, &lt;code&gt;user_reply&lt;/code&gt; is a ''variable''.  Variables are like a box that can store some piece of data.  Here is a program to show examples of variables:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 123.4
b23 = 'Spam'
first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;
b = 432
c = a + b
print &quot;a + b is&quot;, c
print &quot;first_name is&quot;, first_name
print &quot;Sorted Parts, After Midnight or&quot;, b23
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the output:

 a + b is 555.4
 first_name is Bill
 Sorted Parts, After Midnight or Spam

The variables in the above program are &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b23&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.  A variable in Python can store any type of data - in this example we stored some strings (e.g. &quot;Bill&quot;) and some numbers (e.g. 432).

Note the difference between strings and variable names.  Strings are marked with quotation marks, which tells the computer &quot;don't try to understand, just take this text as it is&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;first_name&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This would print the text:

 first_name

as-is.  Variable names are written without any quotation marks and instruct the computer &quot;use the value I've previously stored under this name&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print first_name
&lt;/source&gt;

which would print (after the previous example):

 Bill

=== Assignment ===

Okay, so we have these boxes called variables and also data that can go into the variable.  The computer will see a line like &lt;code&gt;first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and it reads it as &quot;Put the string &lt;code&gt;Bill&lt;/code&gt; into the box (or variable) &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Later on it sees the statement &lt;code&gt;c = a + b&lt;/code&gt; and it reads it as &quot;put the sum of &lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;123.4 + 432&lt;/code&gt; which equals &lt;code&gt;555.4&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The right hand side of the statement (&lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt;) is ''evaluated'' and the result is stored in the variable on the left hand side (&lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;). This is called ''assignment'', and you should not confuse the assignment equal sign (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;) with &quot;equality&quot; in a mathematical sense here (that's what &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; will be used for later).

Here is another example of variable usage:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
print a
a = a + 1
print a
a = a * 2
print a
&lt;/source&gt;

And of course here is the output:

 1
 2
 4

Even if it is the same variable on both sides the computer still reads it as &quot;First find out the data to store and then find out where the data goes&quot;.

One more program before I end this chapter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = input(&quot;Type in a number: &quot;)
text = raw_input(&quot;Type in a string: &quot;)
print &quot;number =&quot;, number
print &quot;number is a&quot;, type(number)
print &quot;number * 2 =&quot;, number * 2
print &quot;text =&quot;, text
print &quot;text is a&quot;, type(text)
print &quot;text * 2 =&quot;, text * 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The output I got was:

 Type in a Number: '''12.34'''
 Type in a String: '''Hello'''
 number = 12.34
 number is a &lt;type 'float'&gt;
 number * 2 = 24.68
 text = Hello
 text is a &lt;type 'str'&gt;
 text * 2 = HelloHello

Notice that &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; was gotten with &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; was gotten with &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt; returns a string while &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; returns a number. When you want the user to type in a number use &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; but if you want the user to type in a string use &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt;.

{{mbox
| image = [[File:Ambox_important.svg|40px|alt=Exclamation mark]]
| text  = Only use &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; when you trust your users with the computer the program runs on. &lt;br&gt;
Everything entered into &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; dialog is evaluated as a Python expression and thus allows the user to take control of your program. For example, entering &lt;code&gt;__import__('os').system('dir')&lt;/code&gt; executes the &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; command. You should instead get a string and convert it to the necessary type like &lt;code&gt;int(raw_input())&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;float(raw_input())&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

The second half of the program uses &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; which tells what a
variable is. Numbers are of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, which are
short for ''integer'' and ''floating point'' (mostly used for decimal numbers), respectively. Text strings are of type &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, short for ''string''. Integers and floats can be worked on by mathematical functions, strings cannot. Notice how when python
multiplies a number by an integer the expected thing happens. However
when a string is multiplied by an integer the result is that multiple
copies of the string are produced (i.e., &lt;code&gt;text * 2 = HelloHello&lt;/code&gt;).

The operations with strings do different things than 
operations with numbers.  Here are some interactive mode examples
to show that some more.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;This&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;is&quot; + &quot; joined.&quot;
'This is joined.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ha, &quot; * 5
'Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, '
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ha, &quot; * 5 + &quot;ha!&quot;
'Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

This could also be done as a program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;This&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;is&quot; + &quot; joined.&quot;
print &quot;Ha, &quot; * 5
print &quot;Ha, &quot; * 5 + &quot;ha!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the list of some string operations:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Operation 
!Symbol 
!Example
|-
|Repetition 
|&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;i&quot; * 5 == &quot;iiiii&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Concatenation 
|&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;World!&quot; == &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
|}
&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!-- n_1 = input(&quot;First Number? &quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- n_2 = input(&quot;Second Number? &quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- name = raw_input(&quot;Input your name: &quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print name,&quot;, the sum of the first number and the second number is&quot;, n_1 + n_2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;n_1 =&quot;,repr(n_1) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;n_2 =&quot;,repr(n_2) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;name =&quot;,repr(name) --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!-- You use &lt;code&gt;raw_input&lt;/code&gt; when you want to get a string from the user. You use &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; around the &lt;code&gt;raw_input&lt;/code&gt; when you want to get a number.   --&gt;

=== Examples ===

'''Rate_times.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates rate and distance problems
print &quot;Input a rate and a distance&quot;
rate = input(&quot;Rate: &quot;)
distance = input(&quot;Distance: &quot;)
print &quot;Time:&quot;, (distance / rate)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate: '''5'''
 Distance: '''10'''
 Time: 2

 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate: '''3.52'''
 Distance: '''45.6'''
 Time: 12.9545454545

'''Area.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle
print &quot;Calculate information about a rectangle&quot;
length = input(&quot;Length: &quot;)
width = input(&quot;Width: &quot;)
print &quot;Area&quot;, length * width
print &quot;Perimeter&quot;, 2 * length + 2 * width
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Calculate information about a rectangle
 Length: '''4'''
 Width: '''3'''
 Area 12
 Perimeter 14

 Calculate information about a rectangle
 Length: '''2.53'''
 Width: '''5.2'''
 Area 13.156
 Perimeter 15.46

'''temperature.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
temp = input(&quot;Fahrenheit temperature: &quot;)
print (temp - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''32'''
 0.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''-40'''
 -40.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''212'''
 100.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''98.6'''
 37.0

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== While loops ===
Here we present our first ''control structure''.  Ordinarily the computer starts with the first line and then goes down from there.  Control structures change the order that statements are executed or decide if a certain statement will be run.  Here's the source for a program that uses the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; control structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    print a
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the extremely exciting output: 

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10

And you thought it couldn't get any worse after turning your computer into a five dollar calculator?

So what does the program do?  First it sees the line &lt;code&gt;a = 0&lt;/code&gt; and sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to zero. Then it sees &lt;code&gt;while a &lt; 10:&lt;/code&gt; and so the computer checks to see if &lt;code&gt;a &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt;. The first time the computer sees this statement &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is zero so it is less than 10. In other words as long as &lt;code&gt;''a''&lt;/code&gt; is less than ten the computer will run the tabbed in statements. This eventually makes &lt;code&gt;''a''&lt;/code&gt; equal to ten (by adding one to &lt;code&gt;''a''&lt;/code&gt; again and again), and the &lt;code&gt;while a &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt; is not true any longer. Reaching that point the program will not run the indented lines any longer.

Always remember to put a colon &quot;:&quot; after the &quot;while&quot; statement!

Here is another example of the use of &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
s = 0
print ('Enter Numbers to add to the sum.')
print ('Enter 0 to quit.')
while a != 0:
    print ('Current Sum:', s)
    a = input('Number? ')
    s = s + int(a)
print ('Total Sum =', s)
&lt;/source&gt;

 Enter Numbers to add to the sum.
 Enter 0 to quit.
 Current Sum: 0
 Number? '''200'''
 Current Sum: 200
 Number? '''-15.25'''
 Current Sum: 184.75
 Number? '''-151.85'''
 Current Sum: 32.9
 Number? '''10.00'''
 Current Sum: 42.9
 Number? '''0'''
 Total Sum = 42.9

Notice how &lt;code&gt;print 'Total Sum =', s&lt;/code&gt; is only run at the end. The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement only affects the lines that are indented with whitespace. The &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;does not equal&quot; so &lt;code&gt;&quot;while a != 0:&quot;&lt;/code&gt; means: &quot;until &lt;code&gt;''a''&lt;/code&gt; is zero, run the tabbed statements that follow.&quot;  

==== Infinite loops ====
Now that we have while loops, it is possible to have programs that run forever. An easy way to do this is to write a program like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while 1 == 1:
   print &quot;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; operator is used to test equality of the expressions on the two sides of the operator, just as &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; was used for &quot;less than&quot; before (you will get a complete list of all comparison operators in the next chapter).

This program will output &lt;code&gt;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&lt;/code&gt; until the heat death of the universe or until you stop it, because 1 will forever be equal to 1.  The way to stop it is to hit the Control (or ''Ctrl'') button and ''C'' (the letter) at the same time.  This will kill the program.  (Note: sometimes you will have to hit enter after the Control-C.)

=== Examples ===
'''Fibonacci.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
max_count = 20
while count &lt; max_count:
    count = count + 1
    # we need to keep track of a since we change it
    old_a = a
    old_b = b
    a = old_b
    b = old_a + old_b
    # Notice that the , at the end of a print statement keeps it
    # from switching to a new line
    print(old_a),
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181

Note the output on a single line by use of a comma at the end of the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement.

'''Password.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Waits until a password has been entered.  Use Control-C to break out without
# the password

# Note that this must not be the password so that the 
# while loop runs at least once.
password = &quot;no password&quot;

# note that != means not equal
while password != &quot;unicorn&quot;:
    password = raw_input(&quot;Password: &quot;)
print &quot;Welcome in&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample run:
 Password: '''auo'''
 Password: '''y22'''
 Password: '''password'''
 Password: '''open sesame'''
 Password: '''unicorn'''
 Welcome in

=== Exercises ===
Write a program that asks the user for a Login Name and password.  Then when they type &quot;lock&quot;, they need to type in their name and password to unlock the program.
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

Write a program that asks the user for a Login Name and password.  Then when they type &quot;lock&quot;, they need to type in their name and password to unlock the program.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
name = raw_input(&quot;What is your UserName: &quot;)
password = raw_input(&quot;What is your Password: &quot;)
print &quot;To lock your computer type lock.&quot;
command = &quot;&quot;
input1 = &quot;&quot;
input2 = &quot;&quot;
while command != &quot;lock&quot;:
    command = raw_input(&quot;What is your command: &quot;)
while input1 != name:
    input1 = raw_input(&quot;What is your username: &quot;)
while input2 != password:
    input2 = raw_input(&quot;What is your password: &quot;)
print &quot;Welcome back to your system!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you would like the program to run continuously, just add a &lt;code&gt;while 1 == 1:&lt;/code&gt; loop around the whole thing.
You will have to indent the rest of the program when you add this at the top of the code, but don't worry, you don't have to do it manually for each line! Just highlight everything you want to indent and click on &quot;Indent&quot; under &quot;Format&quot; in the top bar of the python window. Note that you can use empty strings like this: &lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

Another way of doing this could be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
name = raw_input('Set name: ')
password = raw_input('Set password: ')
while 1 == 1:
    nameguess=passwordguess=key=&quot;&quot;   # multiple assignment
    while (nameguess != name) or (passwordguess != password):
        nameguess = raw_input('Name? ')
        passwordguess = raw_input('Password? ')
    print &quot;Welcome,&quot;, name, &quot;. Type lock to lock.&quot;
    while key != &quot;lock&quot;:
        key = raw_input(&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; in while &lt;code&gt;(name != &quot;user&quot;) or (password != &quot;pass&quot;):&lt;code&gt;, which we haven't yet introduced. You can probably figure out how it works.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
login = &quot;john&quot;
password = &quot;tucker&quot;
logged=2

while logged != 0:
    while login != &quot;Phil&quot;:    
            login = raw_input(&quot;Login : &quot;)
    while password != &quot;McChicken&quot;:
            password = raw_input(&quot;Password: &quot;)
    logged = 1

    print &quot;Welcome!&quot;
    print &quot;To leave type lock &quot;

    while logged == 1:
        leave = raw_input (&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;)
        if leave == &quot;lock&quot;:
            logged = 0
print &quot;Goodbye!!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This method, although a bit more crude also works. Notice it uses the as of yet un-introduced &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== If statement ===
As always I believe I should start each chapter with a warm-up typing exercise, so here is a short program to compute the absolute value of a number:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
n = input(&quot;Number? &quot;)
if n &lt; 0:
   print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, -n
else:
   print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, n
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:

 Number? '''-34'''
 The absolute value of -34 is 34

 Number? '''1'''
 The absolute value of 1 is 1

So what does the computer do when it sees this piece of code?  First it prompts the user for a number with the statement &quot;&lt;code&gt;n = input(&quot;Number? &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  Next it reads the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;if n &lt; 0:&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. If &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is less than zero Python runs the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, -n&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Otherwise it runs the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;print &quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, n&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  

More formally Python looks at whether the ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;n &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; is true or false.  An &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is followed by an indented ''block'' of statements that are run when the expression is true.  Optionally after the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statement and another indented ''block'' of statements.  This second block of statements is run if the expression is false.  

There are a number of different tests that an expression can have.  Here is a table of all of them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!operator 
!function
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|less than
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
|less than or equal to
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|greater than
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
|greater than or equal to
|-
|&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; 
|equal
|-
|&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; 
|not equal
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|another way to say not equal (old style, not recommended)
|}

Another feature of the &lt;code&gt; if&lt;/code&gt; command is the &lt;code&gt; elif &lt;/code&gt; statement.  It stands for else if and means if the original &lt;code&gt; if&lt;/code&gt; statement is false but the &lt;code&gt; elif&lt;/code&gt; part is true, then do the &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; part. And if neither the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; expressions are true, then do what's in the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block. Here's an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a &gt; 5:
        print a, &quot;&gt;&quot;, 5
    elif a &lt;= 7:
        print a, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, 7
    else:
        print &quot;Neither test was true&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

and the output:

 1 &lt;= 7
 2 &lt;= 7
 3 &lt;= 7
 4 &lt;= 7
 5 &lt;= 7
 6 &gt; 5
 7 &gt; 5
 8 &gt; 5
 9 &gt; 5
 10 &gt; 5

Notice how the &lt;code&gt;elif a &lt;= 7&lt;/code&gt; is only tested when the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement fails to be true. There can be more than one &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; expression, allowing multiple tests to be done in a single &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This Program Demonstrates the use of the == operator
# using numbers
print 5 == 6
# Using variables
x = 5
y = 8
print x == y
&lt;/source&gt;

And the output

 False
 False

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is debugging? ===
:&quot;As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy  to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.&quot; &amp;mdash; ''Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging'', 1949

By now if you have been messing around with the programs you have probably found that sometimes the program does something you didn't want it to do.  This is fairly common.  Debugging is the process of figuring out what the computer is doing and then getting it to do what you want it to do.  This can be tricky.  I once spent nearly a week tracking down and fixing a bug that was caused by someone putting an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; where a &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; should have been.  

This chapter will be more abstract than previous chapters.

=== What should the program do? ===

The first thing to do (this sounds obvious) is to figure out what the
program should be doing if it is running correctly.  Come up with some
test cases and see what happens.  For example, let's say I have a
program to compute the perimeter of a rectangle (the sum of the length
of all the edges).  I have the following test cases:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!height !! width !!perimeter
|-
|3 ||4 ||14
|--
|2 ||3 ||10
|-
|4 ||4 ||16
|-
|2 ||2 ||8
|-
|5 ||1 ||12
|-
|}

I now run my program on all of the test cases and see if the program does what 
I expect it to do.  If it doesn't then I need to find out what the computer is
doing.

More commonly some of the test cases will work and some will not.  If that is the case you should try and figure out what the working ones have in common. 
For example here is the output for a perimeter program (you get to see the code in a minute):

 Height: '''3'''
 Width: '''4'''
 perimeter = 15

 Height: '''2'''
 Width: '''3'''
 perimeter = 11

 Height: '''4'''
 Width: '''4'''
 perimeter = 16

 Height: '''2'''
 Width: '''2'''
 perimeter = 8

 Height: '''5'''
 Width: '''1'''
 perimeter = 8

Notice that it didn't work for the first two inputs, it worked for the next
two and it didn't work on the last one.  Try and figure out what is in common 
with the working ones.  Once you have some idea what the problem is finding the
cause is easier.  With your own programs you should try more test cases if you need them.

=== What does the program do? ===

The next thing to do is to look at the source code.  One of the most important things to do while programming is reading source code.  The primary way to do this is code walkthroughs.  

A code walkthrough starts at the first line, and works its way down until the program is done.  &lt;code&gt;While&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements mean that some lines may never be run and some lines are run many times.  At each line you figure out what Python has done.

Lets start with the simple perimeter program.  Don't type it in, you are going to read it, not run it.  The source code is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
height = input(&quot;Height: &quot;)
width = input(&quot;Width: &quot;)
print &quot;perimeter =&quot;, width + height + width + width
&lt;/source&gt;

; ''Question:'' What is the first line Python runs?
: ''Answer:'' The first line is always run first.  In this case it is: &lt;code&gt;height = input(&quot;Height: &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Prints &lt;code&gt; Height: &lt;/code&gt;, waits for the user to type a number in, and puts that in the variable height.
; What is the next line that runs?
: In general, it is the next line down which is: &lt;code&gt;width = input(&quot;Width: &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Prints &lt;code&gt;Width: &lt;/code&gt;, waits for the user to type a number in, and puts what the user types in the variable width.
; What is the next line that runs?
: When the next line is not indented more or less than the current line, it is the line right afterwards, so it is: &lt;code&gt;print &quot;perimeter = &quot;, width + height + width + width&lt;/code&gt; (It may also run a function in the current line, but that's a future chapter.)                                                                        What does that line do?
: First it prints &lt;code&gt;perimeter = &lt;/code&gt;, then it prints &lt;code&gt;width + height + width + width&lt;/code&gt;.
; Does &lt;code&gt;width + height + width + width&lt;/code&gt; calculate the perimeter properly?
: Let's see, perimeter of a rectangle is the bottom (width) plus the left side (height) plus the top (width) plus the right side (huh?). The last item should be the right side's length, or the height.
; Do you understand why some of the times the perimeter was calculated &quot;correctly&quot;?                                                                             : It was calculated correctly when the width and the height were equal.

The next program we will do a code walkthrough for is a program that is supposed to print out 5 dots on the screen.  However, this is what the program is outputting:

 . . . . 

And here is the program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = 5
while number &gt; 1:
    print &quot;.&quot;,
    number = number - 1
print
&lt;/source&gt;

This program will be more complex to walkthrough since it now has indented portions (or control structures).  Let us begin.
; What is the first line to be run?
: The first line of the file: &lt;code&gt;number = 5&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: Puts the number 5 in the variable number.
; What is the next line?
: The next line is: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: Well, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statements in general look at their expression, and if it is true they do the next indented block of code, otherwise they skip the next indented block of code.
; So what does it do right now?
: If &lt;code&gt;number &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; is true then the next two lines will be run.
; So is &lt;code&gt;number &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;?
: The last value put into &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; so yes.
; So what is the next line?
: Since the &lt;code&gt; while&lt;/code&gt; was true the next line is: &lt;code&gt;print &quot;.&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Prints one dot and since the statement ends with a ',' the next print statement will not be on a different screen line.
; What is the next line?
: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt; since that is following line and there are no indent changes.
; What does it do?
: It calculates &lt;code&gt;number - 1&lt;/code&gt;, which is the current value of &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; (or 5) subtracts 1 from it, and makes that the new value of number.  So basically it changes &lt;code&gt; number&lt;/code&gt;'s value from 5 to 4.
; What is the next line?
: Well, the indent level decreases so we have to look at what type of control structure it is.  It is a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, so we have to go back to the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; clause which is &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It looks at the value of number, which is 4, and compares it to 1 and since &lt;code&gt;4 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; the while loop continues.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop was true, the next line is: &lt;code&gt;print &quot;.&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It prints a second dot on the line.
; What is the next line?
: No indent change so it is: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt;
; And what does it do?
: It takes the current value of number (4), subtracts 1 from it, which gives it 3 and then finally makes 3 the new value of number.
; What is the next line?
: Since there is an indent change caused by the end of the while loop, the next line is: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It compares the current value of number (3) to 1. &lt;code&gt;3 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; so the while loop continues.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop condition was true the next line is: &lt;code&gt;print &quot;.&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;
; And it does what?
: A third dot is printed on the line.
; What is the next line?
: It is: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It takes the current value of number (3) subtracts from it 1 and makes the 2 the new value of number.
; What is the next line?
: Back up to the start of the while loop: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It compares the current value of number (2) to 1.  Since &lt;code&gt;2 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; the while loop continues.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop is continuing: &lt;code&gt;print &quot;.&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It discovers the meaning of life, the universe and everything.  I'm joking. (I had to make sure you were awake.)  The line prints a fourth dot on the screen.
; What is the next line?
: It's: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: Takes the current value of number (2) subtracts 1 and makes 1 the new value of number.
; What is the next line?
: Back up to the while loop: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does the line do?
: It compares the current value of number (1) to 1. Since &lt;code&gt;1 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; is false (one is not greater than one), the while loop exits.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop condition was false the next line is the line after the while loop exits, or: &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Makes the screen go to the next line.
; Why doesn't the program print 5 dots?
: The loop exits 1 dot too soon.
; How can we fix that?
: Make the loop exit 1 dot later.
; And how do we do that?
: There are several ways.  One way would be to change the while loop to: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 0:&lt;/code&gt;  Another way would be to change the conditional to: &lt;code&gt;number &gt;= 1&lt;/code&gt;  There are a couple others.

=== How do I fix the program? ===

You need to figure out what the program is doing.  You need to figure out what the program should do.  Figure out what the difference between the two is.  Debugging is a skill that has to be practiced to be learned. If you can't figure it out after an hour, take a break, talk to someone about the problem or contemplate the lint in your navel.  Come back in a while and you will probably have new ideas about the problem.  Good luck.

=Haber=

&quot;Haber&quot; is an [[../Irregular Verbs|irregular verb]] that means ''' &quot;to have&quot;''' in the sense of having done something, or '''&quot;there is&quot;''' or '''&quot;there are&quot;'''. It is used mostly as an auxilliary verb to form the perfect compound tenses (has/had done, etc.)

:[[../Infinitive/]]: '''haber'''
:[[../Present Participle/]]: ''' habiendo''' 
:[[../Past Participle/]]: n/a

==Indicative==
===[[../Present/]]===
&lt;small&gt;(aka Present Perfect)&lt;/small&gt;

('''hecho''' is the :[[../Past Participle|Past participle]]: of hacer, meaning '''&quot;to make&quot;''' or '''&quot;to do&quot;.''' Here, it means &quot;done&quot;.) 
:Yo '''he''' hecho ''I have done''&lt;br&gt;
:tú '''has''' hecho ''You (informal) have done''&lt;br&gt;
:él/ella/usted '''ha''' hecho  ''He/she has, you (respectful) have done''&lt;br&gt;
:nosotros '''hemos''' hecho  ''We have done''&lt;br&gt;
:(vosotros '''habéis''' hecho) ''You (plural, informal) have done''&lt;br&gt;
:ellos/ustedes '''han''' hecho ''They / you (plural, formal) have done'' &lt;br&gt;
:'''hay''' ''There is / there are'' (special form)

&lt;small&gt;(Don't know what '''Yo, tú, él,''' and so on mean ? They are '''[[../Pronouns|pronouns]].''')&lt;/small&gt;

    <title>Quantum Mechanics/Meaning of Quantum Wave Function</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Quantum Mechanics/Page}}

In the classical picture, we usually work with the position and momentum of a particle or particles. From these, we can generate all the physical information about the system. 

However, it is easy to see how such an approach will run into serious problems for quantum mechanics. If we consider, for the moment, the Uncertainty Principle to be our definition of Quantum Mechanics then, there is the position of a particle having no simple meaning, as there is an inherent uncertainty in it. 
 
Talking about a particular position ''and'' momentum is wrong, in quantum mechanics.

To get round this problem, instead of having a particular value of position (or momentum) of a particle, we instead assign a probability to each point in space, of finding the particle there. We could similarly define the probability of it having a particular momentum but, while equally valid, that approach is not initially useful.

Thus, in quantum mechanics, we have a wavefunction, which, as we will see, contains all the information about the system. In general, this wavefunction will be complex.  This wavefunction's modulus squared is the probability distribution of the system. 

Position (or momentum for that matter) now, is not a variable. Rather, it is an operator. Before we see how it works, let us deviate a little, in order to understand operators better.

Take a two state system for example. By two states, we mean that a particular property (say the color) can have only two values (say Red and Blue). Now, a wavefunction of the system will be a mixture of these states. Let us say R is the wavefunction, when the particle is &quot;definitely&quot; Red, and B when it is definitely Blue. So, the general wavefunction, ''W'' of the system is a linear combination of the two. 

:&lt;math&gt;W = xR + yB &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|x|^2&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the particle is Red. Since this is a two state system, &lt;math&gt;|y|^2 = 1 - |x|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Be aware that, in general, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may be complex numbers, which is why we must use &lt;math&gt;|x|^2&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; in order to get a real probability.

Now, the big news. The fundamental assumption of quantum mechanics is that any measurement will ''send the system into one of that operator's eigenstates''. 
Eigenstates are just the states of a system unchanged by an operator.

In this example, when we measure the color of the system, we multiply it by a color operator, which turns a wavefunction into a color, Red or Blue. 

So, Quantum Mechanics says that if you make a measurement of the colour, you will never find the system to be a mixture of Red and Blue! It is only that you will sometimes find it Red, sometimes Blue, with the corresponding probabilities. 

If you were to measure some other property of the system, you might find it in a state which you could deduce had mixed color, but you wouldn't be able to observe this mixture. The uncertainty principle stems from this phenomenon.

Measurement is nothing but acting the corresponding operator on our wavefunction. Remember, once we have acted an operator on our wavefunction, the system has already &quot;collapsed&quot; into one of it's eigen-states (allowed states). Any subsequent measurements will yield the same result, because the system isn't anymore a mixture of all those eigen-states.  

To see the probability effect as stated above, you'll have to prepare the system from scratch. In other words, before making a measurement, prepare infinite mental copies of the system (an ensemble) and then perform the same measurement on each of them.

Coming back to position; this is a special operator, in that its spectrum (the range of eigen-values) is continuous. Our example had a discrete (2 level) system. The details of working out stuff become more complicated for such an operator, but the basic premise remains exactly the same. 
 
What happens now? We know that Quantum Mechanics should reduce to Classical Mechanics at a large enough scale. For a single particle, this wavefunction is peaked around the &quot;Classical Position&quot; and the standard deviation is ~ h. So, on normal scales, we won't see this &quot;fuzziness&quot; of the particle. 

To see how a result matches with Classical Mechanics, we can use the concept of an &quot;Expectation Value&quot;. An expectation value of an operator is just the average value of its eigenvalues, weighted with the corresponding probabilities. It can be shown that the expectation values of position and momentum are related like the classical position and momentum.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Creating Functions ===
To start off this chapter I am going to give you an example of what you could do but shouldn't (so don't type it in):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
a = 23
b = -23

if a &lt; 0:
    a = -a
if b &lt; 0:
    b = -b                         #Or use the command: elif (if+else)
if b &gt; 0:
  elif:
    print(&quot;ok&quot;)
    print(&quot;Nope&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 The absolute values of 23 and 23 are equal

The program seems a little repetitive. Programmers hate to repeat things -- that's what computers are for, after all! (Note also that finding the absolute value changed the value of the variable, which is why it is printing out 23, and not -23 in the output.) Fortunately Python allows you to create functions to remove duplication.  Here is the rewritten example:    
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def absolute_value(n):
    if n &lt; 0:
        n = -n
    return n

a = 23
b = -23

if absolute_value(a) == absolute_value(b):
    print &quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;are equal&quot;
else:
    print &quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;are different&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 The absolute values of 23 and -23 are equal

The key feature of this program is the &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; statement.  &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt;
(short for define) starts a function definition.  &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; is
followed by the name of the function &lt;code&gt;absolute_value&lt;/code&gt;.  Next comes a '(' followed by the parameter &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is passed from the
program into the function when the function is called).  The statements
after the ':' are executed when the function is used.  The
statements continue until either the indented statements end or a
&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is encountered.  The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement returns a value
back to the place where the function was called.

Notice how the values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are not changed.
Functions can be used to repeat tasks that don't return
values.  Here are some examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def hello():
    print &quot;Hello&quot;

def area(w, h):
    return w * h

def print_welcome(name):
    print &quot;Welcome&quot;, name

hello()
hello()

print_welcome(&quot;Fred&quot;)
w = 4
h = 5
print &quot;width =&quot;, w, &quot;height =&quot;, h, &quot;area =&quot;, area(w, h)
&lt;/source&gt;

with output being:

 Hello
 Hello
 Welcome Fred
 width = 4 height = 5 area = 20

That example shows some more stuff that you can do with
functions.  Notice that you can use no arguments or two or more.
Notice also when a function doesn't need to send back a value, a
return is optional.
&lt;!-- Functions can be used to eliminate repeat code. --&gt;

=== Variables in functions ===
When eliminating repeated code, you often have variables in the repeated code.  
In Python, these are dealt with in a special way.  So far all variables we have 
seen are global variables.  Functions have a special type of variable called 
local variables.  These variables only exist while the function is running.  
When a local variable has the same name as another variable (such as a global 
variable), the local variable hides the other.  Sound confusing?  Well, these 
next examples (which are a bit contrived) should help clear things up.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 4
 
def print_func():
    a = 17
    print &quot;in  print_func a = &quot;, a

print_func()
print &quot;a = &quot;, a,&quot;which is global variable assigned prior to the function print_func&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

When run, we will receive an output of:

 in print_func a = 17
 a = 4 which is global variable assigned prior to the function print_func

Variable assignments inside a function do not override global variables, they 
exist only inside the function.  Even though &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was assigned a new value inside 
the function, this newly assigned value was only relevant to &lt;code&gt;print_func&lt;/code&gt;, when 
the function finishes running, and the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;'s values is printed again, we see the 
originally assigned values.

===Complex example===

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a_var = 10
b_var = 15
c_var = 25

def a_func(a_var):
    print &quot;in a_func a_var = &quot;, a_var
    b_var = 100 + a_var
    d_var = 2 * a_var
    print &quot;in a_func b_var = &quot;, b_var
    print &quot;in a_func d_var = &quot;, d_var
    print &quot;in a_func c_var = &quot;, c_var
    return b_var + 10

c_var = a_func(b_var)

print &quot;a_var = &quot;, a_var
print &quot;b_var = &quot;, b_var
print &quot;c_var = &quot;, c_var
print &quot;d_var = &quot;, d_var
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:
&lt;pre&gt;
 in a_func a_var =  15
 in a_func b_var =  115
 in a_func d_var =  30
 in a_func c_var =  25
 a_var =  10
 b_var =  15
 c_var =  125
 d_var = 
 
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;C:\Python24\def2&quot;, line 19, in -toplevel-
     print &quot;d_var = &quot;, d_var
 
 NameError: name 'd_var' is not defined
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example the variables &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;d_var&lt;/code&gt;
are all local variables when they are inside the function &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt;.  
After the statement &lt;code&gt;return b_var + 10&lt;/code&gt; is run, they all cease to 
exist. The variable &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; is automatically a local variable since it 
is a parameter name.  The variables &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;d_var&lt;/code&gt; are local
variables since they appear on the left of an equals sign in the function in
the statements &lt;code&gt;b_var = 100 + a_var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;d_var = 2 * a_var&lt;/code&gt; .

Inside of the function &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; has no value assigned to it.  When the 
function is called with &lt;code&gt;c_var = a_func(b_var)&lt;/code&gt;, 15 is assigned to 
&lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; since at that point in time &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt; is 15, making the 
call to the function &lt;code&gt;a_func(15)&lt;/code&gt;.  This ends up setting
&lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; to 15 when it is inside of &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt;.

As you can see, once the function finishes running, the local variables
&lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt; that had hidden the global variables of the same
name are gone.  Then the statement &lt;code&gt;print &quot;a_var = &quot;, a_var&lt;/code&gt; prints the 
value &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; rather than the value &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt; since the local variable 
that hid the global variable is gone.  

Another thing to notice is the &lt;code&gt;NameError&lt;/code&gt; that happens at the end.  
This appears since the variable &lt;code&gt;d_var&lt;/code&gt; no longer exists since 
&lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt; finished.  All the local variables are deleted when the function
exits.  If you want to get something from a function, then you will have 
to use &lt;code&gt;return something&lt;/code&gt;.

One last thing to notice is that the value of &lt;code&gt;c_var&lt;/code&gt; remains unchanged 
inside &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt; since it is not a parameter and it never appears on the 
left of an equals sign inside of the function &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt;.  When a 
global variable is accessed inside a function it is the global variable 
from the outside.

Functions allow local variables that exist only inside the function and 
can hide other variables that are outside the function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Variables with more than one value ===
You have already seen ordinary variables that store a single value.  However other variable types can hold more than one value.  The simplest type is called a list.  Here is an example of a list being used:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
which_one = input(&quot;What month (1-12)? &quot;)
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',
          'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:
    print &quot;The month is&quot;, months[which_one - 1]
&lt;/source&gt;

and an output example:

 What month (1-12)? '''3'''
 The month is March

In this example the &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; is a list.  &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; is defined with the lines &lt;code&gt; months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']&lt;/code&gt; (note that a &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; could also be used to split a long line, but that is not necessary in this case because Python is intelligent enough to recognize that everything within brackets belongs together).  The &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; start and end the list with commas (&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;) separating the list items.  The list is used in &lt;code&gt;months[which_one - 1]&lt;/code&gt;.  A list consists of items that are numbered starting at 0.  In other words if you wanted January you would use &lt;code&gt;months[0]&lt;/code&gt;.  Give a list a number and it will return the value that is stored at that location.

The statement &lt;code&gt; if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:&lt;/code&gt; will only be true if &lt;code&gt; which_one&lt;/code&gt; is between one and twelve inclusive (in other words it is what you would expect if you have seen that in algebra).

Lists can be thought of as a series of boxes. Each box has a different value. For example, the boxes created by  &lt;code&gt;demolist = ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]&lt;/code&gt; would look like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!box number 
!0 
!1  
!2 
!3 
!4 
!5 
|-
|demolist 
|&quot;life&quot; 
|42 
|&quot;the universe&quot; 
|6 
|&quot;and&quot;
|9
|}

Each box is referenced by its number so the statement &lt;code&gt;demolist[0]&lt;/code&gt; would get &lt;code&gt;'life'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;demolist[1]&lt;/code&gt; would get &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; and so on up to &lt;code&gt;demolist[5]&lt;/code&gt; getting &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.

=== More features of lists ===
The next example is just to show a lot of other stuff lists can do (for once I don't expect you to type it in, but you should probably play around with lists until you are comfortable with them.).  Here goes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
demolist = [&quot;life&quot;, 42, &quot;the universe&quot;, 6, &quot;and&quot;, 9]
print &quot;demolist = &quot;,demolist
demolist.append(&quot;everything&quot;)
print &quot;after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:&quot;
print demolist
print &quot;len(demolist) =&quot;, len(demolist)
print &quot;demolist.index(42) =&quot;, demolist.index(42)
print &quot;demolist[1] =&quot;, demolist[1]

# Next we will loop through the list
c = 0
while c &lt; len(demolist):
    print &quot;demolist[&quot;, c, &quot;] =&quot;, demolist[c]
    c = c + 1

del demolist[2]
print &quot;After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:&quot;
print demolist
if &quot;life&quot; in demolist:
    print &quot;'life' was found in demolist&quot;
else:
    print &quot;'life' was not found in demolist&quot;

if &quot;amoeba&quot; in demolist:
    print &quot;'amoeba' was found in demolist&quot;

if &quot;amoeba&quot; not in demolist:
    print &quot;'amoeba' was not found in demolist&quot;

demolist.sort()
print &quot;The sorted demolist is&quot;, demolist
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 demolist =  ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]
 after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:
 ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']
 len(demolist) = 7
 demolist.index(42) = 1
 demolist[1] = 42
 demolist[ 0 ] = life
 demolist[ 1 ] = 42
 demolist[ 2 ] = the universe
 demolist[ 3 ] = 6
 demolist[ 4 ] = and
 demolist[ 5 ] = 9
 demolist[ 6 ] = everything
 After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:
 ['life', 42, 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']
 'life' was found in demolist
 'amoeba' was not found in demolist
 The sorted demolist is [6, 9, 42, 'and', 'everything', 'life']

This example uses a whole bunch of new functions.  Notice that you can
just &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; a whole list.  Next the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; function is used
to add a new item to the end of the list.  &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; returns how many
items are in a list.  The valid indexes (as in numbers that can be
used inside of the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;) of a list range from 0 to &lt;code&gt;len - 1&lt;/code&gt;. The
&lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; function tells where the first location of an item is
located in a list.  Notice how &lt;code&gt;demolist.index(42)&lt;/code&gt; returns 1, and
when &lt;code&gt;demolist[1]&lt;/code&gt; is run it returns 42.  The line &lt;code&gt;# Next we will loop through the list&lt;/code&gt; is a just a reminder to the programmer (also called a ''comment''). Python will ignore any lines that start with a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;.  Next the lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
c = 0
while c &lt; len(demolist):
    print 'demolist[', c, '] =', demolist[c]
    c = c + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

create a variable &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, which starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches the last index of the list.  Meanwhile the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement prints out each element of the list. The &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt; command can be used to remove a given element in a list.  The next few lines use the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; operator to test if an element is in or is not in a list. The &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; function sorts the list. This is useful if you need a
list in order from smallest number to largest or alphabetical.  Note
that this rearranges the list. In summary, for a list, the following operations occur:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!example 
!explanation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist[2]&lt;/code&gt; 
|accesses the element at index 2
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist[2] = 3&lt;/code&gt; 
|sets the element at index 2 to be 3
|-
|&lt;code&gt;del demolist[2]&lt;/code&gt; 
|removes the element at index 2
|-
|&lt;code&gt;len(demolist)&lt;/code&gt; 
|returns the length of &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot; in demolist&lt;/code&gt; 
|is ''True'' if &lt;tt&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is an element in &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot; not in demolist&lt;/code&gt; 
|is ''True'' if &lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is not an element in &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.sort()&lt;/code&gt; 
|sorts &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.index(&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; 
|returns the index of the first place that &lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; occurs
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.append(&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; 
|adds an element &lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the list
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.remove(&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
|removes the first occurrence of value from &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt; (same as &lt;code&gt;del demolist[demolist.index(&quot;value&quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;)
|}

This next example uses these features in a more useful way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
menu_item = 0
namelist = []
while menu_item != 9:
    print &quot;--------------------&quot;
    print &quot;1. Print the list&quot;
    print &quot;2. Add a name to the list&quot;
    print &quot;3. Remove a name from the list&quot;
    print &quot;4. Change an item in the list&quot;
    print &quot;9. Quit&quot;
    menu_item = input(&quot;Pick an item from the menu: &quot;)
    if menu_item == 1:
        current = 0
        if len(namelist) &gt; 0:
            while current &lt; len(namelist):
                print current, &quot;.&quot;, namelist[current]
                current = current + 1
        else:
            print &quot;List is empty&quot;
    elif menu_item == 2:
        name = raw_input(&quot;Type in a name to add: &quot;)
        namelist.append(name)
    elif menu_item == 3:
        del_name = raw_input(&quot;What name would you like to remove: &quot;)
        if del_name in namelist:
            # namelist.remove(del_name) would work just as fine
            item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
            del namelist[item_number]
            # The code above only removes the first occurrence of
            # the name.  The code below from Gerald removes all.
            # while del_name in namelist:
            #       item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
            #       del namelist[item_number]
        else:
            print del_name, &quot;was not found&quot;
    elif menu_item == 4:
        old_name = raw_input(&quot;What name would you like to change: &quot;)
        if old_name in namelist:
            item_number = namelist.index(old_name)
            new_name = raw_input(&quot;What is the new name: &quot;)
            namelist[item_number] = new_name
        else:
            print old_name, &quot;was not found&quot;

print &quot;Goodbye&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is part of the output:

 --------------------
 1. Print the list
 2. Add a name to the list
 3. Remove a name from the list
 4. Change an item in the list
 9. Quit
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''2'''
 Type in a name to add: '''Jack'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''2'''
 Type in a name to add: '''Jill'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''1'''
 0 . Jack
 1 . Jill
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''3'''
 What name would you like to remove: '''Jack'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''4'''
 What name would you like to change: '''Jill'''
 What is the new name: '''Jill Peters'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''1'''
 0 . Jill Peters
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''9'''
 Goodbye

That was a long program.  Let's take a look at the source code. The line &lt;code&gt;namelist = []&lt;/code&gt; makes the variable &lt;code&gt;namelist&lt;/code&gt; a list with no items (or elements).  The next important line is &lt;code&gt;while menu_item != 9:&lt;/code&gt;.  This line starts a loop that allows the menu system for this program.  The next few lines display a menu and decide which part of the program to run.

The section
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
current = 0
if len(namelist) &gt; 0:
    while current &lt; len(namelist):
        print current, &quot;.&quot;, namelist[current]
        current = current + 1
else:
    print &quot;List is empty&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
goes through the list and prints each name.  &lt;code&gt;len(namelist)&lt;/code&gt; tells how many items are in the list.  If &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then the list is empty.

Then, a few lines later, the statement &lt;code&gt;namelist.append(name)&lt;/code&gt; appears.  It uses the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; function to add an item to the end of the list.  Jump down another two lines, and notice this section of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
del namelist[item_number]
&lt;/source&gt;
Here the &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; function is used to find the index value that will be used later to remove the item.  &lt;code&gt;del namelist[item_number]&lt;/code&gt; is used to remove a element of the list.   

The next section
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
old_name = raw_input(&quot;What name would you like to change: &quot;)
if old_name in namelist:
    item_number = namelist.index(old_name)
    new_name = raw_input(&quot;What is the new name: &quot;)
    namelist[item_number] = new_name
else:
   print old_name, &quot;was not found&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
uses &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; to find the &lt;code&gt;item_number&lt;/code&gt; and then puts &lt;code&gt;new_name&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code&gt;old_name&lt;/code&gt; was.

Congratulations, with lists under your belt, you now know enough of the language
that you could do any computations that a computer can do (this is technically known as Turing-Completeness).  Of course, there are still many features that
are used to make your life easier.

=== Examples ===
'''test.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
## This program runs a test of knowledge

# First get the test questions
# Later this will be modified to use file io.
def get_questions():
    # notice how the data is stored as a list of lists
    return [[&quot;What color is the daytime sky on a clear day? &quot;, &quot;blue&quot;],
            [&quot;What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? &quot;, &quot;42&quot;],
            [&quot;What is a three letter word for mouse trap? &quot;, &quot;cat&quot;]]

# This will test a single question
# it takes a single question in
# it returns True if the user typed the correct answer, otherwise False

def check_question(question_and_answer):
    # extract the question and the answer from the list
    question = question_and_answer[0]
    answer = question_and_answer[1]
    # give the question to the user
    given_answer = raw_input(question)
    # compare the user's answer to the testers answer
    if answer == given_answer:
        print &quot;Correct&quot;
        return True
    else:
        print &quot;Incorrect, correct was:&quot;, answer
        return False

# This will run through all the questions
def run_test(questions):
    if len(questions) == 0:
        print &quot;No questions were given.&quot;
        # the return exits the function
        return
    index = 0
    right = 0
    while index &lt; len(questions):
        # Check the question
        if check_question(questions[index]):
            right = right + 1
            index = index + 1
        # go to the next question
        else:
            index = index + 1
    # notice the order of the computation, first multiply, then divide
    print &quot;You got&quot;, right * 100 / len(questions),\
           &quot;% right out of&quot;, len(questions)

# now let's run the questions

run_test(get_questions())
&lt;/source&gt;

The values &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; point to 1 and 0, respectively. They are often used in sanity checks, loop conditions etc. You will learn more about this a little bit later (chapter [[../Boolean Expressions/]]).

Sample Output:

 What color is the daytime sky on a clear day?'''green'''
 Incorrect, correct was: blue
 What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?'''42'''
 Correct
 What is a three letter word for mouse trap?'''cat'''
 Correct
 You got 66 % right out of 3

=== Exercises ===
Expand the test.py program so it has a menu giving the option of taking
the test, viewing the list of questions and answers, and an option to
quit.  Also, add a new question to ask, &quot;What noise does a truly
advanced machine make?&quot; with the answer of &quot;ping&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">And here is the new typing exercise for this chapter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
onetoten = range(1, 11)
for count in onetoten:
    print count
&lt;/source&gt;

and the ever-present output:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10

The output looks awfully familiar but the program code looks different.  The first line uses the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; function.  The &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; function uses two arguments like this &lt;code&gt;range(start, finish)&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; is the first number that is produced.  &lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; is one larger than the last number.  Note that this program could have been done in a shorter way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for count in range(1, 11):
    print count
&lt;/source&gt;

Here are some examples to show what happens with the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; command:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''range(1, 10)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''range(-32, -20)'''
 [-32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''range(5,21)'''
 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''range(5)'''
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''range(21, 5)'''
 []

The next line &lt;code&gt;for count in onetoten:&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; control structure.  A &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; control structure looks like &lt;code&gt;for variable in list:&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; is gone through starting with the first element of the list and going to the last.  As &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; goes through each element in a list it puts each into &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt;.  That allows &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt; to be used in each successive time the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is run through.  Here is another example (you don't have to type this) to demonstrate:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
demolist = ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']
for item in demolist:
    print &quot;The Current item is:&quot;,
    print item
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 The Current item is: life
 The Current item is: 42
 The Current item is: the universe
 The Current item is: 6
 The Current item is: and
 The Current item is: 9
 The Current item is: everything

Notice how the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop goes through and sets item to each element in the list. Notice how if you don't want &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; to go to the next line add a comma at the end of the statement (i.e. if you want to print something else on that line).  So, what is &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; good for?  The first use is to go through all the elements of a list and do something with each of them.  Here's a quick way to add up all the elements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [2, 4, 6, 8]
sum = 0
for num in list:
    sum = sum + num

print &quot;The sum is:&quot;, sum
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output simply being:

 The sum is: 20

Or you could write a program to find out if there are any duplicates in a list like this program does:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
list.sort()
prev = list[0]
del list[0]
for item in list:
    if prev == item:
        print &quot;Duplicate of&quot;, prev, &quot;found&quot;
    prev = item
&lt;/source&gt;

and for good measure:

 Duplicate of 7 Found

Okay, so how does it work?  Here is a special debugging version to help you understand (you don't need to type this in):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
print &quot;l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]&quot;, &quot;\t\tl:&quot;, l
l.sort()
print &quot;l.sort()&quot;, &quot;\t\tl:&quot;, l
prev = l[0]
print &quot;prev = l[0]&quot;, &quot;\t\tprev:&quot;, prev
del l[0]
print &quot;del l[0]&quot;, &quot;\t\tl:&quot;, l
for item in l:
    if prev == item:
        print &quot;Duplicate of&quot;, prev, &quot;found&quot;
    print &quot;if prev == item:&quot;, &quot;\t\tprev:&quot;, prev, &quot;\titem:&quot;, item
    prev = item
    print &quot;prev = item&quot;, &quot;\t\tprev:&quot;, prev, &quot;\titem:&quot;, item
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]        l: [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
 l.sort()                l: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 prev = l[0]             prev: 0
 del l[0]                l: [1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 if prev == item:        prev: 0         item: 1
 prev = item             prev: 1         item: 1
 if prev == item:        prev: 1         item: 4
 prev = item             prev: 4         item: 4
 if prev == item:        prev: 4         item: 5
 prev = item             prev: 5         item: 5
 if prev == item:        prev: 5         item: 7
 prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
 Duplicate of 7 found
 if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 7
 prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
 if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 8
 prev = item             prev: 8         item: 8
 if prev == item:        prev: 8         item: 9
 prev = item             prev: 9         item: 9
 if prev == item:        prev: 9         item: 10
 prev = item             prev: 10        item: 10

The reason I put so many &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements in the code was so that you can see what is happening in each line.  (By the way, if you can't figure out why a program is not working, try putting in lots of print statements so you can see what is happening.)  First the program starts with a boring old list.  Next the program sorts the list.  This is so that any duplicates get put next to each other.  The program then initializes a &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt;(ious) variable.  Next the first element of the list is deleted so that the first item is not incorrectly thought to be a duplicate.  Next a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is gone into.  Each item of the list is checked to see if it is the same as the previous.  If it is a duplicate was found.  The value of &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; is then changed so that the next time the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is run through &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; is the previous item to the current.  Sure enough, the 7 is found to be a duplicate.  (Notice how &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; is used to print a tab.)  

The other way to use &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops is to do something a certain number of times.  Here is some code to print out the first 9 numbers of the Fibonacci series:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
b = 1
for c in range(1, 10):
    print a,
    n = a + b
    a = b
    b = n
&lt;/source&gt;

with the surprising output:

 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Everything that can be done with &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops can also be done with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops but &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops give an easy way to go through all the elements in a list or to do something a certain number of times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a little example of boolean expressions (you don't have to type it in):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 6
b = 7
c = 42
print 1, a == 6
print 2, a == 7
print 3, a == 6 and b == 7
print 4, a == 7 and b == 7
print 5, not a == 7 and b == 7
print 6, a == 7 or b == 7
print 7, a == 7 or b == 6
print 8, not (a == 7 and b == 6)
print 9, not a == 7 and b == 6
&lt;/source&gt;

With the output being:

 1 True
 2 False
 3 True
 4 False
 5 True
 6 True
 7 False
 8 True
 9 False

What is going on?  The program consists of a bunch of funny looking &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements.  Each &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement prints a number and an expression.  The number is to help keep track of which statement I am dealing with.  Notice how each expression ends up being either &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;.  In Python, false can also be written as 0 and true as 1.  
&lt;!-- For example: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; if 1: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;true&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ... else: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;false&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...  --&gt;
&lt;!-- true --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; if 0: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;true&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ... else: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;false&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...  --&gt;
&lt;!-- false --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;

The lines:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 1, a == 6
print 2, a == 7
&lt;/source&gt;

print out a &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; respectively just as expected since the first is true and the second is false.  The third print, &lt;code&gt;print 3, a == 6 and b == 7&lt;/code&gt;, is a little different.  The operator &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; means if both the statement before and the statement after are true then the whole expression is true otherwise the whole expression is false.  The next line, &lt;code&gt;print 4, a == 7 and b == 7&lt;/code&gt;, shows how if part of an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; expression is false, the whole thing is false.  The behavior of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; can be summarized as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result 
|-  
|true &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; true 
|true 
|-
|true &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; false 
|false 
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; true 
|false
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; false 
|false
|}

Notice that if the first expression is false Python does not check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is false.  

The next line, &lt;code&gt;print 5, not a == 7 and b == 7&lt;/code&gt;, uses the &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; operator.  &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; just gives the opposite of the expression. (The expression could be rewritten as &lt;code&gt; print 5, a != 7 and b == 7&lt;/code&gt;).  Here is the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result
|-
|&lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; true 
|false 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; false 
|true
|}

The two following lines, &lt;code&gt;print 6, a == 7 or b == 7&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print 7, a == 7 or b == 6&lt;/code&gt;, use the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator.  The &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator returns true if the first expression is true, or if the second expression is true or both are true.  If neither are true it returns false.  Here's the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result
|-  
|true &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; true 
| true
|-
|true &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; false 
|true
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; true 
| true  
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; false 
| false 
|}

Notice that if the first expression is true Python doesn't check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is true.  This works since &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; is true if at least one half of the expression is true.  The first part is true so the second part could be either false or true, but the whole expression is still true.

The next two lines, &lt;code&gt;print 8, not (a == 7 and b == 6)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print 9, not a == 7 and b == 6&lt;/code&gt;, show that parentheses can be used to group expressions and force one part to be evaluated first.  Notice that the parentheses changed the expression from false to true. This occurred since the parentheses forced the &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; to apply to the whole expression instead of just the &lt;code&gt;a == 7&lt;/code&gt; portion.

Here is an example of using a boolean expression:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [&quot;Life&quot;, &quot;The Universe&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;]

# make a copy of the list. See the More on Lists chapter to explain what [:] means.
copy = list[:]
# sort the copy
copy.sort()
prev = copy[0]
del copy[0]

count = 0

# go through the list searching for a match
while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev:
    prev = copy[count]
    count = count + 1

# If a match was not found then count can't be &lt; len
# since the while loop continues while count is &lt; len
# and no match is found

if count &lt; len(copy):
    print &quot;First Match:&quot;, prev
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the output:

 First Match: Jill

This program works by continuing to check for match &lt;code&gt;while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] is not equal to prev&lt;/code&gt;.  When either &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the last index of &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; or a match has been found the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; is no longer true so the loop exits.  The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; simply checks to make sure that the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; exited because a match was found.  

The other &quot;trick&quot; of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; is used in this example.  If you look at the table for &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; notice that the third entry is &quot;false and won't check&quot;.   If &lt;code&gt;count &gt;= len(copy)&lt;/code&gt; (in other words &lt;code&gt;count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/code&gt; is false) then &lt;code&gt;copy[count]&lt;/code&gt; is never looked at.  This is because Python knows that if the first is false then they can't both be true.  This is known as a short circuit and is useful if the second half of the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; will cause an error if something is wrong.  I used the first expression (&lt;code&gt;count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/code&gt;) to check and see if &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; was a valid index for &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;.  (If you don't believe me remove the matches &quot;Jill&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;, check that it still works and then reverse the order of &lt;code&gt;count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;copy[count] != prev and count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/code&gt;.)

Boolean expressions can be used when you need to check two or more different things at once.

=== A note on Boolean Operators ===
A common mistake for people new to programming is a misunderstanding of the way that boolean operators works, which stems from the way the python interpreter reads these expressions.  For example, after initially learning about &quot;and &quot; and &quot;or&quot; statements, one might assume that the expression &lt;code&gt;x == ('a' or 'b')&lt;/code&gt; would check to see if the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; was equivalent to one of the strings &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt;.  This is not so.  To see what I'm talking about, start an interactive session with the interpreter and enter the following expressions:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' == ('a' or 'b')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'b' == ('a' or 'b')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' == ('a' and 'b')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'b' == ('a' and 'b')

And this will be the unintuitive result:

 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' or 'b')'''
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' or 'b')'''
 False
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' and 'b')'''
 False 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' and 'b')'''
 True

At this point, the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operators seem to be broken.  It doesn't make sense that, for the first two expressions, &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt; is not.  Furthermore, it doesn't make any sense that 'b' is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt;.  After examining what the interpreter does with boolean operators, these results do in fact exactly what you are asking of them, it's just not the same as what you think you are asking.

When the Python interpreter looks at an &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; expression, it takes the first statement and checks to see if it is true. If the first statement is true, then Python returns that object's value without checking the second statement.  This is because for an &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; expression, the whole thing is true if one of the values is true; the program does not need to bother with the second statement. On the other hand, if the first value is evaluated as false Python checks the second half and returns that value. That second half determines the truth value of the whole expression since the first half was false.  This &quot;laziness&quot; on the part of the interpreter is called &quot;short circuiting&quot; and is a common way of evaluating boolean expressions in many programming languages.

Similarly, for an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; expression, Python uses a short circuit technique to speed truth value evaluation.  If the first statement is false then the whole thing must be false, so it returns that value.  Otherwise if the first value is true it checks the second and returns that value.

One thing to note at this point is that the boolean expression returns a value indicating &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, but that Python considers a number of different things to have a truth value assigned to them.  To check the truth value of any given object &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, you can use the function &lt;code&gt;bool(x)&lt;/code&gt; to see its truth value.  Below is a table with examples of the truth values of various objects:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!True !!False
|-
|True ||False
|-
|1 ||0
|-
|Numbers other than zero ||The string 'None'
|-
|Nonempty strings ||Empty strings
|-
|Nonempty lists ||Empty lists 
|-
|Nonempty dictionaries ||Empty dictionaries
|}

Now it is possible to understand the perplexing results we were getting when we tested those boolean expressions before.  Let's take a look at what the interpreter &quot;sees&quot; as it goes through that code:

'''First case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' or 'b')'''  # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' or 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True
                            # Return that first value: 'a'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'a' '''          # the string 'a' is equivalent to the string 'a', so expression is True
 True

'''Second case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' or 'b')'''  # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' or 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True
                            # Return that first value: 'a'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'a' '''          # the string 'b' is not equivalent to the string 'a', so expression is False
 False 

'''Third case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' and 'b')''' # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' and 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True, examine second value
                            # 'b' is a nonempty string, so second value is True
                            # Return that second value as result of whole expression: 'b'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'b' '''          # the string 'a' is not equivalent to the string 'b', so expression is False
 False

'''Fourth case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' and 'b')''' # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' and 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True, examine second value
                            # 'b' is a nonempty string, so second value is True
                            # Return that second value as result of whole expression: 'b'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'b' '''          # the string 'b' is equivalent to the string 'b', so expression is True
 True 

So Python was really doing its job when it gave those apparently bogus results.  As mentioned previously, the important thing is to recognize what value your boolean expression will return when it is evaluated, because it isn't always obvious.  

Going back to those initial expressions, this is how you would write them out so they behaved in a way that you want:

 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'a' or 'a' == 'b' '''
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'a' or 'b' == 'b' '''
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'a' and 'a' == 'b' '''
 False
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'b' == 'a' and 'b' == 'b'
 False

When these comparisons are evaluated they return truth values in terms of True or False, not strings, so we get the proper results.

=== Examples ===
'''password1.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
## This programs asks a user for a name and a password.
# It then checks them to make sure the user is allowed in.

name = raw_input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
password = raw_input(&quot;What is the password? &quot;)
if name == &quot;Josh&quot; and password == &quot;Friday&quot;:
    print &quot;Welcome Josh&quot;
elif name == &quot;Fred&quot; and password == &quot;Rock&quot;:
    print &quot;Welcome Fred&quot;
else:
    print &quot;I don't know you.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs

 What is your name? '''Josh'''
 What is the password? '''Friday'''
 Welcome Josh

 What is your name? '''Bill'''
 What is the password? '''Money'''
 I don't know you.

=== Exercises ===
Write a program that has a user guess your name, but they only get 3 chances 
to do so until the program quits.

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

Write a program that has a user guess your name, but they only get 3 chances 
to do so until the program quits.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Try to guess my name!&quot;
count = 3
name = &quot;Tony&quot;
guess = raw_input(&quot;What is my name? &quot;)
while count &gt; 1 and guess != name:
    print &quot;You are wrong!&quot;
    guess = raw_input(&quot;What is my name? &quot;)
    count = count - 1

if guess != name:
    print &quot;You are wrong!&quot; # this message isn't printed in the third chance, so we print it now
    print &quot;You ran out of chances.&quot;
    quit
else:
    print &quot;Yes! My name is&quot;, name + &quot;!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

I have chosen [[en:Eugène Delecroix|Eugène Delecroix]]'s '''''Orphan Girl in a Cemetery''''' to represent ''Ellen Foster''. This piece of artwork is a perfect illustration of the novel as both the girl in the painting and Ellen are orphans who have spent time in a cemetery.  In addition, the girl seems to have just finished crying. After Ellen's mother dies, Ellen must have been in a similar situation. The girl in the painting has an expression of fear (This is similar to the feeling that Ellen experiences she runs away from her father) and seems to be looking at an object, or perhaps a person, who is outside the painting. Perhaps this is representative of her looking into her future wondering what her new life will be like. Ellen was in the same situation. Perhaps Ellen would be looking towards her grandmother (of whom she was very afraid).

The Street 
by Octavio Paz 


A long and silent street. 

I walk in blackness and I stumble and fall 

and rise, and I walk blind, my feet 

stepping on silent stones and dry leaves. 

Someone behind me also stepping on stones, leaves: 

if I slow down, he slows: 

if I run, he runs. I turn: nobody. 


Everything dark and doorless. 

Turning and turning among these corners 

which lead forever to the street 

where I pursue a man who stumbles 

and rises and says when he sees be: nobody&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
	
[[en:Octavio Paz|Octavio Paz]]'s poem '''''The Street''''' is thematically similar to the ideas present in ''Ellen Foster''. In this poem, the narrator describes a long and silent street that he is traversing at night. He adds that he stumbles and falls. In these two lines, the theme of being lost and lonely is very prevalent. This is similar to the feeling that Ellen has after her mother dies. In the next line, the narrator says that he gets back up. The idea that this presents can be equated to the theme of perseverance in Ellen Foster. Soon, the reader becomes aware that the narrator is running away from someone. Ellen spent a great deal of time hiding and running away from her father and his cronies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am confused by the term &quot;Minister of the Crown&quot;.  How many of these ministers are there?  Do they sit in the Houses of Parliament along with MPs and Lords?  I see that the Lord Chancellor is a Minister of the Crown, but who else?

:There are 90-odd ministers, some more senior than others.  They are almost always members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords, and the vast majority are in the House of Commons (so they have to be elected there first).  It is always possible to appoint someone to the House of Lords if necessary.

The section on Speakership in the House of Lords is now wrong; the law was recently ammended, and there is now a speaker of the House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor, whilst still technically holding the title, is usually referred to as 'Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs' by the Government.

== Use of &quot;sovereign&quot; ==

The use of the word sovereign in this is very confused. The monarch is not the sovereign - the Parliament, including the monarch, is. Although sovereign is indeed a common term used for monarchy, this is not a legally accurate use of the word: in addition, when discussing both sovereignty in terms of the person(s) who are sovereign '''and''' in terms of the concept of sovereignty as in the first paragraph, it would be sensible to use an alternative word to describe the former, in order to avoid confusion.</text>

#Ellen's mother dies from a self imposed overdose of medication. Ellen's father refuses to take his wife to the hospital making him partly to blame for the death.
#Ellen is repeatedly sexually and physically abused by her father and his cronies. This forces Ellen to frequently seek refuge in the house of Starletta and her family.
#Ellen's teacher finds signs of physical abuse on Ellen's arm and she reports this. As a result, Ellen is sent to live with the art teacher Julia and her husband Roy, who are both hippies.
#Ellen's grandmother sucessfully battles for and gains custody of Ellen in court and Ellen goes to live with this cruel and bitter woman. 
#While Ellen is staying at her grandmother's house, she learns of her father's death but she is not very sad. Her grandmother is angry at this and tells Ellen never to cry again.
#After Ellen's grandmother dies, Ellen is sent to live with her aunt Nadine, and her cousin Dora who are condescending and rude to Ellen.
#Ellen arrives at her &quot;new mama's&quot; house where she has good food and positive relationships with the other members of the family.
#Starletta comes to visit Ellen and Ellen tells Starletta that she loves her and she is sorry that she judged her by her the color of her skin.

These are my predictions for Ellen's future:
#Ellen graduates high school and goes to college (paid for by her foster parents).  
#At college, Ellen falls in love with a man who is an African American.
#After Ellen graduates from college, she gets a job as a social worker.
#She has a child and she names it Starletta.

==Source Transformation==

Any linear time invariant network of impedances can be reduced to one equivalent impedance. In particular, any network of sources and resistors can be reduced to one ideal source and one resistor, in either the Thevenin or Norton configurations.  In this way, a complicated network attached to a load resistor can be reduced to a single voltage divider (Thevenin) or current divider (Norton).

[[Image:Thevenin norton equivalents.svg|center|600px]]

Thevenin and Norton equivalents let you replace a Voltage source in series with a resistor by a current source in parallel with a resistor, or vice versa.  This is called a source transformation.

The point to be noted is that the block that is replaced with such an equivalent should be linear and time invariant, i.e. a linear change in the electrical source in that block produces a linear change in the equivalent source, and the behavior can be replicated if the initial conditions are replicated.
'''The above shown transformation figures are true only if the circuit contains at least one independent voltage or current source. If the circuit comprises only dependent sources then Thevenin equivalent consists of R&lt;sub&gt;Th&lt;/sub&gt; alone''' 

==Thevenin Equivalents==
The Thevenin equivalent circuit of a (two-terminal) network consists of a voltage source in series with a resistor.  The Thevenin equivalent will have the same output voltage and current regardless of what is attached to the terminals.

==Techniques For Finding Thevenin Equivalents==
*Network contains no sources (only resistors): The Thevenin resistance is equal to the equivalent resistance of the network.  The Thevenin voltage is zero.

*Basic: Works for any network except one with no independent sources.  Find the voltage across the terminals (with positive reference at terminal A) when they are open-circuited.  Find the current from terminal A to terminal B when they are short-circuited.  Then&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=\frac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Thevenin voltage source value is equivalent to the open-circuit voltage.

If the network has no dependent sources, the independent sources can be zeroed, and the Thevenin resistance is equal to the equivalent resistance of the network with zeroed sources.  Then, find &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt;.


*Only Dependent Sources:

If the network has only dependent sources, either attach a test voltage source to the terminal points and measure the current that passes from the positive terminal, or attach a test current source to the terminal points and measure the voltage difference across the terminals.  In both cases you will have values for &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{sc}&lt;/math&gt;, allowing you to use the &lt;math&gt;R_{th}=\frac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}}&lt;/math&gt; relation to find the Thevenin resistance.

==Norton Equivalents==

Norton equivalents can be found by performing a source transformation on the Thevenin equivalent.
The Norton Equivalent of a Thevenin Equivalent consists of a current source, &lt;math&gt;I_N= \frac {V_{th}}{R_{th}}&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_{th}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Thevenin and Norton Equivalent ==

[[Image:Thevenin example circuit.svg|center|thumb|200px|Figure 1: Circuit for the determination of Equivalents]]

The steps for creating the Equivalent are:
:1. Remove the load circuit.
:2. Calculate the voltage, V, at the output from the original sources.
:3. Now replace voltage sources with shorts and current sources with open circuits.
:4. Replace the load circuit with an imaginary ohm meter and measure the total resistance, R, looking back into the circuit, with the sources removed.
:5. The equivalent circuit is a voltage source with voltage V in series with a resistance R in series with the load.

The Thevenin Equivalent is determined with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; as the load as shown in Figure 1.  The first step is to open circuit &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;.  
Then the voltage v is calculated with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; open circuited must be calculated. The voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; this is because no current flows in the circuit so the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; by KVL.

Since this circuit does not contain any dependent sources, all that needs to be done is for all the Independent Voltage sources to be shorted and for all Independent Current Sources to be open circuited.  This results in the circuit shown in Figure 2.

[[Image:Thevenising circuit.svg|center|thumb|200px|Figure 2: Circuit for the Equivalent Resistance]]

Now the Thevenin Resistance is calculated looking into the two nodes.  The Thevenin resistance is clearly &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_3 | | R_4 &lt;/math&gt;. 
The Thevenin Equivalent is shown in Figure 3 and &lt;math&gt;R_{th}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{th}&lt;/math&gt; have the values shown below.
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=R_1 + R_3 | | R_4  \,&lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt;V_{th}=V_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Thevenin equivalent circuit.svg|center|thumb|200px|Figure 3: Equivalent Thevenin Circuit]]

The Norton Equivalent is created by doing a source transformation using 
&lt;math&gt;I_{N}=\frac {V_{th}}{R_{th}} \,&lt;/math&gt;.(2)

[[Image:Norton equivalent circuit.svg|center|thumb|200px|Figure 4: Equivalent Norton Circuit]]

If &lt;math&gt;R_2=R_1=6k \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_3=R_4=2k \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_1=15 V&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=1k + 4k | | 4k \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=6k \Omega \,&lt;/math&gt;


As a final note if the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculate by Voltage Divider Rule using the Thevenin Equivalent circuit in Figure 3.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{R2}=\frac {V_{th}R_2}{R_{th}+R_2}&lt;/math&gt; (3)
If the value of &lt;math&gt;R_{th}&lt;/math&gt; form equation 1 is substituted into equation 3.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{R2}=\frac {V_{th}R_2}{R_1 + R_3 | | R_4+R_2}&lt;/math&gt; (4)
Now look at Figure 1 and calcute &lt;math&gt;V_{R2}&lt;/math&gt; by voltage divider rule it has the same value as equation 4.  If the current through &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculated in Figure 4 by current divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;I_{R2}=\frac {I_NR_{th}}{R_{th}+R_2}(5)&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting equation 2 into 5.
:&lt;math&gt;I_{R2}=\frac {V_{th}}{R_{th}+R_2}(4)&lt;/math&gt;
If equation 4 and Ohm's Law are used to get the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; equation 3 is reached.

Please note:  The &quot;||&quot;, a symbol that is used as an operator here, holds higher precedence than the &quot;+&quot; operator.  As such, it is evaluated before a sum.

See [[w:Norton's theorem|Norton's theorem]] and [[w:Thevenin's theorem|Thevenin's theorem]] for more examples.

==Phasors==
[[image:Euler's_Formula_in_the_complex_plane.png|thumb|right|Figure One: Rectangular Notation]]
[[image:Euler's_Formula_in_the_Complex_Plane_Polar.png|thumb|right|Figure Two: Polar Notation]]
Phasors provide a simple means of analyzing linear circuits.  At the heart of phasor analysis lies [[Algebra/Complex Numbers#Euler's formula|Euler's formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;Ae^{j({\omega}t+\theta)}=A\cos({\omega}t+\theta)+jA\sin({\omega}t+\theta) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*'''j''' is the Imaginary unit (&lt;math&gt;j^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;).
*In electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is symbolized by j rather than the symbol ''i'' because ''i'' is used to denote current in electrical engineering.
*The frequency of the wave, in [[Hertz|Hz]], is given by &lt;math&gt;\omega/2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complex exponential can also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;Ae^{j({\omega}t+\theta)}=Ae^{j \theta} \cdot e^{j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}=Ae^{j\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is called a phasor.  It contains information about the magnitude and phase of a sinusoidal signal, but not the frequency or time.  This simplifies use in circuit analysis, since most of the time, all quantities in the circuit will have the same frequency.  (For circuits with sources at different frequencies, the principle of superposition must be used.)

A shorthand phasor notation is: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}=A\angle\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is simply a polar form, and can be converted to rectangular notation by (see figure one):
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}=Ae^{j \theta}=A\angle\theta=A\cos\theta+jA\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;
and back again by (see figure two):
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}=X+jY=\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}\angle{\tan^{-1}{\frac{Y}{X}}}=\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}e^{j \tan^{-1}{\frac{Y}{X}}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us understand how this process works, even though a phasor causes circuits to heat  up steady flow in current will explain on a basis that disallows overheating. Since according to the formula the outcome will be there is a time in  duration which the current usage stays the same.

==Sinusoidal Signals==
To begin, we must first understand what sinusoidal signals are.  Sinusoidal signals can be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;A\cos({\omega}t+\theta)\!&lt;/math&gt;
where A is the amplitude, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in radians per second, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the phase angle in degrees(phase shift).
We can return to the sinusoidal signal by taking the real part of Euler's formula:
:&lt;math&gt; A\cos({\omega}t+\theta)=\mathfrak{Re}(Ae^{j({\omega}t+\theta)})&lt;/math&gt;

For the moment, consider single-frequency circuits.  Every steady state current and voltage will have the same basic form:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A_i}e^{j{\omega}t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; is a phasor.  So we can &quot;divide through&quot; by &lt;math&gt;e^{j{\omega}t}\!&lt;/math&gt; to get phasor circuit equations.  We can solve these equations for some phasor circuit quantity &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, multiply by &lt;math&gt;e^{j{\omega}t}\!&lt;/math&gt;, and convert back to the sinusoidal form to find the time-domain sinusoidal steady-state solution.

==Example==
We have three sinusoidal signals with the same frequency added together:
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = 5\cos(200t+30^\circ)+2\cos(200t+45^\circ)+\cos(200t-60^\circ)\!&lt;/math&gt;
In phasor notation, this is:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V} = 5e^{j30^\circ}+2e^{j45^\circ}+e^{-j60^\circ} = 5\angle30+2\angle45+\angle-60&lt;/math&gt;
We can combine these terms to get one phasor notation.  This is done first by separating the real and imaginary components:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{X: }5\cos(30^\circ) + 2\cos(45^\circ)+\cos(-60^\circ)\approx 6.2443\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Y: }5\sin(30^\circ) + 2\sin(45^\circ)+\sin(-60^\circ)\approx 3.04819\!&lt;/math&gt;
The phasor notation can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}=6.2443+j3.04819=\sqrt{6.2443^2+3.04819^2}\angle{\tan^{-1}{\frac{3.04819}{6.2443}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}=6.94861\angle{26.0194}&lt;/math&gt;
Back to the time domain, we get the answer:
:&lt;math&gt;v(t)=6.94861\cos(200t+26.0194^\circ)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==
Impedance, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, is the quantity that relates voltage and current in the frequency domain.  (The tilde indicates a [[Electronics/Phasors|phasor]]. An overscore or arrow may also be used.)

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}=\frac{\tilde{V}}{\tilde{I}}=\frac{V\angle\phi_V}{I\angle\phi_I}=\frac{V}{I}\angle{\phi_V-\phi_I}&lt;/math&gt;.

In rectangular form,

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}=R+jX&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the resistance and ''X'' is the reactance.  Impedance is generally a function of frequency, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}(\omega)=R(\omega)+jX(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE: ω = 2 π f
:where f is the frequency in cycles per second (f=50 or 60 Hertz usually, depending on the country concerned. Aircraft systems often use 400 Hertz.)

=== Reactance ===

'''Reactance''' (symbol &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is the resistance to current flow of a circuit element that can store energy (i.e. a capacitor or an inductor), and is measured in ohms.

The reactance of an inductor of inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (in Henries), through which an alternating current of angular frequency &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; flows is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;X_L = \omega L&lt;/math&gt;

The reactance of a capacitor of capacitance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (in Farads) is given similarly:

:&lt;math&gt;X_C = 1 /(\omega C)&lt;/math&gt;

The two formulae for inductive reactance and capacitive reactance create interesting counterpoints. Notice that for inductive reactance, as the frequency of the AC increases, so does the reactance. Hence, higher frequencies result in lower current. The opposite is true of capacitive reactance: The higher the frequency of AC, the less reactance a capacitor will present.

Similarly, a more inductive inductor will present more reactance, while a capacitor with more capacitance will yield less reactance.

==Resistors==
Resistors have zero reactance, since they do not store energy, so their impedance is simply 
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}=R&lt;/math&gt;.

==Capacitors==
Capacitors have zero resistance, but do have reactance.  it is stored in the power  of a circuit or it can be also stored in a motor running off a AC current. Their impedance is

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}=\frac{1}{j{\omega}C}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the capacitance in farads. The reactance of one microfarad at 50 Hz is -3183 ohms, and at 60 Hz it is -2653 ohms. In much more basic terms storing energy would be equivalent to a battery the power source is active and stays in this manner without any loss of power, this is what is regarded as  a means for reversing electricity in the process of keeping that current.

.

==Inductors==

Like capacitors, inductors have zero resistance, but have reactance.  Their impedance is

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}=j{\omega}L&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the inductance in henries. The reactance of one henry at 50 Hz is 314 ohms, and at 60 Hz it is 377 ohms.

==Circuit Analysis Using Impedance==

Analysis in the frequency domain proceeds exactly like DC analysis, but all currents and voltages are now phasors (and so have an angle).  Impedance is treated exactly like a resistance, but is also a phasor (has an imaginary component/angle depending on the representation.)

(In the case that a circuit contains sources with different frequencies, the principle of [[Electronics/Superposition|superposition]] must be applied.)

Note that this analysis only applies to the [[Electronics/Steady_State|steady state]] response of circuits. For circuits with transient characteristics, circuits must be analyzed in the Laplace domain, also known as s-domain analysis.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Meitnerium. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Meitnerium~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is about dictionaries. If you open a dictionary, you should notice every entry consists of two parts, a word and the word's definition. The word is the key to finding out what a word means, and what the word means is considered the value for that key. In Python, dictionaries have keys and values. Keys are used to find values. Here is an example of a dictionary in use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_menu():
    print '1. Print Dictionary'
    print '2. Add definition'
    print '3. Remove word'
    print '4. Lookup word'
    print '5. Quit'
    print

words = {}
menu_choice = 0
print_menu()

while menu_choice != 5:
    menu_choice = input(&quot;Type in a number (1-5): &quot;)
    if menu_choice == 1:
        print &quot;Definitions:&quot;
        for x in words.keys():
            print x, &quot;: &quot;, words[x]
        print
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        print &quot;Add definition&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Word: &quot;)
        means = raw_input(&quot;Definition: &quot;)
        words[name] = means
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print &quot;Remove word&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Word: &quot;)
        if name in words:
            del words[name]
            print name, &quot; was removed.&quot;
        else:
            print name, &quot; was not found.&quot;
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print &quot;Lookup Word&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Word: &quot;)
        if name in words:
            print &quot;The definition of &quot;, name, &quot; is: &quot;, words[name]
        else:
            print &quot;No definition for &quot;, name, &quot; was found.&quot;
    elif menu_choice != 5:
        print_menu()
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is my output:

 1. Print Dictionary
 2. Add definition
 3. Remove word
 4. Lookup word
 5. Quit

This program is similar to the name list from the earlier chapter on lists (note that lists use indexes and dictionaries don't).  Here's how the program works: 

* First the function &lt;code&gt;print_menu&lt;/code&gt; is defined. &lt;code&gt;print_menu&lt;/code&gt; just prints a menu that is later used twice in the program.
* Next comes the funny looking line &lt;code&gt;words = {}&lt;/code&gt;.  All that line does is tell Python that &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary. 
* The next few lines just make the menu work.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for x in words.keys():
    print x, &quot;: &quot;, words[x]
&lt;/source&gt;

* This goes through the dictionary and prints all the information. The function &lt;code&gt; words.keys()&lt;/code&gt; returns a list that is then used by the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.  The list returned by &lt;code&gt;keys()&lt;/code&gt; is not in any particular order so if you want it in alphabetic order it must be sorted.  Similar to lists the statement &lt;code&gt;words[x]&lt;/code&gt; is used to access a specific member of the dictionary.  Of course in this case &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a string. 
* Next the line &lt;code&gt;words[name] = means&lt;/code&gt; adds a word and definition to the dictionary.  If &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is already in the dictionary &lt;code&gt;means&lt;/code&gt; replaces whatever was there before.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if name in words:
    del words[name]
&lt;/source&gt;

* See if name is in words and remove it if it is.  The expression &lt;code&gt;name in words&lt;/code&gt; returns true if &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is a key in &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; but otherwise returns false.  The line &lt;code&gt;del words[name]&lt;/code&gt; removes the key &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and the value associated with that key.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if name in words:
    print &quot;The definition of &quot;, name, &quot; is: &quot;, words[name]
&lt;/source&gt;

* Check to see if words has a certain key and if it does prints out the definition associated with it.
* Lastly if the menu choice is invalid it reprints the menu for your viewing pleasure.

A recap: Dictionaries have keys and values.  Keys can be strings or
numbers.  Keys point to values.  Values can be any type of variable
(including lists or even dictionaries (those dictionaries or lists of
course can contain dictionaries or lists themselves (scary right? :-)
)).  Here is an example of using a list in a dictionary:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
max_points = [25, 25, 50, 25, 100]
assignments = ['hw ch 1', 'hw ch 2', 'quiz   ', 'hw ch 3', 'test']
students = {'#Max': max_points}

def print_menu():
    print &quot;1. Add student&quot;
    print &quot;2. Remove student&quot;
    print &quot;3. Print grades&quot;
    print &quot;4. Record grade&quot;
    print &quot;5. Print Menu&quot;
    print &quot;6. Exit&quot;

def print_all_grades():
    print '\t',
    for i in range(len(assignments)):
        print assignments[i], '\t',
    print
    keys = students.keys()
    keys.sort()
    for x in keys:
        print x, '\t',
        grades = students[x]
        print_grades(grades)

def print_grades(grades):
    for i in range(len(grades)):
        print grades[i], '\t', '\t',
    print

print_menu()
menu_choice = 0
while menu_choice != 6:
    print
    menu_choice = input(&quot;Menu Choice (1-6): &quot;)
    if menu_choice == 1:
        name = raw_input(&quot;Student to add: &quot;)
        students[name] = [0] * len(max_points)
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        name = raw_input(&quot;Student to remove: &quot;)
        if name in students:
            del students[name]
        else:
            print &quot;Student:&quot;, name, &quot;not found&quot;
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print_all_grades()
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print &quot;Record Grade&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Student: &quot;)
        if name in students:
            grades = students[name]
            print &quot;Type in the number of the grade to record&quot;
            print &quot;Type a 0 (zero) to exit&quot;
            for i in range(len(assignments)):
                print i + 1, assignments[i], '\t',
            print
            print_grades(grades)
            which = 1234
            while which != -1:
                which = input(&quot;Change which Grade: &quot;)
                which = which - 1
                if 0 &lt;= which &lt; len(grades):
                    grade = input(&quot;Grade: &quot;)
                    grades[which] = grade
                elif which != -1:
                    print &quot;Invalid Grade Number&quot;
        else:
            print &quot;Student not found&quot;
    elif menu_choice != 6:
        print_menu()
&lt;/source&gt;

and here is a sample output:

 1. Add student

Here's how the program works.  Basically the variable &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt; is
a dictionary with the keys being the name of the students and the
values being their grades.  The first two lines just create two lists.
The next line &lt;code&gt;students = {'#Max': max_points}&lt;/code&gt; creates a new
dictionary with the key {&lt;code&gt;#Max&lt;/code&gt;} and the value is set to be &lt;code&gt;[25, 25, 50, 25, 100]&lt;/code&gt;, since thats what &lt;code&gt;max_points&lt;/code&gt; was when the assignment is made (I use the key &lt;code&gt;#Max&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; is sorted
ahead of any alphabetic characters).  Next &lt;code&gt;print_menu&lt;/code&gt; is
defined.  Next the &lt;code&gt;print_all_grades&lt;/code&gt; function is defined in the
lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_all_grades():
    print '\t',
    for i in range(len(assignments)):
        print assignments[i], '\t',
    print
    keys = students.keys()
    keys.sort()
    for x in keys:
        print x, '\t',
        grades = students[x]
        print_grades(grades)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how first the keys are gotten out of the &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt; dictionary with the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; function in the line &lt;code&gt;keys = students.keys()&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; is a list so all the functions for lists can be used on it.  Next the keys are sorted in the line &lt;code&gt;keys.sort()&lt;/code&gt; since it is a list.  &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; is used to go through all the keys. The grades are stored as a list inside the dictionary so the assignment &lt;code&gt;grades = students[x]&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; the list that is stored at the key &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.  The function &lt;code&gt;print_grades&lt;/code&gt; just prints a list and is defined a few lines later.

The later lines of the program implement the various options of the menu.  The line &lt;code&gt;students[name] = [0] * len(max_points)&lt;/code&gt; adds a student to the key of their name.  The notation &lt;code&gt;[0] * len(max_points)&lt;/code&gt; just creates a list of 0's that is the same length as the &lt;code&gt;max_points&lt;/code&gt; list.  

The remove student entry just deletes a student similar to the telephone book example.  The record grades choice is a little more complex.  The grades are retrieved in the line &lt;code&gt;grades = students[name]&lt;/code&gt; gets a reference to the grades of the student &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.  A grade is then recorded in the line &lt;code&gt;grades[which] = grade&lt;/code&gt;.  You may notice that &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; is never put back into the students dictionary (as in no &lt;code&gt;students[name] = grades&lt;/code&gt;).  The reason for the missing statement is that &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; is actually another name for &lt;code&gt;students[name]&lt;/code&gt; and so changing &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; changes &lt;code&gt;student[name]&lt;/code&gt;.  

Dictionaries provide a easy way to link keys to values.  This can be used to easily keep track of data that is attached to various keys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's this chapter's typing exercise (name it cal.py). &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; actually looks for a file named calendar.py and reads it in.  If the file is named calendar.py and it sees an &quot;import calendar&quot; it tries to read in itself which works poorly at best.)):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import calendar
year = input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;)
calendar.prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is part of the output I got:

 Type in the year number: 2001
 
                                  2001

(I skipped some of the output, but I think you get the idea.) So what does the program do?  The first line &lt;code&gt;import calendar&lt;/code&gt; uses a new command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;.  The command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; loads a module (in this case the &lt;code&gt;calendar&lt;/code&gt; module).  To see the commands available in the standard modules either look in the library reference for python (if you downloaded it) or go to http://docs.python.org/library/.  If you look at the documentation for the calendar module, it lists a function called &lt;code&gt;prcal&lt;/code&gt; that prints a calendar for a year.  The line &lt;code&gt;calendar.prcal(year)&lt;/code&gt; uses this function.  In summary to use a module &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; it and then use &lt;code&gt;module_name.function&lt;code&gt; for functions in the module.  Another way to write the program is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from calendar import prcal

year = input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;)
prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt; 

This version imports a specific function from a module.  Here is another program that uses the Python Library (name it something like clock.py) (press Ctrl and the 'c' key at the same time to terminate the program):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from time import time, ctime

prev_time = &quot;&quot;
while True:
    the_time = ctime(time())
    if prev_time != the_time:
        print &quot;The time is:&quot;, ctime(time())
        prev_time = the_time
&lt;/source&gt;

With some output being:

 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:04 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:05 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:06 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:07 2000
 
 Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;clock.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
     the_time = ctime(time())
 
 KeyboardInterrupt

The output is infinite of course so I canceled it (or the output at least continues until Ctrl+C is pressed).  The program just does a infinite loop (&lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; is always true, so &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; goes forever) and each time checks to see if the time has changed and prints it if it has.  Notice how multiple names after the import statement are used in the line &lt;code&gt;from time import time, ctime&lt;/code&gt;.  

The Python Library contains many useful functions.  These functions give your programs more abilities and many of them can simplify programming in Python.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen lists and how they can be used.   Now that you have some more background I will go into more detail about lists.  First we will look at more ways to get at the elements in a list and then we will talk about copying them.  

Here are some examples of using indexing to access a single element of a list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[0]'''
 'zero'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[4]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[5]'''
 'five'

All those examples should look familiar to you.  If you want the first item in the list just look at index 0.  The second item is index 1 and so on through the list.  However what if you want the last item in the list?  One way could be to use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function like &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]&lt;/code&gt;.  This way works since the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function always returns the last index plus one.  The second from the last would then be &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]&lt;/code&gt;.  There is an easier way to do this.  In Python the last item is always index -1.  The second to the last is index -2 and so on.  Here are some more examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-6]'''
 'zero'

Thus any item in the list can be indexed in two ways: from the front and from the back.

Another useful way to get into parts of lists is using slicing.  Here is another example to give you an idea what they can be used for:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things = [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0]'''
 0
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[7]'''
 'Jill'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0:8]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, 'Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[2:4]'''
 [2, 'S.P.A.M.']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[4:7]'''
 ['Stocking', 42, 'Jack']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[1:5]'''
 ['Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking']

Slicing is used to return part of a list.  The slicing operator is in the form &lt;code&gt;things[first_index:last_index]&lt;/code&gt;.  Slicing cuts the list before the &lt;code&gt;first_index&lt;/code&gt; and before the &lt;code&gt;last_index&lt;/code&gt; and returns the parts inbetween.  You can use both types of indexing:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:-2]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4]'''
 'Stocking'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:6]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]

Another trick with slicing is the unspecified index.  If the first index is not specified the beginning of the list is assumed.  If the last index is not specified the whole rest of the list is assumed.  Here are some examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:2]'''
 [0, 'Fred']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-2:]'''
 ['Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:3]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:-5]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]

Here is a (HTML inspired) program example (copy and paste in the poem definition if you want):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
poem = [&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;went&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;the&quot;,
        &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;pail&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;water.&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;fell&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;broke&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;crown&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;came&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;tumbling&quot;, &quot;after&quot;]

def get_bolds(text):
    true = 1
    false = 0
    ## is_bold tells whether or not we are currently looking at 
    ## a bold section of text.
    is_bold = false
    ## start_block is the index of the start of either an unbolded 
    ## segment of text or a bolded segment.
    start_block = 0
    for index in range(len(text)):
        ## Handle a starting of bold text
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;:
            if is_bold:
                print &quot;Error: Extra Bold&quot;
            ## print &quot;Not Bold:&quot;, text[start_block:index]
            is_bold = true
            start_block = index + 1
        ## Handle end of bold text
        ## Remember that the last number in a slice is the index 
        ## after the last index used.
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;:
            if not is_bold:
                print &quot;Error: Extra Close Bold&quot;
            print &quot;Bold [&quot;, start_block, &quot;:&quot;, index, &quot;]&quot;, text[start_block:index]
            is_bold = false
            start_block = index + 1

get_bolds(poem)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 Bold [ 1 : 4 ] ['Jack', 'and', 'Jill']
 Bold [ 11 : 15 ] ['fetch', 'a', 'pail', 'of']
 Bold [ 20 : 23 ] ['down', 'and', 'broke']
 Bold [ 28 : 30 ] ['Jill', 'came']

The &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; function takes in a list that is broken into words
and tokens.  The tokens that it looks for are &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which starts
the bold text and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which ends bold text. The function
&lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; goes through and searches for the start and end
tokens.

The next feature of lists is copying them.  If you try something simple like:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print b'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print b'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print a'''
 [1, 10, 3]

This probably looks surprising since a modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;
resulted in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; being changed as well.  What happened is that the
statement &lt;code&gt;b = a&lt;/code&gt; makes &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a ''reference'' to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
This means that &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as another name for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
Hence any modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; changes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as well.  However
some assignments don't create two names for one list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a * 2'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print a'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print b'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print a'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print b'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

In this case &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is not a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; since the
expression &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; creates a new list. Then the statement
&lt;code&gt;b = a * 2&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a reference to &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; rather than a
reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.  All assignment operations create a reference.
When you pass a list as an argument to a function you create a
reference as well.  Most of the time you don't have to worry about
creating references rather than copies.  However when you need to make
modifications to one list without changing another name of the list
you have to make sure that you have actually created a copy.

There are several ways to make a copy of a list.  The simplest that
works most of the time is the slice operator since it always makes a
new list even if it is a slice of a whole list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print a'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print b'''
 [1, 10, 3]

Taking the slice &lt;code&gt;[:]&lt;/code&gt; creates a new copy of the list. However it
only copies the outer list.  Any sublist inside is still a references
to the sublist in the original list.  Therefore, when the list
contains lists, the inner lists have to be copied as well.  You could
do that manually but Python already contains a module to do it.  You
use the &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''import copy'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c = copy.deepcopy(a)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[0][1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c[1][1] = 12'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print a'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print b'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print c'''
 [[1, 2, 3], [4, 12, 6]]

First of all notice that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a list of lists.  Then notice
that when &lt;code&gt;b[0][1] = 10&lt;/code&gt; is run both &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are
changed, but &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is not.  This happens because the inner arrays
are still references when the slice operator is used.  However with
&lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; was fully copied.

So, should I worry about references every time I use a function or
&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;?  The good news is that you only have to worry about
references when using dictionaries and lists.  Numbers and strings
create references when assigned but every operation on numbers and
strings that modifies them creates a new copy so you can never modify
them unexpectedly.  You do have to think about references when you are
modifying a list or a dictionary.

By now you are probably wondering why are references used at all?  The
basic reason is speed.  It is much faster to make a reference to a
thousand element list than to copy all the elements.  The other reason
is that it allows you to have a function to modify the inputed list
or dictionary.  Just remember about references if you ever have some
weird problem with data being changed when it shouldn't be.

&lt;!-- Okay here is todays typing exercise: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!--     &quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     prefix = &quot;&quot; --&gt;

&lt;!--     if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = -1 --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_str = in_str[1:] --&gt;
&lt;!--     else: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = 1 --&gt;
&lt;!--     for x in range(0,len(in_str)): --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_num = out_num * 10 + ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0') --&gt;
&lt;!--     return out_num * multiplier --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(2) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(-23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;14234&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;12345&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The output is: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 14234 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 12345 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -3512 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- So how does it work?  The first detail to notice is that it defines two different functions, one that converts a string to a number and one that converts a number to a string.  Notice that this function does string manipulation similar to how lists can be manipulated.  For example the line &lt;code&gt;if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;&lt;/code&gt; uses indexing to look at the first letter in the string.  Another thing that strings can do that lists can is using slices.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_str = in_str[1:]&lt;/code&gt; uses slices to get all but the first character of in_str (or drops the first letter).  However you cannot use slices or indexing to assign to a letter or location in a string. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Two new things to introduced are the functions &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt;.  The  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function takes a character (a string of length one) and returns the ASCII value of the character.  The function &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt; is its inverse and takes a ASCII value and returns a character.  The expression &lt;code&gt;ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0')&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function to find the value of a string.  This works since '0' through '9' have ASCII values that are all in a row.  The ASCII value of '0' is 48 and the ASCII value of '9' is 57 so when we subtract 57-48 we get 9 and this works similarly with other numbers.  The expression &lt;code&gt;chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10)&lt;/code&gt; works in a similar manor but in reverse.
--&gt;
And now presenting a cool trick that can be done with strings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def shout(string):
    for character in string:
        print &quot;Gimme a &quot; + character
        print &quot;'&quot; + character + &quot;'&quot;
shout(&quot;Lose&quot;)

def middle(string):
    print &quot;The middle character is:&quot;, string[len(string) / 2]

middle(&quot;abcdefg&quot;)
middle(&quot;The Python Programming Language&quot;)
middle(&quot;Atlanta&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the output is:

 Gimme a L
 'L'
 Gimme a o
 'o'
 Gimme a s
 's'
 Gimme a e
 'e'
 The middle character is: d
 The middle character is: r
 The middle character is: a

What these programs demonstrate is that strings are similar to lists in several ways.  The &lt;code&gt;shout()&lt;/code&gt; function shows that &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops can be used with strings just as they can be used with lists.  The &lt;code&gt;middle&lt;/code&gt; procedure shows that that strings can also use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function and array indexes and slices.  Most list features work on strings as well.

The next feature demonstrates some string specific features:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def to_upper(string):
    ## Converts a string to upper case
    upper_case = &quot;&quot;
    for character in string:
        if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':
            location = ord(character) - ord('a')
            new_ascii = location + ord('A')
            character = chr(new_ascii)
        upper_case = upper_case + character
    return upper_case

print to_upper(&quot;This is Text&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 THIS IS TEXT

This works because the computer represents the characters of a string as numbers from 0 to 255.  Python has a function called &lt;code&gt;ord()&lt;/code&gt; (short for ordinal) that returns a character as a number.  There is also a corresponding function called &lt;code&gt;chr()&lt;/code&gt; that converts a number into a character.  With this in mind the program should start to be clear.  The first detail is the line: &lt;code&gt;if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':&lt;/code&gt; which checks to see if a letter is lower case.  If it is then the next lines are used.  First it is converted into a location so that a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, b&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, c&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and so on with the line: &lt;code&gt;location = ord(character) - ord('a')&lt;/code&gt;.  Next the new value is found with &lt;code&gt;new_ascii = location + ord('A')&lt;/code&gt;.  This value is converted back to a character that is now upper case.

Now for some interactive typing exercise:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Integer to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''2'''
 2
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(2)'''
 '2'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''-123'''
 -123
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(-123)'''
 '-123'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''`123`'''
 '123'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot;'''
 '23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;)'''
 23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot; * 2'''
 '2323'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;) * 2'''

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;123&quot;)'''

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''`float(&quot;1.23&quot;)`'''

If you haven't guessed already the function &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a integer to a string and the function &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to an integer. The function &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to a float.  The &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; function returns a printable representation of something. &lt;code&gt;`...`&lt;/code&gt; converts almost everything into a string, too. Here are some examples of this:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1)'''
 '1'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(234.14)'''
 '234.14'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr([4, 42, 10])'''
 '[4, 42, 10]'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''`[4, 42, 10]`'''
 '[4, 42, 10]'

The &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function tries to convert a string (or a float) into a integer.  There is also a similar function called &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; that will convert a integer or a string into a float.  Another function that Python has is the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function.  The &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function takes a string and returns data of the type that python thinks it found.  For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print v, type(v)'''
 123 &lt;type 'int'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('645.123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print v, type(v)'''
 645.123 &lt;type 'float'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('[1, 2, 3]')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print v, type(v)'''
 [1, 2, 3] &lt;type 'list'&gt;

If you use the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function you should check that it returns the type that you expect.

One useful string function is the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; method. Here's an example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;This is a bunch of words&quot;.split()'''
 ['This', 'is', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'words']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text = &quot;First batch, second batch, third, fourth&quot;'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 ['First batch', ' second batch', ' third', ' fourth']

Notice how &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; converts a string into a list of strings.  The string is split by whitespace by default or by the optional argument (in this case a comma).
You can also add another argument that tells &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; how many times the separator will be used to split the text. For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 4
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' fourth'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;, 2)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 3
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' third, fourth'

=== Slicing strings (and lists) ===

Strings can be cut into pieces &amp;mdash; in the same way as it was shown for lists in the previous chapter &amp;mdash; by using the ''slicing'' &quot;operator&quot; &lt;tt&gt;[:]&lt;/tt&gt;. The slicing operator works in the same way as before: text[first_index:last_index] (in very rare cases there can be another colon and a third argument, as in the example shown below).

In order not to get confused by the index numbers, it is easiest to see them as ''clipping places'', possibilities to cut a string into parts. Here is an example, which shows the clipping places (in yellow) and their index numbers (red and blue) for a simple text string:

&lt;tt&gt;
{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0px&quot;
|
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |0
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; | ...
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
|-

|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
|-
| text = 
|&quot;
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!S 
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!T
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!R
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!I
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!N
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!G
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|&quot;
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
|-
|
|
|[:
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|:]
|
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the red indexes are counted from the beginning of the string and the blue ones from the end of the string backwards. (Note that there is no blue -0, which could seem to be logical at the end of the string. Because &lt;tt&gt;-0 == 0&lt;/tt&gt;, (-0 means &quot;beginning of the string&quot; as well.)  Now we are ready to use the indexes for slicing operations:

&lt;tt&gt;
{|
|-
|text[1:4] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;TRI&quot;
|-
|text[:5] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[:-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[-4:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;RING&quot;
|-
|text[2] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;R&quot;
|-
|text[:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRING&quot;
|-
|text[::-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;GNIRTS&quot;
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;text[1:4]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us all of the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; string between clipping places 1 and 4, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;TRI&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you omit one of the [first_index:last_index] arguments, you get the beginning or end of the string as default: &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt; gives &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRIN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. For both &lt;tt&gt;first_index&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;last_index&lt;/tt&gt; we can use both the red and the blue numbering schema: &lt;tt&gt;text[:-1]&lt;/tt&gt; gives the same as &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt;, because the index -1 is at the same place as 5 in this case. If we do not use an argument containing a colon, the number is treated in a different way: &lt;tt&gt;text[2]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us one character following the second clipping point, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The special slicing operation &lt;tt&gt;text[:]&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;from the beginning to the end&quot; and produces a copy of the entire string (or list, as shown in the previous chapter).

Last but not least, the slicing operation can have a second colon and a third argument, which is interpreted as the &quot;step size&quot;: &lt;tt&gt;text[::-1]&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; from beginning to the end, with a step size of -1. -1 means &quot;every character, but in the other direction&quot;. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; backwards is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;GNIRTS&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (test a step length of 2, if you have not got the point here).

All these slicing operations work with lists as well. In that sense strings are just a special case of lists, where the list elements are single characters. Just remember the concept of ''clipping places'', and the indexes for slicing things will get a lot less confusing.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program requires an excellent understanding of decimal numbers
def to_string(in_int):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_str = &quot;&quot;
    prefix = &quot;&quot;
    if in_int &lt; 0:
        prefix = &quot;-&quot;
        in_int = -in_int
    while in_int / 10 != 0:
        out_str = chr(ord('0') + in_int % 10) + out_str
        in_int = in_int / 10
    out_str = chr(ord('0') + in_int % 10) + out_str
    return prefix + out_str

def to_int(in_str):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_num = 0
    if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;:
        multiplier = -1
        in_str = in_str[1:]
    else:
        multiplier = 1
    for x in range(0, len(in_str)):
        out_num = out_num * 10 + ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0')
    return out_num * multiplier

print to_string(2)
print to_string(23445)
print to_string(-23445)
print to_int(&quot;14234&quot;)
print to_int(&quot;12345&quot;)
print to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 2
 23445
 -23445
 14234
 12345
 -3512

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a simple example of file IO (input/output):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Write a file
out_file = open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
out_file.write(&quot;This Text is going to out file\nLook at it and see!&quot;)
out_file.close()

# Read a file
in_file = open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)
text = in_file.read()
in_file.close()

print text
&lt;/source&gt;

The output and the contents of the file &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; are:

 This Text is going to out file
 Look at it and see!

Notice that it wrote a file called &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; in the directory that you ran the program from.  The &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; in the string tells Python to put a ''n''ewline where it is.  

A overview of file IO is:
* Get a file object with the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function.
* Read or write to the file object (depending on how it was opened)
* Close it

The first step is to get a file object.  The way to do this is to use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function.  The format is &lt;code&gt;file_object = open(filename, mode)&lt;/code&gt;  where &lt;code&gt;file_object&lt;/code&gt; is the variable to put the file object, &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is a string with the filename, and &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;&quot;r&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''r''ead a file or &lt;code&gt;&quot;w&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''w''rite a file (and a few others we will skip here).  Next the file objects functions can be called.  The two most common functions are &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function adds a string to the end of the file.  The &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string.  If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).  

Now here is a new version of the phone numbers program that we made earlier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_numbers(numbers):
    print &quot;Telephone Numbers:&quot;
    for x in numbers.keys():
        print &quot;Name:&quot;, x, &quot;\tNumber:&quot;, numbers[x]
    print

def add_number(numbers, name, number):
    numbers[name] = number

def lookup_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:
        return &quot;The number is &quot; + numbers[name]
    else:
        return name + &quot; was not found&quot;

def remove_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:
        del numbers[name]
    else:
        print name,&quot; was not found&quot;

def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;r&quot;)
    for in_line in in_file:
        in_line = in_line.rstrip('\n') #Eliminate end of line or enter        
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

def save_numbers(numbers, filename):
    out_file = open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)
    for x in numbers.keys():
        out_file.write(x + &quot;,&quot; + numbers[x] + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()

def print_menu():
    print '1. Print Phone Numbers'
    print '2. Add a Phone Number'
    print '3. Remove a Phone Number'
    print '4. Lookup a Phone Number'
    print '5. Load numbers'
    print '6. Save numbers'
    print '7. Quit'
    print

phone_list = {}
menu_choice = 0
print_menu()
while True:
    menu_choice = input(&quot;Type in a number (1-7): &quot;)
    if menu_choice == 1:
        print_numbers(phone_list)
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        print &quot;Add Name and Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        phone = raw_input(&quot;Number: &quot;)
        add_number(phone_list, name, phone)
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print &quot;Remove Name and Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        remove_number(phone_list, name)
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print &quot;Lookup Number&quot;
        name = raw_input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        print lookup_number(phone_list, name)
    elif menu_choice == 5:
        filename = raw_input(&quot;Filename to load: &quot;)
        load_numbers(phone_list, filename)
    elif menu_choice == 6:
        filename = raw_input(&quot;Filename to save: &quot;)
        save_numbers(phone_list, filename)
    elif menu_choice == 7:
        break
    else:
        print_menu()

print &quot;Goodbye&quot;  
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that it now includes saving and loading files.  Here is some output of my running it twice:

 1. Print Phone Numbers
 2. Add a Phone Number
 3. Remove a Phone Number
 4. Lookup a Phone Number
 5. Load numbers

The new portions of this program are:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;r&quot;)
    while True:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if not in_line:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()
def save_numbers(numbers, filename):
    out_file = open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)
    for x in numbers.keys():
        out_file.write(x + &quot;,&quot; + numbers[x] + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

First we will look at the save portion of the program.  First it creates a file object with the command &lt;code&gt;open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  Next it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command &lt;code&gt;out_file.write(x + &quot;,&quot; + numbers[x] + &quot;\n&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.

The loading portion is a little more complicated.  It starts by getting a file object.  Then it uses a &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; loop to keep looping until a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement is encountered.  Next it gets a line with the line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_file.readline()&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function will return a empty string when the end of the file is reached. The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement checks for this and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;s out of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop when that happens.  Of course if the &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; returns.  Hence we have to get rid of the newline.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_line[:-1]&lt;/code&gt; does this for us by dropping the last character.  Next the line &lt;code&gt;name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; splits the line at the comma into a name and a number.  This is then added to the &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; dictionary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== ...or how to handle errors ===

So you now have the perfect program, it runs flawlessly, except for one detail, it will crash on invalid user input.  Have no fear, for Python has a special control structure for you.  It's called &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; and it tries to do something.  Here is an example of a program with a problem:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;
number = 1
while number != -1:
    number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
    print &quot;You entered:&quot;, number
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how when you enter &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it outputs something like:

 Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;try_less.py&quot;, line 4, in ?
     number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))&lt;/source&gt;
 
 ValueError: invalid literal for int(): @#&amp;

As you can see the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function is unhappy with the number &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (as well it should be).  The last line shows what the problem is; Python found a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;.   How can our program deal with this?  What we do is first: put the place where the errors occurs in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and second: tell Python how we want &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;s handled.  The following program does this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;
number = 1
while number != -1:
    try:
        number = int(raw_input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
        print &quot;You entered:&quot;, number
    except ValueError:
        print &quot;That was not a number.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when we run the new program and give it &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it tells us &quot;That was not a number.&quot; and continues with what it was doing before.

When your program keeps having some error that you know how to handle, put code in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and put the way to handle the error in the &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; block.

Here is a more complex example of Error Handling.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Program by Mitchell Aikens 2012
# No copyright.
import math

def main():
	success = 0
	while (success == 0):
		try:
			epact()
			success = 1
		except ValueError:
			print &quot;Error. Please enter an integer value.&quot;
			year = 0
		except NameError:
			print &quot;Error. Please enter an integer value.&quot;
			year = 0
		except SyntaxError:
			print &quot;Error. Please enter an integer value.&quot;
			year = 0
		finally:
			print &quot;Program Complete&quot;

def epact():
    
    year = int(input(&quot;What year is it?\n&quot;))
    C = year/100
    epactval = (8 + (C/4) - C + ((8*C + 13)/25) + 11 * (year%19))%30
    print &quot;The Epact is: &quot;,epactval

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The program above uses concepts from previous lessons as well as the current lesson.
Let's look at the above program in sections.

After we define the function called &quot;main&quot;, we tell it that we want to &quot;try&quot; function named &quot;epact&quot;. It does so &quot;while&quot; there is no &quot;success&quot;.   The interpreter then goes to the the line &lt;code&gt;year = int(input(&quot;What year is it?\n&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;.
The interpreter takes the value entered by the user and stores it in the variable named &quot;year&quot;.

If the value entered is not an integer or a floating point number (which would be converted to an integer by the interpreter), an exception would be raised, and execution of the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block ends, just before &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; is assigned the value 1.

Let's look at some possible exceptions. the program above does not have an &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; clause for every possible exception, as there are numerous types or exceptions.

If the value entered for year is an alphabetical character, a &lt;code&gt;NameError&lt;/code&gt; exception is raised. In the program above, this is caught by the &lt;code&gt;except NameError:&lt;/code&gt; line, and the interpreter executes the print statement below the &lt;code&gt;except NameError:&lt;/code&gt;, then it sets the value of &quot;year&quot; to 0 as a precaution, clearing it of any non-numeric number. The interpreter then jumps back to the first line of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, and the process restarts.

The process above would be the same for the other exceptions we have. If an exception is raised, and there is an except clause for it in our program, the interpreter will jump to the statements under the appropriate except clause, and execute them.

The &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; statement, is sometimes used in exception handling as well. 
Think of it as the trump card. Statements underneath the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clause will be executed regardless of if we raise and exception or not. The &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; statement will be executed after any &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; clauses prior to it. 

Below is a simpler example where we are not looped, and the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clause is executed regardless of exceptions.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Program By Mitchell Aikens 2012
#Not copyright.

def main():
    try:
        number = int(input(&quot;Please enter a number.\n&quot;))
        half = number/2
        print &quot;Half of the number you entered is &quot;,half
    except NameError:
        print &quot;Error.&quot;
    except ValueError:
        print &quot;Error.&quot;
    except SyntaxError:
        print &quot;Error.&quot;
    finally:
        print &quot;I am executing the finally clause.&quot;
        
main()
&lt;/source&gt;

If we were to enter an alphabetic value for &lt;code&gt;number = int(input(&quot;Please enter a number.\n&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;, the output would be as follows:

 Please enter a number.
 t
 Error.
 I am executing the finally clause.

=== Exercises ===
Update at least the phone numbers program (in section [[../File IO/]]) so it doesn't crash if a user doesn't enter any data at the menu.

For the moment I recommend looking at [http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ The Python 2 Tutorial] by [http://www.python.org/~guido/ Guido van Rossum] for more topics. If you have been following this tutorial, you should be able to understand a fair amount of it. If you want to get deeper into Python, [http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ Learn Python the Hard Way] is a nice on-line textbook, although targeted at people with a more solid programming background. The [[Python Programming]] wikibook can be worth looking at, too.

This tutorial is very much a work in progress.  Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it.  I enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.  

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">; ''Question:'' Can't use programs with input. : ''Answer:'' If you are using IDLE then try using command line.  This problem seems to be fixed in IDLE 0.6 and newer.  If you are using an older version of IDLE try upgrading to Python 2.0 or newer.
; Is there a printable version? : Yes, see the next question.
; Is there a PDF or zipped version? : Yes, go to http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut for several different versions.  Note that this will not always be up to date with the Wikibooks version. The Wikibook can be printed from the [[../Print version|print version]].
; What is the tutorial written with? : Originally, LaTeX, see the &lt;code&gt;easytut.tex&lt;/code&gt; file.
; I can't type in programs of more than one line. : If the programs that you type in run as soon as you are typing them in, you need to edit a file instead of typing them in interactive mode. (Hint: interactive mode is the mode with the &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; prompt in front of it.)
; My question is not answered here. : Ask on the talk page.  Please post source code if at all relevant (even, (or maybe especially) if it doesn't work). Helpful things to include are what you were trying to do, what happened, what you expected to happen, error messages, version of Python, Operating System, and whether or not your cat was stepping on the keyboard. (The cat in my house has a fondness for space bars and control keys.)
; I want to read it in a different language. : There are several translations that I know of.  One is in Korean and is available at http://home.hanmir.com/~johnsonj/easytut/easytut.html. Another is in Spanish and at http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut_es/.  Another is in Italian and is available at http://www.python.it/doc/tut_begin/index.html. Another is in Greek and available at http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut_gr/. Several people have said they are doing a translation in other languages such as French, but I never heard back from them.  If you have done a translation or know of any translations, please either send it to me or send me a link.
; How do I make a GUI in Python? : You can use either TKinter at http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/ or WXPython at http://www.wxpython.org/
; How do I make a game in Python? : The best method is probably to use PYgame at http://pygame.org/
; How do I make an executable from a Python program? : Short answer: Python is an interpreted language so that is impossible. Long answer is that something similar to an executable can be created by taking the Python interpreter and the file and joining them together and distributing that.  For more on that problem see http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw.py?req=all#4.28. A project that does make executable python files is py2exe - see http://www.py2exe.org.
; I need help with the exercises : Hint, the password program requires two variables, one to keep track of the number of times the password was typed in, and another to keep track of the last password typed in. Also you can download solutions from http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/

&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!-- == Command Line Install == --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- This is here purely for historical reasons.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- === Running Python === --&gt;
&lt;!-- This section is somewhat vague since I am trying to explain how to run Python in general and not on a specific machine (though I am writing from a Unix viewpoint).  If you have a Microsoft(tm) Windows machine see the next section for details.  If you have a Macintosh see http://www.python.org for other documentation. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- First you should check to see if you can run Python in interactive mode.  To do this go to a command prompt and type &lt;code&gt; python&lt;/code&gt;.  If everything is working you should see something like this: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Python 1.5.1 (#1, Dec 17 1998, 20:58:15)  [GCC 2.7.2.3] on linux2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The &lt;code&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is Python's way of telling you it is waiting for you to type something in.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- If you did not get the &lt;code&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; prompt then something is wrong.  Check and make sure that you properly installed Python.  Check to see that the python executable is in the path.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Once you got the Python interpreter running you can play around with it.  Here are some things you could try: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; 1+1 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; 3*4+5  --&gt;
&lt;!-- 17 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; a=12 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; a      --&gt;
&lt;!-- 12 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hi&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- 'Hi' --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- To exit try typing Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+D or if neither of those works type &lt;code&gt;import sys; sys.exit(0)&lt;/code&gt;.  Next, how to run Python programs.  First you need create a Python program.  To do that you should type in the following in a text editor:\footnote{A text editor is just a program that edits text.  If you are in Windows I recommend that you use Notepad or Editpad (http://www.jgsoft.com).  If you are in Unix I recommend that you use a text editor that you are comfortable with (if you haven't found one yet use pico, ae, or (x)emacs (emacs has a very nice Python mode BTW)).  } --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;Hello, World!&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Now save the file in some convenient location as hello.py.  Next go to directory with the file that you save the file in and type &lt;code&gt; python hello.py&lt;/code&gt;.  The screen should look something like this: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;python hello.py --&gt;
&lt;!-- Hello, World! --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- If you get some error message check to make sure you saved the file in the right place.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- From now on I will mainly give you programs to type in that you should save and then run.   --&gt;
&lt;!-- %%If you didn't get that and get some error message like bad command or filename or command not found then either Python is not installed or the Python interpreter is not in your path.  With Windows you need to have the python.exe file locate in your path.  For example, if python.exe is in the directory &lt;code&gt;C:\PROGRA~1\PYTHON\&lt;/code&gt; then if you add &lt;code&gt;PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\PYTHON\;%PATH%&lt;/code&gt; to the end of your &lt;code&gt;AUTOEXEC.BAT&lt;/code&gt; file the next time you reboot your computer python.exe will be found in your path.  For Unix find Python with locate and add the directory to the path (or move python). --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- %%There, you now should be able to type in and run a Python program.  The later chapters will show you more about how to create a Python program. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- === Windows === --&gt;
&lt;!-- First install Python.  Then go to a command line which can be done one of two ways: Click ''' Start&gt;&gt;Programs&gt;&gt;MS-DOS Prompt''', or click ''' Start&gt;&gt;Run''', then type ''' command''' and hit ''' Enter'''. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- This will open up a DOS screen with a prompt that probably looks like this: --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\WINDOWS&gt;    --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Type ''' python''' and hit ''' Enter'''.  If you get &lt;code&gt; Bad command or file name&lt;/code&gt; then either you forgot to install Python or &lt;code&gt; python.exe&lt;/code&gt; is not in the &lt;code&gt; PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable (to see what the &lt;code&gt; PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable has in it type ''' PATH''').   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- To fix the problem click ''' Start&gt;&gt;Find&gt;&gt;Files or Folders''' and then look for a file ''' Named''' &lt;code&gt; python.exe&lt;/code&gt;.  If it is found then the problem is the &lt;code&gt; PATH&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise Python was not properly installed.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- To fix the &lt;code&gt; PATH&lt;/code&gt; problem the directory that includes &lt;code&gt; python.exe&lt;/code&gt; needs to be added to &lt;code&gt; PATH&lt;/code&gt;.  The directory that &lt;code&gt; python&lt;/code&gt; is in is the folder that &lt;code&gt; Find&lt;/code&gt; shows to the left of the name.  If the whole name is not shown Right click on the python icon and go to ''' Properties'''.  The &lt;code&gt; Properties&lt;/code&gt; dialog will have a line called &lt;code&gt; Location:&lt;/code&gt; that shows the directory where &lt;code&gt; python.exe&lt;/code&gt; is at.  Next go to the command prompt and type in &lt;code&gt;PATH=&quot;C:\Location of Python\&quot;;%PATH%&lt;/code&gt;.  For Example: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\WINDOWS&gt;python --&gt;
&lt;!-- Bad command or file name --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\WINDOWS&gt;PATH=&quot;C:\Programe Files\Python&quot;;%PATH% --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\WINDOWS&gt;python --&gt;
&lt;!-- Python 1.5.1 (#0, Apr 13 1998, 20:22:04) [MSC 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Type Ctrl+Z to get out of interactive mode (i.e. hold down the Ctrl Key and then press down on the Z key at the same time, then release both.). --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Next type this program in a text editor (such as Notepad): --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;Hello, World!&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- and save it in a convenient location such as &lt;code&gt;C:\python\hello.py&lt;/code&gt;. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- From here you need to change the path to the Python directory where you saved your first program.  The command to do this is (Hit Enter): --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- cd \python       --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- which should give you a prompt like: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\Python&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Now you are ready to run your first program.  Just type python hello.py --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;python hello.py --&gt;
&lt;!-- Hello, World! --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- From now on in the tutorial I will assume that you know how to create and run programs. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- === Longer Windows install === --&gt;
&lt;!-- %%\newcommand{\file}[1]{&lt;code&gt;#1&lt;/code&gt;} --&gt;
&lt;!-- %%\newcommand{\url}[1]{&lt;code&gt;#1&lt;/code&gt;} --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- \subsection{Download Python} --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Download &lt;code&gt;py152.exe&lt;/code&gt; from [http://www.python.org/download/download\_windows.html http://www.python.org/download/download\_windows.html]   The file is located at [ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/win32/py152.exe ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/win32/py152.exe]   Download this file and save it to your computer. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- \subsection{Install Python} --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Run &lt;code&gt;py152.exe&lt;/code&gt; by double clicking on the executable.  This will start the Python installation process.  Use the defaults for the install.  The computer will restart after this is done. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- %%The Python installation creates a folder &lt;code&gt;Python 1.5&lt;/code&gt;.  Go to Start$\to$ Programs$\to$ Python~1.5 --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- \subsection{Add Python to Path} --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- The next step is to add the Python executable to the path.  The path specifies how DOS finds commands.  First you will find where the Python executable was installed.  Next create a &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; command to tell DOS where to find Python.  Lastly add the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; command to the autoexec.bat so that it will be permanent.  The following tells how to do this. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- This is what you should do to add Python to the path. First get to an MS-DOS Prompt.  The way to get to a MS-DOS Prompt is go to Start$\to$Run.  When the Run dialog pops up type &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; and press Enter (Note: don't type the ``quotation marks'', just type the stuff between them)  (Note two: type Enter after everything that I put in this &lt;code&gt;font&lt;/code&gt;).  A window titled MS-DOS Prompt should appear.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Type &lt;code&gt;cd \textbackslash{&lt;/code&gt;}.  The command &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; stands for change directory.  When &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; is followed by a &lt;code&gt;\textbackslash{&lt;/code&gt;} it means change to the root directory.  The &lt;code&gt;C:\textbackslash{&lt;/code&gt;&gt;} prompt tells you that you are in the root directory.  Once in the root directory the next task is to find Python.  --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Type &lt;code&gt;dir /s python.exe&lt;/code&gt;  This should give you some output like: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!--  Volume in drive C is WIN 95 --&gt;
&lt;!--  Volume Serial Number is 283F-12D9 --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Directory of C:\Program Files\Python --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- PYTHON   EXE         5,120  04-13-99 11:31a python.exe --&gt;
&lt;!--          1 file(s)          5,120 bytes --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Total files listed: --&gt;
&lt;!--          1 file(s)          5,120 bytes --&gt;
&lt;!--          0 dir(s)     344,498,176 bytes free --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The important part of this is the line: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Directory of C:\Program Files\Python --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- which shows the directory that &lt;code&gt;python.exe&lt;/code&gt; is located in. This can be used to create a &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable that allows &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; to be run from anywhere on the system.  The syntax is  &lt;code&gt;PATH=\%PATH\%;&quot;directory&quot;&lt;/code&gt; where directory is the directory that &lt;code&gt;python.exe&lt;/code&gt; is in.  For this example the command is: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- PATH=%PATH%;&quot;C:\Program Files\Python&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Type this in at the DOS Prompt and then you should be able to run Python with the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; command.  If you did everything right you should see (version numbers and dates may be different): --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Python 1.5.2 (#4, Dec 16 1999, 18:55:39)  [GCC 2.7.2.3] on Win 95 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- If you get the &lt;code&gt;$&gt;&gt;&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; prompt you have gotten into Python.  Try typing in it &lt;code&gt;print &quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  You should see &lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt; printed.  Try tying &lt;code&gt;print 1+1&lt;/code&gt;.  You should see &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; printed.  Type &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Z&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. type z while holding down the Ctrl key) to get out of Python's interactive mode.   --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- If there is some problem with the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; then you will see something like: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\&gt;python --&gt;
&lt;!-- Bad command or file name --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Right now the change you made is only temporary.  To get Python to be in the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; every time the computer starts you need to add it to the &lt;code&gt;autoexec.bat&lt;/code&gt; file.  The &lt;code&gt;autoexec.bat&lt;/code&gt; file is run every time the computer starts.  To do this open the &lt;code&gt;autoexec.bat&lt;/code&gt; in a text editor like &lt;code&gt;notepad&lt;/code&gt;.  Type the command &lt;code&gt;notepad c:\textbackslash{&lt;/code&gt;autoexec.bat} on the DOS Prompt.  If you don't have a &lt;code&gt;autoexec.bat&lt;/code&gt; notepad will ask you if you want to create one (say yes).  Add the line that you used above (i.e. something like: &lt;code&gt;PATH=\%PATH\%;&quot;C:\textbackslash{&lt;/code&gt;Program Files\textbackslash{}Python&quot;}) to the &lt;code&gt;autoexec.bat&lt;/code&gt;.  Add the line as close to the bottom as you can, just don't add the line after a line that tells windows to load: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- PATH=%PATH%;&quot;C:\Program Files\Python&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- win --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- The &lt;code&gt;win&lt;/code&gt; loads Windows so I added the path line above it.  If you don't see a &lt;code&gt;win&lt;/code&gt; line add the path line to the end.  Save the &lt;code&gt;autoexec.bat&lt;/code&gt; file, reboot your computer and it should be install. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- When your computer boots again go to the DOS Prompt and try to run &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; again to see if the change was successful. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- \subsection{Running Programs} --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Now that Python is set up we need to use it to run programs.  Go to a DOS Prompt (Start$\to$Run, then type &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt;).  Change to the root directory (&lt;code&gt;cd \textbackslash{&lt;/code&gt; }).  Now make a directory with the command &lt;code&gt;mkdir prg&lt;/code&gt; which makes the directory &lt;code&gt;prg&lt;/code&gt;.  Switch into that directory with the &lt;code&gt;cd prg&lt;/code&gt; command.  Create a file there by typing the &lt;code&gt;notepad hello.py&lt;/code&gt; command.  That will open a &lt;code&gt;notepad&lt;/code&gt; window.  In Notepad type: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;Hello, World!&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Save the file and then go back to the DOS Prompt.  Now type &lt;code&gt;python hello.py&lt;/code&gt; in at the DOS Prompt.  Python should reply with &lt;code&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/code&gt; if everything is working right.  If you get the error:  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Bad command or file name --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- check to see if the path is correct.  Also check to make sure that you spelled &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; correctly.  If you get the error: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- C:\PROGRA~1\PYTHON\PYTHON.EXE: can't open file 'hello.py' --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- check to see that you properly saved the &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; file and that you are in the correct directory. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Once you have that working create another file with the &lt;code&gt;notepad ask.py&lt;/code&gt; command.  Put the following text in the file: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- data = raw_input(&quot;Type something here:&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print &quot;You typed:&quot;,data --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Save and then run with the &lt;code&gt;python ask.py&lt;/code&gt; command.  The program should ask you to type in data and after you hit Enter it will tell you what you type.  You should get something like this: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- Type something here:Hi --&gt;
&lt;!-- You typed: Hi --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- If you got that, congratulations, you now have a working Python environment. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If a rigid body is initially at rest, it will remain at rest if and
only if the sum of all the forces and the sum of all the torques
acting on the body are zero. As an example, a mass balance with arms
of differing length is shown in figure above.

The balance beam is subject to three forces pointing upward or downward, the
tension ''T'' in the string from which the beam is suspended and the
weights ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;g and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;g exerted on the beam by the two suspended
masses. The parameter ''g'' is the local gravitational field and the
balance beam itself is assumed to have negligible mass. Taking upward
as positive, the force condition for static equilibrium is

:&lt;math&gt;T-M_1 g - M_2 g = 0 \quad \mbox{Zero net force}&lt;/math&gt;

Defining a counterclockwise torque to be positive, the torque balance
computed about the pivot point in figure 10.7
is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau=M_1 g d_1 - M_2 g d_2 = 0 \quad \mbox{Zero torque}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the lengths of the beam arms.

The first of the above equations shows that the tension in the
string
must be

:&lt;math&gt;T=\left( M_1 +M_2 \right) g&lt;/math&gt;

while the second shows that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1}{M_2}=\frac{d_1}{d_2} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the tension in the string is just equal to the weight of the
masses attached to the balance beam, while the ratio of the two masses
equals the inverse ratio of the associated beam arm lengths.</text>

==Themes==
*'''Adversity in early childhood''' is the most prevalent theme in the novel.  Ellen is faced with many problems including, but not limited to, the death of her mother and the sexual abuse of Ellen by her father.
*'''Self-identity''' is another theme present in the novel. Ellen changes her name to Foster because she has no real identity since she is moved around from foster home to foster home.
*Another theme is '''self-reliance and responsibility'''. Ellen is forced to fend for herself from an early age. It is amazing how she is able to handle so much responsibility.  Despite the many impediments she faces, she continues to cope.


==Ellen’s healing process==
To heal, Ellen should continue to create art. When Ellen creates art, it calms her and enables her to think more clearly. In addition, spending time with her friends and her new family is vital to Ellen's recovery.
Because Ellen likes to learn, it would be wise for her to seek knowledge by doing things such as reading books and attending classes.

*Page 88: ''&quot;That may not be the name God or my mama gave me but that is my name now. Ellen Foster. My old family wore the other name out and I figured I would take the name of my new family. That one is fresh. Foster. I told him all that.&quot;''
*Page 125: ''&quot;Starletta I always thought I was special because I was white and when I thought about you being colored I said to myself it sure is a shame Starletta's colored. I sure would hate to be that way. White people selling your mama's quilts like they do. And the three of you live in that house that's about to fall down. I always went away from your house wondering how you stood to live without a inside toilet. I know your daddy just put one in but you went a long time without one. Longer than any white folks I know. And when I thought about you I always felt glad for myself And now I don't know why. I really don't. And I just wanted to tell you that. You don't have to say anything back. You just lay there and wait for supper.&quot;''
*Page 25: ''&quot;Each month one of his brothers would bring him some cash money in an envelope and I would make sure I got to it before my daddyd did. They left it in the mailbox I guess because they did not think one of us was at home. I figured out what I needed and took it. You got the lights, gas to heat and cook, food, and extras. The people who sent the bills said do not send cash but at least I sent them the right change. I let him have the rest of the money and he would stock up so he would not have to worry.&quot;''

If we wiggle the left end of the spring in the above diagram by  amount ''d''=''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;sin &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F&lt;/sub&gt;t'',  rather than rigidly fixing it, we have a forced harmonic oscillator. 

The constant ''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of the imposed wiggling motion. The forcing frequency  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; is not necessarily equal to the natural or resonant frequency  of the mass-spring system. Very different behavior occurs depending on whether it is less than, equal to, or greater than &amp;omega;.

Given the above wiggling, the force of the spring on the mass becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;F = -k(x-d) = -k(x-d_0 \sin \omega_F t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

since the length of the spring is the difference between the positions of the left and right ends. Proceeding as for the unforced mass-spring system, we arrive at the differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{k}{M}x= \frac{k}{M}d_0 \sin \omega_F t&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation turns out to be the sum of a forced part in which ''x''&amp;prop; sin &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F&lt;/sub&gt;t'', and a free part which is the same as the solution to the unforced equation. We are primarily interested in the forced part of the solution, so let us set ''x''=''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;sin &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F&lt;/sub&gt;t''and substitute this into the equation of motion, giving:
	
:&lt;math&gt; -\omega_F^2 x_0 \sin \omega_F t + \frac{k}{M}x_0 \sin \omega_F t = \frac{k}{M}d_0 \sin \omega_F t &lt;/math&gt;

The sine factor cancels leaving us with an algebraic equation for , the amplitude of the oscillatory motion of the mass.

Solving for the ratio of the oscillation amplitude of the mass to the amplitude of the wiggling motion, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x_0}{d_0} = \frac{1}{1-M \omega_F^2/k} = \frac{1}{1-\omega_F^2/\omega^2} &lt;/math&gt;


where we have recognized that ''k''/''M''=&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the square of the frequency of the ''free'' oscillation. 

Notice that if &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;&amp;omega;, then the motion of the mass is in phase with the wiggling motion and the amplitude of the mass oscillation is greater than the amplitude of the wiggling. As the forcing frequency approaches the natural frequency of the oscillator, the response of the mass grows in amplitude. 

When the forcing is at the resonant frequency, the response is technically infinite, though practical limits on the amplitude of the oscillation will intervene in this case -- for instance, the spring cannot stretch or shrink an infinite amount. In many cases friction will act to limit the response of the mass to forcing near the resonant frequency. 

When the forcing frequency is greater than the natural frequency, the mass actually moves in the opposite direction of the wiggling motion -- i. e., the response is out of phase with the forcing. The amplitude of the response decreases as the forcing frequency increases above the resonant frequency.

Forced and free harmonic oscillators form an important part of many physical systems. For instance, any elastic material body such as a bridge or an airplane wing has harmonic oscillatory modes. A common engineering problem is to ensure that such modes are damped by friction or some other physical mechanism when there is a possibility of excitation of these modes by naturally occurring processes. A number of disasters can be traced to a failure to properly account for oscillatory forcing in engineered structures.</text>

== Fields and Forces ==

The forces caused by electric and magnetic fields are mostly what we can actually measure in electromagnetism. These vector quantities are related to the scalar and vector potentials as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

The '''E''' is the electric field vector, and the '''B''' is the magnetic field vector. Because of these equations, electric fields are frequently called &quot;E Fields&quot;, and magnetic fields are frequently called &quot;B Fields&quot;. This book may use either of these notations.

== Lorentz Equation ==

By comparison of these equations with the general expression for force in gauge theory, we find that the electromagnetic force on a particle with charge ''q'' is
			   			 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E} + q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''v''' is the velocity of the particle. For historical reasons this is called the ''Lorentz'' force.

== Relativity ==

Relativity is, in brief, the study of reference frames. A '''reference frame''' is a fixed coordinate system against which local measurements are taken. Consider the common example of two observers: Observer A is located on a moving train, and Observer B is standing in a field watching the train. Here is what the two observers see:

;Observer A: Observer A sees the train as being stationary, and the field as moving.
;Observer B: Observer B sees the field as stationary, and the train as moving.

Both observers are essentially the origin of their own coordinate system. Clearly, the two coordinate systems can be related together through some sort of '''transformation''', that is that things that Observer A can see can be translated into coordinates according to Observer B, and vice-versa.

In linear algebra, a coordinate system has a ''basis'', a small set of unit vectors that can be used to describe all the points in that system. If we can relate the basis vectors of Observer A and Observer B, then we can relate any point in either system to the other system.

Because basis vectors are vectors (rank-1 tensors), the transformations between them are typically matrices (rank-2 tensors).

Special Relativity is based on the idea that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames, and that the speed of light, ''c'', is a constant regardless of the frame. An equation is said to be &quot;Invariant under Lorentze Transformation&quot; if it satisfies these requirements when a lorentz transformation is applied to it. We will see that the requirement of lorentz invariance is an important one in electrodynamics.

Another subject, General Relativity, expands the mathematical ideas of relativity to non-inertial frames. We will not consider general relativity topics in this book.

== Lorentz Transformations ==

It is tempting, but naive, for us to consider only 3 basis vectors. These vectors, the spacial vectors, can be called without any lack of generality &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;. However, one of the important results from Einsteins work on relativity is that time is also dependant on the reference frame, and that therefore we need to consider all points in both space (X, Y, and Z vectors) but also in time (a T vector). All our vectors then have a length of 4, and our transformation matrices must be 4&amp;times;4 matrices. A 4&amp;times;4 transformation matrix that uses three spatial coordinates and 1 time coordinate is known as a '''lorentz transformation matrix''', or simply a &quot;lorentz transformation&quot;.

If we have two coordinate systems, (X, Y, Z, T), and (X', Y', Z', T') and they are '''non-inertial''' systems, we can relate the two systems using the '''L''' transformation functions:

:&lt;math&gt;X' = L_X(X)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y' = L_Y(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z' = L_Z(Z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T' = L_T(T)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if each element X', Y', Z', and T' are linearly related to X, Y, Z, and T, we can convert L into a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}X' \\ Y' \\ Z' \\ T'\end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{L}\begin{bmatrix}X \\ Y \\ Z \\ T\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

As we can see from this equation, if we are going to apply a Lorentz transformation to a coordinate system, the coordinates must be specified in vectors of length 4. We will call all vectors with a length of 4 a &quot;four vector&quot;. We will discuss four vectors in a later chapter.

== Inertial vs. Non-Inertial Frames ==

An inertial frame is a frame with no net acceleration. Consider the case above with the two observers, Observer A, and Observer B. Observer A is on a train, and Observer B is looking at the train from a distance. If the train is moving at a constant speed and in a straight line, then the two frames are inertial. However, if the train is accelerating or decelerating, or if the train is not moving in a straight line, then the two frames are non-inertial.

The study of inertial frames is a field known as [[Special Relativity]]. The study of non-inertial frames is known as [[General Relativity]]. In this book, we will consider special relativity only.

== Ohm's Law ==

The continuum form of Ohm's Law is only valid in the reference frame of the conducting material. If the material is moving at velocity '''v''' relative to a magnetic field '''B''', a term must be added as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \cdot \left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The analogy to the Lorentz force is obvious, and in fact Ohm's law can be derived from the Lorentz force and the assumption that there is a drag on the charge carriers proportional to their velocity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&quot;In this section we will begin by stating the basic equations of electromagnetism --in terms of the four-potential, valid in special relativity-- then see how this reduces to the simple rules governing electricity and magnetism we learnt in school.

:&quot;Approaching the subject this way means you will be aware of the appproximations in the simple rules.&quot;

Unlike like the standard approach, where every five chapters you say &quot;Sorry, what we told you earlier was only half-true. This is the real story.&quot;

Approaching the subject from this angle has advantages, especially as part of a unified treatment of modern physics (and it's the approach taken by the source text) so I'd suggest we try sticking to it. The traditional approach can be used in other wikibooks, giving the readers a chance to see which suits them best. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

== Maxwell's ==

Which chapter will cover Maxwells.
On another note, I just finished a first draft of Four-Potentials

== Discouraged Teaching Method ==

Teaching physics with this top-down approach should, in my opinion, be thoroughly discouraged for the following reasons:

1. It isn't really the top in the first place. At higher energy scales, electromagnetism seems to descend from the superstructure of Electroweak interactions as a low-energy limit. So, starting with four potentials would be a rather abrupt checkpoint of the theory to start with.

2. While it is true that the theory in terms of four potentials is mathematically elegant and forces an impression of inevitability, this formalism is invisible to many physical possibilites such as that of the magnetic monopole. A person studying the EM formalism through four potentials loses the chance to think about such possibilities or what experiments could be done to detect them.

3. Physics is an emperical science. It is dictated by experiment. Close correspondences between experimental findings and some mathematical structures lend those mathematical structures temporary importance in our understanding of the physical world. To begin a discussion of electromagnetism (aimed at the lay reader / sophomore visiting Wiki) with head-in-the-air formalism that aims to descend and explain all electromagnetic phenomena will deprive people of real reasons for the development of electric and magnetic fields to explain phenomena in the world. Otherwise, all the A's and F's are just an academic exercise in mental gymnastics.

4. The four potential, in quantum electrodynamics, leads to some rather knotty problems of gauge fixing (solved, but rather messily). This gauge freedom in A and its messy fixing in QED lead us to believe that we lack a respectable gauge free notation of electrodynamics.

I suspect that you might have had a largely mathematics based background going into electromagnetism because I see that you try to start from Lorentz invariance etc and are struck by its mathematical simplicity. You could also, begin from the deeper quantum theory of electrodynamics of A and descend to explain all physical phenomena pretty successfully. That will be the best picture we have so far, but at what cost to the general reader or curious character? However, if you still wish to expound EM top down, I would suggest looking for a two form of A to make a Lorentz invariant Lagrangian and proceed down. 

I believe this is a thorougly misguided approach to teaching anything, and will potentially befuddle the general reader instead of providing him with an honest understanding of what we know and how we know.

===Response===

I agree with you but came to help this wikibook after the format was already laid out. If you read my Four Potential stuff you'll probably note that I keep throwing off telling people to study the rest first. If you would like to suggest a better format here, I would be most pleased to implement it after a vote.

== Section Structure ==

I've been trying to contribute to these pages, and I am finding that their structure is inconducive to adding material in any kind of sensible progression. Starting the discussion off with electromagnetic four-potential is a strange idea (at best), especially considering the book hasnt even discussed elementary currents or potentials before hand. I've rearranged some of the existing pages into a progression that (i feel) will be better and more straight-forward for a reader without much familiarity with the subject. However, despite my best efforts at rearranging, I can't quite seem to make pages line up to provide material in a good order. Therefore, I am going to propose an outline for a proposed new architecture to this section, and I would like to get some questions/comments on this before I do it:

*Introduction
**required maths (vectors, del, flux, divergance, curl, spherical coordinates, etc...)
*Electrostatics
**Coulomb's Law
**E-Field
**Gauss' Law
**Conservation of E-Field (Electric potential, charge distribution energy)
**Capacitance
*Relativity
**Michelson-Morley Experiment
**Lorentz Transformation
**Four-Vectors
**Magentic Fields 
**E and B fields as Tensors
*Maxwell's Equations
*Magnetostatics
**Ohms Law
**Biot-Savart's Law
**Ampere's Law
**Magentization
*Mechanics
**Force and Torque by E and B fields, etc.
**Motions and interactions of charged particles
**Larmor Precession
**Magnetic Stress Tensors
*Variation with Time
**Faraday's Law
**Poynting Vector
**Displacement Current
**Four-Vectors changing in Time

This is, I think, a good way to integrate all the material into a straight-forward precession. I can think of some things that can definately be moved around, however. I ask anybody who knows about this material to help out and make comments/suggestions on this outline, because I would like to start moving/renaming/deleting pages here to make things better ASAP. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:21, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

I would suggest moving relativity towards the bottom of the list and looking at Mechanics of Electricity directly after Electrostatics. From there Magnetism would come in as allegory to electricity, which seems to work well. I've just finished taking a class in this (PH 212/252 at most colleges), and this was the general layout. Essentially, this stuff is confusing as all get out, and it's somewhat easier to tackle if you do it one idea at a time and build slowly. Since magnetism behaves so similarly to electricity, it seems much easier to study it after one has some knowledge of electricity.

--[[User:Thatnerdyguy|Thatnerdyguy]] 15:40, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with you, i think. Although, the [[Special Relativity]] chapter of this book occurs before this chapter, so readers should have some background knowledge of it. This subject is sufficiently difficult, however, and maybe we should just push it off till the end. Magnetism is best learned (from my experiance as well) as an allegory for electricity, so we can worry about that second-to-last. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:36, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

== Rename  ==

This page needs to be renamed to '''electromagnetism'''... because it speaks not only of electrodynamics, but also electrostatic. ''[[:pt:User:Raylton P. Sousa|Raylton P.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section should cover charge, voltage, and current at the least.  Will also probably include some items from Electronics Overview (which is really more of a glossary, and overlaps with the definitions in the appendix.)

== Charge ==

I moved everything about charge over to a new chapter called [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]].  Electric field, an introductory section on Energy, Electric potential energy, Electric potential, Voltage, Current, and Power are discussed in this chapter, most of which I wrote.  I plan to change the title of this chapter to Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power.  &quot;Charge and Coulomb's Law&quot; would be the first chapter and this chapter would be the second chapter.  The &quot;Electric Field&quot; section could stay here or be moved to the end of the &quot;Charge and Coulomb's Law&quot; chapter, whatever it would take to even the length of the first two chapters out.

== Electric Field ==

Interesting that [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] added the &quot;Electric Field&quot; section here to [[Electronics/Basic_Concepts]] (on 30 Jun 2004), only 2 days after I (on 28 Jun 2004) added the &quot;Electric Field&quot; section to
[[GCSE Science/Current, voltage resistance and Ohm's law]].

Great minds think alike, eh ?

On any other wiki, I would try to merge the best parts of both explanations into one single explanation. Hopefully the merged explanations is better than either original.

On the other hand, instead of repeating the same paragraph over and over, some teachers like to have several very different-sounding explanations of the same thing -- some students will &quot;get&quot; the first explanation right off, and repeating it again won't help the other students.

Should I merge these E field descriptions ?

Then the index of several different wikibooks could link to one merged explanation. That would be similar to the way that so many books dealing with computers re-print the same ASCII table.

== Reply to DavidCary remark on two different sections on electric field ==

I, [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]], have read your relatively new section on Electric Field in &quot;Current, ....(GSCE science).&quot;   The sentence stating:

The &quot;electric field&quot; indicates how much force (in Newtons), and in what direction, is required to hold that particle in place, divided by the charge of that particle.

seemed a little awkward because it was not clear that &quot;is required&quot; is the verb for the subject &quot;force.&quot;  Therefore, I made a slight modification to make it sound a little better.  
I also modified the sentence about [if the particle just &quot;sits&quot; there, there is no electric field in that location].  A particle could &quot;sit&quot; there because some opposing reactive force(s) could balance out the electric force, even though the electric field is not zero.  

The &quot;Electronics&quot; book is different from the GSCE book.    The GSCE book is a fairly simple book for 14-16 year olds, students in first couple years of high school without a strong mathematics background.  The simple explanation on Electric Field there is adequate for them.  The &quot;Electronics&quot; book, however, is intended to be somewhat more advanced and comprehensive with a higher degree of math ability assumed, although the use of calculus, I anticipate, will be kept to a minimum.  I think it is intended for a college student's or adult's electrical course, or at least an upper level high school electronics (or maybe physics) course.  I have, nevertheless, tried to keep unnecessarily complicated theory out of the book, such as electric field equations derived from Coulomb's Law, especially on the grounds that many electrical engineers do not use such equations in practice.  I do not intend to dwell on electric field further in the &quot;Electronics&quot; book.  

My recommendation is to keep both these discussions on electric field separate the way they are in their respective books.   [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 03:38, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Definitions ==

Instead of linking to an article like [[volt]], we should link to the definitions page, like [[Electronics/Definitions|volt]].  Unfortunately, getting it to go right to the appropriate definition will require us to turn all the definition tags into subsection tags, like this: [[Electronics/Definitions#Volt|volt]].  Anyone know of a better way? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:56, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

== Basic Understanding ==

Experiments show us that electric point charges attract or repel as calculated by Coulomb's law.  Integrating (summing) over a distribution of points charges as they are assembled into a specific system configuration allows us to determine a scalar value defined as the electrical potential or electric field of a specific point.  This mathematical definition is very useful in electronics circuit theory.


'''Voltage'''

:The potential difference between two test points resulting from the distribution of charge in the circuit, usually measured in volts.

'''Current'''

:Net amount of charge (coulombs) (number of electrons x electron charge) flowing past a specified point during a time interval (seconds), usually measured in Amps (1 Amp = 1 coulomb / 1 second).  In typical components and systems the quantity of electrons is quite large and the aggregate charge flow is referred to as electricity.

'''Power'''

:Energy given in a certain amount of time, usually measured in watts.

'''Law of Charges'''

:Opposite charges attract while similar charges repel.

'''Inductance'''

:When electricity passes through a wire it creates a moving magnetic field around the wire.  The typical unit of measure is Henrys.

'''Capacitance'''

:When electric fields or charge distributions are created in a physical system that stores recoverable energy, characteristics of the physical components which affect calculation of the electrical quantities are defined as capacitance.  The base unit of measure is Farads, however microfarads (μF), are used much more often.

'''Resistance'''

:When potential difference creates movement of electrons between two points, some of the potential energy formerly available in the system is irreversibly transferred from the electric field or the electrons moving through the component via collisions with atoms and molecules within the material.  Ohm's Law, V=IR, defines resistance as R=V/I where V is the voltage difference applied across the component, I is the resulting current flow in Amps, and R is a constant created by characteristics of the component which is calculated from the measured voltage loss of the measured current passing through the component.

===Electric Field===

A charged particle such as a proton or electron may &quot;feel&quot; an electrical force on it in a certain environment.  This  force is typically due to the presence of other charges nearby.  The force will have a direction and magnitude, and can be represented by a vector. (A vector is simply a quantity that represents the direction and magnitude of something.) The magnitude of the force depends on the charge of the particle, the charge on the particles around it, and how close or far away they are: Highly charged particles close to each other exert heavy forces on each other; if the charges are less, or they are farther apart, the force is less.  The direction of the force depends on the location of the surrounding charges.

In describing the electrical environment at that location , it is said there is an '''electric field''' at that location.  The electric field is defined as the force  that a single unit of charge  would feel at that location.
In some systems of measurement, the unit of charge is the charge of a single  proton; in others it is the coulomb. A coulomb is the charge of 6.24&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;
protons

The relationship between force and electric field for a single charged particle is given by the following equation:
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{F}/q
&lt;/math&gt;

The bold letters indicate vector quantities.  This means that a charge q, in an electric field '''E''', having a certain direction and a magnitude E, would have a force '''F''' on it, in the same direction and with a magnitude F.  Considering only the magnitudes, the following would result from the definition.

     E = F/q    these are all magnitudes or numerical quantities

The net electric field '''E''', at a location is due to the presence of all other charges nearby, similar to the net electric force '''F''', if there was a charge q at that location.  The contribution of one of these other charges to the total (or net) electric field is a vector '''E''' contribution, which for a point charge can be derived from [[w:Coulomb's Law|Coulomb's Law]].  Distributions of charge density in various shapes may also yield vector '''E''' contributions to the total electric field, to be added in as vector quantities.  Practically speaking, most electricians, electrical engineers, and other electrical circuit builders and hobbyists seldom do these sorts of electric field calculations.  Electric field calculations of this sort are more of a theoretical physics or special applications problem, so these calculations are omitted here in favor of more applicable material.  See [[w:Electric Field|Electric Field]] for such information on electric field formulas.  

There is an electrical force on a charge only if there is a charge subject to the force at a location in an electric field.  However, even if there is no such charge subject to the force, there could still be an electric field at a point.  This means that an electric field is a property of a location or point in space and its electrical environment, which would determine what a charge q would &quot;feel&quot; if it were there.

===Energy===

Now, a micro-physics review: [[w:Work|Work]] is causing displacement (or movement) of an object or matter against a force.  '''Energy''' is the ability to perform work like this.  Energy can be kinetic energy or potential energy.  [[w:Kinetic energy|Kinetic energy]] is the energy a mass has because it is moving.  [[w:Potential energy|Potential energy]] in an object, in matter, in a charge or other situation has the ability to perform work or to be converted into kinetic energy or a different kind of potential energy.  

A reason why a particle or a charge may have potential energy could be because it is located at a point in a force field, such as a gravitational field, electric field, or magnetic field.  In the presence of such a field, gravity or electric or magnetic forces could cause the particle or charge to move faster or move against resistive forces, representing a conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy or work.  The amount of potential energy it has would depend on its location.  Moving from one location to another could cause a change in its potential energy.  &lt;br&gt;For example, an object near the surface of the earth placed high would have a certain amount of gravitational potential energy based on its mass, location (height or altitude) in and strength of the Earth's gravitational field.  If the object were to drop from this location (height) to a new lower location, at least some of its gravitational potential energy would be converted to kinetic energy, resulting in the object moving down.  The difference in gravitational potential energy could be calculated from one location to another, but determining the absolute potential energy of the object is arbitrary, so ground level is chosen arbitrarily as the height where its gravitational potential energy equals zero.  The potential energy at all other heights is determined from the mass of the object, location relative to the ground level, and strength of the gravitational field.  

All energy values are numerical or scalar quantities, not vectors.

===Electric Potential Energy===

Somewhat similarly, a charged particle at a certain point or location in an electrical environment (i. e. an electric field) would have a certain amount of '''electric potential energy''' based on its charge, location, and the electric field there, which could be based on quantity and locations of all other charges nearby.  If the charge were to move from this location to a new location or point, it could cause a change in its electric potential energy.  This difference in electric potential energy in the charge particle would be proportional to its charge and it could be an increase or a decrease.  From measurements and calculations, one may be able to determine this difference in electric  potential energy, but coming up with an absolute figure for its potential is difficult and typically not necessary.  Therefore, in a manner somewhat similar to gravitational potential energy, an arbitrary location or point nearby, often somewhere in the electric circuit in question, is chosen to be the point where the electric potential energy would be zero, if the charge were there.  Often the wiring, circuit, or appliance will be connected to the ground, so this ground point is often chosen to be the zero point.  The electric potential energy at all other points is determined relative to the ground level.  The [[w:SI|SI]] unit of '''electric potential energy''' is the [[w:Joule|'''joule''']].

===Electric Potential===

Because the electric potential energy of a charged particle (or object) is proportional to its charge and otherwise simply dependent on its location (point where it's at), a useful value to use is electric potential.  '''Electric potential''' (symbolized by ''V'') at a point is defined as the electric potential energy (PE) per unit positive charge (''q'') that a charge would have at that given point (location).  At a point ''a'', the electric potential at ''a'' is given by:

                      ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = (PE of charge at ''a'')/''q''

Somewhat analogously to an electric field, electrical potential is a property of a location and the electrical conditions there, whether or not there is a charge present there subject to these conditions.  On the other hand, electric potential energy is more analogous to electric force in that for it to be present, there should be a subject charged particle or object which has that energy.  Electric potential is often simply called '''potential''' by physicists.  Because the SI unit of electric potential energy is the joule and because the SI unit of charge is the coulomb, the SI unit for electric potential, the '''volt''' (symbolized by V), is defined as a joule per coulomb (J/C).  

Because electric potential energy is based on an arbitrary point where its value is set at as zero, the value of electric potential at a given point is also based on this same arbitrary zero point (reference point where the potential is set at zero).  The potential at a given point ''a'' is then the difference between potentials from point ''a'' to the zero point, often called a '''ground''' node (or just ground).  

Calculations of electric potential energy or electric potential based on Coulomb's Law are sometimes theoretically possible, such as might be for electric field calculations, but again these are of mostly theoretical interest and not often done in practical applications.  Therefore, such calculations are also omitted here in favour of more applicable material.  

Often it is of interest to compare the potentials at two different points, which we may call point ''a'' and point ''b''.  Then the '''electric potential difference''' between points ''a'' and ''b'' (''V&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'') would be defined as the electric potential at ''b'' minus the electric potential at ''a''.

                         ''V&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''

The unit for electric potential difference is the volt, the same as for electric potential.  Electric potential difference is often simply called '''potential difference''' by physicists.  Under [[w:Direct current|direct current]] (DC) conditions and at any one instant in time under [[w:Alternating current|alternating current]] (AC), potential and potential difference are numerical or scalar quantities, not vectors, and they can have positive or negative values.

===Voltage===

'''Voltage''' is electric potential expressed in volts.  Similarly, potential difference expressed in volts is often called '''voltage difference''' or often referred to as voltage across two points or across an electrical component.  The terms electric potential, potential, and potential difference are terms more often used by physicists.  Since these quantities are almost always expressed in volts (or some related unit such as millivolts), engineers, electricians, hobbyists, and common people usually use the term voltage instead of potential.  Furthermore, in practical applications, electrical force, electric field, and electrical potential energy of charged particles are not discussed nearly as often as voltage, power, and energy in a macroscopic sense.  

Additional note: The following explains why voltage is &quot;analogous&quot; to the pressure of a fluid in a pipe (although, of course, it is only an analogy, not exactly the same thing), and it also explains the strange-sounding &quot;dimensions&quot; of voltage. Consider the potential energy of compressed air being pumped into a tank. The energy increases with each new increment of air. Pressure is that energy divided by the volume, which we can understand intuitively. Now consider the energy of electric charge (measured in coulombs) being forced into a capacitor. Voltage is that energy per charge, so voltage is analogous to a pressure-like sort of forcefulness. Also, dimensional analysis tells us that voltage (&quot;energy per charge&quot;) is charge per distance, the distance being between the plates of the capacitor. (More discussion is on page 16 of &quot;Industrial Electronics,&quot; by D. J. Shanefield, Noyes Publications, Boston, 2001.)

====Frequency====

When an electric circuit is operating in [[w:Direct Current|Direct Current]] ([[w:DC|DC]]) mode, all voltages and voltage differences in the circuit are typically constant (do not vary) with time.  When a circuit is operating under [[w:Alternating Current|Alternating Current]] ([[w:AC|AC]]) conditions, the voltages in the circuit vary periodically with time; the voltages are a sinusoidal function of time, such as V(t) = a sin (b t)  with constant a and b, or some similar function.  The number of times the period repeats (or &quot;cycles&quot;) per unit time is called the [[w:Frequency|frequency]] of V(t).  Under DC conditions or at any one instant in time under AC, potential (or voltage) and potential difference (or voltage difference) are numerical or scalar quantities, not vectors, and they can have positive or negative values.  However, in AC mode, the overall function of voltage with time V(t), can be expressed as a complex number or a phasor for a given frequency.  The frequency can be expressed in cycles per second or simply sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is called '''Hertz''' (Hz) in SI units.  Typical commercial electric power provided in the United States is AC at a frequency of 60 Hz.

====Ground====

Ground is shown on electronics diagrams, but it isn't really a component.  It is simply the node which has been assigned a voltage of zero.  It is represented by one of the symbols below.  Technically, ''any'' single node can be assigned as ground, and other voltages are measured relative to it.  However, the convention is to only assign it in one of two ways, related to the type of power supply.  In a single supply situation, such as a circuit powered by a single battery, the ground point is usually defined as the more negative of the power source's terminals.  This makes all voltages in the circuit positive with respect to ground (usually), and is a common convention.  For a split-supply device, such as a circuit driven by a center-tapped transformer, usually the center voltage is defined as ground, and there are equal and roughly symmetrical positive and negative voltages in the circuit.

;Signal ground : Ground for a signal.  Since wires have a certain amount of resistance to them, ground points in a circuit aren't all at exactly the same voltage.  It is important in practical circuit design to separate the power supply ground from the signal ground from the shielding ground, etc.  In circuits where minimum noise is especially important, power regulator circuitry should have thick wires or traces connecting the grounds, in a sequence from the power supply to the &quot;cleanest&quot; ground at the output of the filters of the power supply, which will then be a &quot;star point&quot; for the grounds of the signal circuitry.

;Chassis ground : A direct connection to the chassis of the device.  This is used for EMI shielding and also for safety ground in line AC powered devices.

;Earth ground : Used in radio or power distribution systems, a connection to the earth itself.  Also the other end of the connection for the safety ground, since the power line voltage will seek a path through the earth back to the power line supply station.  This was the original usage of the word &quot;ground&quot;, and the more modern meaning of the word would have been called a &quot;floating ground&quot;.  

The earth ground symbol and signal ground symbol are often interchanged without regard to their original meanings.  As far as signal-level electronics (and this book) is concerned, ground almost always means a signal ground or floating ground, not connected to the earth itself.

===Current===

''Electric current'', often called just current, is the movement of charge in a conductor (such as a wire) or into, out of, or through an electrical component.  Current is quantified as a rate of positive charge movement past a certain point or through a cross-sectional area.  Simply put, current is quantified as positive charge per unit time.  However, since current is a vector quantity, the direction in which the current flows is still important.  Current flow in a given direction can be positive or negative; the negative sign means that positive charges move opposite of the given direction.  The quantity of current at a certain point is typically symbolized by a capital or small letter I with a designation which direction the current I is moving.  The [[w:SI|SI]] unit of current is the [[w:Ampere|ampere]] (A), one of the [[w:Fundamental unit|fundamental units]] of physics.  See [[w:Ampere|ampere]] for the definition of ampere.  Sometimes, ampere is informally abbreviated to amp.  The definition of a [[w:Coulomb|coulomb]] (C), the SI unit of charge, is based on an ampere.  A coulomb is the amount of positive charge passing a point when a constant one ampere current flows by the point for one second.  The '''second''' is the SI unit of time.  In other words, a coulomb equals an ampere-second (A&amp;middot;s).  An ampere is a coulomb per second (C/s).  

====Conventional Current====

Typically, current is in a metal and constitutes movement of electrons which have negative charge; however, people initially thought that current had a positive charge.  The result is that even though current is the flow of negative electrons and flows from the negative to the positive terminal of a battery, when people do circuit analysis they pretend that current is a flow of positive particles and flows from the positive to the negative terminal of a battery (or other power source).  Actually, it is more complicated than this, since current can be made up of electrons, holes, ions, protons, or any charged particle.  Since the actual charge carriers are usually ignored when analyzing a circuit, current is simplified and thought of as flowing from positive to negative, and is known as conventional current.  

Analogy to pebble tossing: I have pebbles and I am throwing them into a basket.  In doing this the basket gains pebbles and I lose pebbles.  So there is a negative current of pebbles to the basket because it is gaining pebbles, and there is a positive current of pebbles to me because I am losing pebbles.  In pebble tossing the currents have equal strength but in opposite directions.

Current ''I'' is represented in amperes (A) and equals ''x'' number of ''y''

===Power===

Power is energy per unit of time.  The SI unit for power is the '''watt''' (W) which equals a '''joule per second''' (J/s), with joule being the SI unit for '''energy''' and second being the SI unit for '''time'''.  When somebody plugs an appliance into a receptacle to use electricity to make that appliance function, that person provides electrical energy for the appliance.  The appliance usually functions by turning that electrical energy into heat, light, or work &amp;mdash; or perhaps converts it into electrical energy again in a different form.  If this situation is ongoing, it is said that the receptacle or electric power company delivers power to the appliance.  The current from the receptacle going in and out of the appliance effectively carries the power and the appliance absorbs the power.

Multiplying a unit of power by a unit of time would result in a unit that represents a quantity of energy.  Therefore, multiplying a kilowatt by an hour gives a kilowatt-hour (kW&amp;middot;h), a unit often used by electrical power companies to represent an amount of electrical energy generated or provided to consumers.

For direct current (DC), power ''P'' can be calculated by multiplying the voltage and current, when they are known.  
                      ''P'' = ''V'' ''I''

Note that energy/charge is multiplied by charge/time to give energy/time.  At any one point in time t in alternating current (AC) circuitry, power P(t) equals voltage V(t) times current I(t).  
          P(t) = V(t) I(t) at any one time t

Calculations of AC power averaged over time will be discussed under AC power.

==Circuit==

An electronic '''circuit''' is a system in which conventional current flows from the positive terminal of a source, through a load, to the negative terminal of the source.
But the current will only flow when there is a closed path from the positive to negative terminal. If there is a discontinuity or an open circuit in its path, the current will not flow and hence the circuit will be non functional.
The current does not flow since the open circuit acts like an infinite resistance.

===Short Circuit===
[[Image:Electronics_Short.PNG]]

A short circuit is another name for a node, although it usually means an unintentional node.  Has current through it but no voltage across it.

===Open Circuit===
[[Image:Electronics_Open.PNG]]

Has potential across it but no current through it.

===Properties of wires===

Theoretical circuit connection (wire) has no resistance or inductance. Real wires always have voltage over them if there is current flowing through them (resistance). On high frequencies there are measurable voltage potentials over wire links if there is flowing alternating current through wires (inductance like in inductors).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transcription, comments, theories, links to do with VMs page f1r to be added here... :-)

== Description: ==

This page contains four paragraphs (with 4.6, 2.4, 9.5, 5.5 lines, respectively), each followed by a short right-justified &quot;title&quot;. ''(Note to self: link this to a page discussing &quot;titles&quot;)''

Paragraphs 2 and 3 begin with big &quot;weirdo&quot; doodles, very unlike normal Voynichese letters. The first (EVA &amp;252) looks like a capital K lying on it side, with the vertical bar at the bottom; it could be said to resemble a bird with its wings outspread. The second (EVA &amp;253) looks similar to the first, with an extra squiggly line rising from between the two &quot;horns&quot;. The two symbols are drawn or painted with flaring strokes ending in swallowtail serifs.

A 1-inch band along the right margin is heavily stained. There seem to be two or three columns of letters (&quot;key like sequences&quot; in that band, which are barely visible in the reproductions

There is a faint unreadable text at the top of the page, apparently in cursive handwriting.

== Comments: ==

This page starts both Quire 1 and the whole manuscript. Many of the VMs' mysterious features - such as right-justified &quot;titles&quot;, mysterious marginalia, deliberate (yet curious) page-structure, rare one-off characters, etc - are to be found here.

The page layout suggests four quotes with attributions, or signed endorsements, or perhaps descriptive summaries of sections that follow.

The faint scribbling at the top is the signature of Jacobus de Tepenecz, as asserted in many references.

Jim Reeds writes [15 Jul 94]: &quot;The erased key on f1r is discussed by Brumbaugh. It seems to have 3 vertical columns of letters. The leftmost is the ordinary alphabet, lower case italic hand, a through z. I could not check for the presence of every letter (I'm not sure about j, for instance) but a, b, c, ... o, p, q, r, s, ... y, z are pretty clear. Next to those are very spotty frags of Voynich letters. I could make out &lt;8&gt; next to a, &lt;R&gt; next to c, &lt;6&gt; next to y, and one of the gallows letters somewhere near the q, r, s range. [...] The 3d column seems to be 1 off from the first: italic miniscules, r next to s, and so on. More is visible in UV shots than Petersen shows.&quot;

Brumbaugh reportedly claims that there was a date in the upper right corner of f1r before it was obliterated by the application of chemicals (intended to reveal faded writing).

D'Imperio says that the &quot;weirdo&quot; characters EVA &amp;252/&amp;253 are in bright red ink; confirmed by Glen Claston [20 Feb 1998] and Jim Reeds [03 Mar 1998].

Rene [28 Jul 1997] found a medieval astrological diagram [1], in Greek, where EVA &amp;252 is used as a symbol for Aries, which is &quot;kruos&quot; or &quot;kryos&quot; in Greek.

Stolfi suggested [07 Aug 1998] that the symbols may be abbreviations for &quot;Koenig&quot; and &quot;KoenigiN&quot; --- i.e. &quot;K&quot; and &quot;K&quot;-with-squiggle. ''(How desperate can you get?)''

It also seems highly likely that f12 was cut out '''after''' the folios were numbered: I think it's reasonably safe to conclude that this page was cut out by a later owner. Perhaps by examining the technology used to perform the cut, we may be able to get an idea of who cut it out! However, whether this is the page (from North Wales) described by Paul Floyd in 2003 is another question entirely...

[[File:Koeksisters.JPG|thumb]]
{{wikipedia|Koeksister}}

A '''koeksister''' is a piece of dough, usually in the shape of a plait, that is deep fried in oil and then dipped in a cold syrup mixture. If you keep your oil hot and the syrup very cold you get the perfect koeksister - crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft, moist and syrupy on the inside. Koeksisters are very rich and are usually served as a special treat or kept for festive occasions. Making koeksisters is time-consuming and labour-intensive (another reason why it is not often made in modern day homes), so plan ahead to set a night and day aside for making this delicious treat. The syrup is made the night before to chill in the refrigerator in two containers. While making the koeksisters one of the containers is kept chilled in the refrigerator, to replace the other container of syrup when it heats up after a few batches of the fried dough have been dipped into the first container of syrup. If the syrup isn't cold the dough won't soak up the syrup and you will end up with a dry koeksister.

== Syrup ==
=== Ingredients ===
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]];
* 500ml (2 cups) water;
* 3cm long piece of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (peeled and bruised) and a few slices of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], or;
* 2-3 sticks of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]];
* 1ml (pinch) cream of tartar;
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].
2 1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice

=== Procedure ===
# Put into a saucepan and bring to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]], stirring until the sugar has dissolved. 
# Turn the heat down and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for 5-8 minutes. 
# Cool the syrup to room temperature. 
# Divide it into 2 saucepans and place in the refrigerator to chill overnight.

== Dough ==
=== Ingredients === 
* 240 g [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 4 teaspoons (20ml) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 tablespoons (30ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 125ml (half cup) [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] '''or''' soured milk '''or''' water and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice

=== Procedure ===
# Sift together flour, baking powder, salt.
# Rub in butter.
# Add buttermilk.
# Mix into a soft dough and knead thoroughly. (It helps if you oil your hands lightly when starting to knead the dough.)
# Cover the dough with a damp cloth and leave dough to rest for 15 minutes.
# Roll the dough out to a thickness of 5mm and cut into strips 5mm wide and 70mm long (half a cm x 7cm). Press the ends of two or three strips together and twist or plait, press the ends together again. Keep the dough you are not working with covered with a damp cloth.
# [[Cookbook:Deep fry|Deep fry]] in hot [[Cookbook:Oil_and_fat|oil]] until golden brown on both sides.
# Remove with a slotted spoon and dip the pieces immediately in the ice cold syrup.
# Remove and place the koeksisters on a wire rack so that the excess syrup can drain.

Store the koeksisters in a sealed container in the refrigerator. They freeze well and can be served straight from the freezer.

This recipe will yield approx. 3 doz (85g) dainty sized koeksisters - you can make them bigger for a more substantial treat.

== Description: ==

One plant centered on page. 

: Root: a knobby, warped, pancake-like tuber with  short roots attached like claws or fangs  all around the rim. Light color.

: Stem: thick, well drawn. Light color.

: Branches: one straight up, two oblique with drooping tips.

: Leaves: broad lance-shape, with two short tails.

: Stalk: short.

: Flowers: one, growing at the tip of the center branch.  

: Stalk: very short.

: Chalyx: conical, continuous with petals.  Petals: short rounded, light-colored.  Core: hemispherical, dark-colored (could be a berry; see below).

Two paragraphs (with 3.8 and 5.8 lines), just below mid-page, left- and right-justified, interrupted by the plant's main stem.

== Comments: ==

Part of this drawing (root and leaves only) is repeated on Pharma page [[f102r1]][3,2].

The plant looks basically normal, except for the very peculiar root.

Petersen identifies the plant as &quot;Solanum Solatrium, Belladonna&quot; specifically the &quot;flower&quot;.  He says: &quot;see L.Fuchs p.398&quot;.  There is no &quot;Solanum solatrium&quot;; rather, &quot;solatrium&quot; is an ancient (Dioscoridean) name for some or all of these species:

'''Solanum dulcamara (bittersweet)'''

http://www.runeberg.org/nordflor/109.html

and perhaps other somewhat less likely species such as Withania somnifera and Physalis alkekengi. 

The leaves of f1v seem most compatible those of Atropa belladonna (shape) and Hyoscyamus niger (attachment to stem), and the &quot;flower&quot; at the top of f1v does resemble the sheathed, shiny black fruits of these two species.

However, A.beladonna's root has been described as a roundish rhizome with a long (up to 1m) tapering root, which does not seem to match the highly distinctive &quot;pancake with claws&quot; of f1v.  I have found no image or description of the other plants' roots.

A very similar root, with quite different leaves, can be seen on another Italian herbal: 

University of Vermont Library MS 2, fol. 39 (ca. 1500)

http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/biomed/his/immi/vm9437.htm

The medieval text calls that plant &quot;Gran[i]a maggiore&quot;.  The modern commentary tentatively identifies it with

'''Ecballium elaterium (Squirting Cucumber)'''

http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/mi10/mi10043.jpg 

However the leaves do not match, and the flower barely so.  I have found no image or description of E.elaterium's roots.

All four plants are poisonous in varying degrees. The active principles can be absorbed by smoking or through the skin as well as by ingestion.  They were used as potent psychoactive drugs, causing paralysis of involuntary muscles, dizziness, sleep, hallucinations, violent behavior, etc., and have been often associated with witchcraft.

We often encounter systems which contain multiple harmonic oscillators, such as this:

[[Image:CoupledOscillators.png]]

two identical masses, ''m'', the first attached to a wall by a spring with constant ''k'', and the second attached to the first by another, identical spring.

If the springs weren't linked they'd both vibrate at the same frequency, &amp;omega;=&amp;radic;(''k''/''m''). Linking the springs changes this.

To find out how the linked system behaves, we will start with the Lagrangian, using the displacements of the masses, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as our coordinates.

A moment's inspection of the system shows

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2_1 + \dot{x}^2_2 \right) \quad
V=\frac{1}{2}k \left( x_1^2 + (x_2-x_1)^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

so, using &amp;omega;&amp;sup2;=''k''/''m'',

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2_1 + \dot{x}^2_2 \right) - 
\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 \left( x_1^2 + (x_2-x_1)^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The equations of motion immediately follow.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\ddot{x}_1 &amp; = &amp; -\omega^2 (2x_1 -x_2) \\
\ddot{x}_2 &amp; = &amp; -\omega^2 (x_2 -x_1)
\end{matrix} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

To solve these equations we try a solution in trig functions 
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = A_1 \sin \Omega t \quad x_2 = A_2 \sin \Omega t &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into (1) gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 -\Omega^2 A_1 &amp; + &amp; \omega^2 (2A_1-A_2) &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
 -\Omega^2 A_2 &amp; + &amp; \omega^2 (A_2-A_1) &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

We would get the same equations from any trig function solution of the same frequency.

Gathering the coefficients of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; together lets rewrite the last equation as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 2\omega^2-\Omega^2 &amp; -\omega^2 \\
-\omega^2 &amp; \omega^2-\Omega^2 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

We can only solve this equation if the determinant of the matrix is zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^4-3\omega^2 \Omega^2 + \omega^4 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions are 

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_{\pm}^2=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5} }{2} \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

so the combined system has two natural frequencies, one lower and one higher than the natural frequency of the individual springs. This is typical.

We can also calculate the ratio of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from (2). Dividing by ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A_1}{A_2}= 1-\frac{\Omega_{\pm}^2}{\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;

*For the lower frequency, &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;, which is less than &amp;omega;, the ratio is positive, so the two masses move in the same direction with different amplitudes. They are said to be ''in phase''.

*For the higher frequency, &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, which is more than &amp;omega;, the ratio is negative, so the two masses move in the opposite direction with different amplitudes. They are said to be ''in antiphase''.

This behaviour is typical when pairs of harmonic oscillators are coupled.

The same approach can also be used for systems with more than two particles.</text>

'''Internet Relay Chat''', commonly abbreviated '''IRC''', is a chat protocol, a way how to enable several people to talk to each other by entering text messages, each participant seeing everything that the other participants write, as if they were in a telephone conference.

== Technology of IRC ==
Formally, IRC is a real-time text-based multi-user communication protocol specification and implementation, which relays messages between users on the network.
According to [http://efnet.org/ Efnet.org], IRC was born sometime in 1988. According to [http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ IRChelp.org], the official specification for IRC was written in 1993 in the [[w:RFC|RFC]] format. The specification &quot;RFC 1459: Internet Relay Chat Protocol&quot; is a really excellent source for both an introduction to and detailed information about the IRC protocol. Today IRC has a very wide range of users and anyone can find a place to participate in chat.

IRC's largest unit of architecture is the '''IRC network'''. There are perhaps hundreds of IRC networks in the world each one running parallel and disjoint from the others. A client logged into one network can communicate only with other clients on the same network, not with clients on other networks. Each network is composed of one or more '''IRC servers'''. An IRC client is a program that connects to a given IRC server in order to have the server relay communications to and from other clients on the same network but not necessarily the same server.

Messages on IRC are sent as blocks. That is, other IRC clients will not see one typing and editing as one does so. One creates a message block (often just a sentence) and transmits that block all at once, which is received by the server and based on the addressing, delivers it to the appropriate client or relays it to other servers so that it may be delivered or relayed again, et cetera.

Once connected to a server, addressing of other clients is achieved through '''IRC nicknames'''. A nickname is simply a unique string of ASCII characters identifying a particular client. Although implementations vary, restrictions on nicknames usually dictate that they be composed only of characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore, and dash.

Another form of addressing on IRC, and arguably one of its defining features, is the '''IRC channel'''. IRC channels are often compared to CB Radio (Citizen's Band Radio) channels. While with CB one is said to be &quot;listening&quot; to a channel, in IRC one's client is said to be &quot;joined&quot; to the channel. Any communication sent to that channel is then &quot;heard&quot; or seen by the client. On the other hand, other clients on the same network or even on the same server, but not on the same channel will not see any messages sent to that channel.

While IRC is by definition not a [[Internet_Technologies/Peer-to-Peer_%28P2P%29|P2P]] protocol, IRC does have some extensions that support text and file transmission directly from client to client without any relay at all. These extensions are known as [[w:Direct Client-to-Client|DCC]] (Direct Client Connect) and [[w:Client-To-Client Protocol|CTCP]] (Client To Client Protocol). For CTCP, clients like mIRC implement commands such as &quot;ctcp nickname version&quot; or &quot;ctcp nickname ping&quot; to get some interesting infos about other users.

==Using Internet Relay Chat==
To use Internet Relay Chat, you need to do the following:
# Choose and install an IRC client.
# Find the ''channel'' discussing the topic of your interest (similar to a room in other chat environments).
# Find the ''server'' at which the channel is located. You can be directed to both the server and the channel by the website of a project, such as Wikibooks.
# Connect to the ''server'' using the client, using a nickname of your choice.
# Connect to the ''channel'' (a room).

{{todo|Provide more information on how to choose nicknames and their use and restrictions of registering them.}}

==Registering your nickname==
Some IRC networks offer to register your nickname through a service bot. This provides sometimes access to channels that are blocked to unregistered users and in most cases reserves your nickname so no one else can use it (it will at least mark you as the logged in user and anyone else who uses it as not logged in).

The service bots providing this is mostly named &quot;NickServ&quot;, sometimes also &quot;AuthServ&quot; or on a big network just &quot;Q&quot;. When you found out which one of those bots exists, you can gather more information by typing:
:&lt;pre&gt;/msg [BOTNAME] help&lt;/pre&gt;
This should get you detailed instructions on how to use the service.

=== Example HowTo for a network ===
The process is fairly simple, once you have chosen a nickname you would like to register (assuming it's not owned by anyone else) and chosen a password, follow these steps:

* If you have not done so already, change your nickname to the one you would like to register
:&lt;pre&gt;/nick [NICKNAME]&lt;/pre&gt;
For example:
:&lt;pre&gt;/nick JohnDoe&lt;/pre&gt;
* Send a private message to the network's nickserv service with the password you chose and your email address with
:&lt;pre&gt;/msg nickserv register [PASSWORD] [EMAIL]&lt;/pre&gt;
For example:
:&lt;pre&gt;/msg nickserv register 1234abcd JohnDoe@email.com&lt;/pre&gt;
* After messaging the nickserv you should shortly receive a reply back stating that the it received your registration request and sent an email to the address you provided.
:&lt;pre&gt;An email containing nickname activation instructions has been sent to JohnDoe@email.com&lt;/pre&gt;
* To complete the registration process, you will need to message the nickserv with the registration code emailed to your address.
:&lt;pre&gt;/msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER JohnDoe p4huc5gqunnc&lt;/pre&gt;
* Once you have correctly entered the registration code, the nickserv should message you back stating the nick registration process was completed successfully.
:&lt;pre&gt;JohnDoe has now been verified.&lt;/pre&gt;
You should now be &quot;logged in&quot; under your nick.  If you disconnect from the server, to relogin under your nick you will need to message the nickserv with your password:
:&lt;pre&gt;/msg nickserv identify [PASSWORD]&lt;/pre&gt;
For example:
:&lt;pre&gt;/msg nickserv identify 1234abcd&lt;/pre&gt;
Once doing so, it should reply back saying you successfully logged in.
:&lt;pre&gt;You are now identified for JohnDoe&lt;/pre&gt;

==Private conversations and chats==
By default, the conversations using IRC are public, visible to all users in the channel.

To have a private conversation with a user in the channel, type &quot;/query nickname&quot;.

To have a private chat, join an non-existent channel, and then allow joining only by invitation using the command &quot;/mode +i&quot;.
Chunked into steps:
# /join #mynewchannel
# /mode +i
# /invite someotherguy

== IRC clients ==
To use IRC, you'll need an IRC client--a program that lets you connect to an IRC server, and enter an IRC channel. There is a variety of IRC clients:

== IRC commands ==
What follows is an overview of some of the basic commands of the IRC protocol. All the commands are already prefixed with a slash &quot;/&quot;, as in most clients this will indicate that an IRC command follows that shall be executed. With some IRC clients including ChatZilla and Pidgin, you do not need to know these commands: you tell the client what you want to do using the graphical user interface and the client sends the necessary commands for you.

===Basic commands===
Some basic commands for IRC are listed in the following section. Please note that not all of them are available in all clients, as some of them are client-sided inventions to make your life easier and not part of the IRC protocol itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two approaches to furthering knowledge: reasoning from known ideas and synthesizing observations. In inductive reasoning you observe the world, and attempt to explain based on your observations. You start with no prior assumptions. Deductive reasoning consists of logical assertions from known facts.

==Basic Terms==
Before one can start to understand logic, and thereby begin to prove geometric theorems, one must first know a few vocabulary words and symbols.

'''Conditional''': a conditional is something which states that one statement implies another. A conditional contains two parts: the condition and the conclusion, where the former implies the latter. A conditional is always in the form &quot;If ''statement 1'', then ''statement 2''.&quot; In most mathematical notation, a conditional is often written in the form ''p'' ⇒ ''q'', which is read as &quot;If ''p'', then ''q''&quot; where ''p'' and ''q'' are statements.

'''Converse''': the converse of a logical statement is when the conclusion becomes the condition and vice versa; i.e., ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' becomes ''q'' ⇒ ''p''. For example, the converse of the statement &quot;If someone is a woman, then they are a human&quot; would be &quot;If someone is a human, then they are a man.&quot; The converse of a conditional does not necessarily have the same truth value as the original, though it sometimes does, as will become apparent later.

'''AND''': And is a logical operator which is true only when both statements are true. For example, the statement &quot;Diamond is the hardest substance known to man AND a diamond is a metal&quot; is false. While the former statement is true, the latter is not. However, the statement &quot;Diamond is the hardest substance known to man AND diamonds are made of carbon&quot; would be true, because both parts are true. 

'''OR''': If two statements are joined together by &quot;or,&quot; then the truth of the &quot;or&quot; statement is dependent upon whether one or both of the statements from which it is composed is true. For example, the statement &quot;Tuesday is the day after Monday OR Thursday is the day after Saturday&quot; would have a truth value of &quot;true,&quot; because even though the latter statement is false, the former is true.

'''NOT''': If a statement is preceded by &quot;NOT,&quot; then it is evaluating the opposite truth value of that statement. The symbol for &quot;NOT&quot; is For example, if the statement ''p'' is &quot;Elvis is dead,&quot; then ¬p would be &quot;Elvis is not dead.&quot; The concept of &quot;NOT&quot; can cause some confusion when it relates to statements which contain the word &quot;all.&quot; For example, if ''r'' is &quot;¬&quot;. &quot;All men have hair,&quot; then ''¬r'' would be &quot;All men do not have hair&quot; or &quot;No men have hair.&quot; Do not confuse this with &quot;Not all men have hair&quot; or &quot;Some men have hair.&quot; The &quot;NOT&quot; should apply to the verb in the statement: in this case, &quot;have.&quot; ''¬p'' can also be written as NOT ''p'' or ''~p''. 
NOT ''p'' may also be referred to as the &quot;negation of ''p''.&quot;

'''Inverse''': The inverse of a conditional says that the negation of the condition implies the negation of the conclusion. For example, the inverse of ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' is ''¬p'' ⇒ ''¬q''. Like a converse, an inverse does not necessarily have the same truth value as the original conditional.

'''Biconditional''': A biconditional is conditional where the condition and the conclusion imply one another. A biconditional starts with the words &quot;if and only if.&quot; For example, &quot;If and only if ''p'', then ''q''&quot; means both that ''p'' implies ''q'' and that ''q'' implies ''p''. 

'''Premise''': A premise is a statement whose truth value is known initially. For example, if one were to say &quot;If today is Thursday, then the cafeteria will serve burritos,&quot; and one knew that what day it was, then the premise would be &quot;Today is Thursday&quot; or &quot;Today is not Thursday.&quot;

'''⇒''': The symbol which denotes a conditional. ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' is read as &quot;if ''p'', then ''q''.&quot;

'''Iff''': Iff is a shortened form of &quot;if and only if.&quot; It is read as &quot;if and only if.&quot;

'''⇔''': The symbol which denotes a biconditonal. ''p'' ⇔ ''q'' is read as &quot;If and only if ''p'', then ''q''.&quot;

'''∴''': The symbol for &quot;therefore.&quot; ''p'' ∴ ''q'' means that one knows that ''p'' is true (''p'' is true is the premise), and has logically concluded that ''q'' must also be true.

'''∧''': The symbol for &quot;and.&quot;

'''∨''': The symbol for &quot;or.&quot;

==Deductive Reasoning==
There are a few forms of deductive logic. One of the most common deductive logical arguments is '''modus ponens''', which states that:
:''p'' ⇒ ''q
:''p'' ∴ ''q''

:''(If ''p'', then ''q'')
:''(''p'', therefore ''q'')''

An example of modus ponens:
:If I stub my toe, then I will be in pain.
:I stub my toe.
:Therefore, I am in pain.

Another form of deductive logic is '''modus tollens''', which states the following.

:''p'' ⇒ ''q''
:''¬q'' &amp;there4; ''¬p''

:''(If ''p'', then ''q'')''
:''(''not q'', therefore ''not p'')''


Modus tollens is just as valid a form of logic as modus ponens. The following is an example which uses modus tollens.


:If today is Thursday, then the cafeteria will be serving burritos.

:The cafeteria is not serving burritos, therefore today is not Thursday.


Another form of deductive logic is known as the '''If-Then Transitive Property'''. Simply put, it means that there can be chains of logic where one thing implies another thing. The If-Then Transitive Property states:

:''p'' ⇒ ''q''

:(''q'' ⇒ ''r'') &amp;there4; (''p'' ⇒ ''r'')


:''(If ''p'', then ''q'')''

:''(''(If ''q'', then ''r''), therefore (if ''p'', then ''r''))
For example, consider the following chain of if-then statements.
:If today is Thursday, then the cafeteria will be serving burritos.
:If the cafeteria will be serving burritos, then I will be happy.

:Therefore, if today is Thursday, then I will be happy.

==Inductive Reasoning==
Inductive reasoning is a logical argument which does not definitely prove a statement, but rather assumes it. Inductive reasoning is used often in life. Polling is an example of the use of inductive reasoning. If one were to poll one thousand people, and 300 of those people selected choice A, then one would infer that 30% of any population might also select choice A. This would be using inductive logic, because it does not definitively prove that 30% of any population would select choice A.

Because of this factor of uncertainty, inductive reasoning should be avoided when possible when attempting to prove geometric properties.

==Truth Tables==
Truth tables are a way that one can display all the possibilities that a logical system may have when given certain premises. The following is a truth table with two premises (''p'' and ''q''), which shows the truth value of some basic logical statements. ''(NOTE: '''T''' = '''true'''; '''F''' = '''false''')''


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Unlike science which has theories, mathematics has a definite notion of proof. Mathematics applies deductive reasoning to create a series of logical statements which show that one thing implies another. 

Consider a triangle, which we define as a shape with three vertices joined by three lines. We know that we can arbitrarily pick some point on a page, and make that into a vertex. We repeat that process and pick a second point. Using a ruler, we can connect these two points. We now make a third point, and using the ruler connect it to each of the other points. We have constructed a triangle.

In mathematics we formalize this process into axioms, and carefully lay out the sequence of statements to show what follows. All definitions are clearly defined. In modern mathematics, we are always working within some system where various axioms hold.

==Two-Column Proof==
The most common form of explicit proof in highschool geometry is a two column proof consists of five parts: the given, the proposition, the statement column, the reason column, and the diagram (if one is given).

===Example of a Two-Column Proof===
Now, suppose a problem tells you to solve &lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, showing all steps made to get to the answer.  A proof shows how this is done:

Given: &lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

Prove: x = 1

{| Style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot; rules=&quot;none&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;|Statement
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;| Reason 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|Given
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|Property of subtraction
|}

We use &quot;Given&quot; as the first reason, because it is &quot;given&quot; to us in the problem.
==Written Proof==
Written proofs (also known as informal proofs, paragraph proofs, or 'plans for proof') are written in paragraph form. Other than this formatting difference, they are similar to two-column proofs.

Sometimes it is helpful to start with a written proof, before formalizing the proof in two-column form.  If you're having trouble putting your proof into two column form, try &quot;talking it out&quot; in a written proof first.
===Example of a Written Proof===
We are given that x + 1 = 2, so if we subtract one from each side of the equation (x + 1 - 1 = 2 - 1), then we can see that x = 1 by the definition of subtraction.

==Flowchart Proof==
A flowchart proof or more simply a flow proof is a graphical representation of a two-column proof.  Each set of statement and reasons are recorded in a box and then arrows are drawn from one step to another.  This method shows how different ideas come together to formulate the proof.

Mathematics takes concrete things, and turns them into abstractions which help to generalize ideas. Take a simple example with numbers. Is quantity the property of a thing? We can have two cars or two shoes, but there are still two. We can also have one car or two cars, but we are still talking about a &quot;car&quot;. 

Think about it for a minute. Can you define the idea of number? There is no tangible thing as one. There is &quot;one dollar&quot;, but there is not a one. There is a symbol for one, but again no tangible &quot;one&quot;. 

If you attempted to define numbers you probably came up with definitions that just start out listing 1,2,3,etc. or you can also look and see that one plus one is two. There is something inherent in this property. 

This seemingly imperceptible condition of abstraction is the defining quality of mathematics. In geometry we consider enclosed shapes with three sides on them, and call them triangles. You may see a triangle, but you will never see the tangible idea of triangle. You merely see a representation of it. 

Yet, you can discover such facts like a rectangle can be divided into two triangles. This is true regardless of the rectangle you choose, and you can reason this without actually seeing every rectangle, which would be impossible.

Mathematics is able to generalize various things into abstract ideas, upon which generalized statements can be made for classes of objects without considering each one individually. Triangles have certain properties. Two of anything has certain properties. These are all related in the abstract.

In understanding abstractions, mathematics begins to classify ways in which abstract objects are alike, and ways they are different. Some things are numbers, and others are shapes. 

Mathematics deals with this problem by defining different types of equivalences. For any two things it covers, an equivalence class says they are either the same or different in a certain way. In ordinary arithmetic this might be expressed by something like 
&lt;math&gt;3+3=6&lt;/math&gt;
which says that under the equal equivalence class 3+3 is the same as 6.

== Basic Voynich Jargon ==
'''Dain''' = Colloquial Scots, particularly North East Scotland meaning &quot;doing&quot; . A typical example may be &quot;Fit i Ye Dain?'&quot; = &quot;What are you Doing?&quot; Can also be &quot;Dein&quot;

'''dain/daiin/daiiin''' = a weird-looking &quot;word&quot; that recurs throughout the VMS, often in groups (like dain daiin), which has led to numerous bizarre theories. 

'''EVA''' = a particular stroke-based transcription format for the VMS, designed to be both linguistically readable and post-processible into whatever glyph format you like. For more on this (and to download the EVA Hand 1 font), go to: http://www.voynich.nu/extra/eva.html

'''Folio''' = a pair of pages with a number (the foliation) on the front (typically in the top right). The front page of the pair is denoted &quot;-r&quot; (for recto), and the back (reverse) page of the pair is denoted &quot;-v&quot; (for verso). So, f80r means folio #80, front page. 

'''Gallows / Gallows Characters''' = the tall squiggly characters seen freqently in the VMS. Less common are '''Long gallows''' or '''Split gallows''', which are gallows characters which (typically) have the two 'legs' of the gallows separated and some other text placed beneath. 

'''Interlinear''' = a merged set of transcriptions of the VMS, where various authors' transcriptions of the same line of VMS text are interleaved (ie, placed one after the other). You can download the latest (&quot;version 1.6e6&quot;) Landini/Reeds/Takahashi/etc interlinear file from http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/98-12-28-interln16e6/ 

'''Nymph''' = one of the small naked women adorning the pages of the balneological and astrological sections. 

'''Picnic Table''' = an inverted V shape with a flat line across the top (not a gallows character). In EVA this is character &lt;x&gt;. 

'''Quire''' = a set of bifolios folded around a central &quot;gutter&quot; into a small chapter-like entity: typically 16 pages long. If numbered (as they are in the VMS, usually on the bottom right of the back of each quire), the numbering is referred to as its quiration.

== Voynich Section Jargon ==

'''Herbal pages''' = pages with a single type of plant on

'''Pharma pages''' = pages with multiple plants and apothecary jars (maiolica)

'''Astrological pages''' = the circular volvelles with nymphs (f70v2..f73v) 

'''Astronomical pages''' = the other circular diagrams (f67r1..f70r2, etc) 

'''9-rosette page''' = the foldout map page 

'''Recipe / Ephemeris pages''' = the starred paragraphs at the back of the VMS 

'''Balneological pages''' = nymphs, baths, plumbing (f75r...f84v) 

'''Key-like sequences''' = pages with 1+ sets of single glyphs in a row/column/circle 

'''Front page''' = f1r 

'''Magic circle page''' = f57v 

'''Fertilisation / Seed page''' = f86v 

The '''michiton oladabas''' page = the last page, named after one particularly influential reading of its non-Voynichese letters.

== Linguistics/Statistics Voynich Jargon ==
'''Core-mantle-crust theory''' = three separate categories to group letters into: part of a VMS grammar proposed by Jorge Stolfi, explained in depth at http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/00-06-07-word-grammar/ 

'''Entropy''' = an overall measure of how unpredictable a sequence of numbers is. However, if you change how you predict what the next number is (ie, change the context or model), and you'll get a different entropy value. If you change how you transcribe the text, you'll get a different entropy value too. 

'''Glyph''' = a single connected entity on a page. But is the ligatured &quot;4o&quot; you often see one glyph or two? Opinions differ... 

'''Grammar''' = how text 'works'. For the VMS, written in a language and alphabet we (apparently) don't know, working this out has proven hard. A good summary is here: http://www.voynich.nu/a_para.html 

(The) '''Kober/Ventris''' Approach = the way that Linear B was famously decoded by Michael Ventris, who built his ideas around the patterns noticed by Alice Kober (typically a common triplet at the start of some groups of five symbols, which she suspected formed some kind of root). If the VMS is actually a language, then Kober/Ventris would be relevant, as they decoded Linear B without the help of bilingual texts (like the Rosetta stone, etc). For more info, go to http://www.bib-arch.org/bswb_AO/bswbao0601review.html 

'''Stroke''' = a single pen-stroke within a glyph. 

'''Transcription''' = how you choose to convert a text into (ASCII) characters. There are two major types - stroke-based (such as EVA) and glyph-based (pretty much every other one). As opinions differ about what is and isn't a glyph, EVA was introduced so that a single transcription could be post-processed to fit your glyph model.

== Cryptography / Shorthand Voynich Jargon ==

'''Cipherbet''' = a contraction of &quot;cipher alphabet&quot; coined by Nick Pelling. Admittedly a horrible word, but if you take a cryptographic view of the VMS, you'll probably end up using this (perhaps unwillingly).

'''Cleartext''' = the original text before encoding. Same as plaintext. 

'''Ciphertext''' = plaintext that has been enciphered/encoded (perhaps encoded text should be called Codetext, but that seems somehow ugly and unusable, I don't know why). 

'''Code / Cipher''' = a system to fiddle around with text. Technically, codes replace words with a number reference (a code index) and ciphers replace letters with other letters: though nomenclature (whereby particular key words were replaced by special symbols) forms a kind of bridge between the two types of systems. 

'''Cryptanalysis''' = the art/science of breaking codes/ciphers. 

'''Cryptography''' = the art/science of making codes/ciphers.

'''Cryptology''' = the overall science of code-making and code-breaking

'''Monoalphabetic''' = a cipher system that only ever has a single (output) replacement character for a single (input) plaintext character. It's long been agreed that, if the VMs is encoded, it's using a system that's more complex than just a monoalphabetic cipher. cf polyalphabetic. 

'''Notarikon''' = a system of Qabbalistic word manipulation whereby phrases are transformed into their acronyms (and words expanded back into phrases as if they were acronyms), typically to reveal deeper truths in the Torah. Often described as a kind of possible shorthand / code mechanism, but rarely actually used. 

'''Pair cipher''' = a cipher which replaces one or more plaintext letters with a pair (or group) of letters from the cipherbet. AKA a verbose cipher. 

'''Plaintext''' = raw text that hasn't been fiddled around with at all. 

'''Polyalphabetic''' = a cipher system that has multiple monoalphabetic (qv) ciphers, which it selects between according to context. A &quot;straight polyalpha&quot; will change context every letter, and loop around after (say) every 26 letters: when breaking polyalphas, you often try to discern this &quot;heartbeat&quot;. Unless the text has an internal &quot;rhythm&quot; that matches the internal rhythm of the context change, this typically has the effect of emitting all letters at roughly the same rate - which we don't observe in the VMS. So, if it isn't a monoalpha, &amp; it isn't a straight polyalpha... what is it? 

'''Steganography''' = a system to hide text in plain sight. Rather than relying on mathematics, this relies on psychology and misdirection to distract the eye from seeing the text. Hiding text in JPEGs or WAVs is the modern form of steganography (various intelligence agencies claimed that Al-Qaeda was doing this, but AFAIK have failed to find even one) - but people have taken delight in hiding secret messages in pictures since time immemorial. 

'''Stenography''' = a modern name for shorthand. Often confused with steganography (qv), even by people who should know better. :-)

'''Tachygraphy''' = a shorthand system based around writing a limited number of symbols at speed, typically by using a specially designed &quot;single-stroke&quot; alphabet to take notes onto a wax tablet with a stylus.

'''Verbose cipher''' = a cipher which replaces one or more plaintext letters with a pair (or group) of letters from the cipherbet: such systems date back to at least 1440. AKA pair cipher.

== Miscellaneous Voynich Jargon ==

'''Albarelli''' = maiolica containers (like small barrels) for potions and lotions. These are relevant to the &quot;barrels&quot; with nymphs in (which Edith Sherwood talks about) in the low-numbered astrological volvelle pages, as these could well be albarelli: the complexity of the glazing designs grew steadily throughout the 15th Century, so moved from austere Islamic geometric shapes (circa 1440-1450) through to complex historical scenes (circa 1510). Similarly, the number of colours that could be employed sensibly increased over the same period - these would date the VMS' albarelli to (say) 1460-1470 (few colours, geometric designs). 

'''Antidotary''' = manuscript or book from the 15th/16th Century describing recipes, mixtures, plants, jars, etc. 

'''Apothecary''' = medieval / early modern pharmacist or chemist. The &quot;apothecary oncia&quot; symbol (a 'cursive z' with a bar above it), denoting an ounce or fluid ounce, was a frequent feature of early modern recipes, and is often transcribed as &quot;3&quot;. This means a frequent pattern there is &quot;3 iii&quot; (which means &quot;oncia tria&quot;, 3 ounces) - so some suspect that the VMS' &quot;dain/daiin/daiiin&quot; could be a steganographic version of &quot;3 i / 3 ii / 3 iii&quot;. However, YMMV. :-) 

'''Balneological''' = a hand-rolled fancy Cuban-cigar way of saying &quot;to do with [medicinal] baths and spas&quot;. 

(The) '''Castle Page''' = part of the foldout page on f85v2. This foldout page is known as &quot;the 9-rosette page&quot;, as it is made up of 9 strange circular shapes arranged in a 'tic-tac-toe' pattern, and connected by what look like causeways. Iconographically, the rosette with the castle resembles the circular maps of Milan which appeared in the 15th Century, the most famous of which appeared in Jacopo del Massajo's 1428 edition of Ptolemy's Geographia. Make of that what you will! :-) 

'''Circinus''' = medieval device used to draw circles. 

'''CopyFlo''' = a kind of monochrome photocopy printout from microfilm produced by the Beinecke Library which you can buy. It's very nice to own one, but it's just a shame that it's not somewhat better quality. 

'''Foldout''' = a page larger than the size of most VMS pages that you can &quot;fold out&quot; to see in full. Examples: the famous &quot;9-rosette&quot; map page, the pharma pages, the astronomical pages. 

'''FSG''' = First Study Group, a early (and significant) group of cryptographers and historians who tried to crack the VMS, 1944-1946. Similarly, there was an SSG in the 1960s. There's a good page listing numerous people involved with the VMS over the years here --&gt; http://www.voynich.nu/solvers.html 

'''Grove Numbers''' = a way of numbering the nymphs/stars/labels on the circular astrological diagrams: for a particular ring, count clockwise from 9 o'clock (normally the leftmost nymph) up from #1. There are three (partial) justifications for this: (1) this is the location of the ascendant (the horizon) in a circular astrological natal chart; (2) this is roughly where you find stylised markers (probably indicating &quot;start-of-line&quot;) in the circular rings of text; (3) if you count from the inside ring first, the nymph associated with the 7th degree of Leo is wearing a crown - the star associated with Leo 7 is Regulus, &quot;the little king&quot;. If you're interested, you might like to look at Astromagia. However, YMMV... :-o 

'''Maiolica''' = 15th/16th century tin-glazed earthenware, AKA lustreware. (Note that Victorian tin-glazed earthenware is called &quot;Majolica&quot;, i.e. with a &quot;j&quot;). Maiolica was originally shipped across to Italy from Spain via Majorca (hence the name, somewhat misleadingly), but the technique for making it was copied in Northern Italy, which became the leading centre for their manufacture (circa 1450). http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~kovacevi/homepage.htm 

'''Mirror of Princes''' = a type of medieval document which purported to advise princes on how to tackle numerous different aspects of stately life. Filarete's utopian &quot;Treatise on Architecture&quot; falls into this category, as does Machiavelli's (in)famous &quot;Il Principe&quot;. However, Alberti also wrote a satire (&quot;Momo e Il Principe Italiano&quot;, which is online at http://www.intratext.com/X/ITA0734.HTM ) taking the mickey out of these &quot;Mirrors&quot; (which tended to take themselves rather too seriously), &amp; their intention (to influence those in power) seems rarely to have succeeded. Oh well. :-/ 

'''Murano''' = the centre of the Italian glass-making and mirror-making trade, which was tightly controlled by Venice. A few of the containers in the VMS pharma section have decoration similar to glass from Murano circa 1450-1500. 

'''Nocturnelle''' = a hand-held circular early modern instrument similar to a volvelle, but instead used for calculating the time at night from the position of the stars. AKA moon-dial, or even phebilabe or phebelabium (following David A. King). 

'''Rotoscope / Rotograph''' = a kind of projective photograph system used in the early 20th Century, whereby images (rotographs) were projected onto the plane of a screen inside a mechanism (a rotoscope), which could then be examined closely or traced from. The British Library was given a set of VMS rotographs in 1931. 

'''Volvelle''' = a hand-held medieval astrological instrument made from concentric circular dials, &amp; used to calculate planetary positions...

'''Wiki / WikiWiki''' = a generic name for a web-page which anyone can edit quickly without having to learn HTML. Try it yourself! :-) 

'''WMV''' = Wilfrid Michael Voynich, who bought the VMS in Italy in 1912. His original (Polish) name was &quot;Michal Wojnicz&quot;, and his clandestine spy-name (don't ask) was &quot;Wilfryd&quot; - when he moved to the West, he westernised his name to be a mixture of the two, spelt more phonetically. 

'''Wolkenband''' = a chain of clouds, often used as a squiggly decorative feature in 15th Century Italian MS, to be seen on VMS page f68v3 (first brought up by Erla Rosakiewicz in 1945 - see http://www.ehabitat.demon.co.uk/vms/letter-050.html ) and indeed throughout the VMS' balneological section. 

'''YMMV''' = Your Mileage May Vary, ie &quot;interpret the preceding statement(s) how you will&quot;

== Why a Wikibook on GTK+ ==
A wikibook is an undertaking similar to an open-source software project: A contributor creates content for the project to help others, for personal enrichment, or to accomplish something for the contributor's own work (e.g., lecture preparation).

An open book, just like an open program, requires time to complete, but it can benefit greatly from even modest contributions from readers. For example you can fix &quot;bugs&quot; in the text (where the bug might be typographic, expository, technical, aesthetic or otherwise) in order to make a better book. If you find an opportunity to fix a bug, simply click on &quot;edit&quot;, make your changes, and click on save. Other contributors may review your changes to be sure they are appropriate for the book. If you are unsure, you can visit the discussion page and ask there. Use common sense.

If you would like to make bigger contributions, you can take a look at the sections or chapters that are too short or otherwise need more work and start writing! Be sure to skim the rest of the book first in order to avoid duplication of content. Additionally, you should read the Guidelines for Contributors page for consistency tips and advice.

Note that you don't need to contribute everything at once. You can mark sections as &quot;TODO,&quot; with a description of what remains to be done, and perhaps someone else will finish those parts for you. Once all TODO items are finished, we'll have reached our First Edition!

Examples in this book should be written in C as that is the language GTK+ is written in most. Additionally, implementations of the algorithms as an appendix are welcome.

Under that theory, the prominent stars to the lower left appears to be Casseopeia, and Tycho's Star, the supernova of 1572, is the outer of the two stars in the 8:30 position. The single star to the lower right is Algol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One idea concerning the collections of faces in the corners is they may represent planetary conjunctions. Astronomical research has revealed that such configurations do indeed occur. While providing specific dates, they do not help date the manuscript, as they occurred in both the 15th and 16th Centuries.

An interpretation of the folio is that the conjunctions were observed from the central point while the Sun or Moon was setting (or rising) over the trees.

Here are some of the alignment dates:

 NW  Mercury, Venus, Jupiter (Virgo) 29 August 1554
 NE  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn  (Taurus/Aries) 17 April 1588
 SE  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter (Leo/Cancer) 10 July 1577

==Red Ink==

Jorge Stolfi discusses the red ink on this page at http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/99-12-15-f67-reds/ .  I have a couple of comments on this document.

First he mentions &quot;The shadow is painted red in seven of the moons, and light yellow in the other five.&quot;  Looking at the more recently available SIDs provided by the Beinecke (2004) I'm of the opinion that this yellow is a thinner &quot;wash&quot; of the same color used in the non-red text.  In fact it is difficult to distinguish the color from some of the fainter letters.

As far as the red ink goes, my non-expert opinion based on the high quality scans now available are that they are all the same ink painted at the same time.

However, I'm not so sure that the red ink was necessarily applied at the same time as the rest of the text.

Firstly there has been some discussion about the sloppiness of some of the painting.  In the &quot;moons&quot; on this page neither the red nor the &quot;yellow&quot; fillins are very neat.

In the case of the lighter color overpainting I believe that the overpainting was applied after the outline had dried.  This theory is based on the appearance of where the overpainting overlaps the outline and produces and &quot;additive&quot; darkening effect.  However this could be no more than minutes after the outline was drawn so perhaps doesn't say much.

I considered the possibility that the red text was an overpainting of earlier brown &quot;original&quot; text.  I can't find much evidence for this theory though:

: At the upper right there seems to be a brown dot between two of the words.  Dirt?

: At the upper left there seems to be a brown dot above one of the words.  I'm inclined to think this brown does not quite match the primary text color though.  In fact looking back at the first dot I'm inclined to think that it matches the color of this dot and not the primary text color either.

: Against this theory is the fact that in some places the red text is rather thin.  Perhaps the brush was nearly dry.  In those cases I can see no evidence of an &quot;additive&quot; darkening from an underlying brown text, faint or not.

Another random note:  What thought has been given to the pattern in the outer band?  At first glance it seems to be decorative, but it is fairly complex and not entirely repetitive.  It should be noted that this band seems to have the same &quot;yellow&quot; wash in a couple of places as the lighter overpainted moons.  This color also appears in the center figure.

''The factual accuracy of this module is [[Wikibooks:accuracy dispute|disputed]].'' 


First,  the bad news.  There is nothing you can do that will make you attractive to every woman you meet.  Every woman has her own unique preferences,  turn-ons,  and turn-offs. Even if you happened to be Mel Gibson, there are women (especially lesbians) who would look at you and think, &quot;Eh, nothing special,&quot; or women for whom Mel Gibson reminds them of some person they intensely dislike (Mel Gibson, perhaps). You just can't please everybody.

However, you need not appeal to a woman in terms of looks to make her go out with you. Of course, she needs to admire you, to feel good and comfortable because of you. So the whole area of looks is just to prevent some thoughts like &quot;my, that's a dirty/boring/careless guy/gal&quot; to pop up in her mind the moment she sees you first.

==Clothing==

Basic elements of style:

Fit: Obviously, the piece of clothing in question needs to fit, preferably loosely.  If you feel like flaunting your muscles (if you HAVE muscles), then go ahead and wear something a little tighter.

Comfort: Except in extreme situations (i.e. formal dinners and the like), make sure your clothing feels comfortable on you.  If not, you'll wriggle around, and this will make you look odd.

Colour: The ideal colour of your clothes depends on you.  Dark, muted tones convey an air of professionalism, whereas light, bright tones convey an air of lightheartedness.  Play to your strengths.

Fabric: This ties back into comfort.  If the basic material the clothing is made out of is itchy and uncomfortable, it won't play well with the ladies.  Obviously, find what you feel most comfortable in.

Appropriateness: Wearing an inappropriate outfit can effectively sink you.  What is deemed &quot;appropriate&quot; is determined by the situation: obviously, black-tie galas and other upscale events call for a much more strict standard of dress than, say, a club.

Practicality: When buying an outfit, think: &quot;How will I use it&quot;?  If it's fairly expensive, and you're rarely going to use it, then it may not be a good idea to buy it.

Value: Go with what works on your budget.  If you attempt to woo the ladies by looking like a millionaire when you are not one, it will lead to disappointment.

Mixing and matching: This is very important.  If two items of your wardrobe clash, this can sink you.  Think of your wardrobe like an orchestra.  No matter how good one instrument is, if another doesn't produce a pleasant sound, that's all people will notice.  White, black, and grey are the universal matching colours: nearly every other colour will go with at least one of them.

Accessories: Accessories come in two categories, the utile and the stylish.

Utile accessories: These are the accessories you actually USE.  Take your belt for example.  It's holding up your trousers.  You're using it.  A watch is another example.  You can use it to tell time.

Stylish accessories: You don't actually use these, they're just there to make something look good (like a &quot;grill&quot;).

==Your body==
If you ask a woman what she wants in a man or woman, considering the looks, they will often prefer men or women without fat, a little bit of muscle up to bodybuilder-like figures. However, reality shows the opposite, and it's more important how you make her feel. If she feels turned on by big muscles, that's okay. If you can make her comfortable and (only then) turn her on via what you say, it's even more powerful! Exercising is a good way to go, though.

===Exercise===
The sacks of meat charged with moving our brains from place to place are wonderful devices,  but they weren't designed for the sedentary lives and atrocious diets so many of us inflict upon them. They are meant to be used and used vigorously.

Exercise is absolutely critical to the human body.  There are a dozen reasons,  and making yourself gorgeous for women of the female persuasion is just one of them.  You want to be able to accomplish the daily tasks of life without getting winded.  You want to be able to run and play with your kids.  You want to be able to defend yourself in a fight.  Just choose a reason that motivates you and compels you to do put in the effort,  so your body can live up to its potential.

There is no shortage of exercises to choose from.  Running,  jogging,  cycling,  weight lifting,  swimming,  basketball,  racquetball,  tennis,  gymnastics,  badminton,  and football (European or American) are all popular.  But if you prefer some niche sport like fencing,  go for it.  The important thing is to tailor your workout to fit your own personality and lifestyle.  Is it convenient to bicycle to and from work?  Do it.  Do you enjoy team sports?  Do it.  Do you like the idea of upgrading your muscles?  Do it.  

Many people go the weight lifting route,  but don't forget to add aerobic exercise into the mix.  The usual advice is three to four times per week,  for at least twenty minutes per session.

If you are in a very unhealthy condition (like you have difficulties to move thereof...) you need to begin slowly, assisted by some diet, because the primary goal will be weight loss, and to exercise properly you need less weight. Running is best for fat-reducing, you can run as slow as you want (well it should be more strainful than simply walking) for as long as you can. 15 minutes is ok for beginners, even with casual breaks. After two or three months you will feel your heart has become a lot stronger, and you can do a lot longer. You need more than half an hour to begin burning fat efficiently. One hour seems to be a good time span, that is not too stressful for the rest of your body (after some practice though).

Don't be fooled by sports that don't really give you much exercise.  For example,  cricket.  It's a sport with a long and storied history,  but try watching a game.  How many of the players are actually moving at any given time?  The game is characterized by the occasional frantic burst of activity,  and a whole lot of standing around.  This pattern of exercise is more likely to result in injuries than in firm,  woman-attracting abs.  It's great to enjoy cricket,  but be sure to give your body other forms of exercise.  The overall health that results will make you a better player and reduce your likelihood of injury.

Diet is a tricky subject.  We all have different dietary needs,  we all have different food preferences,  and some lifestyles aren't conducive to getting proper nutrition.  Lifestyle changes aren't easy,  but they're worth doing.  Put down the twinkies and acquaint yourself with the produce department of your local supermarket.  Most of us could benefit from cutting back on fat,  cutting our overall calorie intake,  and eating a much wider variety of healthy foods.  Avoid fad diets,  diets that focus on a single miracle food (the infamous grapefruit diet,  for example),  and starvation diets.  The best diet isn't necessarily the one that drops pounds fastest,  but one which involves permanent lifestyle changes that keep unwanted pounds from coming back.

The news are always full of studies where eating such-and-such vegetable or fruit prevents cancer/heart disease/arthritis/etc/etc /etc..      A sum-up of all these studies is &quot;Food is medicine, and medicine is food.&quot;  This is the case when you are careful to eat lots of raw vegetables, fruits, and grains, while eating dairy and meat much less often.   Eating veggies raw is to be preferred to eating them cooked, because the heat breaks up the vitamins and minerals.  Think of fruit as nature's dessert.   
Eating healthy foods will do you much more good if you stop eating the unhealthy foods too.   The key to this is to avoid the pre-processed foods like the plague, and eat things in as natural a state as possible.    High fructose corn syrup in particular kills your bodies ability to determine that you are full, which leads to overeating.   (do a Google search on &quot;high fructose corn syrup, health&quot; to find out more.)  It is amazing how many foods it is found in now.       

Healthy eating affects your looks - the gloss of your hair, the clearness of your skin.. It also affects body odor, your energy level, and your outlook on life.   You will know that you're eating healthy if you find yourself feeling fewer and fewer cravings for sweets and meats.

===Changing your diet===

When you go to the grocery store, choose a new vegetable to try, and get only one.  When you get home, wash it in water to get the pesticides off of it, cut a small piece, and eat it raw to see what it tastes like and decide whether you like it.  If you like it raw, then that's definitely how you should eat it.   If you don't like it raw, then try cooking it for just a few minutes, and then try it again.  (It is better to undercook than overcook vegetables.)  If you don't like that vegetable at all, then don't try eating it again until 6 months later, when you've gotten more used to your more natural diet and your perception of vegetables and their flavors have changed.   Think of it as a scientific experiment, and work your way through all the vegetables this way so that you can find you didn't know you liked. 

(Health Note: If you decide to eat a food in a different manner of preparation than conventional methods, it is often a good idea to check into the particular item a little first (Web searches, etc.). While taste, creativity and other points are all concerns, some foods are cooked or prepared in a certain way because of nutritional issues. For example, some raw peas, though eaten are actually not good for your ligaments so should be cooked before eating to break down certain chemicals; also, acorns/chestnuts have tannins which should be broken down by heat or other treatments (some societies prepare it with clay which binds up tannins to prevent them from absorption through the intestinal wall. These are just a few examples.)

Try out fruits in a similar fashion, but omitting the cooking step. Fruits are especially good for satisfying hunger quickly, and a piece of fruit can go a long way.  

If you hate breakfast cereals with flakes, go for granola cereal.  Test out brands until you find one you like, as not all granolas are created equal. Whenever possible, eat carbohydrates based on whole grain, wheat, wheat flour, and the like.  Avoid &quot;enriched&quot; if possible.

==Hair and Facial Hair==

Hair should be clean and well-groomed.  Frequent use of shampoo and conditioner is advised,  and the longer your hair is the more important it becomes.  Regular trims keep your hair low

Oh,  one more thing:  Comb-overs.  Don't do it.  Just don't. It is becoming commonplace for balding men now to simply shave off all of their hair, which many consider to be a better alternative.

Facial hair is a difficult and controversial area.  Some women love it,  some women absolutely hate it.  For widespread appeal,  I would suggest doing away with the beard and sideburns altogether.  But if you like how you look with a beard or goatee,  go for it,  and keep it neatly trimmed at whatever length you enjoy.  When you are happy with the way you look,  it shows in the way you conduct yourself,  and the confidence you display is often very attractive to women.

==Body Language==

Stand up straight.  This says you are alert and on top of things.  It also shows your body to the best advantage.   
Same goes for sitting up straight.  

'''What to do with your hands''' --  
Use your hands to help convey your meaning when you speak and tell stories.  While listening, you can keep them in your pockets,or on your lap (if sitting down).  
 
Having your arms folded across your chest during a conversation conveys an impression that you are resistant or closing your mind against whatever is being said; it is like a barrier between you and other people.   Avoid this stance when in any kind of argument with a girl.
 
Having one arm folded across your chest with the other arm resting over it and that hand up touching your face conveys the impression that you are listening carefully.   If you are at a table, you can also send the same signal by leaning forward slightly, with your elbows on the table, with your head leaning on your hands.   

If you sit on a couch next to a girl you don't know, resting your arm on the back of the couch (assuming the back is low enough to do so comfortably) yet without touching her back may be interpretted by some girls as expressing mild interest.  More interest may be conveyed, if your other arm is not similarly draped over the back of the couch and there is another girl sitting on that side.   

If you are sitting down with an empty spot next to you and a girl walks into the room who you find attractive, you can subtly signal to her to come over and sit down by you by catching her eye and smiling.  This will fulfill a girl's psychological need to feel wanted, and it will draw them to you like a moth to a flame.  Even if they don't come over and sit down next to you immediately, they will eventually (unless they have a boyfriend and he is present).

* Between the time that you signal and the time that she comes and sits down next to you, plan out a line of conversation into which you can immediately enter.  The girl has no idea what to expect, but she will be open to being impressed and charmed.

==Be Yourself!==

The most important thing is to be happy with and confident in your body.  If you don't feel confident in the appearance you present to women,  this lack of confidence will speak louder than expensive clothes or a new haircut ever could.  So if some piece of advice feels totally wrong,  jettison it.  If some outfit makes you feel like an idiot,  wear something else.  Attitude is everything.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Introduction to Philosophy]]

&lt;-- I have not the time now but I recommend adding Nietzsche's &quot;proto&quot;-existential viewpoint which was neither one of &quot;nausea&quot; or &quot;apathy&quot; --&gt;
&lt;-- Indeed, he even says that many people are not existential and are mere skeletons who have shrouded themselves with the beliefs of others. --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Have you ever felt that &quot;hell is other people&quot;?''&lt;br /&gt;
:([[w:Jean-Paul Sartre|Jean-Paul Sartre]] expressed this thought in ''[[w:No Exit|Huis clos]]'', his play).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Do you think you are &quot;condemned to be free&quot; because you make your own choices in life, and are not dependent on external morality?

If so, you may be an ''existentialist''.

One existentialist thought is &quot;Nothing is true, everything is permitted&quot;.  [[w:Fyodor Dostoevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky]] expressed this through Ivan, a character in his book ''[[w:The Brothers Karamazov|The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (''Братья Карамазовы'').  Ivan later shed his existentialism for faith in God (misquoted by Sartre in ''Existentialism is a Humanism'').

One existentialist feeling is nausea, another is apathy. Both feelings are in response to not actually being able to change the world.

==Kierkegaard==

The &quot;first&quot; existentialist (or at least the first to bear this title of &quot;existentialist&quot;) was [[w:Søren Kierkegaard|Søren Aabye Kierkegaard]], a Danish philosopher. He talked about three stages in our lives:
* the aesthetic stage,
* the ethical stage,
* the religious stage

These three stages were commonly associated with the &quot;feelings&quot; that accompanied them.  

The aesthetic stage, embodied by young people who recklessly pursue youth's pleasures or by students of science or another devotion which requires great discipline in which to achieve success, is characteristically associated with the feeling of &quot;despair&quot; including the aforementioned &quot;nausea&quot;.

This is brought on by the realization that no matter how long one parties and drinks and cavorts, or in the second case, no matter how many books are studied and lectures attended, the secrets to life and a happy existence are simply not to be found in this fashion.
This leads to a despair darker than night, a wanting to make something of oneself, to be remembered or to be depended upon.  This sense of duty brings on the second stage of existential appropriation, the religious stage.  

Though termed the &quot;religious stage&quot;, this stage is embodied by a clear desire to do a duty to something bigger than oneself.  The activities that result in this stage are usually ones of great responsibility, sometimes with others depending upon the individual. 
Examples of such activities include marriage, volunteering in a military organization, or becoming religiously devout or joining the monastic order.  During this religious stage, feelings of guilt are eventually encountered because no matter how devout, responsible, or courageous people can be, certain things occur that are out of their control and they inevitably fail themselves in some way by not being able to uphold their responsibility or oath.  For example, an individual could be the best soldier he can be, but alas, his comrade is felled by a bullet that he could not stop, and is thus guilt stricken.

Finally the individual undergoes a schism in which a discovery is made that one can really only be true to oneself, and that from this idiom stems the powerful realization of free will and the terrible responsibility that comes with it.  This final stage of realization is known as the existential or enlightened stage.  In this stage an individual is aware that his or her &quot;reason for being&quot; is solely decided by his or her own decisions, and nothing else.
This enlightenment is the mantle of true freedom, even onto the decision of suicide!

==Paris - Sartre==

Then in Paris, after the Second World War, many literary and philosophical ideas changed. Albert Camus wrote The Outsider, The Fall and The Plague.  

[[w:Jean-Paul Sartre|Jean-Paul Sartre]], who had studied under [[w:Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger]], started a magazine called ''[[w:Les Temps Modernes|Les Temps Modernes]]'' with [[w:Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].  Sartre's main philosophical book is ''[[w:Being and Nothingness|Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'Être et le Néant''), while ''[[w:Existentialism is a Humanism|Existentialism is a Humanism]]'' (''L'existentialisme est un humanisme'') is a concise and less technical work suitable for the beginner.  He also wrote plays, such as ''[[w:No Exit|No Exit]]'' (''Huis Clos''), and novels, such as ''[[w:Nausea (book)|Nausea]]'' (''La naus&amp;eacute;e'') and the ''[[w:The Roads to Freedom|The Roads to Freedom]]'' (''Les chemins de la liberté'') trilogy.

When discussing Sartre in the line of existentialists it may be useful to note that he was by far the most political of the lot.  Sartre became a Marxist and in some sense lost some respectability among many existentialists &amp;mdash; because he had begun to rely on an external set of values rather than an ''authentic'' set of choices.

== Interpersonal Body Language ==

Women on average are better at body language than men; it could even be said to be an innate knowledge. Thus, understanding body language is of great importance if you want to approach attractive women. 

It's up to men to decipher the implied meanings of their actions, but sadly, most men are generally lacking in this area. 

The consequence would be this: a man feeling that everything is going perfectly -- until the woman suddenly leaves him. 

When you meet a woman who interests you, one of the first things you should do is to observe the way she carries herself; the way she moves, stands, makes conversation with others, dilated pupils, shiny eyes, so on and so forth.

== Your own body language ==
List of things to consider:
* Eye contact
* Eyebrows
* Smiling
* Avoiding movement during a sitting interaction
* Hands
* Feet tend to point out their direction, so it's important that this language be conciliatory.
* Look forward and at one direction.
* Do not wiggle or jerk around.
* Maintain symmetry. If one side of the body does not match the other, that suggests that you only have half interest in the other person, that you are distracted with something else and not saying why.
* One suggestion is to look natural, which means to not think about this list.

If you stay in one place, then you can let the other person or persons find a comfortable distance from you. Continue to stay in one place while talking with the other person. If leaving the person, leave discretely, before the other person becomes completely disinterested with you.

Good posture potentially improves your confidence and the impression you make. Sit and stand straight, keep your shoulders back and your chest up. If you avoid reacting to your own humorous remarks, the other persons might react more.

''Do not change the angle of your body.'' That is, if the other person approached you first, and your body does not face the body of the other person, then do not reorient yourself. If you must reorient yourself, leave and return. It is best to show other persons that you are stable and consistent.

== Body language of other person ==
The meaning of some of the body language in this list has not yet been documented here.

* licking lips
* maintaining eye contact
* looking at you &quot;from below&quot; (persons might be trying to exaggerate the height difference between you)
* playing with hair
* touching your upper arm

In a social setting, try comparing the other person's body language with a third person with its interactions with you.

The &quot;personal space&quot; test consists of moving a little bit closer to another person at a social setting so that you are standing close and reducing the size of the space around another person. A person less interested in you will attempt to move away.

People instinctively raise their eyebrows when they meet interesting people. Use this to attempt to measure the interest that other people have with you. Interested or excited people will also have shiny eyes. The eyes have a tiny gland on the bottom of the eyelid secreting liquids such as tears and lubrication. When a person is interested or excited, the glands tend to secrete liquid thus giving the eyes the shiny appearance.
Maintaining eye contact shows a person's confidence level.

== Closed versus Open ==

Some persons form a barrier: arms crossed, legs crossed, or holding an object in front of themselves. Their body is closed. It is better to seek persons who have arms apart, legs uncrossed, and are facing in your direction; their body is open.

As an exception, if two persons like themselves well, then they might close their bodies while standing or sitting opposite each other. These persons are acting open; their bodies are only closed because they are closed to themselves.

== Leaning Forward versus Away ==

When sitting at a table, persons can either lean forward or away. If you lean forward, then you are more visible to other persons at the table; it is easier to converse with other persons who lean forward.

When comfort and trust have not yet been secured, leaning forward can be taken subconsciously as a sign of hostility. This can be used to subconsciously manipulate or train the other person's actions to your liking.

In contrast, leaning backward, away from the table, is a sign of disinterest. However, a person that leans backward but has their body open might simply be relaxing. Try using some jokes or humor to gain the interest of this person so that they begin leaning forward.

Therefore, if you want to invite someone home, or plan another social meeting with them, suggest making the invitation when the other person or persons are leaning forward with open bodies. Invite the person to meet with you for coffee or some other beverage, or tell them to write their telephone number, even if they must write it with your pen on your arm.

== Rapport ==
Rapport is the technique of mimicking the body language of the other person. If your body language mirrors the body language of other persons in the conversation, then you are implementing rapport. For example:

* If you are approaching a sitting person, you sit too.
* If the body of the other person is closed, avoid being open; that would seem intrusive.

Other persons sometimes check if you mirror their body language, and have more interest in persons with rapport. For the converse, you can check if the other person mirrors you.

{{NOTE|Rapport is more than mirroring the person you in a conversation with. Mirroring is just one of the things that can be done to Establish Rapport. Rapport is establishing a common ground with someone to make them feel comfortable and connected to you. People like those that are like themselves, so by showing body language similarities along with the common eye contact techniques,among many others, while carrying a conversation, rapport can be established.}}

== Definitions ==


'''Binocular Disparity'''

The difference between the two retinal images of an object. Because the right and the left eye are at slightly different positions from each other, they have to turn inwards in order to keep focus on an object as it approaches closer. The closer the object the more the eyes turn inwards. A listener can tell how alert the other person is by the angle or the eyes turning inwards. Binocular Disparity is what allows us to have three dimensional vision.

While talking to a person, subconsciously one can tell if the other person is paying attention. The more a listener focuses their vision on the speaker, the more the eyes turn inwards. A listener whose eyes are both turned straight forward reveals that he's not paying attention. Even though there is eye contact, the eyes should be turned in slightly in order to focus on the speaker.

Binocular Disparity can be used to subconsciously communicate relaxation or aggression. By focusing the eyes on a dot on the other person's face, one is perceived to be alert. Maintaining focus on the dot for longer time would make the person appear as aggressive or even angry such as zeroing in on a target.

On the contrary, looking at the whole face of the other person, and unfocusing the eyes, makes one come across as relaxed and friendly or even easy going. Unfocusing the eyes can be used as an aid in argument resolution. The decreased angle of the eyes turning inward makes one look as having relaxed. As a result, the other person sees a relaxed look of the eyes and tends to relax himself.

'''Cut Off / Facing Away''' 

A form of gaze avoidance or intrusion avoidance in which the head or the whole body is turned fully away to one side. 

A sudden cut-off gesture in conversation may indicate uncertainty or disagreement with a speaker's remarks. Sustained cut-off may reveal shyness or disliking.

A cut off is a form of angular distance. People also turn away as a form of being considerate and giving the other person space in a setting where moving away physically is impractical. During an intermission, the candidates in a debate would respectfully turn away, so as to give each other room to breathe. 

In salesmanship, looking suddenly up and to the side is a signal of the prospects skepticism. The sales agent themselves could turn their head or the whole body to the side to make their presence less pushy to the prospect. While walking away discourages prospects because of the retreating nature, the cut off can be used as a substitute for angular distance.

Facing away is a reaction to spatial invasion either one's own of the other persons. After the host and the various guests embrace, they back off and one or both always look away as an equilibrium-maintaining technique to re-establish a proper level of proximity. 

Males and people of greater physical size turn their heads away to the side more than do females and people of smaller stature who in turn find it more comfortable and easier to create distance by walking.

Both gaze aversion and torso rotation increase dramatically in conditions of crowding. 


'''Dancing as a Seduction Tool''' 

Dancing is one of those things that can either greatly enhance or totally destroy your chances to score depend on how good you are at it. Many guys would actually be better off just standing around trying to look cool, if the alternative is dancing badly. Women treat dancing as a form of &quot;safe sex&quot; (a fun, sensual activity without any of the risks  or downsides of actual sex), and a guy's ability to close-contact dance with women is often viewed by them as an indicator of sexual ability. 

There's a certain breed of guy called &quot;the dance partner&quot;. This guy likes to hang out all night in clubs, dance for hour after hour with many women, and go home with none of them. He might either be gay, or simply have no idea on how to translate the dancing into sex. Or simply like dancing.

A famous receiver for the Oakland Raiders named Fred Biletnikoff used to say that ''&quot;if you can put your hands on a pass, you should be able to catch it. If you have a woman in your arms, you should be able to get her into your bed. Dancing is an excellent way to get her into your arms. If she is with a group of girls, ask everyone at the table to dance one by one and work over to the one you want. If they are sitting there drinking and talking, watching the dance floor and keeping time to the music, they are ready to dance. Go ask, if they say no, laugh and have your comeback line ready. I have had girls that said no come back to me and want to know why I didn't ask them again. Usually those are the one's that go home with you too. I would say that 9 1/2 out of ten girls I ask to dance, go out on the floor with me. Energize them, then let things flow. Firm but gentle works most of the time.&quot;''


'''Ears, Right Ear vs. Left Ear'''

If you're stuck chatting up a &quot;mumbler&quot; (someone who will mumble their words instead of speaking clearly) at a cocktail party, lean in with your right ear. It's better than your left at following the rapid rhythms of speech, according to researchers at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. If, on the other hand, you're trying to identify a song playing softly in the elevator, turn your left ear toward the sound. The left ear is better at picking up music tones.


'''Eyebrow Raise'''

The tendency for people to raise their eyebrows as one approaches them face-to-face is usually indicative of esteem. If you walk down the street and encounter someone you don't know then the chances are that neither of you will raise your eyebrows. If you recognize each other, however, even if you do not greet each another, then eyebrows will likely raise and lower. Of particular interest here in a business-place context is that if one person is not rated highly by the other person then that person will not raise their eyebrows, even though they acknowledge the presence of the first person.

While meeting a person, briefly raise and lower the eyebrows to communicate greetings as the person enters your scope of vision. When accompanied by a slight backwards head tilt, the greeting gesture can be made to come across as very sincere and genuine. Both the zygomatic smile and the eyebrow movement are very popular body language tools used by sales people and politicians.



'''Hugging (Rocking)'''

Primate holding in the arms, a natural mothering response, is met with clinging, an infantile sign of needing to be mothered. Thus, embracing is the evolutionary correct way to say &quot;I love you,&quot; and the proper primate way to say &quot;I need you&quot; as well. As humans embrace, a gentle rocking motion from side to side occurs. Swaying, a positive sign, stimulates pleasure centers linked to the inner ear's vestibular sense. Not only do we rock babies, but also the adults we love. 

  
'''Kinesics''' 

The importance of body language is recognized worldwide - there will not be a training for sales people and management in which the study of body language is absent, for instance. In 1970 Julius Fast wrote his famous book &quot;''Body Language''.&quot; In it he writes about the study of the language of the body and called it: kinesica. More recent developed theories on human functioning have given life to Neuro Linguistic Programming. NLP uses body language as its main source of information to tell more about the way we operate as people, by ourselves or when we are together. For instance, we adjust our body position all the time to our environment when we are in company or in a public place. It has been researched that we have a higher success rate of getting our message across to another when we take on a similar position as him/her. Unconsciously we copy the others movements like crossing and uncrossing legs, turning our bodies this way or that. In NLP this process is called mirroring and could also be referred to as building rapport.

 

'''Love Signals'''

A great deal of our nonverbal communication bespeaks sexuality. Despite speech, courtship is best transacted in an unspoken medium through, e.g., lip-pouts, head-tilts, and shoulder-shrugs. Verbally saying &quot;I love you&quot; before showing love nonverbally in gesture, posture, and deed is apt to scare a partner away.

The lesson here? Don't tell a girl &quot;I love you&quot; too soon. Instead use body language gestures and nonverbal communication to show your feelings of interests. If you tell her your feelings, but you're too nervous and your body language in not in tune, she might perceive your verbal speech as insincere. First try to use non verbal signals. See also Rapport and Mirroring.


'''Masculinity'''

&quot;Keep shoulders broad but posture not *too* straight; keep eye contact; look other men in the eye and don't do the &quot;down &amp; away&quot;; don't cover face unless you are acting mischievous; slow movements; deep tonality; move from either the hips or the shoulders (generally); broad arm movements; move with a sense that you occupy a great deal of space -- that you have a large domain or territory; make your eyes expressive of emotion and not of excitement; learn to really dance (waltz, salsa, samba, flamenco, etc.) and this'll become second nature.&quot; alt.seduction.fast  


'''Right Brain vs. Left Brain'''

This theory of the structure and functions of the mind suggests that the two different sides of the brain control two different &quot;modes&quot; of thinking.  

Experimentation has shown that the two different sides, or hemispheres, of the brain are responsible for different manners of thinking. The following table illustrates the differences between left-brain and right-brain thinking: 

Left Brain: 

Logical

Sequential

Rational

Analytical

Objective

Looks at parts 


Right Brain:
Random

Intuitive

Holistic

Synthesizing

Subjective

Looks at wholes 


Some individuals have a distinct preference for one of these styles of thinking. Some, are more whole-brained and equally adept at both modes. In general, academia tend to favor left-brain modes of thinking, while downplaying the right-brain ones. Left-brain scholastic subjects focus on logical thinking, analysis, and accuracy. Right-brained subjects, on the other hand, focus on aesthetics, feeling, and creativity.

 

'''Pacing and Leading''' 

Pacing and leading is one of the keys to influencing people. It refers to meeting them at their map of the world (pacing) and then taking them where you want them to go (leading.) Rapport is a basic, behavioural signal that you have met someone at their map of the world. The simplest, most effective test for rapport is &quot;if you lead, they follow.&quot;

2) Choose a safe situation to practise mirroring an element of someone else's behaviour. When you have mirrored them for a while, and think you are in rapport with the person, scratch your nose. If they lift their hand to their face within the next minute or so, congratulate yourself: you have led their behaviour!

Skilled communicators have a wide range of behaviours they can mirror to build rapport. You can find a way to mirror virtually anything you can observe.

3) Increase the range of behaviours that you can mirror, and introduce deliberate rapport-building into situations where it will benefit you and others (nb. Use your common sense and choose low-risk situations to practice in.)

Note: It is possible to get rapport without pacing by being outrageous and/or dynamic in a way that drawn in the audience and catches their attention.

'''Pupil Dilation'''

The dilation of the pupils is an increase in the diameter of the pupils as they get bigger to take in more light as it gets darker. Dilating pupils is also indicative of interest. One can subconsciously tell if the other person is eager to see them by the size of the pupils in the other persons eyes. When the pupils are large in normal lighting conditions, the persons eagerness and alert perception is noticed. A person with fake interest would be smiling and showing positive gestures, but their pupils would remain small, thus giving the person away.

Pupil Dilation combined with Shining Eyes and Binocular Disparity could be used in communicating enthusiasm and warmth towards the subject.


'''Push Pull Technique'''

In the song Yellow by Coldplay, Chris Martin demonstrates using body language a Push Pull example.

&quot;Because I love you so&quot;. Stops, looks back, turns around, gives you a chance to leave, gives you space. Then when he sees that you really do want him, you would wait for him and you in the camera are there slowing down to stay with him. The camera was moving gradually along the beach and he was walking forward along the beach. Both he and the camera were together, that is how we could see him, and now that he slows down, we see that we are slowing down for him. But he doesn't make us, the audience wait, he is the one  who comes back. The camera is staying there, looking at him and he comes back, tight after he looks around first: Push, Pull.

Make your move, then if the girl's not going for it by saying yes right away, just give some space. If she waits for you to come back; she's yours.


'''Reconnaissance'''

Upon re-entering our home (after several hours of absence), we feel a peculiar need to wander about the space to &quot;check&quot; for intruders. In mammals, this behavior is known as reconnaissance: &quot;. . . in which the animal moves round its range in a fully alerted manner so that all its sense organs are used as much as possible, resulting in maximal exposure to stimuli from the environment. It thus 'refreshes its memory' and keeps a check on everything in its area. This is a regular activity in an already familiar environment, which does not require the stimulus of a strange object.

  

'''Shining Eyes'''

The eyes have a tiny gland on the bottom of the eyelid secreting liquids such as tears for use as lubrication. When a person is interested or excited, the glands tend to secrete liquid thus giving the eyes a shiny appearance. 

During courtship, shining eyes are used extensively to indicate a sign or attraction in the other person. When describing a guy, the girl might say &quot;there was something in his eyes.&quot; &quot;The lover's eyes&quot; is another term used to mark their characteristic appearance.

In practice, it is very hard to have shining eyes without having genuine intentions, therefore there is the belief that people can tell one another's motives subconsciously through face to face interaction.

Shining Eyes combined with Pupil Dilation and Binocular Disparity subconsciously communicate enthusiasm and warmth towards the subject. 

  

'''Symmetry''' 

The body plans of most animals, including humans, exhibit mirror symmetry, also called bilateral symmetry. They are symmetric about a plane running from head to tail (or toe).

Bilateral symmetry is so prevalent in the animal kingdom that many scientists think that it can't be a coincidence. After all, there are infinitely more ways to construct an asymmetrical body than a symmetrical one. And yet, fossilized evidence shows that bilateral symmetry had already taken hold in animals as early as 500 million years ago.

Therefore, bilateral symmetry must have evolved for a reason, the thinking goes. And over the years, scientists have come up with a number of hypotheses about what that reason might be. According to one, a body that is bilaterally symmetrical is easier for the brain to recognize while in different orientations and positions, thus making visual perception easier.

Another popular hypothesis is that symmetry evolved to help with mate selection. Experiments with birds and insects revealed that females prefer to mate with males possessing the most symmetrical sexual ornaments. Peahens, for example, prefer peacocks with more extravagant and symmetrical tails, and female barn swallows prefer males with long, symmetrical tail feathers.

Human experiments also show similar patterns.

Experiments have found that women are more attracted to men who have features that are more symmetrical than other men. One study even found that women have more orgasms during sex with men who were more symmetrical, regardless of their level of romantic attachment or the guys' sexual experience.

The connection between body symmetry and mate selection began to make sense when researchers started finding correlations between symmetry and health. One study found that men with asymmetric faces tend to suffer more from depression, anxiety, headaches and even stomach problems. Women with facial asymmetry are less healthy and more prone to emotional instability and depression.

Another study found that the more asymmetric a person's body was, the more likely they were to show signs of aggression when provoked.

Symmetry is also prevalent in the physical sciences and is woven into the very laws that govern our universe.

  
'''Tapping''' 

Tapping is a defensive gesture or a warning sign for a person not to come any closer. It doesn't necessarily mean that one wants the other person to leave, unless the tapping becomes very loud and even audible from a distance, which is then the area from which the person doing the tapping wants the people around them to clear. 

It is not an aggressive signal, but that of mainly wanting to hold things off, not come any close, keep things the way they are. The auditory effect of the tapping also has the verbal effect of not wanting to be disturber with conversation. The sound itself is meant to block of other sound as another person might try to speak and has a psychological effect of distracting the brains auditory cortex. It's like turning on the radio to distract oneself from noisy neighbors arguing across the hall, or pretending to be listening to a walkman when someone is trying to start a conversation.

Tapping in a physical sense also serves to designate one's territory. In a classroom setting or an office environment, one might tap their pencil against the side of the table meaning that he/she's busy so that nobody sits next to them in order to maintain the concentration.

  
'''Tense Eyes''' 

The eyes themselves don't tense as much as the eye lids around them and in tense situation, more particularly the lower eye lids. The eye lids close in around the eyes limiting their vision and in effect having an expression of zeroing in or targeting someone. When the eye lids are smaller it's hard to see the surrounding area, so the person has one location in their scope of vision in mind. It is the opposite of open body language and a sign of closed body language. In open body language a person is friendly willing and receptive. When the eyes are smaller, they are showing that they are not receptive. They are focused on one particular area of importance usually because it is perceived as a threat or a source of trouble.

The eyes can also be tense sometimes when a person is concentrating on a task, such as reading an important document, or working on an assignment, however, when dealing with personal interaction, tense eyes are very specifically associated with unfriendliness or hostility. Tensing of the eyelids could also help one so see better as the tension helps in the shaping of the eyes to focus. When a person is working on a task and not involved in a social setting, tense eyes would indeed be a method for the person to focus better. In a social setting people have adapted to use tense eyes as a means of communicating suspicion or wariness, particularly of an intellectual basis as opposed to emotional or personal.

A tense or unfriendly expression in the eyes is a sign that the person is disliking something that is something analytical or of technical nature. For instance when one's wife has tense eyes it could mean that she doesn't trust her husband in something like doing the bills or renovating the house. It doesn't mean that she's suspecting him of having an affair or believes he's forming an emotional attachment with another woman. The eyes mainly reveal thought processes and not matters of the hearth, unless a person  evaluates their personal relationships on an analytical level, which is rarely so.

 

'''Tense Mouth'''

Tense mouth is indicative of hostility or disagreement. It is closely related to the usage of the lower teeth which are associated with unfriendliness. It is an attempt to hide or not show off the lower teeth or make an offensive gesture with the mouth while in conversation with someone not particularly liked.

A tense mouth is visible through flattening and thinning of the lips. As opposed to full lips, the person is subconsciously tensing their lips in effect making them seem smaller and less visible. The lips are a very friendly and encouraging part of the face. When a person doesn't like someone, they inevitably find it hard to show their lips as a way of saying that they are not happy and they are not inviting. At the same time the person is trying not to show off their lower teeth too much, although this might happen, as this could be a very offensive and at times inappropriate display of facial expression.

The opposite of a tense mouth would be the lower lip protrusion, plumping lips (as in flirting), showing upper teeth and in effect smiling.

'''Through Look'''

Psychological technique to get oneself unattached to a particular person by not avoiding them in the field of vision, and at the same time to slowing down to make eye contact, so as to be uninfluenced. Used very often by public speakers. Public speakers are trained to make eye contact, to scan the room and at the same time not fixate on any one particular person or area. The purpose is to give everyone recognition and a chance to speak up, if a member of the audience has a question, but not to be otherwise distracted by any one particular person or object.

 
'''Touch (First Touch)'''

The first touch—a milestone in courtship—is likely to seem casual, unpremeditated, and &quot;accidental&quot; rather than serious. An eager hand reaches out to a neutral body part (a forearm or shoulder, e.g.) which reacts by accepting the contact or by pulling away. Sensitive pads of our fingertips used as tactile antennae gauge the slightest startle, tenseness, or hesitation of response. 

Negative replies include angling away, leaning away, and no reaction. 

Positive responses include 

* lifting the shoulders, shoulder shrug 
* sideward head-tilt, and 
* returning the touch with a touch. 

Thus, partners learn a great deal from the first manual contact, which deftly probes beneath spoken words to feelings. Touching another's body captures full attention, and is the evolutionary true test of where a partner stands. 


'''Touching '''

Research shows:  &quot;Wives under stress are soothed by husbands' touch.&quot;

Casual touching is one of the most powerful attraction triggers. The soothing effect of the touch could be seen in MRI scans of areas deep in the brain that are involved in registering emotional and physical alarm.

The 'touch' most commonly referred to is hand holding. There are other important reasons for holding her hand, but as this research confirms, it has an INSTANT soothing affect.

It is believed that casual touching, and hand holding in particular has a massive effect on success in long term relationships.

Researcher notes that this effect is many times more powerful with married couples, but even a complete stranger STILL had an effect on the woman's brain. It is possible for a total stranger, can trigger a soothing effect on any woman, DEEP in her subconscious mind, simply through the use of a simple touch.


'''Verbal Plumage - The lip sinking that is attractive in men and unattractive in women'''

Verbal Plumage is quite simply using exaggerated facial expressions and lips and mouth movement to talk with the face. We all move our lips and faces when we talk to deliver the sound. Verbal plumage is just that same facial behaviors to a greater volume especially when saying pleasant, soft or deep sounds. What ever kind of movement you make with your mouth and lips when you say words like &quot;you&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;feel&quot;, &quot;between&quot;, &quot;inside&quot;, &quot;deep&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, &quot;forever&quot;, &quot;no other&quot; etc. Girls like those words. They are just words to us guys, but to them they have special significance when we say it. The word &quot;special&quot; is another word.

When you say those words exaggerate the lip movement part of the word as if it has special significance for you too. Girls love that. They feel special when they hear those words, and you adding verbal plumage to it makes the word that much more profound as if you really mean it.

Verbal plumage doesn't have to be any particular words. Verbal plumage on its own is simply talking with the face by definition. To use it in the context of seduction would be to increase verbal plumage at particular words and phrases that have deep meaning and feeling attached to them.

Imagine you are talking to a deaf persona and you are trying to make your self understood. Imagine the extra kind of lip sinking you would do to express yourself. Do just that, but only do it with the right words when you are saying words that are pleasant to girls when they hear them. Here are some more words that girls like when you say them:

intention
true
reality
no choice
I want
appreciation
sincere
trust
come on
yes

In comparison, words like: call, go out, maybe, I don't know, no, number, meet etc. Girls don't like those words. They hear them all the time when guys try to hit on them and get their digits. Say less of those words, and when you do use them you are a ventriloquist at the time.

Girls are already very expressive and feeling when they talk. It's not attractive in a woman to use verbal plumage because that makes her even more touchy feely clingy when she talks. But in a guy, it makes him come by as caring and in touch with his feelings when talking to women.


'''Voice Training'''

Right before you call stand up and hum a little bit at a moderate to deep tone -- it'll improve the sound of your voice over the phone


'''Zygomatic Smile'''

A very &quot;pleasant&quot; smile, and one of the most sincere types of smiles which is very hard to produce on demand, is the zygomatic smile. A zygomatic smile is the real item, a genuine heartfelt smile that involves upturned corners of the mouth, wrinkling at the eyes, or crow's feet, and utilizes very many more facial muscles than we can easily control voluntarily. It is therefore virtually impossible to fake the zygomatic smile, and most of us, while not necessarily knowing it, can distinguish it from a &quot;phony&quot; smile.

Utilitarian theories of ethics judge an action by its consequences; an action is right, or duty, if it brings about the best balance of intrinsic good over intrinsic bad. Thus, utilitarians place an emphasis on the consequences of our actions or policies. Jeremy Bentham formulates this in his famous &quot;Principle of Utility.&quot; Utilitarianism is a well-known example of a branch of ethics known as consequentialism, which states that actions are morally judged by the impartially reckoned value of the consequences. That which is good or bad differs between different types of utilitarianism, hedonistic utilitarianism  and preference-respecting utilitarianism being the most noteworthy.

==History of utilitarianism==
Utilitarianism was founded by [[w:Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham]] and further developed by his disciple, [[w:John Stuart Mill|John Stuart Mill]]. Bentham was most interested in the ramifications that a utilitarian ethics would have for the law, and he developed a precise system for correlating a crime's detrimental effect on utility to the severity of its punishment. Mill explored utilitarianism from a more broadly philosophical perspective, and defended it from the critiques of opposing ethicists. Mill did this by taking Bentham's dictum that what was important was the precise amount of happiness and adding a factor of quality, where quality is determined by &quot;competent judges&quot; who are capable of fully enjoying the given pleasure. More than this, however, Mill suggested that some happiness was of such a high quality that any amount of it would be preferable to any amount of a happiness which was of a lesser quality. This thesis is controversial, partially because it is patronizing, but primarily because Mill's reasoning behind introducing it -- that there are some happinesses which are of such a high quality that a well informed and independent jury would always choose some of that happiness over any amount of another -- is far from rigorous and might simply not be the case.

Another 19th Century Philosopher, [[w:Henry Sidgwick|Henry Sidgwick]], re-interpreted utilitarianism along lines which are more commonly used today. He found that the classification of utility as happiness was clumsy and so began to talk about utility as a measure of desire and satisfaction. Thus, something would be good on utilitarian grounds if it satisfied the desires of many people, and bad if it did not, or if it went against their desires.

Two branches of utilitarianism that are still recognized today eventually developed:

Act utilitarianism, or AU, states that if an agent is faced with a moral decision, it is morally obligatory to make the choice that brings the highest total pleasure to everyone affected.

Rule utilitarianism, or RU, states that it is morally obligatory for everyone to act in accordance with the set of moral rules such that if everyone acts in accordance with this set of rules, more pleasure is produced than if everyone acts in accordance with any other set of moral rules.

==Utilitarianism today==
Peter Singer is a contemporary philosopher whose basic approach to ethics is utilitarian.

==Criticism==
Professor James Rachels critiqued the philosophy of utilitarianism, mainly by attacking the following points:
#Actions are judged to be right or wrong only on the basis of their consequences
#The only consequence that matters is whether happiness or unhappiness results
#No one's happiness is more or less important than another's- each are equally important

The first flaw that Rachels identified with Utilitarianism was making happiness the goal that we seek out in our endeavors.  While this may be attractive in principle, Rachels claims that it is very flawed in practice.  An example proving this is if a friend bad-mouths somebody behind their back, Utilitarianism will claim that it is a moral action, because the person is not aware; Ergo, it did not cause them any harm.  Rachels suggests that one should not seek out friends in order to make him or herself happy.  Instead, happiness should be a response to what one has achieved or obtained.

Another point that Rachels makes is regarding the dogma of only considering the consequence of an action important, rather than the action itself.  For example, if a police officer is accused of abusing somebody based on their race, clearly the best solution according to utilitarianism would be to find the officer guilty, and punish them severely, as this will cause the greatest number of people to achieve happiness.  Rachels would refute this by saying that this is not moral, since although more people are happy, one person was ruined without receiving fair representation.  Rachels would claim that they should receive a just trial, and be prosecuted according to the law.  Another example is if there is a person who has hidden cameras in the washroom, utilitarianism would claim that this is morally right, due to the fact that he didn't cause anybody unhappiness, and increased the happiness of himself.  Rachels would deny this, and claim that his actions were immoral.

Rachels also attacks the Utilitarianist argument that everybody is equal, and your own happiness is no more important than anybody else's.  He claims that this is completely impractical, as one can usually increase the happiness of somebody else whenever they buy something.  For example, if one has $20 that they can either spend on new shoes, or they can donate it to help the poor, obviously donating it will help more people (i.e. in Africa), but is it reasonable to sacrifice the happiness of yourself and your loved ones in order to help complete strangers? Rachels would claim that it is not.

Other often cited criticisms of utilitarianism are that the philosophy doesn't take into account a person's intention. Did a person that took an action intending to maximize happiness do something immoral if the action ends up decreasing happiness? If four people need an organ transplant to live, would it be a moral act to kill one person against his will and transplant his organs into those people so that they will live? If Utilitarianism states that any action that maximizes happiness is good, then killing one person against his will in order to save others would be a moral act.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The philosophy of mind is about the form and content of our thoughts, and how and why we come to think them. Understanding the philosophy of mind gives us some fairly universally applicable rules to understand ourselves, other people, animals and even computers.

Philosophy of mind covers similar domains to psychology and psychiatry, and helps us look at these disciplines within a specifically philosophical context.

You can either look at things in a hermetic (closed) or empirical (open) way.

Philosophy of mind is closely connected to cognitive psychology. It is connected also to neuroscience, which is still attempting to sort out (once and for all) whether our minds and our brains are separate.

Questions one may ask are: 'What is the difference between reality and illusion?', 'How is the mind related to the body, or to physical things in general?', 'How do I know that other minds exist?'  In studying these questions one might start with Descartes' Meditations, then go on to study George Berkeley, Edmund Husserl and Gilbert Ryle, to mention just one or two.

Further questions include: 'What, if anything, is the &quot;subconscious&quot;?'  If this cannot be put on a sound footing, how do we talk about 'self deception'?  'What, if anything, is &quot;mental illness&quot;?'

Another area of philosophy of mind that grew during the second half of the 20th Century is artificial intelligence.  The Turing test challenges us to say whether we are talking to a human being or to a computer. People have been developing computers to the point where these tools could be said to have minds. Perhaps they will think autonomously.

Philosophy of mind can be expressed as 'thoughts about thoughts'.

Further Inquiries into Philosophy of Mind involve questions of whether specific thoughts or activities of the mind such as perception of color or feeling pain can be identified, in a strict sense, with the physical brain event which corresponds to such mental activities, or whether there is a distinction between the two.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Donaldz. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Donaldz~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

The traditional cuisine of Poland is characterised by [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], especially [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Dill|dills]]. [[Cookbook:Lunch|Lunch]] and [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]] tend to be heavy.

[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]] is usually simple, often meatless, and taken at 6-9 o'clock. Lunch is taken at 2-3 o'clock and dinner is taken at 4-7 o'clock.

The most well-known dish outside Poland is perhaps [[Cookbook:Bigos|bigos]]. It is a [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] (pickled [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]) and [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] (usually [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]) dish.

Poland has recently provided well for those who are vegetarian, and the desserts are usually fruity in nature.

Bigos is a very traditional Polish dish. It is claimed that its origins come from Polish hunting traditions where hunters would cook up their catch with cabbage, wild mushrooms and sausage. Recipes for Bigos vary from family to family but there are several ingredients that are almost universal: Cabbage, Sausage (usually smoked), Onions, Salt Pork, Bacon and Venision. As most modern cooks don't have easy access to good quality venison, pork and, less frequently, beef are often substituted. The variation using beef and referenced in the introduction of this section, is called Bigos Hultajski. (See Polish Heritage Cookbook by Robert and Maria Strybel) Bigos Myśliwski is the version more usually associated as the traditional Bigos. You can also add prunes or wild Polish Mushrooms ( Borowik - Boletus edulis).

{{vegetable}}

A radish is a root [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]], which is usually grown in the spring (Northern Hemisphere) and autumn (Southern Hemisphere). It is grown all over Europe, America, Asia and the Pacific.

It appears as a white vegetable with a tough red skin.

Radish often has a piquant taste and burns the tongue

A radish can be used as a garnish for [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]], or in its own right as an ingredient in a pie or soup.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Life on Earth is astonishingly complex.  There are tens of millions of living ''species'', or kinds of organisms.  Some endangered species have just a few individual organisms, while others have quadrillions.  Every individual organism is, all by itself, an extremely complicated object, with many interacting parts.  Further, organisms interact with other organisms, of the same species and of other species, to form an inconceivably complex network of causes and effects.

Evolutionary biology studies the origin and methods of this complexity.  Evolutionary biologists try to answer questions like: Why are there so many species, and how did they come to be?  What are the relationships between species and how did these relationships arise?  How did organisms develop their intricate structures and ways of life?  Why do species become extinct?  How did life originate in the first place?

In the last two hundred years, great advances have been made in answering many of these questions.  An overarching theory, the theory of ''evolution by modification and natural selection'', first expounded by Charles Darwin in the 1850's, has been very successful at explaining the origin of life's complexity in general, although many puzzling questions remain unanswered.

This book will present our current understanding of how life on Earth got the way it is, and describe current research directions in this profound and fascinating field.

== What is this, John? ==

:What is this John? [[Alice in Cyberwonderland]]. -- [[user:zanimum]]
::John, I think [[Alice in Cyberwonderland]] violates [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]], rule #4, ''Wikibooks is not fiction''. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:09, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::Genteen, thanks for pointing this out, as I realize at first glance Alice in Cyberwonderland does appear to be fiction, and your concern gives me an opportunity to talk about the underlying conceptual framework of '''Alice in Wonderland''' and how it is intended to serve as a '''teaching tale'''.

:::For as Alice journeys through the various doors, windows, gates and digital passageways. etc, she learns - albeit in an uncoventional, fantastic way - about the remarkable and fascinating properties of a real-time, interactive. digital, knowledge-based universe. I have outlined some of the details below, and slightly reorganized what I had written here before. [[User:John Doe|John Doe]] 01:41, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Alice in Cyberwonderland - A Teaching Tale ==

:'''4. ... Wikibooks primary mission is to create open source textbooks, how-to guides, and classroom aids.'' - from [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]]

:'''Alice in Cyberwonderland''' - and any such sequels as might emerge, e.g. '''Alice Through the Windows''', '''Alice's Adventures in Wikiwonderland''', although on the surface a work of fiction and fantasy, is being written as an imaginative vehicle of discovery of the wonders of a digital universe: a universe not subject to the constraints of the laws of conservation of mass and energy - as everything that lives in a purely digital form has '''zero mass''', '''zero physical size''', with '''virtually zero travel time''', a universe governed by the laws and properties of information, information systems; a world where the nture of proerty has become transformed, with the nature of information itself favouring the freedom of expression, exploration. inquiry and exchnage that a wiki, open source, open content, interactive information powered by evolving interoperable digital engines whose creative work consumes virtually no energy, where the same entity can be in many places at the same time and in many different forms ...

:Among the specific examples of how Alice's adventures open up exploration and discovering of the naure of digital universes are the '''light and colour cubes'''[http://www.light-cubes.net] - soon to be the basis for another Wikibook - and her discovery of the state of the '''[[Mesopotamian Marshlands]]''' will led her into a journey through time and space where becomes a participant in the emergence of a new knowledge-based civilization in which the restoration of the decimated Mesopotamian Marshes in Southern Iraq serves as a catalyst for a rebirth in the cradle of civilization.

:Alice also becomes immersed in a world of '''information species''' - a few of which have already been identified in the current draft - and begins to become aware of the wonders of information ecosystems and [[Information Ecology]].
:I could go into more detail - in fact I did so yesterday but neglected to save the draft - and hadn't found the time get back here until a short time go - however, the hour is late. More - or less - later.

=== A Tale Whose Time Has Come ===

::&quot;''There is a tide in the affairs of man''
::'' Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune''
:: ...
::''On such a full sea are we now afloat;''
::''And we must take the current when it serves,''
::''Or lose our ventures.''
:::'''Brutus''' in '''Julius Caesar''' by William Shakespeare

=== A tribute to Lewis Carroll ===

:A self-revealing light-hearted tribute to '''Lewis Carroll''' - ''aka'' '''Rev. Charles Dodson'' - and a choice to follow Rev. Dodson's footsteps of anonymity.

:An exploration of a different wonderland, one that did not exist in Lewis Carroll's time. If Lewis Carroll were alive now, might not he - as a mathematician - have been fascinated by the wonders of digital technology. Might he not have conjured up tales for a modern-day Alice that took place in today's '''lookinglass''' - plus microscope and telescope - world of the Internet?

=== A tribute to mathematics ===

:The commmon bond of mathematics is a special bridge to the mind to Lewis Carroll, for the '''mathematics of information''' - including zero mass, zero physical size, and virtually zero travel time - and fields such as '''chaos mathematics''', '''mathematical biology''' and more have been among the numerous sources of inspiration to John Doe's alter ego in his explorations and appreciation of the dynamics of a digital knowledge-based universe.

=== An imaginary journey through the wonders of a digital universe ===

:For the tale that reveals itself, is a tale of global transofrmation - transition to a center of gravity - and levity too - a new '''Nash Equilibirum''' based on the properties and dynamics of the digital knowledge-based universe that many '''John Doe'''s - and '''Jane Doe'''s too - discover themselves immersed in the vast, wonderful and mysterious information ecosystem - see, for example, the wikibook on '''Information Ecology'''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Ecology] - with virtually no boundaries, and virtually free from the constraints of the laws of conservation of mass and energy.

=== Improvisatonal Plays ===

:In a world that at time can be osessed with '''work''', Alice in Cyberwonderland is a space for '''improvisational play''' - playing with words and meanings, with numbers and mathematical expresions, plays of apparent illusion and disillusion - plays of paradox ... and in the process, rediscovering how we can - and do - learn through interactive play and games.

::''The play's the thing,''
::''Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.''
:::'''Hamlet''' in ''Hamlet''', Act 2, Scene 2, by William Shakespeare

=== An Invitation to explore and discover Cyberwonderland ===

== Revelation of a &quot;Gaia Mind&quot;? ==

:Perhaps it will become '''self-evident''' that what is arising through the birth and evolution of new forms of collective intelligence is no less than the manifestation of a '''Gaia Mind''' - a mind that serves as the key to a new era in the life of Gaia - the Earth and the commuity of life of the Earth

=== Catalyst: the Mesopotamian Marshlands ===

:Who knows? Perhaps the regeneration of the '''Mesopotamian Marshlands'''[http://www.mesopotamian-marshlands.net] - ''between the rivers - a cradle of civilization'' - may be the venue through which clear evidence of the presence and workings of a Gaia Mind become revealed - '''hotspots''', '''tension points''' that reflect the convergence of almost all of the dimensions of tension and conflict on the Earth and that may, going beyond the '''canary in the coal mine''', may not only be alerting us to the perils of the distortion of '''moral and economic values''' associated with a world addicted to '''unsustainable fossil-fuel-dependence''' and a reliance on military force and '''weapons of destruction''' to suppress conflict, rather than a way that '''honours the earth''', treasures the '''healing powers of hwater''', and where civilization and the laws of the land uphold nonviolent, '''peaceful resolution of conflict'''.

== Who is John Doe? ==

=== John Doe - Everybody, Anybody ===

:In common usage, '''John Doe''' is '''anybody''' - and '''everybody''' - and seems to be a fitting name for a '''wikibook author'''

:In this wikibook, anybody - even '''you''' - can be a co-author, a contributor, perhaps even a member of the cast of what might even evolve into a feature-length interactive '''open source dvd movie''' ...

=== John Doe &amp; Lewis Carroll ===

:'''like''' Lewis Carroll, John Doe's ''alter ego'' is a '''mathematician'''
::'''unlike''' Lewis Carroll, John Doe's ''alter ego'' read mathematics at '''Cambridge''', not '''Oxford'''
:'''like''' Lewis Carroll, John Doe's ''alter ego'' loves '''reading''' imaginary tales to '''young children'''
::'''unlike''' Lewis Carroll, John Doe's ''alter ego'' is a '''father''' - of one daughter and two sons
:'''like''' Lewis Carroll, John Doe's ''alter ego'' is a '''person of faith'''
::'''unlike''' Lewis Carroll, John Doe's ''alter ego'' has no formal credentials as to his faith

=== John Doe and the Housing Court of Kings ===

:While the seeds of '''Alice in Cyberwonderland''' had begun to germinatre earlier, it was the appearance of John Doe in the '''Housing Court of Kings'''[http://habitat.igc.org/housing-court-of-kings] that that both inspired the as-yet barely revealed episodes of '''Alice in the Housing Court of Kings''' and led to he adoption of the name of John Doe as the alias under which Alice would be writeen.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called John Doe. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name John Doe~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Changes within a gene pool occurring from generation to generation is called '''microevolution'''. Allele frequencies in a population may change due to gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection and mutation. These are referred to as the four fundamental forces of evolution. Note that only mutation can create new genetic variation. The other three forces simply rearrange this variation within and among populations.

The main factors change frequencies of alleles for a single genetic locus and therefore cause genetic variation on a small scale. The following causes of microevolution allow violations of the Hardy Weinberg assumption
# Genetic Drift
# Natural Selection
# Gene Flow
# Mutation


==Genetic Drift==
In genetic drift there is a genetic variation among allele frequencies of that population due to random chance. Therefore a small population would allow for higher chance of sampling error and a change in allele frequencies as a result would lead to a misrepresentation of the parent generations gene pool. The misrepresentation of allele frequencies causing a change in the population is an evolutionary process. 

===Bottleneck Effect=== 
The bottleneck effect results in a drastic change of allele frequencies of a gene pool causing genetic drift. This dramatic change in allele's occurs as a result of natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods. The portion of the population that survives such a circumstance will then be overrepresented in the gene pool while causing a reduced population size. Genetic variation is reduced due to the smaller population size and over representation of certain allele frequencies.

===Founder Effect===
Another dramatic mechanism for genetic drift is due to the a small number of individuals from an originally larger population inhabiting a new isolated geographic region such as an island, lake, or some other new habitat. This is not to be confused with immigration because in immigration a population already inhabits the region when new individuals to the region begin to inhabit it. These new individuals make up the gene pool of their original population and now represent it in the new habitat but in a smaller proportion. This affects the allele frequencies of that population.

===Inbred Populations===
Inbreeding refers to non-random mating among closely related individuals. These situations tend to increase the chance of the homozygous condition, thus leading to lower fitness and survival rates.

Inbreeding and homozygous conditions lead to higher-possibilities in expressing recessive or negative traits.

==Natural Selection==
A population can evolve by natural selection where the traits characterizing a population can change over time when its individuals differ in heritable traits that are responsible for differences in survival and reproduction.

===Gene Flow===
Gene flow refers to changes in allele frequency that result from migration of individuals between populations. In the absence of gene flow, populations can become genetically distinct from one another through genetic drift, or due to differing natural selection pressures in the different populations. Gene flow has the effect of minimizing the genetic differences between populations. Surprisingly little gene flow is needed to keep populations from diverging. Sewall Wright demonstrated that only one migrant per generation is necessary to prevent two populations from diverging.

==Mutation==
Mutation is the ''ultimate'' source of all new genetic variation. Mutations are random, heritable changes in DNA that can alter gene expression. However, they occur rarely. Most new mutations are expected to be neutral to mildly deleterious, with relatively fewer highly advantageous or highly deleterious mutations. How quickly a mutation spreads through a population depends on its effect of fitness (advantageous vs. deleterious), and also whether it is dominant, co-dominant, or recessive. In general recessive mutations should spread slowly, since they initially will show up in heterozygotes, so the effect of the new mutation is not seen until two of these heterozygotes mate to produce offspring which are homozygous for the mutation (and therefore the effect of the mutation can be seen). In contrast, dominant mutations may spread quickly, since their effects are seen immediately when they are present in heterozygous form. Mutations are the ONLY source of new alleles.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Moolsan. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Moolsan~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Mesopotamian Summer ==

Hello EuroprachBHT

Thanks for your additions to the discussion page, I have been following so many other streams of information and peeople - as the Mesopotamian Marshlands process have evolved into a Mesopotamian  Summer - to be lauched on Sunday, June 20, 8:57 pm (EST). I have not been monitoring this wikibook although I have been substantially expanding the contents and structure of the daabase that gnerated the pages and have been gathering and compiling much information - especially maps - from the early days of mesopotamia

I have also been making a lot of phone calls, and the gathering, organizing, compiling growing quanitities of remarkable infomration, and processively importing then into what will soon be renamed as the MESO-SUM digital engine 

I would love to talk with you about the process, and would be happy to phone you if you email me your phone number - I will also send you an email [[User:Information Ecologist|Information Ecologist]] 06:07, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)


from attention-tunnel
Hello EuropracBHIT, I like to answer you. Is this the way I send messages??

To answer your question: 1) No, I did not ask Edan for approval to use the name 'Aspergia'. Therefore I should maybe change the name to something else. I don't want to cause any trouble. My intent was to rembmer people of the idea of 'Re-Branding Aspergia' of which an explenation is on Aspergia. It really doesn't have to have the names Aspergia. Its about the spirit. 2) Murray and Lesser both agreed and are very happy to have their content made publicly available. I have not yet gotten a response from Walker. They like both Creative Commons and GNU. The idea is 1) to translate the papers by the hlp of wiki technology, 2) have it freely available for everyone, 3) encourage delevopment of this model of mind.

== aspergia book ==

Thanks. I got your message about these autism writings. I haven't looked into the autism and computing books. The only book of which I was aware was the &quot;Aspergia Book&quot;. The idea for the book seems to have been posted on the [http://www.wrongplanet.net/ WrongPlanet.net site] [http://www.wrongplanet.net/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=915 here]. I don't know exactly how much this will fit the purpose of wikibooks, but it seems to be in preliminary stages so I'm inclined to let it stay since it could provide information about Asperger's that could be incorporated into other articles as well. I wouldn't try to get it deleted or anything because it looks harmless right now.

The GFDL violations, however, should not be tolerated. I think it would be a good idea to ask attention-tunnel to provide a link to another site hosting the content. Even if these were under the GFDL, they would probably be more appropriately placed in Wikisource. I hope this helps!

Hi EuropracBHIT, I noticed that you put Categories on ''each'' subpage of [[The Golden Bough]]. I think, having the main page of a book in the Categories like [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Religion Religion] or Magic would be enough, as anything else will completely fill up the Categories pages so that they are not usable anymore... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:35, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

If you're going to contribute to South American books, please make sure to eliminate any racist white supremacist views out of source material you're using. And just in case they're your views, I know Poles are overwhelmingly racists and white supremacists (and anyone who disagrees is either #1 not Polish, or #2 is a racist) but that doesn't mean you're allowed to try to teach these really despicable views to children.

This book is about the creation and analysis of efficient data structures. It covers:

* the primitive '''node''' structure;
* '''asymptotic notation''' for mathematically discussing performance characteristics;
* built-in '''arrays''';
* '''list structures''' built from either nodes or arrays;
* '''iterators''' as an abstract model of enumerating the items in a sequence;
* '''stacks''' and '''queues''' for computing with last-in/first-out and first-in/first-out orderings;
* binary and general '''tree''' structures for searching or representing hierarchical relationships;
* min and max '''heaps''' for representing ordering based on priorities;
* '''graph''' structures for representing more general relationships between data elements;
* '''hash tables''' for the efficient retrieval of strings and other objects; and finally
* '''trade-offs''' between the structures, and strategies for picking the most appropriate ones.

To understand the material in this book you should be comfortable enough in a programming language to be able to work with and write your own variables, arithmetic expressions, if-else conditions, loops, subroutines (also known as functions), pointers (also known as references or object handles), structures (also known as records or classes), simple input and output, and simple recursion.

Because many different languages approach the construction of data structures differently, we use pseudo-code so that you can translate the code into your own language.

== Why a book on Data Structures? ==
A [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?|Wikibook]] is an undertaking similar to an open-source software project: A contributor creates content for the project to help others, for personal enrichment, or to accomplish something for the contributor's own work (e.g., lecture preparation).

An open book, just like an open program, requires time to complete, but it can benefit greatly from even modest contributions from readers. For example you can fix &quot;bugs&quot; in the text (where the bug might be typographic, expository, technical, aesthetic or otherwise) in order to make a better book. If you find an opportunity to fix a bug, simply click on &quot;edit&quot;, make your changes, and click on save. Other contributors may review your changes to be sure they are appropriate for the book. If you are unsure, you can visit the discussion page and ask there. Use common sense.

If you would like to make bigger contributions, you can take a look at the sections or chapters that are too short or otherwise need more work and start writing! Be sure to skim the rest of the book first in order to avoid duplication of content. Additionally, you should read the [[Algorithms/Guidelines_for_Contributors|Guidelines for Contributors]] page for consistency tips and advice.

Note that you don't need to contribute everything at once. You can add the template &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TODO|description of what remains to be done}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;, to pages and perhaps someone else will finish those parts for you.

This book is intentionally kept narrow-in-focus in order to make contributions easier (because then the end-goal is clearer). This book is part one of a series of three computer science textbooks on algorithms, continuing on to the techniques of algorithms in ''[[Algorithms]]'' and ending with ''[[Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]]''. If you would like to contribute a topic not already listed in any of the three books try putting it in the ''Advanced'' book, which is more eclectic in nature. Or, if you think the topic is fundamental, you can go to either the [[Talk:Algorithms|Algorithms]] or the [[Talk:Data Structures|Data Structures]] discussion page and make a proposal.

Additionally, implementations of the data structures (in either Ada, C, C#, Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, or Scheme) as an appendix are welcome.

This textbook aims to cover what CS majors learn in an introductory data structures and algorithms programming course.

----

Do we want to do everything for this subject on one page, or make this just a page of links?  I like the second idea better.

''I prefer dropping new information here until a section gets &quot;too big&quot;. Then split off that section onto its own page. See http://CommunityWiki.org/BigBucketsFirst --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:41, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC) ''

I agree with that article's logic. I'll copy the material from my linked list page back to this page, and work on it here.  Later on, maybe we'll span off to other pages aka buckets. --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]]

:I think the buckets right now are too small. I think it would be easier (because this is a textbook) to divide the book into chapters, and have each chapter be a subpage (if necessary). Anything finer grained than chapters would mean a lot of clicking and it would be easy to miss having a coherent voice in the book (both for contributing authors and for readers). But that's just my own feelings on the matter: I want these to seem like real books instead of just indexes to entries in the wikipedia. [[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 09:31, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Format ==

I'd like to join the project if I may.  I'm ready to tackle a couple of these topics.  Is there a particular format to use?--[[User:Wcrowe|Wcrowe]] 21:34, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I would like to suggest a change in the order of the chapters.  I would like to have Graphs moved before Trees, as a tree is simply a special case of a graph.
[[User:Pesto|Pesto]] 04:11, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
:I see what you are getting at, but the question is What's the best didactic ordering? After all, linked-lists are just another form of graph, further, they are another form of tree, so why not discuss linked-lists last? But to be serious, I think tree traversal algorithms are easier to understand than graph traversal algorithms. And by also being more limited, trees provide a good introduction to the concept of graphs. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:37, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

If you write an article, you get to choose the format.  Later on, people might improve the format, but at the beginning, we should just get out something and let people work on refining later. --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 17:15, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)

We should use header markup (with the equal signs) rather than bullet markup.  The header markup builds  the table of contents.  Also, we should put articles into the Programming:Data_Structures namespace for now.  I'm starting a linked list article.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 17:22, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:I agree: looking at a table of contents gives a better idea of what the book is like, and encourages more modifications and additions. I'm going to change the format to that. [[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 09:48, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== I dropped the variables and types section. ==

It links to a javascript page right now that I don't think is relevant.  Everyone: remember to use the namespace Programming:Data Structures:your topic for your articles.--[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 22:55, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Wikipedia links are good, but... ==
This is a textbook, therefore, IMO, sections should use a how-to approach.  You will immediately see that this differs quite a bit from an encyclopedic approach.  I hope it is everyone's intent to ''teach'' these subjects, step by step, rather than just create a collection of Wikipedia links.

== Page Structure ==

I'd rather not make a large change without some discussion, but it seems to me that the sorting portion should be moved to the bottom.  I kind of visualize this page as three sections:

I wasn't planning on laying out the whole menu.  I just meant to put in some examples, but I went further than I intended.  I think that this breakdown gives us better control over presenting pros &amp; cons of collection selections (Since the list selections are together and the stack selections are together), and is more consistant.

 Primary Storage Types
    Single object allocation (used to implements linked lists, most trees, ...)
    Array (used to implement array list, most stacks, circular queues, ...)
 Secondary Storage Types
    Lists
       Common list operations &amp; example
           Set(pos, val), Get(pos), remove(pos), append(val)
       Implemented as a Linked List
           Single linked list
           Double linked list
       Implemented as an Array List
    Stacks
       Common stack operations &amp; example
           Push(val), Pop (, peek?)
       Implemented on a Linked List
       Implemented on an array
    Queues
       Common queue operations &amp; example
            enqueue, dequeue
       Implemented as LinkedList
       Implemented as an array (circular, fixed size queue)   
       Special cases
           Dequeues (What is this used for, by the way?)
    Trees &amp; Graphs (isn't a tree just a special case of a graph?)
       Common tree operations &amp; example
            add, get, remove
       Implemented as links (like linked list)
       Implemented in an array (Heap)
       Special cases
           Binary tree
              Balanced
           Quad tree
           Graphs
    Hash Tables
        ...
 How do I choose a data structure for a given situation?
    Sorts
    Big O notation
    Combinations
       ArrayList and Hashtable
    ...

--[[User:BillKress|BillKress]] 23:06, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Big O Notation should be discussed in front because it is used throughout the rest of the material.  You should also include the discussion of Abstract Data Types and information hiding in fron too. -- [[User:Gdarwin|Gdarwin]] 06:42, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Hi Bill, sorry for the late reply. That structure looks much better, though I would put trees in a section before graphs, because the traversal concepts like inorder, preorder, and post-order (for binary trees) is really something separate enough. After queues should be heaps, aka priority queues, and then the heap sort. For graphs, depth-first and breadth-first should be covered. Below is what I suggest: [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:00, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Introduction
   What is Data Abstraction?
 The Node
   The most elementary data structure
 Arrays
   Matricies: two dimensional arrays
   Insertion sort on an array
   Binary search on a sorted array
 List Structures
   Common list operations &amp; example
     set(pos, val), get(pos), remove(pos), append(val)
       [not sure about these operations: what about next()? or iterators?]
       [Perhaps discuss operations on Nodes, versus operations on the List
       itself: example, Nodes have a next operation, but the List itself has
       a pointer to the head and tail node, and an integer for the number of
       elements. This view would work well in both the Lisp and OO worlds.]
   Doubley linked list
   Vectors (resizeable arrays)
 Iterators
   Operating on sequences without knowledge of the sequence itself
 Stacks and Queues
   Common stack operations &amp; example
     push(val), pop, and peek
   Implemented on a Linked List
   Implemented on an array
   Common queue operations &amp; example
     enqueue, dequeue
   Implemented as LinkedList
   Implemented as an array (circular, fixed size queue)
   Dequeues
 Trees
   Common tree operations &amp; example
     add, get, remove
   Binary trees
     in order, pre order, post order traversals
     Balanced binary trees
   Iterators for trees
 Min and Max Heaps
   A tree implemented as an array! (not to be confused with the heap in memory)
   Percolation
   Heap sort
   Treaps: heaps where elements can be deleted by name
 Graphs
   Directed and Undirected graphs
     matrix and list representations
   Depth-First Search
   Breadth-First Search
   Topological sort
 Hash Tables
   Iteration order for hash tables by augmenting the structure
    - iterating over items in the order in which they were inserted
    - iterating over the items based on most-recently-used
 Sets
   Different implementations
    - lists, binary search trees, bit arrays, hashtables
   Disjoint Sets (operations: union, find)
 Tradeoffs between Data Structures
   Use asymptotic behaviour to decide, most importantly seeing how the
   structure will be ''used'': an infrequent operation does not need to be
   fast if it means everything else will be much faster

The content is designed to compliment the Algorithms text book (the idea is that the reader would cover the DS book first, then the Algo book, and then the [[Computer Science/Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms|Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]] book that would pick up the more random and advanced ideas). Most importantly, I'd like to see each book be small enough that it can be read completely in one or two semesters. The more reference-based or encyclopedic content could be saved for either the Advanced book or the wikipedia. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:00, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Incoherent Structure ==

I agree.  I find it odd that a lot of list based structures are currently placed under linked lists, when these structures can obviously be impleneted as an array.

Your layout looks good, but I was wondering if we can add a disccusion about big O notation.  I see it used here, but where is it formally defined?

[[User:Gdarwin|Gdarwin]] 16:13, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Proposed structure has been modified.  I'd still like to hear one or two more people say that they prefer this structure before I refactor.

--[[User:BillKress|BillKress]] 23:04, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Duplication for Array ==

Currently we have some 2 articles on arrays one here and one in [[Programming:Arrays]]. We should merge realy leavin only a short into here and move the rest off.

* [[Programming:Arrays]] is only a redirect to [[Data Structures/Arrays]].  --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 06:47, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

* I think the DS book should only talk about the most basic form of arrays, that is, integer-indexed arrays. Many of the other topics currently mentioned, like associative arrays, won't make sense to the reader because they haven't read about hash tables (which use simple arrays and linked-lists) or binary search trees yet. The purpose of our story should be abstraction, abstraction, abstraction, and show how the complex gets built up from the very simple; not how the complex gets built up from things just as complex. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:50, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

*: Speaking of integer based array: even that leaved the question of &quot;which integer&quot;? &lt;small&gt;(See: [[Ada Programming/Types/array]])&lt;/small&gt;. Before the almost assembler like C came out &lt;small&gt;(and predended to be a higher language)&lt;/small&gt; it was almost part of the definition of a &lt;small&gt;(real)&lt;/small&gt; higher language that you did not need to choose a register sized mashine word as array index. As such I belive that restricting an array index to &quot;integer&quot; is actualy a loss of abstraction. Abstraction for me means: away from computer implementation - closer to the live of humans. Example: Humans use arrays of (''Jan'', ''Feb'', ... ''Dec'') or (''Mon'', ''Thu'', ... ''Sun'') while computers would internaly use (0, 1 ... 12) or (0, 1, .. 6). Even if a human would choose a number to represent a month or day he would choose a 1 for ''Jan'' or ''Mon'' and not 0 as a computer would do. A higher programming language with better abstraction allow a more human like representation &lt;small&gt;(i.E. using an enumeration type as as index)&lt;/small&gt;. The Psydo language used in [[Computer Science]] should allow for the highest abstraction - and an &lt;code&gt;array [Jan ... Dez, 1990 ... 2005] of ....&lt;/code&gt; should not be out of the question. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 06:47, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
*::I completely agree with you that allowing different index types allows for better abstraction. But we need to be careful about which abstractions we're talking about. The purpose of this book is to ''describe'' how one would get from embarrassingly simple, low-level abstractions into very precise, semantic-rich, high-level abstractions. To me, it would kind of be like arguing that the Hashtables chapter should use Perl, because Perl already has hash tables built-in. But the point is not to write the most elegant code examples; the point is to demonstrate computer science concepts.&lt;p&gt;I find the idea very beautiful that in a language like Lisp, all you need is cons, car and cdr, and from there you can make lists, trees and graphs. Add in a very simple array, and you can make hashtables and matrices, et cetera... This is a very compelling story, and it can't be told as well if unnecessary elements are constantly added as side-notes. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:24, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
*::(BTW, a deeper discussion of rich programming languages might be better suited for the Programming Languages book, or also possibly the Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms book. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 21:09, 23 August 2005 (UTC))

== Quicksort misconceptions ==

:''Since superceeded by the Introsort algorithm, the Quicksort algorithm can exact excellent performance on purely random data. It's worst performance, however, occurs on nearly-sorted or on sorted data, at which point Quicksort becomes completely impractical.''
The above quote is incorrect. The original quicksort introduced by Hoare used random, not deterministic, methods to select the pivot. Thus, the kind of data input (random or ordered) wasn't important. It would only perform poorly on the very slight chance that the random selections were suboptimal. Some bad textbooks present some pretty poor ways of picking the pivots, but that is not the true quicksort.

I think it would probably be best not to present quicksort in the data-structures book at all because it's already half-way covered in the Algorithms book (currently the partition portion of quicksort is covered). I think Bubble sort probably shouldn't even be mentioned, as selection sort performs better and is easier to understand. For a data-structures book, Heap sort makes the most sense. Part of my hope is that we can keep both the data-structures and algorithms books simple (by covering only the most fundamental tools), and get into the more advanced material (e.g. introsort) in an ''Advanced Data-Structures and Algorithms'' book. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:34, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Moving forward ==

It looks like we've resolved many of the issues on this page. How would one go about archiving this talk page? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:18, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Create an [[/Archive 1]] page and move the stuff there. Now that sub-pages are active [[/Archive 1]] allways works ;-). --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:31, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

== Template Tricks ==

Here's the page structure I have for the Introduction, and I'd like to repeat it for the other chapters:

 Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction
   -- simple page that includes:
      a header &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data StructuresChapNav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
        - i.e. a template
      &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
        - another template
      a horizontal line
      a footer &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data StructuresChapNav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
        - the same template as the header
 
 where the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is:
 Template:Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction
   -- a simple page that &lt;nowiki&gt;REDIRECTS&lt;/nowiki&gt; to
      the page Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction_content
 
 Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction_content
   -- the article that includes the chapter's *real* content.

The idea of these template tricks is two fold:
# The navigation templates simply allow you to browse the book easier; and
# The _content templates allow the book to be viewed in two different ways: by-chapter, or all-chapters

The by-chapter view is the one shown above. The all-chapters view would be a page that would look like this:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data Structures:Introduction}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data Structures:Chapter 2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Computer Science:Data Structures:Chapter 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  ... and so on, including all of the _content pages (indirectly, because the
  templates will redirect)

The indirection is neccessary in order to avoid the chapter navigation getting shown in the all-chapters view.

The idea behind the all chapters view is that people could print out the book easily. Anyway, if you see some weird things, like the above, that's the reason why. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:47, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Pseudocode ==
I've implemented the [[Data_Structures/Stacks_and_Queues_content#Linked_List_Implementation|Stack ADT]] in a pseudocode that I'm proposing for the rest of the book. I used a literate programming approach in which the implementation is interspersed with prose describing it. The pseudocode for a somewhat more complicated ADT should probably be copied here and used for an example. The details of the pseudocode follow.

All blocks begin with a keyword (so far '''type''' and '''method''') and end with a line containing '''end''' and the keyword. The pseudocode is sensitive to line endings, although a python-like use of ''';''' to put two commands on the same line would not be unreasonable. Make sure you indent the contents of all blocks.

I use &lt;code&gt;'''type''' &lt;var&gt;TypeName&lt;/var&gt;['''&lt;'''&lt;var&gt;type-arguments&lt;/var&gt;'''&gt;'''] &lt;/code&gt; to introduce a new type. I use the word &quot;type&quot; rather than an alternative like &quot;class&quot; or &quot;structure&quot; because this is a book on abstract data types, rather than object oriented classes, and the word &quot;structure&quot; is too long. I drew the angle brackets from C++ template or Java generic syntax. I think it is important to point out that abstract types are parametrized on other types. The type ends with &lt;code&gt;end type&lt;/code&gt; on its own line. 

The '''data''' keyword declares a private data member. It is of the form &lt;code&gt;'''data''' &lt;var&gt;member-name&lt;/var&gt; ''':''' &lt;var&gt;member-type&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. I am using the Pascal style of data typing (''':''' to introduce the type of a variable) because there's already a keyword in front of the variable and this allows us to use type names with spaces in them. Data members (so far) can be accessed by their name alone in any member function. Possibly, we should follow python's lead and require a &quot;self.&quot; in front of an access to clearly distinguish them from local variables.

'''method''' introduces a public member function/method. These are of the form &lt;code&gt;'''method''' &lt;var&gt;method-name&lt;/var&gt; (&lt;var&gt;arg-1&lt;/var&gt;:&lt;var&gt;arg-1-type&lt;/var&gt;,&amp;hellip;) [:&lt;var&gt;return-type&lt;/var&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;. A method ends with &lt;code&gt;end method&lt;/code&gt; on its own line. If a return type is present, a '''return''' statement with the right type must terminate all calls of the function. Probably we should find a way to indicate that a method does not modify its object or an argument. You call a member function using the standard &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;object&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;var&gt;member&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;args&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; syntax.

I'd like a '''for''' loop that allows iteration over either a numeric range with a possible stride, or over all members of a given set or sequence. Perhaps the following syntax:
 for i in 1..11 [step 2] # Does this loop for i=11 or not?
 for i in some_set
Pattern matching should probably be allowed too:
 for (first,second) in pair_sequence

=== Discussion ===

;A defense of explicit typing in our pseudocode: In a [[Talk:Data Structures/Arrays#pseduo-code|couple]] [[Talk:Data Structures/Stacks and Queues#Note on Style|places]], [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] has suggested that this book's pseudocode should not use generics, instead leaving certain variables untyped. I respectfully disagree. While certain languages (Perl, Python, Lisp) allow programmers to omit the types, this makes the programmer have a firmer understanding of what type a given variable has at any time since the compiler won't catch mistakes. Since we're trying to teach new programmers, who probably don't understand types as well, the type of any variable in our pseudo code should be specified. Without generics, if a variable declaration has no type, the reader has to guess the type. A mapping ADT will have two types that can vary, and a Graph may have even more. Using templates/generics adds a little syntax but allows us to type every variable we use. MShonle, if I'm wrong about your position, feel free to delete this paragraph. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 07:01, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Old discussion from above:
:We should include code snippets in as many different languages as possible along with pseudocode.
::I'm not sure &quot;as many&quot; languages as possible is desirable. Certainly the current fad language could be used, or a language like it. I'm a fan of pseudocode that absorbs the benefits from several languages. But data-structures in Scheme versus Python versus Java/C# are going to be very different. At some point decisions will have to be made. I believe for the topic of data structures that something closer to C should be used, but organized such that it could &quot;obviously&quot; be turned into an object-oriented program.&lt;p&gt;At heart, Data Structures is about making linked-list and hash-tables and ballanced binary search trees: it would seem silly to implement a linked list in a language that already includes full, built-in support of them. (However, these high level-languages could offer a lot: as they can help in the design of the interface of the structures; for example by using iterators.) The Algorithms book uses a more pure pseudocode language that offers excellent looping constructs and array slices: the reason being that showing low-level details detracts from the &quot;hard part&quot; of what the algorithm is (i.e., introducing implementation complexity on top of the inherent complex makes the story telling harder)[[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 09:45, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::From a teaching perspective i think that pseudocode for data structures is much much clearer than any implementation.  I would suggest that code snippets be first done in pseudocode, and then possibly in actual language code (is there a way perhaps this could be on a different page, like an appendix or something?)  The pseudocode is the clearest way to learn the concept, which is pretty indepedent of language.  I think both functional and procedural data structures should be shown, as functional programming is becoming more mainstream, and this book is not simply a programming text, but a CS text, and they are theoretically very important. [[User:JustinWick|JustinWick]] 15:19, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

* I have a suggestion from the [[Computer Programming]] Book: Just read the following 3 pages: [[Computer Programming#Key_concepts]], [[Computer Programming/Control]], [[Ada Programming/Control]]. It's almost what [[User:JustinWick|JustinWick]] suggested.

On the history page, Krischik said: &quot;(Discussion - pseudocode vs real language - why not both?)&quot;. Answer: We ''are'' taking that approach. If people want to supply implementations in C, Scheme, Python or Java they may do so, as an appendix (the sister Algorithms book has one appendix already set up, but with little work done on it). The pseudo-language is closest to Python, so it would be a good idea to test all of the samples by actually running them against a full test-suite (which should also be part of the appendix; see the Algorithms book).

Jyasskin said: &quot;''In a couple places, MShonle has suggested that this book's pseudocode should not use generics, instead leaving certain variables untyped. I respectfully disagree.''&quot;
:Thinking about this more, I think we probably should go with a light-weight kind of generics notation. Basically in the yellow &quot;Some-structure Operations&quot; boxes we could put the conventional &lt;Key,Value&gt; or &lt;Element&gt; notations, just to say &quot;when you see Key here, it could actually be anything&quot;. That probably would make things easier to read. This notation would only be used for the ADT descriptions. The methods themselves will just say &quot;Key k&quot; or &quot;Element value&quot;, and when converting to a language, the reader will either: (1) delete the types, because it's a dynamically typed language; (2) enter in the generic notation, because it's a language that allows type parameterization; or (3) substitute for a concrete type, like string or integer, because the language doesn't allow for generics, but is also statically typed.

hi there!
i just started reading this book, like it so far, but one thing conufses me:
every chapter uses a diferent pseudocode; this realy makes it hard to follow...

== TODO note ==

The references section should have its own _content page, so that it could be seen on the All Chapters view version of the book too. Possibily we'll want to do this for the preamble too. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:59, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

== adding implementations ==

I noticed the part saying that implementations in various languages would be welcome as an Appendix. I agree that this is a good idea, and would be willing to add some of them. I'm not sure what a good structure would be. Have a page as the appendix with everything on it? A page as the appendix with links to pages for individual structures, featuring an implementation in each language, and/or links to pages for each language, featuring an implementation of each structure mentioned in the book. Any thoughts? [[User:Cat Parade|Cat Parade]] 06:39, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
: I agree completely. It would be great to have an appendix for code and pseudocode. I've noticed several sections that contain mostly code. The implementations are great but too much in the text will make a section unreadable.

This also means you don't want the direct category addition below the template, which will upset the sorting that BookCat provides (would sort on D rather than H).&lt;br&gt;

== When using the counting technique for induction, I always stop counting at some point and crash. The other techniques have their own little issues I can't work out (being a programmer, this really puts my nads in a salad shooter). Are there any computer programs I can run on a laptop that will somehow remind me that I am dreaming? ==
--[[User:Vampirism44|Vampirism44]] ([[User talk:Vampirism44|talk]]) 22:59, 10 May 2009 (UTC) Yes, there are computer programs you can use. Just look at the software section in induction techniques. As for the counting technique, when you &quot;crash&quot;, simply start counting from 1 again.

== Lucitity has become chance for me, and even then it only occurs once every two weeks. Is there anything I can try to make it a 80% possibility per night? ==

== As lucid dreams are rare for me, this little bug really sucks. I gain lucidity, and when I try to give my dream a basic command (Like turning my hands blue, or making my sister explode), I wake up as the command takes effect. Even when I focus on something (my hands or the explosion), I wake. How do I combat this? ==

When doing some things (that wont work in real life) I sometimes start to slip out of it. What I do is just stop for a second (as the dream has become simply me with my eyes closed, imagining things) and just relax. Dont do any fast movements and soon you'll slip back into your little fantasy of blue hands and exploding siblings

== Why do people want to move during sleep paralysis? I have had it about 3 times and have never tried to move. ==

Because for many of the people who experiance this it is entirely accidental and so it is not a comfortable feeling at all. I have had sleep paralysis on roughly 4 occasions, all of them when I was younger except for one time around six months ago and none of them occured on purpose.

== I use the MILD, WILD, and counting induction processes at the same time. I experience sleep paralysis as &quot;I'm breathing in, but I cant breathe out&quot;, and when ym lungs are full, it's REALLY uncomfortable. Also, if I stay this way for 20 secs, my entire room seems to twist, and I see a strange &quot;screensaver&quot; type thing. When I finally breathe out, everything clears, and I become lightheaded. Is there a chance that this is normal? ==

Probably. A lot of weird things happen during sleep paralysis (frequently including discomfort), and I've never heard of anyone actually getting hurt or dying because of sleep paralysis. Just relax.

== Is it possible to use the WILD process with a little background noise? (Small pets moving in their cage, 20Db)==
Some actually prefer to have some background noise. They concentrate on the noise, after some time, it becomes distorted.

== I keep losing lucidity after I try to do something after &quot;pausing&quot; a lucid dream. How do I combat this? (Eg, pausing, then slapping the person in front of me, and I can't seem to lift my hand)==
--[[User:Vampirism44|Vampirism44]] ([[User talk:Vampirism44|talk]]) 00:29, 6 May 2009 (UTC) If you can't move your hand after slapping somebody, this is not losing lucidity. Rather, you probably regained the sense of your physical body and tried to move it rather than your dream body. To combat this, try focusing on the dream as much as possible and then try to move your hand. If this doesn't work, than try to genuinely believe that you will be able to move your hand in your dream, relying on the Placebo effect.

==For how long do u have to experience the buzzing sensation in WILD before you become paralyzed?==

anon: For me the paralysis goes pretty much hand in hand. After like a minute of buzzing I start to feel like I'm falling through my bed. If i try waking up after the &quot;falling through my bed&quot; has started, I almost every time end up having sleep paralysis. This freaked me out a lot of times in the beginning. Now, whenever i get the buzz, I just try to wait for it and let myself float away till my dream starts. Of course this could also be a placebo for me.

==A few of my normal dreams have had some good imagery, but none have had real vividness (e.g. proper sound, the brush of air etc.). I have not had a lucid dream, to the best of my ability, but am trying. Is it likely that a lucid dream would be more realistic in terms of my perceptions than a normal dream?==

[[user:Xgamer4|Xgamer4]]: Not just likely. That's almost always the case. I'm not sure why that is though. One way to actually stay lucid is to, in-fact, focus on something in the dream. A wall, flower, plant, anything, and it helps keep you lucid.

[[User:Exabyte|Exabyte]]: I think that we don't remember normal dreams in much detail because we often don't pay much attention to those details (brush of air, fans running, etc.) in waking life, so our brains don't think to create them. When we are lucid, however, we often want to see how realistic dreams can be, so we look for details that we don't normally pay attention to. Thinking of these details causes our brains to create them. That's just my speculation, though.

Also, take into account that, altough we perceive the world through the 5 senses, generally only one of them is the main neural path into the brain, so the other senses get, like, dimmed as our brain dedicates more resources to that main sense. What this means is that you can remember more of a dream's visuals but only some of the hearings, or more of the hearings but none of the touch; as a matter of fact, as far as I have known, few people remember the tastes of their dreams.

[[User:Ksd5|Ksd5]]: We don't remember normal dreams in much detail, because when we are sleeping, our memory receptors are not as active.

==Could someone please describe the sensation of sleep parilysis during WILD? Because I keep getting close to falling asleep while counting but I jerk myself awake because I suddenly think 'I'm gonna choke' or 'I won't be able to breathe!', And I want to be fully prepared for it.==

vodkeiro: I once had a sleep parilysis. I'm not sure if I was trying to have a Lucid Dream. What happened to me was that, I was having a nightmare, so I started to think loudly (inside the nightmare) &quot;I wanna leave this place, NOW!&quot;. Suddenly, I woke up, I was in my room, and as it happens when someone has a nightmare, i tried to sit on my bed. There was the problem, I couldn't move, I &quot;moved&quot;, but on the next second, I was again at the beggining, like when in a game, where you die and go back to the beggining as if nothing had happened. I tried to yell, scream, shout, everything, but nothing happened. After a few tries, I could move, but I was still a little scared. So, I don't think you'll think &quot;I'm gonna choke&quot;, as you'll get really scared by not being able to move, so you're probably not thinking anything else.

Azmisov: Whenever I go into sleep paralysis my eyes start to flutter very rapidly and I see bright flashes of light. I have never had a painful deathly experience, although it can sometimes be a little uncomfortable. Usually, (I guess it depends on the person) it will last less that 30 seconds. This also depends on how fast you can transition into a lucid dream or astral travel.

 When going into your dreams using WILD you may feel things like vibrations, falling and yes, choking.these are perfectly normal and more importantly safe. just stay calm and the feelings will eventually stop.

Alessandro (chemicalpoem@yahoo.it)

I have had lot of sleep paralysis, and I was very scared about it: goonna choke, gonna die, cannot move, arhg! But, after reading 'bout LD I got very interested in this phenomena and I started to wait fot getting it again. Just this night (I was very tired, it was 5o clock) it happened again. I just remained really quiet, enjoing this sensation: if you get sure that nothing is gonna harm you, 't's like a fantastic total body orgasm!Then I've had THREE consecutive LD, two false awakening and a long, long and very clear dream. So, just keep quiet and IMAGINE!

(sry if tis answer is not regular: I'm not english and I'm still euforic about the night!)

--[[Special:Contributions/118.92.27.198|118.92.27.198]] ([[User talk:118.92.27.198|talk]]) 12:34, 18 December 2007 (UTC)
I have experienced sleep paralysis a few times, the first time was after a lucid dream, I saw myself in a white bed with me(in reality I was sleeping on the couch) from side view, and didn't feel like moving untill after I woke up; I was 3/4 asleep so I didn't panic. the second time was after a non-lucid dream that ended in me pressing a red button, I heard strange highly pleasant music, felt emotions of euphoria and tranquility, and saw a scary, conspicuously sharp toothed monster leaning over me. The other times I don't remember. Everything I've read about sleep paralysis has said something different, so I guess it varies from person to person.

==For the last 3 years I have been getting what I thought was sleep paralysis, but since learning about lucid dreaming, I think my experiences are a form or at least a gateway to lucid dreaming. Is there a link between the two? (in short, i know that I am dreaming but often the dream is of me lying in my bed in my room, or a place similar to my room, so it can be confusing. It is unpleasant, as I feel a strong desire to wake up from the dream state but can't.  I usually try screaming, or moving vigorously- i can't move properly or just roll off my bed(in the dream))==

[[user:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]]: What's most important is to not doubt (even slightly) that you can move, and you'll be able to move. In a dream, whatever you believe you can do, you can do (though it can be hard to convince yourself of that sometimes). If you have trouble completely convincing yourself that you can move, you could try treating the dream sleep paralysis like real sleep paralysis. Use the WILD technique (while paralyzed in the dream) to separate your paralyzed dream body and a second &quot;spirit&quot; dream body (read the paragraph about sleep paralysis in the [[../Induction Techniques#WILD|WILD section]]).

==How good should your dream recall be before you attempt lucid dream [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques|induction techniques]]?==

[[user:Xgamer4|Xgamer]]: You should be remembering at least 1 dream every night though more is better. The main thing though is to just try when you are comfortable. Due to placebo you might get a lucid dream with less than that if you believe.

[[User:evilshiznat|evilshiznat]]: Trying out the induction techniques is probably good while getting better at recall. It'll help you get used to it more, and once you get to one dream per night, you'll be all set.

[[User:Kaycee|KC]]: Developing your dream recall above zero is obviously necessary, but you better set your own pace.  You could start trying the induction techs out right away, just don't be disappointed if you don't get immediate results.

==I have difficulty telling the difference between dreams and reality - not during the dream itself, but when I remember things. Can I exploit this to induce lucid dreams?==

[[user:Xgamer4|Xgamer4]]: While I can't say I know much about it, having difficulty telling differences between dreams and real life in a memory happens to me also. It tends to be a common occurrence I think. It's even mentioned somewhere else here. On actually using it to induce a lucid dream, you could try incubating a dream. Other than that, I really don't know. Try stuff though and see if it works. If it does, tell us. If not, well, you tried.

==Is that possible to have a dream about having a lucid dream? I had a dream in which I had done a reality test and it showed that it was a dream. I walked through the wall, but I was too scared to jump from the window. In my nearly-lucid dreams I never think what I am doing, even when it is something strange. I just do. When I wake up, I often remember my dreams as if I were someone else watching myself in dream. Is that normal?==

--[[Special:Contributions/118.92.27.198|118.92.27.198]] ([[User talk:118.92.27.198|talk]]) 12:42, 18 December 2007 (UTC)
One question at a time mate. You cannot have a dream about having a lucid dream, that would be a lucid dream. I advise you to jump out of the window next time, doing something you are scared to do in a dream often has amusing results. It is normal to remember dreams as if you are someone else watching yourself, it's such a common feature in a dream that someone should come up with a name for such a dream.

I suggest you ignore the above comment, it is certainly possible to have a lucid dream about having a lucid dream. I can attest to this from experience. This will feel like a normal dream, which is what you seem to be describing. You may be aware that concentrating on a subject heavily will often influence your dreams - if you have been studying for a difficult test, you might have a dream about passing or failing it. If you have been recently been enjoying the company of a new girlfriend or boyfriend, they may appear in your dreams too. Likewise, if you have been looking into lucid dreaming and consciously focusing on it, you may have a dream that you are lucid dreaming. Don't read into it too much. --[[Special:Contributions/124.169.35.179|124.169.35.179]] ([[User talk:124.169.35.179|talk]])

==My dreams are often very realistic, e.g. I feel the wind blowing. But when I'm dreaming, I act like in a real life! I can't recognise my dreams that they are dreams. I've found out about lucid dreams about a month ago. I'm trying to have one, but I never had. What can I do to recognise my dreams as a dreams and have at last lucid dream? (Sorry for my English, I'm still learning! ;))==

[[user:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]]: Other than trying some of the [[../Induction Techniques|induction techniques]], your best bet is probably to get in the habit of doing reality checks at certain times throughout the day. For example, you might do a reality check every time you wake up, use an elevator, or drive a car. It's best to choose events that happen frequently in your dreams, obviously. Keeping a dream journal will help your subconscious get used to any differences between your dreams and waking life (there probably are some subtle differences, even if you don't notice them), and improve your dream recall—you might have already had a lucid dream but just never remembered it! (I've had lucid dreams and not remembered them until hours after I woke up before, so it's definitely possible.) Also, if you have any books on lucid dreaming, reading one just before you go to sleep can help a lot since you'll be thinking about it as you fall asleep.

==Sometimes I've had dreams where I think I know I'm dreaming, but I still have limited control. I can never fly or anything, even though I actually try. Is there anything I can avoid just 'dreaming' that I know I'm dreaming?==

You must suspend all disbelief when attempting to do out of the ordinary things in a dream. Jumping off a building or a staircase is a good way to force yourself to fly. With time, you can just jump and fly wherever you want. Personally, during my first lucid experience, I couldn't move my body at all, but I got the hang of it eventually.

==This almost seems religious, the idea of becoming your own god in your dream. What effect does Lucid Dreaming have on your spiritual life?==

[[user:Xgamer4|Xgamer4]]: I honestly can't say. Being Mormon, it doesn't seem to affect me very much. Mormons believe we were put on this earth to experience everything we possibly can in a life time and to return to living with the creators and helpers. To me, LDing, heck, just dreaming in general, is a way to experience many more things we couldn't experience in real life. I mean seriously, in real life, when are you going to get to fly around the world freely, or get chased by some scary thing then confront it, and it tells you why it's chasing you, or be chased by a lion in the middle of a jungle, or talk to people about anything while not worrying about being embarassed or ashamed of what you did, or etc.?

[[User:Kaycee|KC]]: Lucid dreaming in itself will not have an effect on your spiritual life, unless you want to use it for such a purpose (soul-searching and such). However, fear is one of the biggest obstacles in your way to lucid dreaming, and so are negative expectations. You are the person who controls your spiritual life, but if you need counseling, seek it from a proper representative of your own religion. My personal advice would be to drop any extra religious/spiritual baggage before you try lucid dreaming, but it's your choice.

[Gene] Lucid Dreaming is an essential indicator of higher awareness in many spiritual systems.  See Ken Wilber, Buddhism, Ramana Maharshi. The ability to remain self-identified in dreaming sleep and (non-dreaming) deep sleep indicates awareness of higher bodies, the subtle self and the causal Self, respectively. This is normally achieved only after many years of meditation (which itself can be said to be a practice of release from object-relations). Dreaming sleep is a subtle body (mental) experience and deep sleep is a causal body (spiritual) experience. Most people associate their waking state awareness as &quot;consciousness&quot;, but this is a consciousness that is formed in a context of object-relations, which objects help to identify &quot;me&quot; and &quot;not me&quot;.  When there are no perceived (external) objects, such as in deep sleep, can you identify your Self?  It is a milestone of human development when infants achieve object constancy (maintain awareness of where an object is even if it is no longer in view), and is is also a milestone of development, though rarely achieved, to maintain self awareness even in the midst of no perceptions, ie. deep sleep. (e.g. even in a sensory deprivation chamber, one can perceive or feel their body).  Ramana Maharshi (probably acknowledged as a true spiritual adept across more religions and spiritual disciplines than anybody) said &quot;if it's not real in deep dreamless sleep then it's not real&quot; meaning only that the highest causal Self (god) is real, and that the rest of typical human experience is transitory.

['''b'''77] Expanding on Gene's comment above, I fully agree that restoring your self-awareness and retrieving your own identity during the LD is another milestone for humans' mental development.  While I am deeply not convinced about any spiritual claims (religions and alike) and while I always try to find a 'scientific' reason for their existence, I believe that there is truly more to this universe than the science can account for or can 'reasonably' accept as plausible.  So, if indeed death is not just The End, then the mere practice of restating/redefining yourself while in the middle of a LD would pave the way to controlling your death experiences, when the time comes.  ...that is, if you're lucky enough to have time to prepare yourself...  In other words, just as we have so much difficulty escaping those 'serious' nightmares—simply because we're not aware of their virtuality—I believe that whatever godly or ungodly experiences one may have on their final minutes are eventually conditioned by one's ''expectations'' and beliefs (see placebo question below).  So, I would say that practicing LD and also keeping an eye on your own ideas and expectations about the other world could actually ensure a nice last trip out of here.  And well, I would be happy to know that someone who is afraid of hell, of devils and alike, could eventually become aware that, whenever and wherever you may be, the one thing that cannot be destroyed in any way is your being (and staying) aware of yourself, as well as finding a single untouchable spot of self in the middle of whatever 'happens' around you.  As someone who had to learn at some point to ignore an awful durable physical pain just to avoid losing mind, I eventually realized that a mental barrier between the self and the rest (including body), as hard to make and maintain as it is, may be the only apparent solution in such extreme cases.  So yes, do play with LD, play it safe, don't ask too much too fast, and you'll surely be more than happy about your new invisible power :)

==What are the benefits of lucid dreaming (aside from achieving personal interests)? Are there any negative aspects?==

Question asked by [[User:Ivlarx|Ivlarx]] 09:40, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

[[User:R3m0t|R3m0t]]: On the forum I frequent, LD4all, there is a large bias towards people who &quot;just wanna have fun&quot; (eheh) in their dreams. Popular targets include sex, flying, and shapeshifting.

There are stories in ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming'' of people who found their dreams realistic enough to rehearse speeches, or create baking recipes. There were also stories that simply becoming lucid was an extremely fun experience in itself.

A small amount of people have overcome the fears from their nightmares in their lucid dreams. The chapter about it in EWLD (the book) is available as a free sample [http://www.lucidity.com/EWLD10.html here].

Finally, there are people who use lucid dreams as a springboard to reach shared dreams (or &quot;dreamwalking&quot;), precognitive dreams, out-of-body experiences, and astral projection. I'm not sure myself why they want those (I imagine out-of-body experiences are fun because you can see your own body) but apparently some people do. I don't believe in shared and precognitive dreams myself and I also don't believe that out-of-body experiences and astral projection really are due to something (spirit, soul?) moving away from your body.

As for negative, I think that the section in [[../Introduction]] covers that very well. The only thing it omits is obsession. ;) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:34, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

One negative thing is it's harder to be an early riser. You want to sleep more. [[User:CannibalSmith|CannibalSmith]] ([[User talk:CannibalSmith|talk]]) 16:13, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

==What is the placebo effect?==

The [[w:placebo effect|placebo effect]] occurs when something happens just because you believe it will. It strongly affects the nature of lucid dreams.

I suffered nightmares for many years (a result of abuse as a child), although they declined in my thirties. In my forties I began to become aware when a dream was beginning to turn into a nightmare, now 3 things can result from that lucidity: 
1. My most satisfactory result is when I can I alter/divert the next stage of the dream, and it continues without nightmare;
2. I have difficulty diverting the dream sequence but tell myself I must wake up, and do;
3. I cannot just wake up, but I know I need to ask for help. I make myself speak/moan, which takes a lot of effort within the dream, but it always wakes my husband, who then wakes me up.

==When I try to use the WILD technique, I feel a stron urge or tiredness to stop concentrating and go to sleep. Is this normal? It happens early when I first start.==

--[[Special:Contributions/118.92.27.198|118.92.27.198]] ([[User talk:118.92.27.198|talk]]) 12:54, 18 December 2007 (UTC)This has happened to me when I tried holding my arm up to keep myself awake. Is that what you are doing? Maybe you are staying too awake, In that case you should relax and let  your &quot;awareness&quot; drop, try to find out how aware you need to be before your awareness drops so far you fall asleep, and aim just above that level.

==Which site would you recommend to go to to discuss lucid dreams and such?==

[[User:Kaycee|KC]]: Take a look at the newsgroup '''alt.dreams.lucid''' too. If you're not familiar with the Usenet, you can reach it via [http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;output=search&amp;group=alt.dreams.lucid Google Groups].

[[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]]: I'm a frequent poster on [http://ld4all.com LD4all]. Unfortunately, LD4all has a few problems - the site is sometimes slow, the forum categories are less than perfect and there are plenty of repeated questions and postings (this is partly why the wikibook exists).

[[User:Xgamer4|Xgamer4]]: I'd recommend [http://ld4all.com LD4all]. It has many forums to discuss with many other LD'ers. In fact, this wikibook is mainly the product of the board-goers at [http://ld4all.com LD4all].

==it's possible to dream inside another dream?, I remember long time ago a lucid dream where I was in my home, then I tried go to bed to try sleep but when I tried to do that the dream ended spontaneously...==

It is possible to dream that you are dreaming, or to even dream that you have a lucid dream. The difference between dreaming you are lucid and actually being lucid is the fact that when not actually lucid, you have no control over the dream. However, I am unsure if it is possible to have a dream in which you go to sleep and continue a different dream. [[User:Dylnuge|Dylnuge]]

Something like this happened to me. It felt like a normal dream, but i knew that i was dreaming. I had superpowers and this, but i couldn't control my dream.

I had somehing odd happen to me. Many years ago I awakened as usual one morning. Everything looked and sounded as it should. My wife was still sleeping. When I looked at her again, she started shapeshifting, an obvious absurdity in reality. I was speechless and shocked. Suddenly I realized I was dreaming and greatly relieved. I woke up, got out of bed, went to the bathroom and something made me realize I was dreaming yet again. This was in a way more shocking than the first false awakening because it was all so real and I wondered how far could this regress. At that point I awoke and found myself still in bed. This time I was not dreaming. A false awakening has never happened since.

==i wanted to experience the OBE thing... how am i supposed to do that???==

Azmisov: Many of the techniques shown here can be implemented into an OBE/astral travel experience. OBEs usually involve experiencing vibrational forces going through your body. (you should check out the Monroe Institute for more info on this) Another method is to just imagine yourself slipping out of your body. I really don't know if this technique is true OBE, it may just be another lucid dream. There are a lot of other methods I don't know about, so you can do some research to find more techniques.

==My occurrence for lucid dreaming varies from week to week, is this normal? For some weeks I can lucid dream everday for a week straight, then all of a sudden I can't for a month. Lately i have been able to lucid dream twice a night, sometimes three. Any clue what may cause this? Also when I do lucid dream a lot more, I act normal in a dream. I know I am dreaming, I can fly around, i can spawn things around me, but I still talk to people as if It was a real conversation.==

&lt;Daydreamer&gt; Whether or not you were lucidly dreaming depends on whether you decided in your dream to fly, look in the mirror, etc. or whether you were only passively observing these events taking place in the dream.  Realising you are in a dream and then remaining in the dream is a good sign that it was, as often the realisation you are dreaming is enough of a shock to wake you up, but the real test is your level of control.  As far as not being able to swallow is concerned, if you were getting sick, especially if you were getting a temperature or something then this can also affect the vividness of your dreams.

====I have good dream recall, and when I sleep I never seem to lucid dream. When I am dreaming, really weird stuff happens to me. My mind never questions the bizzare circumstances I am put in. I have tried thinking that &quot;I will have a lucid dream&quot; over and over, and done some reality checks during the day. It never occurs to me to do them when I dream. Is there some way that will make me lucid dream for sure? Am I incapable of Lucid Dreaming?====
—Eponymous Anonymous

[[User:Li|Li]] - I know what you mean. I've been trying every way to get a lucid dream, but nothing works. It sucks. I sometimes get really close but freak out and wake up. But despite my inexperience, I know for sure that everyone is capable of lucid dreaming. Try doing a wider variety of reality checks maybe, or perhaps try a different technique. What technique are you using?; WILD and VILD need lots of practice.

[[User:Walter Lewin|Walter Lewin]] 11:57, 13 November 2007 (UTC) - Yeah, I tried to do WILD for the past few weeks. Only once i felt a heavy pain in my chest, I found it hard to move but i could open my eyes and I woke up soon without dreaming lucid :(

--[[Special:Contributions/118.92.27.198|118.92.27.198]] ([[User talk:118.92.27.198|talk]]) 13:07, 18 December 2007 (UTC)
The correct way to do the MILD method is to go to sleep believing that you will &quot;remember&quot; that you are dreaming. Also, one key difference between lucid dreamers and non lucid dreamers  trying to lucid dream is that lucid dreamers do not wonder if they are incapable of lucid dreaming, do not think that it never occors to them to do reality checks when they are dreaming, and tend to treat the phase &quot;I did not lucid dream last night&quot; as similar to the phase &quot;I did not sleep on the couch last night&quot;, in other words, they tend to see lucid dreaming as something they can choose to do if they want to, rather than something they want to successfuly achieve at (long) last.
-accepted-

==Is there a good method to remember your &quot;waking&quot; memories in a dream? Every time I get a dream I have control over myself, but I do not seem to know that I am in a dream and I cannot remember anything from when I am awake(therefore I can't do reality checks or anything &quot;supernatural&quot;). Any ideas of what I should do?==

==Is it possible to recall all waking memories in a lucid dream? I have had only two lucid dreams so far. I know these were lucid, because I did reality checks with positive results. I even managed to fly, create items, and etc. However, I couldn't recall a great deal of my waking memories. This cause me to lose lucidity half way through the dream.==

In your book (en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming) you've mentioned a forum www.lucidforum.net which doesn't seem to be opening AT ALL. It's on the internet and it kinda doesn't seem to exist.. What do I do?</text>

==Vandalism on Cookbook:Allspice==
Dear 4.7.227.62:

Would you mind not vandalising Wikibook pages (and a little politeness wouldn't hurt either)?

There are more interesting F-words in the cookbook: like fennel and flavour and flan.

You have one more chance.

Thank you,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: Act 3, Scene 1==
Hello 66.119.33.186

Checking through KPJas's version and yours (as well as the current edit),I believe you were responsible for the 'amusing edits' to make a modern Shakespeare.

Correcting them to the way Shakespeare himself wrote them is a lot of work, and could well be constituted vandalism.

The reason this text is on Wikibooks is so that we can have the words as Shakespeare wrote them, which is very useful to students and teachers the world over.

Thank you,

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello 66.119.34.58,

Your alterations to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (made on the 9th June) could be considered more than a little vulgar.

I do not think in Elizabethan times any character would be sitting on the john.

I have deleted all references to the john, and also 'after you here[sic] what Benvolio has to say'.

Please refrain from vandalising the work of Shakespeare,

Would you mind not deleting the text of the act and scene, and putting in irrelevant material?

The Friar Lawrence scene is one of my favourites. I find it particularly effective in the Baz Luhrmann version, but Shakespeare's version is terrific too.

If it wasn't for it, we wouldn't be here!

==Introduction==
The '''Urinary System''' is a group of organs in the body concerned with filtering out excess fluid and other substances from the bloodstream. The substances are filtered out from the body in the form of '''urine'''. Urine is a liquid produced by the kidneys, collected in the bladder and excreted through the urethra. Urine is used to extract excess minerals or vitamins as well as blood corpuscles from the body. The Urinary organs include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The Urinary system works with the other systems of the body to help maintain homeostasis.  The kidneys are the main organs of homeostasis because they maintain the acid base balance and the water salt balance of the blood.

==Functions of the Urinary System==

One of the major functions of the Urinary system is the process of excretion. Excretion is the process of eliminating, from an organism, waste products of metabolism and other materials that are of no use. The urinary system maintains an appropriate fluid volume by regulating the amount of water that is excreted in the urine. Other aspects of its function include regulating the concentrations of various electrolytes in the body fluids and maintaining normal pH of the blood. Several body organs carry out excretion, but the kidneys are the most important excretory organ.  The primary function of the kidneys is to maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis) for optimal cell and tissue metabolism. They do this by separating urea, mineral salts, toxins, and other waste products from the blood.  They also do the job of conserving water, salts, and electrolytes. At least one kidney must function properly for life to be maintained. '''Six important roles of the kidneys are:'''

'''Regulation of plasma ionic composition.'''  Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphates are regulated by the amount that the kidney excretes.

'''Regulation of plasma osmolarity.'''  The kidneys regulate osmolarity because they have direct control over how many ions and how much water a person excretes.

'''Regulation of plasma volume.'''  Your kidneys are so important they even have an effect on your blood pressure.  The kidneys control plasma volume by controlling how much water a person excretes.  The plasma volume has a direct effect on the total blood volume, which has a direct effect on your blood pressure. Salt(NaCl)will cause osmosis to happen; the diffusion of water into the blood.

'''Regulation of plasma hydrogen ion concentration (pH).'''  The kidneys partner up with the lungs and they together control the pH. The kidneys have a major role because they control the amount of bicarbonate excreted or held onto. The kidneys help maintain the blood Ph mainly by excreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions as needed.

'''Removal of metabolic waste products and foreign substances from the plasma.'''  One of the most important things the kidneys excrete is nitrogenous waste.  As the liver breaks down amino acids it also releases ammonia.  The liver then quickly combines that ammonia with carbon dioxide, creating '''urea''' which is the primary nitrogenous end product of metabolism in humans.  The liver turns the ammonia into urea because it is much less toxic.  We can also excrete some ammonia, creatinine and uric acid.  The '''creatinine''' comes from the metabolic breakdown of creatine phospate (a high-energy phosphate in muscles).  '''Uric acid''' comes from the break down of nucleotides.  Uric acid is insoluble and too much uric acid in the blood will build up and form crystals that can collect in the joints and cause gout.

'''Secretion of Hormones'''  The endocrine system has assistance from the kidney's when releasing hormones.  Renin is released by the kidneys.   Renin leads to the secretion of aldosterone which is released from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes the kidneys to reabsorb the sodium (Na+) ions.  The kidneys also secrete erythropoietin when the blood doesn't have the capacity to carry oxygen.  Erythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production. The  Vitamin D from the skin is also activated with help from the kidneys. Calcium (Ca+) absorption from the digestive tract is promoted by vitamin D.

==Organs in the Urinary System==

===Kidneys And Their Structure===

The '''kidneys''' are a pair of bean shaped, brown organs about the size of your fist.It measures 10-12 cm long. They are covered by the renal capsule, which is a tough capsule of fibrous connective tissue. Adhering to the surface of each kidney is two layers of fat to help cushion them. There is a concaved side of the kidney that has a depression where a renal artery enters, and a renal vein and a ureter exit the kidney. The kidneys are located at the rear wall of the abdominal cavity just above the waistline, and are protected by the ribcage. They are considered  retroperitoneal, which means they lie behind the peritoneum. There are three major regions of the kidney, '''renal cortex''', '''renal medulla''' and the '''renal pelvis'''.  The outer, granulated layer is the renal cortex.  The cortex stretches down in between a radially striated inner layer. The inner radially striated layer is the renal medulla. This contains pyramid shaped tissue called the renal pyramids, separated by renal columns. The ureters are continuous with the renal pelvis and is the very center of the kidney. 

====Renal Vein====

The '''renal veins''' are veins that drain the kidney. They connect the kidney to the inferior vena cava. Because the inferior vena cava is on the right half of the body, the left renal vein is generally the longer of the two. Unlike the right renal vein, the left renal vein often receives the left gonadal vein (left testicular vein in males, left ovarian vein in females). It frequently receives the left suprarenal vein as well.

====Renal Artery====

The '''renal arteries''' normally arise off the abdominal aorta and supply the kidneys with blood. The arterial supply of the kidneys are variable and there may be one or more renal arteries supplying each kidney. Due to the position of the aorta, the inferior vena cava and the kidneys in the body, the right renal artery is normally longer than the left renal artery. The right renal artery normally crosses posteriorly to the inferior vena cava.
The renal arteries carry a large portion of the total blood flow to the kidneys. Up to a third of the total cardiac output can pass through the renal arteries to be filtered by the kidneys.

===Ureters===

The '''ureters''' are two tubes that drain urine from the kidneys to the bladder.  Each ureter is a muscular tube about 10 inches (25 cm) long. Muscles in the walls of the ureters send the urine in small spurts into the bladder, (a collapsible sac found on the forward part of the cavity of the bony pelvis that allows temporary storage of urine). After the urine enters the bladder from the ureters, small folds in the bladder mucosa act like valves preventing backward flow of the urine. The outlet of the bladder is controlled by a sphincter muscle. A full bladder stimulates sensory nerves in the bladder wall that relax the sphincter and allow release of the urine. However, relaxation of the sphincter is also in part a learned response under voluntary control. The released urine enters the urethra.

===Urinary Bladder===

The '''urinary bladder''' is a hollow, muscular and distendible or elastic organ that sits on the pelvic floor (superior to the prostate in males). On its anterior border lies the pubic symphysis and, on its posterior border, the vagina (in females) and rectum (in males). The urinary bladder can hold approximately 17 to 18 ounces (500 to 530 ml) of urine, however the desire to micturate is usually experienced when it contains about 150 to 200 ml. When the bladder fills with urine (about half full), stretch receptors send nerve impulses to the spinal cord, which then sends a reflex nerve impulse back to the sphincter (muscular valve) at the neck of the bladder, causing it to relax and allow the flow of urine into the urethra. The Internal urethral sphincter is involuntary. The ureters enter the bladder diagonally from its dorsolateral floor in an area called the trigone. The trigone is a triangular shaped area on the postero-inferior wall of the bladder. The urethra exits at the lowest point of the triangle of the trigone. The urine in the bladder also helps regulate body temperature. A bladder when operating normally empties completely upon a complete discharge, otherwise it is a sign that its elasticity is compromised, when it becomes completely void of fluid, it may cause a chilling sensation due to the rapid change of body temperature.

===Urethra===
[[Image:Gray1139.png|250 px|thumb|left|Female urethra (labeled at bottom right.)]]
[[Image:Gray1142.png|200 px|thumb|right|Male Sphincter urethrae muscle - The male urethra laid open on its anterior (upper) surface. (Region visible, but muscle not labeled.)]]

The '''urethra''' is a muscular tube that connects the bladder with the outside of the body.  The function of the urethra is to remove urine from the body.  It measures about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in a woman but up to 8 inches (20 cm) in a man.  Because the urethra is so much shorter in a woman it makes it much easier for a woman to get harmful bacteria in her bladder this is commonly called a bladder infection or a UTI.  The most common bacteria of a UTI is E-coli from the large intestines that have been excreted in fecal matter.
'''Female urethra'''

In the human female, the urethra is about 1-2 inches long and opens in the vulva between the clitoris and the vaginal opening. 

Men have a longer urethra than women. This means that women tend to be more susceptible to infections of the bladder (cystitis) and the urinary tract.

'''Male urethra'''

In the human male, the urethra is about 8 inches  long and opens at the end of the head of the  penis.     

The length of a male's urethra, and the fact it contains a number of bends, makes catheterisation more difficult.


The '''urethral sphincter''' is a collective name for the muscles used to control the flow of urine from the urinary bladder. These muscles surround the urethra, so that when they contract, the urethra is closed.  

* There are two distinct areas of muscle: the internal sphincter, at the bladder neck and
* the external, or distal, sphincter. 

Human males have much stronger sphincter muscles than females, meaning that they can retain a large amount of urine for twice as long, as much as 800mL, i.e. &quot;hold it&quot;.

===Nephrons===

A nephron is the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney. The name nephron comes from the Greek word (nephros) meaning kidney. Its chief function is to regulate water and soluble substances by filtering the blood, reabsorbing what is needed and excreting the rest as urine. Nephrons eliminate wastes from the body, regulate blood volume and pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. Its functions are vital to life and are regulated by the endocrine system by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and parathyroid hormone.
 
Each nephron has its own supply of blood from two capillary regions from the renal artery. Each nephron is composed of an initial filtering component (the renal corpuscle) and a tubule specialized for reabsorption and secretion (the renal tubule). The renal corpuscle filters out large solutes from the blood, delivering water and small solutes to the renal tubule for modification.

====Glomerulus====

The glomerulus is a capillary tuft that receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal circulation. The glomerular blood pressure provides the driving force for fluid and solutes to be filtered out of the blood and into the space made by Bowman's capsule.
The remainder of the blood not filtered into the glomerulus passes into the narrower efferent arteriole. It then moves into the vasa recta, which are collecting capillaries intertwined with the convoluted tubules through the interstitial space, where the reabsorbed substances will also enter. This then combines with efferent venules from other nephrons into the renal vein, and rejoins with the main bloodstream. 


'''Afferent/Efferent Arterioles'''

The afferent arteriole supplies blood to the glomerulus. A group of specialized cells known as '''juxtaglomerular cells''' are located around the afferent arteriole where it enters the renal corpuscle. The efferent arteriole drains the glomerulus. Between the two arterioles lies specialized cells called the '''macula densa.''' The juxtaglomerular cells and the macula densa collectively form the '''juxtaglomerular apparatus.''' It is in the juxtaglomerular apparatus cells that the enzyme '''renin''' is formed and stored. Renin is released in response to decreased blood pressure in the afferent arterioles, decreased sodium chloride in the distal convoluted tubule and sympathetic nerve stimulation of receptors (beta-adrenic) on the juxtaglomerular cells. Renin is needed to form Angiotensin I and Angiotensin II which stimulate the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex.

====Glomerular Capsule or Bowman's Capsule====

'''Bowman's capsule''' (also called the '''glomerular capsule''') surrounds the glomerulus and is composed of visceral (simple squamous epithelial cells) (inner) and parietal (simple squamous epithelial cells) (outer) layers. The visceral layer lies just beneath the thickened glomerular basement membrane and is made of podocytes which send foot processes over the length of the glomerulus. Foot processes interdigitate with one another forming filtration slits that, in contrast to those in the glomeruluar endothelium, are spanned by diaphragms. The size of the filtration slits restricts the passage of large molecules (eg, albumin) and cells (eg, red blood cells and platelets). In addition, foot processes have a negatively-charged coat (glycocalyx) that limits the filtration of negatively-charged molecules, such as albumin. This action is called electrostatic repulsion.

The parietal layer of Bowman's capsule is lined by a single layer of squamous epithelium. Between the visceral and parietal layers is Bowman's space, into which the filtrate enters after passing through the podocytes' filtration slits. It is here that smooth muscle cells and macrophages lie between the capillaries and provide support for them. Unlike the visceral layer, the parietal layer does not function in filtration. Rather, the filtration barrier is formed by three components: the diaphragms of the filtration slits, the thick glomerular basement membrane, and the glycocalyx secreted by podocytes. 99% of glomerular filtrate will ultimately be reabsorbed.

The process of filtration of the blood in the Bowman's capsule is ultrafiltration (or glomerular filtration), and the normal rate of filtration is 125 ml/min, equivalent to ten times the blood volume daily. Measuring the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a diagnostic test of kidney function. A decreased GFR may be a sign of renal failure. Conditions that can affect GFR include: arterial pressure, afferent arteriole constriction, efferent arteriole constriction, plasma protein concentration and colloid osmotic pressure.

Any proteins that are roughly 30 kilodaltons or under can pass freely through the membrane. Although, there is some extra hindrance for negatively charged molecules due to the negative charge of the basement membrane and the podocytes. Any small molecules such as water, glucose, salt (NaCl), amino acids, and urea pass freely into Bowman's space, but cells, platelets and large proteins do not. As a result, the filtrate leaving the Bowman's capsule is very similar to blood plasma in composition as it passes into the proximal convoluted tubule. Together, the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule are called the renal corpuscle.

====Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT)====

The proximal tubule can be anatomically divided into two segments: the proximal convoluted tubule and the proximal straight tubule. The proximal convoluted tubule can be divided further into S1 and S2 segments based on the histological appearance of it's cells. Following this naming convention, the proximal straight tubule is commonly called the S3 segment. The proximal convoluted tubule has one layer of cuboidal cells in the lumen. This is the only place in the nephron that contains cuboidal cells. These cells are covered with millions of microvilli. The microvilli serve to increase surface area for reabsorption.

Fluid in the filtrate entering the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries, including approximately two-thirds of the filtered salt and water and all filtered organic solutes (primarily glucose and amino acids). This is driven by sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the Na+/K+ ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells. Much of the mass movement of water and solutes occurs in between the cells through the tight junctions, which in this case are not selective.

The solutes are absorbed isotonically, in that the osmotic potential of the fluid leaving the proximal tubule is the same as that of the initial glomerular filtrate. However, glucose, amino acids, inorganic phosphate, and some other solutes are reabsorbed via secondary active transport through cotransport channels driven by the sodium gradient out of the nephron.

====Loop of the Nephron or Loop of Henle====
[[File:Gray1128.png|thumb|450px|left|The Nephron Loop or Loop of Henle.]]

The loop of Henle (sometimes known as the nephron loop) is a U-shaped tube that consists of a descending limb and ascending limb. It begins in the cortex, receiving filtrate from the proximal convoluted tubule, extends into the medulla, and then returns to the cortex to empty into the distal convoluted tubule. Its primary role is to concentrate the salt in the interstitium, the tissue surrounding the loop.

;Descending limb:Its descending limb is permeable to water but completely impermeable to salt, and thus only indirectly contributes to the concentration of the interstitium. As the filtrate descends deeper into the hypertonic interstitium of the renal medulla, water flows freely out of the descending limb by osmosis until the tonicity of the filtrate and interstitium equilibrate. Longer descending limbs allow more time for water to flow out of the filtrate, so longer limbs make the filtrate more hypertonic than shorter limbs.

;Ascending limb:Unlike the descending limb, the ascending limb of Henle's loop is impermeable to water, a critical feature of the countercurrent exchange mechanism employed by the loop. The ascending limb actively pumps sodium out of the filtrate, generating the hypertonic interstitium that drives countercurrent exchange. In passing through the ascending limb, the filtrate grows hypotonic since it has lost much of its sodium content. This hypotonic filtrate is passed to the distal convoluted tubule in the renal cortex.

====Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT)====

The distal convoluted tubule is similar to the proximal convoluted tubule in structure and function. Cells lining the tubule have numerous mitochondria, enabling active transport to take place by the energy supplied by ATP. Much of the ion transport taking place in the distal convoluted tubule is regulated by the endocrine system. In the presence of parathyroid hormone, the distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs more calcium and excretes more phosphate. When aldosterone is present, more sodium is reabsorbed and more potassium excreted. Atrial natriuretic peptide causes the distal convoluted tubule to excrete more sodium. In addition, the tubule also secretes hydrogen and ammonium to regulate pH.
After traveling the length of the distal convoluted tubule, only 3% of water remains, and the remaining salt content is negligible. 97.9% of the water in the glomerular filtrate enters the convoluted tubules and collecting ducts by osmosis.

====Collecting ducts====

Each distal convoluted tubule delivers its filtrate to a system of collecting ducts, the first segment of which is the connecting tubule. The collecting duct system begins in the renal cortex and extends deep into the medulla. As the urine travels down the collecting duct system, it passes by the medullary interstitium which has a high sodium concentration as a result of the loop of Henle's countercurrent multiplier system. Though the collecting duct is normally impermeable to water, it becomes permeable in the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). As much as three-fourths of the water from urine can be reabsorbed as it leaves the collecting duct by osmosis. Thus the levels of ADH determine whether urine will be concentrated or dilute. Dehydration results in an increase in ADH, while water sufficiency results in low ADH allowing for diluted urine. Lower portions of the collecting duct are also permeable to urea, allowing some of it to enter the medulla of the kidney, thus maintaining its high ion concentration (which is very important for the nephron).

Urine leaves the medullary collecting ducts through the renal papilla, emptying into the renal calyces, the renal pelvis, and finally into the bladder via the ureter.
Because it has a different embryonic origin than the rest of the nephron (the collecting duct is from endoderm whereas the nephron is from mesoderm), the collecting duct is usually not considered a part of the nephron proper.

'''Renal Hormones'''

1. Vitamin D- Becomes metabolically active in the kidney. Patients with renal disease have symptoms of disturbed calcium and phosphate balance.

2. Erythropoietin- Released by the kidneys in response to decreased tissue oxygen levels (hypoxia).

3. Natriuretic Hormone- Released from cardiocyte granules located in the right atria of the heart in response to increased atrial stretch. It inhibits ADH secretions which can contribute to the loss of sodium and water.

==Formation of Urine==

Urine is formed in three steps: Filtration, Reabsorption, and Secretion.

===Filtration===

Blood enters the afferent arteriole and flows into the glomerulus. Blood in the glomerulus has both filterable blood components and non-filterable blood components. Filterable blood components move toward the inside of the glomerulus while non-filterable blood components bypass the filtration process by exiting through the efferent arteriole. Filterable Blood components will then take a plasma like form called glomerular filtrate. A few of the filterable blood components are water, nitrogenous waste, nutrients and salts (ions). Nonfilterable blood components include formed elements such as blood cells and platelets along with plasma proteins. The glomerular filtrate is not the same consistency as urine, as much of it is reabsorbed into the blood as the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron.

===Reabsorption===

Within the peritubular capillary network, molecules and ions are reabsorbed back into the blood. Sodium Chloride reabsorbed into the system increases the osmolarity of blood in comparison to the glomerular filtrate. This reabsorption process allows water (H2O) to pass from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulatory system. 

Glucose and various amino acids also are reabsorbed into the circulatory system. These nutrients have carrier molecules that claim the glomerular molecule and release it back into the circulatory system. If all of the carrier molecules are used up, excess glucose or amino acids are set free into the urine.  A complication of diabetes is the inability of the body to reabsorb glucose. If too much glucose appears in the glomerular filtrate it increases the osmolarity of the filtrate, causing water to be released into the urine rather than reabsorbed by the circulatory system. Frequent urination and unexplained thirst are warning signs of diabetes, due to water not being reabsorbed.

Glomerular filtrate has now been separated into two forms: Reabsorbed Filtrate and Non-reabsorbed Filtrate. Non-reabsorbed filtrate is now  
known as tubular fluid as it passes through the collecting duct to be processed into urine.

===Secretion===

Some substances are removed from blood through the peritubular capillary network into the distal convoluted tubule or collecting duct. These substances are Hydrogen ions, creatinine, and drugs. Urine is a collection of substances that have not been reabsorbed during glomerular filtration or tubular reabsorbtion.

==Maintaining Water-Salt Balance==

It is the job of the kidneys to maintain the water-salt balance of the blood.  They also maintain blood volume as well as blood pressure. Simple examples of ways that this balance can be changed include ingestion of water, dehydration, blood loss and salt ingestion.

===Reabsorption of water===

Direct control of water excretion in the kidneys is exercised by the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), released by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. ADH causes the insertion of water channels into the membranes of cells lining the collecting ducts, allowing water reabsorption to occur. Without ADH, little water is reabsorbed in the collecting ducts and dilute urine is excreted. 
There are several factors that influence the secretion of ADH.  The first of these happen when the blood plasma gets too concentrated.  When this occurs, special receptors in the hypothalamus release ADH. When blood pressure falls, stretch receptors in the aorta and carotid arteries stimulate ADH secretion to increase volume of the blood.

===Reabsorption of Salt===

The Kidneys also regulate the salt balance in the blood by controlling the excretion and the reabsorption of various ions.  As noted above, ADH plays a role in increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys, thus helping to dilute bodily fluids. The kidneys also have a regulated mechanism for reabsorbing sodium in the distal nephron. This mechanism is controlled by aldosterone, a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone promotes the excretion of potassium ions and the reabsorption of sodium ions.  The release of Aldosterone is initiated by the kidneys. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a renal structure consisting of the macula densa, mesangial cells, and juxtaglomerular cells. Juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells, also known as granular cells) are the site of renin secretion.  Renin is an enzyme that converts angiotensinogen (a large plasma protein produced by the liver) into Angiotensin I  and eventually into Angiotensin II which stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone. The reabsorption of sodium ions is followed by the reapsorption of water.  This causes blood pressure as well as blood volume to increase.

'''Atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH''') is released by the atria of the heart when cardiac cells are stretched due to increased blood volume.  ANH inhibits the secretion of renin by the  juxtaglomerular apparatus and the secretion of the aldosterone by the adrenal cortex.  This promotes the excretion of sodium.  When sodium is excreted so is water.  This causes blood pressure and volume to decrease. 

====Hypernatremia====
An increase in plasma sodium levels above normal is '''hypernatremia'''.  Sodium is the primary solute in the extracellular fluid. Sodium levels have a major role in osmolarity regulation.  For excitable cells the electrochemical gradient for sodium across the plasma membrane is critical for life.  Water retention and an increased blood pressure usually are signs of hypernatremia.  If the plasma sodium levels are below normal it is called '''hyponatremia'''.  Signs of this are low plasma volume and hypotension.

====Diuretics====

A diuretic (colloquially called a water pill) is any drug that elevates the rate of bodily urine excretion (diuresis). Diuretics also decrease the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, and are primarily used to produce a negative extracellular fluid balance. Caffeine, cranberry juice and alcohol are all weak diuretics.
In medicine, diuretics are used to treat heart failure, liver cirrhosis, hypertension and certain kidney diseases. Diuretics alleviate the symptoms of these diseases by causing sodium and water loss through the urine. As urine is produced by the kidney, sodium and water – which cause edema related to the disease – move into the blood to replace the volume lost as urine, thereby reducing the pathological edema. Some diuretics, such as acetazolamide, help to make the urine more alkaline and are helpful in increasing excretion of substances such as aspirin in cases of overdose or poisoning.
The antihypertensive actions of some diuretics (thiazides and loop diuretics in particular) are independent of their diuretic effect. That is, the reduction in blood pressure is not due to decreased blood volume resulting from increased urine production, but occurs through other mechanisms and at lower doses than that required to produce diuresis. Indapamide was specifically designed with this is mind, and has a larger therapeutic window for hypertension (without pronounced diuresis) than most other diuretics.
Chemically, diuretics are a diverse group of compounds that either stimulate or inhibit various hormones that naturally occur in the body to regulate urine production by the kidneys.
Alcohol produces diuresis through modulation of the vasopressin system.

==Diseases of the Kidney==
 
'''Diabetic nephropathy''' (nephropatia diabetica), also known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson syndrome and intercapillary glomerulonephritis, is a progressive kidney disease caused by angiopathy of capillaries in the kidney glomeruli. It is characterized by nodular glomerulosclerosis. It is due to longstanding diabetes mellitus, and is a prime cause for dialysis in many Western countries.
[[Image:Kidney Stone1.jpg|center|thumb|right|An image of a '''kidney stone'''.]]
In medicine, '''hematuria''' (or &quot;haematuria&quot;) is the presence of blood in the urine. It is a sign of a large number of diseases of the kidneys and the urinary tract, ranging from trivial to lethal.

'''Kidney stones''', also known as nephrolithiases, urolithiases or renal calculi, are solid accretions (crystals) of dissolved minerals in urine found inside the kidneys or ureters. They vary in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. Kidney stones typically leave the body in the urine stream; if they grow relatively large before passing (on the order of millimeters), obstruction of a ureter and distention with urine can cause severe pain most commonly felt in the flank, lower abdomen and groin. Kidney stones are unrelated to gallstones.

'''Case Study''' 
I was 34 weeks pregnant when I noticed blood in my urine. I immediately went to my OBGYN where I was told that I had a bladder infection and given an antibiotic. The next morning I experienced the most intense pain. I was rushed to the ER where I was told that I had kidney stones. The doctors explained that there was nothing they could do as long as I was pregnant. The next 3 weeks of my life were filled with intense pain and multiple painkillers. After I delivered my baby, CAT scans were done and I was informed that I had 6 kidney stones. It took three more weeks for me to pass all of the stones the largest measuring 5 mm. The stones were tested and I was informed that my body had been building up calcium due to my pregnancy and this was the cause of the kidney stones. I continued to have kidney pain for 6 months after passing the stones. I now live my life on a low calcium diet and the hope that my body will not develop more kidney stones.

'''Pyelonephritis'''  When an infection of the renal pelvis and calices, called pyelitis, spreads to involve the rest of the kidney as well, the result is pyelonephritis.  It usually results from the spread of fecal bacterium Escherichia coli from the anal region superiorly through the urinary tract.  In severe cases, the kidney swells and scars, abscesses form, and the renal pelvis fills with pus.  Left untreated, the infected kidney may be severely damaged, but administration of antibiotics usually achieve a total cure.

'''glomerulonephritis''' Inflammation of the glomerular can be caused by immunologic abnormalities, drugs or toxins, vascular disorders, and systemic diseases. Glomerulonephritis can be acute, chronic or progressive. Two major changes in the urine are distinctive of glomerulonephritis: hematuria and proteinuria with albumin as the major protein. There is also a decrease in urine as there is a decrease in GFR (glomerular filtration rate). Renal failure
is associated with oliguria (less than 400 ml of urine output per day). 

'''Renal Failure''' Uremia is a syndrome of renal failure and includes elevated blood urea and creatinine levels. Acute renal failure can be reversed if diagnosed early. Acute renal failure can be caused by severe hypotension or severe glomerular disease. Diagnostic tests include BUN and plasma creatinine level tests. It is considered to be chronic renal failure if the decline of renal function to less than 25%.

==Diabetes Insipidus==

This is caused by the deficiency of or decrease of ADH.  The person with (DI) has the inability to concentrate their urine in water restriction, in turn they will void up 3 to 20 liters/day.  There are two forms of (DI), neurogenic, and nephrogenic.  
In nephrogenic (DI) the kidneys do not respond to ADH.  Usually the nephrogenic (DI) is characterized by the impairment of the urine concentrating capability of the kidney along with concentration of water.  The cause may be a genetic trait, electrolyte disorder, or side effect of drugs such as lithium.  In the neurogenic (DI), it is usually caused by head injury near the hypophysisal tract.

==Urinary tract infections (UTI's)==
The second most common type of bacterial infections seen by health care providers is UTI's.  Out of all the bacterias that colonize and cause urinary tract infections the big gun is ''Escherichia coli''. In the hospital indwelling catheters and straight catheterizing predispose the opportunity for urinary tract infections.  In females there are three stages in life that predispose urinary tract infections, that is menarche, manipulation between intercourse, and menopause.  However, a small percentage of men and children will get urinary tract infections.  In men it is usually due to the prostate gland growth which usually occurs in older age men.  In children it can occur 3% to 5% in girls and 1% in boys, uncircumcised boys it is more common than circumcised ones to have a urinary tract infection, in girls it may be the result of onset of toilet training, some predispositions for getting urinary tract infection  include family history and  urinary tract anomalies.  In neonates urinary tract infections is most common when bacteremia is present.

==Dialysis and Kidney Transplant==
[[Image:Plugged into dialysis.jpg|thumb|200px|Plugged into dialysis]]

Generally, humans can live normally with just one kidney. Only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished will renal failure develop. If renal function is impaired, various forms of medications are used, while others are contraindicated. Provided that treatment is begun early, it may be possible to reverse chronic kidney failure due to diabetes or high blood pressure. If creatinine clearance (a measure of renal function) has fallen very low (&quot;end-stage renal failure&quot;), or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms, dialysis is commenced. Dialysis is a medical procedure, performed in various different forms, where the blood is filtered outside of the body.

Kidney transplantation is the only cure for end stage renal failure; dialysis, is a supportive treatment; a form of &quot;buying time&quot; to bridge the inevitable wait for a suitable organ.

The first successful kidney transplant was announced on March 4, 1954 at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. The surgery was performed by Dr. Joseph E. Murray, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1990 for this feat.

There are two types of kidney transplants: living donor transplant and a cadaveric (dead donor) transplant. When a kidney from a living donor, usually a blood relative, is transplanted into the patient's body, the donor's blood group and tissue type must be judged compatible with the patient's, and extensive medical tests are done to determine the health of the donor. Before a cadaveric donor's organs can be transplanted, a series of medical tests have to be done to determine if the organs are healthy. Also, in some countries, the family of the donor must give its consent for the organ donation. In both cases, the recipient of the new organ needs to take drugs to suppress their immune system to help prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney.

[[File:Zeiger.PNG|thumb|180px|Pointer ''a'' pointing variable ''b''. Note that ''b'' stores number, whereas ''a'' stores address of ''b'' in memory (1462)]]
A '''[[w:Pointer (computing)|pointer]]''' is a value that designates the address (i.e., the location in memory), of some value. Pointers are variables that hold a memory location.

There are four fundamental things you need to know about pointers:
* How to declare them (with the address operator '&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;': &lt;code&gt;int *pointer = &amp;variable;&lt;/code&gt;)
* How to assign to them (&lt;code&gt;pointer = NULL;&lt;/code&gt;)
* How to reference the value to which the pointer points (known as ''dereferencing'', by using the dereferencing operator '&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;': &lt;code&gt;value = *pointer;&lt;/code&gt;)
* How they relate to arrays (the vast majority of arrays in C are simple lists, also called &quot;1 dimensional arrays&quot;, but we will briefly  cover multi-dimensional arrays with some pointers in [[C Programming/Common practices#Dynamic multidimensional arrays|a later chapter]]).

Pointers can reference any data type, even functions. We'll also discuss the relationship of pointers with text strings and the more advanced concept of function pointers.

==Declaring pointers==

Consider the following snippet of code which declares two pointers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line start=1&gt;
 struct MyStruct {
     int   m_aNumber;
     float num2;
 };
 
int main()
{
 int          * pJ2;
 struct MyStruct * pAnItem;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Lines 1-4 define a [[C Programming/Complex types#Structs|structure]].  Line 8 declares a variable which points to an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, and line 9 declares a variable which points to something with structure MyStruct.  So to declare a variable as something which points to some type, rather than contains some type, the asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) is placed before the variable name.  

In the following, line 1 declares &lt;code&gt;var1&lt;/code&gt; as a pointer to a long and &lt;code&gt;var2&lt;/code&gt; as a long and not a pointer to a long.  In line 2, &lt;code&gt;p3&lt;/code&gt; is declared as a pointer to a pointer to an int.

 &lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line start=1&gt;
long  *  var1, var2;
 int   ** p3;
&lt;/source&gt;

Pointer types are often used as parameters to function calls.  The following shows how to declare a function which uses a pointer as an argument. Since C passes function arguments by value, in order to allow a function to modify a value from the calling routine, a pointer to the value must be passed.  Pointers to structures are also used as function arguments even when nothing in the struct will be modified in the function.  This is done to avoid copying the complete contents of the structure onto the stack.  More about pointers as function arguments later.

 int MyFunction( struct MyStruct *pStruct );

==Assigning values to pointers==

So far we've discussed how to declare pointers. The process of assigning values to pointers is next.  To assign a pointer the address of a variable, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; or 'address of' operator is used. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int   myInt;
 int  *pPointer;
 struct MyStruct   dvorak;
 struct MyStruct  *pKeyboard;
 
 pPointer = &amp;myInt;
 pKeyboard = &amp;dvorak;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, pPointer will now reference myInt and pKeyboard will reference dvorak.

Pointers can also be assigned to reference dynamically allocated memory.  The malloc() and calloc() functions are often used to do this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 /* ... */
 struct MyStruct *pKeyboard;
 /* ... */
 pKeyboard = malloc(sizeof *pKeyboard);
&lt;/source&gt;

The malloc function returns a pointer to dynamically allocated memory (or NULL if unsuccessful). The size of this memory will be appropriately sized to contain the MyStruct structure.

The following is an example showing one pointer being assigned to another and of a pointer being assigned a return value from a function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 static struct MyStruct val1, val2, val3, val4;

 struct MyStruct *ASillyFunction( int b )
 {
    struct MyStruct *myReturn;
 
    if (b == 1) myReturn = &amp;val1;
    else if (b==2) myReturn = &amp;val2;
    else if (b==3) myReturn = &amp;val3;
    else myReturn = &amp;val4;
  
    return myReturn;
 }

 struct MyStruct *strPointer;
 int     *c, *d;
 int     j;

 c = &amp;j;                           /* pointer assigned using &amp; operator */
 d = c;                            /* assign one pointer to another     */
 strPointer = ASillyFunction( 3 ); /* pointer returned from a function. */
&lt;/source&gt;

When returning a pointer from a function, do not return a pointer that points to a value that is local to the function or that is a pointer to a function argument.  Pointers to local variables become invalid when the function exits. In the above function, the value returned points to a static variable.  Returning a pointer to dynamically allocated memory is also valid.

==Pointer dereferencing==
[[File:Pointers in programming.svg|thumb|300px|The pointer &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; points to the variable &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;.]]
To access a value to which a pointer points, the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator is used. Another operator, the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is used in conjunction with pointers to structures.  Here's a short example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int   c, d;
 int   *pj;
 struct MyStruct astruct;
 struct MyStruct *bb;
 
 c   = 10;
 pj  = &amp;c;             /* pj points to c */
 d   = *pj;            /* d is assigned the value to which pj points, 10 */
 pj  = &amp;d;             /* now points to d */
 *pj = 12;             /* d is now 12 */
 
 bb = &amp;astruct;
 (*bb).m_aNumber = 3;  /* assigns 3 to the m_aNumber member of astruct */
 bb-&gt;num2 = 44.3;      /* assigns 44.3 to the num2 member of astruct   */
 *pj = bb-&gt;m_aNumber;  /* eqivalent to d = astruct.m_aNumber;          */
&lt;/source&gt;

The expression &lt;code&gt;bb-&gt;m_aNumber&lt;/code&gt; is entirely equivalent to &lt;code&gt;(*bb).m_aNumber&lt;/code&gt;. They both access the &lt;code&gt;m_aNumber&lt;/code&gt; element of the structure pointed to by &lt;code&gt;bb&lt;/code&gt;. There is one more way of dereferencing a pointer, which will be discussed in the following section.

When dereferencing a pointer that points to an invalid memory location, an error often occurs which results in the program terminating.  The error is often reported as a segmentation error.  A common cause of this is failure to initialize a pointer before trying to dereference it.
 
C is known for giving you just enough rope to hang yourself, and pointer dereferencing is a prime example.  You are quite free to write code that accesses memory outside that which you have explicitly requested from the system.  And many times, that memory may appear as available to your program due to the vagaries of system memory allocation.  However, even if 99 executions allow your program to run without fault, that 100th execution may be the time when your &quot;memory pilfering&quot; is caught by the system and the program fails.  Be careful to ensure that your pointer offsets are within the bounds of allocated memory!

The declaration &lt;code&gt;void *somePointer;&lt;/code&gt; is used to declare a pointer of some nonspecified type. You can assign a value to a void pointer, but you must cast the variable to point to some specified type before you can dereference it.  Pointer arithmetic is also not valid with &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; pointers.

==Pointers and Arrays==
Up to now, we've carefully been avoiding discussing arrays in the context of pointers. The interaction of pointers and arrays can be confusing but here are two fundamental statements about it:
* A variable declared as an array of some type acts as a pointer to that type.  When used by itself, it points to the first element of the array.
* A pointer can be indexed like an array name. 
 
The first case often is seen to occur when an array is passed as an argument to a function.  The function declares the parameter as a pointer, but the actual argument may be the name of an array.  The second case often occurs when accessing dynamically allocated memory. Let's look at examples of each. In the following code, the call to calloc() effectively allocates an array of struct MyStruct items.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 float KrazyFunction( struct MyStruct *parm1, int p1size, int bb )
 { 
   int ix; //declaring an integer variable//
   for (ix=0; ix&lt;p1size; ix++) {
      if (parm1[ix].m_aNumber == bb )
          return parm1[ix].num2;
   }
   return 0.0f;
 }

 /* ... */
 struct MyStruct myArray[4];
 #define MY_ARRAY_SIZE (sizeof(myArray)/sizeof(*myArray))
 float v3;
 struct MyStruct *secondArray;
 int   someSize;
 int   ix;
 /* initialization of myArray ... */
 v3 = KrazyFunction( myArray, MY_ARRAY_SIZE, 4 );
 /* ... */
 secondArray = calloc( someSize, sizeof(myArray) );
 for (ix=0; ix&lt;someSize; ix++) {
     secondArray[ix].m_aNumber = ix *2;
     secondArray[ix].num2 = .304 * ix * ix;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Pointers and array names can pretty much be used interchangeably. There are exceptions. You cannot
assign a new pointer value to an array name. The array name will always point to the first element of the array.  In the function &lt;code&gt;KrazyFunction&lt;/code&gt; above, you could however assign a new value to parm1, as it is just a pointer to the first element of myArray.  It is also valid for a function to return a pointer to one of the array elements from an array passed as an argument to a function. A function should never return a pointer to a local variable, even though the compiler will probably not complain.

When declaring parameters to functions, declaring an array variable without a size is equivalent to declaring a pointer. Often this is done to emphasize the fact that the pointer variable will be used in a manner equivalent to an array. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;	
 /* two equivalent function definitions */
 int LittleFunction( int *paramN );
 int LittleFunction( int paramN[] );	 
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we're ready to discuss pointer arithmetic. You can add and subtract integer values to/from pointers. If myArray is declared to be some type of array, the expression &lt;code&gt;*(myArray+j)&lt;/code&gt;, where j is an integer, is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;myArray[j]&lt;/code&gt;. So for instance in the above example where we had the expression secondArray[i].num2, we could have written that as &lt;code&gt;*(secondArray+i).num2&lt;/code&gt; or more simply &lt;code&gt;(secondArray+i)-&gt;num2&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that for addition and subtraction of integers and pointers, the value of the pointer is not adjusted by the integer amount, but is adjusted by the amount multiplied by the size (in bytes) of the type to which the pointer refers.  One pointer may also be subtracted from another, provided they point to elements of the same array (or the position just beyond the end of the array). If you have a pointer that points to an element of an array, the index of the element is the result when the array name is subtracted from the pointer. Here's an example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 struct MyStruct someArray[20];
 struct MyStruct *p2;
 int idx;
 
 .
 /* array initialization .. */
 . 
 for (p2 = someArray; p2 &lt; someArray+20;  ++p2) {
    if (p2-&gt;num2 &gt; testValue) break;
 }
 idx = p2 - someArray;        
&lt;/source&gt;

You may be wondering how pointers and multidimensional arrays interact. Let's look at this a bit in detail.  Suppose A is declared as a two dimensional array of floats (&lt;code&gt;float A[D1][D2];&lt;/code&gt;) and that pf is declared a pointer to a float.  If pf is initialized to point to A[0][0], then *(pf+1) is equivalent to A[0][1] and *(pf+D2) is equivalent to A[1][0]. The elements of the array are stored in row-major order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;	
 float A[6][8];
 float *pf;
 pf = &amp;A[0][0]; 
 *(pf+1) = 1.3;   /* assigns 1.3 to A[0][1] */
 *(pf+8) = 2.3;   /* assigns 2.3 to A[1][0] */
&lt;/source&gt;	

Let's look at a slightly different problem.  We want to have a two dimensional array, but we don't need to have all the rows the same length. What we do is declare an array of pointers. The second line below declares A as an array of pointers. Each pointer points to a float. Here's some applicable code:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 float  linearA[30];
 float *A[6];
 
 A[0] = linearA;              /*  5 - 0 = 5 elements in row  */
 A[1] = linearA + 5;          /* 11 - 5 = 6 elements in row  */
 A[2] = linearA + 11;         /* 15 - 11 = 4 elements in row */
 A[3] = linearA + 15;         /* 21 - 15 = 6 elements        */
 A[4] = linearA + 21;         /* 25 - 21 = 4 elements        */
 A[5] = linearA + 25;         /* 30 - 25 = 5 elements        */
 
 *A[3][2] = 3.66;          /* assigns 3.66 to linearA[17];     */
 *A[3][-3] = 1.44;         /* refers to linearA[12];           
                             negative indices are sometimes useful. But avoid using them as much as possible. */
&lt;/source&gt;
   
We also note here something curious about array indexing. Suppose myArray is an array and idx is an integer value. The expression myArray[idx] is equivalent to idx[myArray]. The first is equivalent to *(myArray+idx), and the second is equivalent to *(idx+myArray). These turn out to be the same, since the addition is commutative.

Pointers can be used with preincrement or post decrement, which is sometimes done within a loop, as in the following example.  The increment and decrement applies to the pointer, not to the object to which the pointer refers.
In other words, *pArray++ is equivalent to *(pArray++).

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 long  myArray[20];
 long  *pArray;
 int  i;
 
 /* Assign values to the entries of myArray */
 pArray = myArray;
 for (i=0; i&lt;10; ++i) {
   *pArray++ = 5 + 3*i + 12*i*i;
   *pArray++ = 6 + 2*i + 7*i*i;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Pointers in Function Arguments==
Often we need to invoke a function with an argument that is itself a pointer. In many instances, the variable is itself a parameter for the current function and may be a pointer to some type of structure.  The ampersand character is not needed in this circumstance to obtain a pointer value, as the variable is itself a pointer. In the example below, the variable &lt;code&gt;pStruct&lt;/code&gt;, a pointer, is a parameter to function &lt;code&gt;FunctTwo,&lt;/code&gt; and is passed as an argument to &lt;code&gt;FunctOne&lt;/code&gt;.
The second parameter to &lt;code&gt;FunctOne&lt;/code&gt; is an int. Since in function &lt;code&gt;FunctTwo, mValue&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to an int, the pointer must first be dereferenced using the * operator, hence the second argument in the call is &lt;code&gt;*mValue&lt;/code&gt;.  The
third parameter to function &lt;code&gt;FunctOne&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to a long. Since &lt;code&gt;pAA&lt;/code&gt; is itself a pointer to a long, no ampersand is needed when it is used as the third argument to the function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int FunctOne( struct SomeStruct *pValue, int iValue, long *lValue )
 {
    /*  do some stuff ... */
    return 0;
 }
 int FunctTwo( struct someStruct *pStruct, int *mValue )
 {
    int j;
    long  AnArray[25];
    long *pAA;
     
    pAA = &amp;AnArray[13];
    j = FunctOne( pStruct, *mValue, pAA );
    return j;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Pointers and Text Strings==

Historically, text strings in C have been implemented as arrays of characters, with the last byte in the string being a zero, or the null character '\0'.  Most C implementations come with a standard library of functions for manipulating strings.  Many of the more commonly used functions expect the strings to be null terminated strings of characters.
To use these functions requires the inclusion of the standard C header file &quot;string.h&quot;. 

A statically declared, initialized string would look similar to the following:

 static const char *myFormat = &quot;Total Amount Due: %d&quot;;

The variable &lt;code&gt;myFormat&lt;/code&gt; can be viewed as an array of 21 characters. There is an implied null character ('\0') tacked on to the end of the string after the 'd' as the 21st item in the array. 
You can also initialize the individual characters of the array as follows:

 static const char myFlower[] = { 'P', 'e', 't', 'u', 'n', 'i', 'a', '\0' };

An initialized array of strings would typically be done as follows:

 static const char *myColors[] = {
    &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Violet&quot; };

The initialization of an especially long string can be split across lines of source code as follows.

 static char *longString = &quot;Hello. My name is Rudolph and I work as a reindeer &quot;
   &quot;around Christmas time up at the North Pole.  My boss is a really swell guy.&quot;
   &quot; He likes to give everybody gifts.&quot;;


The library functions that are used with strings are discussed in a later chapter.

==Pointers to Functions==

C also allows you to create pointers to functions. Pointers to functions can get rather messy. Declaring a typedef to a function pointer generally clarifies the code. Here's an example that uses a function pointer, and a void * pointer to implement what's known as a callback. The &lt;code&gt;DoSomethingNice&lt;/code&gt; function invokes a caller supplied function &lt;code&gt;TalkJive&lt;/code&gt; with caller data. Note that &lt;code&gt;DoSomethingNice&lt;/code&gt; really doesn't know anything about what &lt;code&gt;dataPointer&lt;/code&gt; refers to.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 typedef  int (*MyFunctionType)( int, void *);      /* a typedef for a function pointer */

 #define THE_BIGGEST 100

 int DoSomethingNice( int aVariable, MyFunctionType aFunction, void *dataPointer )
 {
     int rv = 0;
     if (aVariable &lt; THE_BIGGEST) {
        /* invoke function through function pointer (old style) */
        rv = (*aFunction)(aVariable, dataPointer );
      } else {
          /* invoke function through function pointer (new style) */
        rv = aFunction(aVariable, dataPointer );
     };
     return rv;
 }

 typedef struct {
     int    colorSpec;
     char   *phrase;
 } DataINeed;
 
 int TalkJive( int myNumber, void *someStuff )
 {
     /* recast void * to pointer type specifically needed for this function */
     DataINeed *myData = someStuff;
     /* talk jive. */
     return 5;
 }
 
 static DataINeed  sillyStuff = { BLUE, &quot;Whatcha talkin 'bout Willis?&quot; };
  
/* ... */
 DoSomethingNice( 41, &amp;TalkJive,  &amp;sillyStuff );
&lt;/source&gt; 

Some versions of C may not require an ampersand preceding the &lt;code&gt;TalkJive&lt;/code&gt; argument in the &lt;code&gt;DoSomethingNice&lt;/code&gt; call.  Some implementations may require specifically casting the argument to the &lt;code&gt;MyFunctionType&lt;/code&gt; type, even though the function signature exacly matches that of the typedef.

Function pointers can be useful for implementing a form of polymorphism in C. First one declares a structure having as elements function pointers for the various operations to that can be specified polymorphically.  A second base object structure containing a pointer to the previous
structure is also declared.  A class is defined by extending the second structure with the data specific for the class, and static variable of the type of the first structure, containing the addresses of the functions that are associated with the class. This type of polymorphism is used in the standard library when file I/O functions are called.

A similar mechanism can also be used for implementing a state machine in C. A structure is defined which contains function pointers for handling events that may occur within state, and  for functions to be invoked upon entry to and exit from the state. An instance of this structure corresponds to a state. Each state is initialized with pointers to functions appropriate for the state.  The current state of the state machine is in effect a pointer to one of these states.  Changing the value of the current state pointer effectively changes the current state.  When some event occurs, the appropriate function is called through a function pointer in the current state.

==Practical use of function pointers in C==
Function pointers are mainly used to reduce the complexity of switch statement.
Example with switch statement: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mul(int a, int b);
int div(int a, int b);
int main()
{
    int i, result;
    int a=10;
    int b=5;
    printf(&quot;Enter the value between 0 and 3 : &quot;);
    scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;i); 
    switch(i)
    {
        case 0:  result = add(a,b); break;
        case 1:  result = sub(a,b); break;
        case 2:  result = mul(a,b); break;
        case 3:  result = div(a,b); break;
    }
}
int add(int i, int j)
{
    return (i+j);
}
int sub(int i, int j)
{
    return (i-j);
}
 int mul(int i, int j)
{
    return (i*j);
}
int div(int i, int j)
{
    return (i/j);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Without using a switch statement:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int add(int a, int b);
int sub(int a, int b);
int mul(int a, int b);
int div(int a, int b);
int (*oper[4])(int a, int b) = {add, sub, mul, div};
int main()
{
    int i,result;
    int a=10;
    int b=5;
    printf(&quot;Enter the value between 0 and 3 : &quot;);
    scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;i); 
    result = oper[i](a,b);
}
int add(int i, int j)
{
    return (i+j);
}
int sub(int i, int j)
{
    return (i-j);
}
int mul(int i, int j)
{
    return (i*j);
}
int div(int i, int j)
{
    return (i/j);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Function pointers may be used to create a struct member function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct
{
    int (*open)(void);
    void (*close)(void);
    int (*reg)(void);
} device;

int my_device_open(void)
{
    /* ... */
}

void my_device_close(void)
{
    /* ... */
}

void register_device(void)
{
    /* ... */
}

device create(void)
{
    device my_device;
    my_device.open = my_device_open;
    my_device.close = my_device_close;
    my_device.reg = register_device;
    my_device.reg();
    return my_device;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Use to implement this pointer (following code must be placed in library).
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
static struct device_data
{
    /* ... here goes data of structure ... */
};

static struct device_data obj;

typedef struct
{
    int (*open)(void);
    void (*close)(void);
    int (*reg)(void);
} device;

static struct device_data create_device_data(void)
{
    struct device_data my_device_data;
    /* ... here goes constructor ... */
    return my_device_data;
}

/* here I omit the my_device_open, my_device_close and register_device functions */

device create_device(void)
{
    device my_device;
    my_device.open = my_device_open;
    my_device.close = my_device_close;
    my_device.reg = register_device;
    my_device.reg();
    return my_device;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Examples of pointer constructs==

Below are some example constructs which may aid in creating your pointer.

 int i;         // integer variable 'i'
 int *p;        // pointer 'p' to an integer
 int a[];       // array 'a' of integers
 int f();       // function 'f' with return value of type integer
 int **pp;      // pointer 'pp' to a pointer to an integer
 int (*pa)[];   // pointer 'pa' to an array of integer
 int (*pf)();   // pointer 'pf' to a function with return value integer
 int *ap[];     // array 'ap' of pointers to an integer
 int *fp();     // function 'fp' which returns a pointer to an integer
 int ***ppp;    // pointer 'ppp' to a pointer to a pointer to an integer
 int (**ppa)[]; // pointer 'ppa' to a pointer to an array of integers
 int (**ppf)(); // pointer 'ppf' to a pointer to a function with return value of type integer
 int *(*pap)[]; // pointer 'pap' to an array of pointers to an integer
 int *(*pfp)(); // pointer 'pfp' to function with return value of type pointer to an integer
 int **app[];   // array of pointers 'app' that point to pointers to integer values
 int (*apa[])[];// array of pointers 'apa' to arrays of integers
 int (*apf[])();// array of pointers 'apf' to functions with return values of type integer
 int ***fpp();  // function 'fpp' which returns a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an int
 int (*fpa())[];// function 'fpa' with return value of a pointer to array of integers
 int (*fpf())();// function 'fpf' with return value of a pointer to function which returns an integer

== sizeof ==

The sizeof operator is often used to refer to the size of a static array declared earlier in the same function.

To find the end of an array
(example from [[wikipedia:Buffer overflow]]):

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* better.c - demonstrates one method of fixing the problem */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char buffer[10];
  if (argc &lt; 2)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;USAGE: %s string\n&quot;, argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }
  strncpy(buffer, argv[1], sizeof(buffer));
  buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;


To iterate over every element of an array, use

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #define NUM_ELEM(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof (*(x)))

 for( i = 0; i &lt; NUM_ELEM(array); i++ )
 {
     /* do something with array[i] */
     ;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;


Note that the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;code&gt; operator only works on things defined earlier in the same function.
The compiler replaces it with some fixed constant number.
In this case, the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;code&gt; was declared as an array of 10 char's earlier in the same function, and the compiler replaces &lt;code&gt;sizeof(buffer)&lt;code&gt; with the number 10 at compile time (equivalent to us hard-coding 10 into the code in place of &lt;code&gt;sizeof(buffer)&lt;code&gt;).
The information about the length of &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;code&gt; is not actually stored anywhere in memory (unless we keep track of it separately) and cannot be programmatically obtained at run time from the array/pointer itself.

Often a function needs to know the size of an array it was given -- an array defined in some other function.
For example,

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* broken.c - demonstrates a flaw */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define NUM_ELEM(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof (*(x)))

int sum( int input_array[] ){
  int sum_so_far = 0;
  int i;
  for( i = 0; i &lt; NUM_ELEM(input_array); i++ ) // WON'T WORK -- input_array wasn't defined in this function.
  {
    sum_so_far += input_array[i];
  };
  return( sum_so_far );
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int left_array[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
  int right_array[] = { 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
  int the_sum = sum( left_array );
  printf( &quot;the sum of left_array is: %d&quot;, the_sum );
  the_sum = sum( right_array );
  printf( &quot;the sum of right_array is: %d&quot;, the_sum );

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Unfortunately, (in C and C++) the length of the array cannot be obtained from an array passed in at run time, because (as mentioned above) the size of an array is not stored anywhere.
The compiler always replaces sizeof with a constant.
This sum() routine needs to handle more than just one constant length of an array.

There are some common ways to work around this fact:
* Write the function to require, for each array parameter, a &quot;length&quot; parameter (which has type &quot;size_t&quot;). (Typically we use sizeof at the point where this function is called).
* Use of a convention, such as a [[wikipedia:null-terminated string|null-terminated string]] to mark the end of the array.
* Instead of passing raw arrays, pass a structure that includes the length of the array (such as &quot;.length&quot;) as well as the array (or a pointer to the first element); similar to the &lt;code&gt;string&lt;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;code&gt; classes in C++.

&lt;!-- FIXME: untested --&gt;
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* fixed.c - demonstrates one work-around */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#define NUM_ELEM(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof (*(x)))

int sum( int input_array[], size_t length ){
  int sum_so_far = 0;
  int i;
  for( i = 0; i &lt; length; i++ )
  {
    sum_so_far += input_array[i];
  };
  return( sum_so_far );
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int left_array[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
  int right_array[] = { 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
  int the_sum = sum( left_array, NUM_ELEM(left_array) ); // works here, because left_array is defined in this function
  printf( &quot;the sum of left_array is: %d&quot;, the_sum );
  the_sum = sum( right_array, NUM_ELEM(right_array) ); // works here, because right_array is defined in this function
  printf( &quot;the sum of right_array is: %d&quot;, the_sum );

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It's worth mentioning that sizeof operator has two variations: &lt;tt&gt;sizeof (&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; (for instance: &lt;tt&gt;sizeof (int)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;sizeof (struct some_structure)&lt;/tt&gt;) and &lt;tt&gt;sizeof &lt;i&gt;expression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (for instance: &lt;tt&gt;sizeof some_variable.some_field&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;sizeof 1&lt;/tt&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hindi}}
Don't let yourself be discouraged by the seeming complexity of the Hindi scripting system (Devanagari); It's easier to grasp than you think. Devanagari is actually surprisingly straightforward and easy to learn.

Example of Hindi writing:

मनमोहन सिंह मंत्रिमंडल में मंत्रालयों का बँटवारा पूरा हो गया है. कपिल सिब्बल को मानव संसाधन विकास और आनंद शर्मा को वाणिज्य एवं उद्योग विभाग दिया गया है.
Krupendra
Hindi consists of 11 vowels, 40 consonants, and two sound modifiers.

The Hindi syllabary is ordered according to how the sounds are created in the mouth.

==Vowels==

First are the vowels, which, with one exception, come in pairs:

&lt;big&gt;अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ ए ऐ ओ औ&lt;/big&gt;

Using the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST), these vowels would be represented thus:

a ā i ī u ū ṛ e ai o au

* &lt;big&gt;अ&lt;/big&gt; (''a'') is pronounced as a default vowel, similar to a schwa.
* &lt;big&gt;आ&lt;/big&gt; (''ā'') is like the vowel a in ''water''.
* &lt;big&gt;इ&lt;/big&gt; (''i'') is like the vowel in ''tin''.
* &lt;big&gt;ई&lt;/big&gt; (''ī'') is like the vowel in ''see''.
* &lt;big&gt;ऋ&lt;/big&gt; (''rī'') is like the vowel in ''ceen''.
* &lt;big&gt;उ&lt;/big&gt; (''u'') is like the vowel in ''book''.
* &lt;big&gt;ऊ&lt;/big&gt; (''ū'') is like the vowel in ''tool''.
* &lt;big&gt;ए&lt;/big&gt; (''e'') is like the vowel in ''May'' except there is no diphthong.
* &lt;big&gt;ऐ&lt;/big&gt; (''ai'') is one of the only two diphthong vowels in Hindi, and pronounced differently depending on regional accent. Often it is pronounced like the vowel in ''hat''.
* &lt;big&gt;ओ&lt;/big&gt; (''o'') is like the vowel in ''hole''.
* &lt;big&gt;औ&lt;/big&gt; (''au'') is the other diphthong vowel, also with varying pronunciation. It is often pronounced like the vowel in ''saw'' or ''awe''.

All vowels in Hindi have two forms: Their standalone form and their ''mātrā'' form. The ''mātrā'' form modifies consonants. Here are the eleven vowels paired with the syllable &lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt; (''k''):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- class=&quot;Unicode&quot;
||&lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;का&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;कि&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;की&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;कु&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;कू&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;कृ&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;के&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;कै&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;को&lt;/big&gt;||&lt;big&gt;कौ&lt;/big&gt;
|- class=&quot;Unicode&quot;
||ka||kā||ki||kī||ku||kū||kṛ||ke||kai||ko||kau
|}


* Note that there is no ''mātrā'' form for the first vowel, &lt;big&gt;अ&lt;/big&gt; --''a''. This is because all Hindi consonants, unless part of a conjunct (see below), or they appear at the end of a word, automatically contain this vowel. So, the letter &lt;big&gt;क&lt;/big&gt; is pronounced ''ka''.

== Regular Consonants==

There are 25 regular consonants (consonants that stop air from moving out of the mouth) in Hindi, and they are organized into groups (''vargas'') of five. The ''vargas'' are ordered according to where the tongue is in the mouth. Each successive ''varga'' refers to a successively forward position of the tongue. The ''vargas'' are ordered and named thus (with an example of a corresponding consonant):

* Velar (k)
* Palatal (j)
* Retroflex (English t)
* Dental (Spanish t)
* Labial (p)

The five consonants in each group are ordered thus:

* unaspirated, unvoiced
* aspirated, unvoiced
* unaspirated, voiced
* aspirated, voiced
* nasal

The difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants is as simple for an English speaker to understand as understanding the difference between the consonants &quot;k&quot; and &quot;g&quot; or &quot;j&quot; and &quot;ch.&quot; However, aspiration is a distinction foreign to most English speakers. To understand the difference, do this simple exercise:

Hold your palm about an inch in front of your mouth. Say the word &quot;pit.&quot; Notice that your hand will likely feel a short burst of air coming from your mouth. Now say the word &quot;spit&quot; and notice that there is little or no burst of air. Now attempt to say &quot;pit&quot; again, this time without letting the burst of air happen.

Here are the five ''vargas'' of regular consonants, followed by their corresponding IAST characters:

क ख ग घ ङ &lt;br&gt;
च छ ज झ ञ &lt;br&gt;
ट ठ ड ढ ण &lt;br&gt;
त थ द ध न &lt;br&gt;
प फ ब भ म &lt;br&gt;

''k kh g gh ṅ''

''c ch j jh ñ''

''ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ''

''t th d dh n''

''p ph b bh m''

Notes:

* The nasal consonants in the first two ''vargas'' are almost never found written alone; they are usually ''conjuncted'' (more on conjuncts later) with another consonant in their corresponding ''vargas,'' as the other nasal consonants often are.

* The consonants in the first two ''vargas,'' as well as the last, are pronounced exactly as they are in English. In other words, a Hindi ''k'' sounds like an English &quot;k&quot; (without aspiration).

* The consonant written 'c' can be confusing; it is pronounced like the first sound in the word ''chair'' but without aspiration. The consonant ''ch'' is virtually indistinguishable from ''c'' to the untrained English speaker, but is indeed a different letter.

* The English consonants &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; fall somewhere in between the Hindi consonants ''t'' and ''d'', and ''ṭ'' and ''ḍ''. They are closer to the latter (retroflex), so when Hindi speakers say or speak English words containing t or d, they almost always use the retroflex version. To achieve these sounds, curl the tongue back and touch the tip to the roof of the mouth.

* The dental consonants are pronounced exactly like the &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; in Spanish, with the tongue touching the back of the upper teeth.

* Voiced, aspirated consonants (''gh, bh,'' etc.) are by far the hardest sounds for the English speaker to learn how to make; however, with some practice they are not overly difficult.

==Semivowels==

There are four semivowels in Hindi:

&lt;big&gt;य र ल व&lt;/big&gt;

''y r l w (v)''

* ''y'' is very similar to its corresponding English sound.
* ''r,'' like most non-English &quot;r&quot; sounds, is flipped, but not rolled.
* ''l'' is the same as the English &quot;l&quot;.
* ''w (v)'' has a somewhat flexible pronunciation, depending on context and regional dialects. Sometimes it is pronounced like the English &quot;w&quot; (as in the word ''swami''), and other times it is closer to the English &quot;v&quot;. It is often pronounced somewhere in between the two sounds.

==Sibilants==

There are three sibilants:

&lt;big&gt;श ष स&lt;/big&gt;

''ś ṣ s''

* ''ś'' is the same as &quot;sh&quot; in English.
* ''ṣ'' is also similar to &quot;sh&quot; in English, and though it is technically pronounced farther back in the mouth, functionally there is very little or no difference between the two in spoken Hindi.
* ''s'' is the same as &quot;s&quot; in English.

==Fricative==

There is one fricative consonant:

&lt;big&gt;ह&lt;/big&gt;

''h''

* ''h'' is pronounced the same as &quot;h&quot; in English.

==Modified Consonants==

There are many sounds found in Hindi that do not directly correspond to any Devanagari letter:

* &lt;big&gt;क़&lt;/big&gt; (''q'') is pronounced farther back in the throat than क. For example, the Arabic word ''Qu'ran'' begins with this letter.

* &lt;big&gt;ग़&lt;/big&gt; (ġ) is pronounced in the back of the throat, similar to the French &quot;r.&quot;

* &lt;big&gt;ख़&lt;/big&gt; (&lt;u&gt;kh&lt;/u&gt;) is pronounced like &quot;ch&quot; in German words like ''Bach'' or ''Reich''.

* &lt;big&gt;ज़&lt;/big&gt; (z) is the same as the English &quot;z.&quot;

* &lt;big&gt;ड़&lt;/big&gt; (ṛ) is difficult to describe, except by example. The Hindi word गाड़ी (gaṛī) sounds very much like &quot;gardee.&quot; Notice that the character used to denote this character is the same as denotes &lt;big&gt;ऋ&lt;/big&gt;. The only way to tell the difference is context; if ṛ is followed by a consonant, it corresponds to &lt;big&gt;ऋ&lt;/big&gt; (example: &lt;big&gt;ऋषि&lt;/big&gt; -- ''ṛṣi'' or &quot;Rishi&quot;). If it is followed by a vowel or falls at the end of a word, is is most likely &lt;big&gt;ड़&lt;/big&gt;.

* &lt;big&gt;ढ़&lt;/big&gt; (ṛh) is the aspirated version of &lt;big&gt;ड़&lt;/big&gt;.

* &lt;big&gt;फ़&lt;/big&gt; is the same as the English sound &quot;f.&quot;


==Sound Modifiers==

The '''''anusvara''''' is notated with a small dot above the corresponding letter. In IAST, it is notated ''ṃ''. It can have two different effects:

* In mid-word, when it appears before a consonant, it has the the same effect as if that consonant's corresponding nasal consonant were placed right before it. For example, if placed before the &quot;k&quot; sound in the English word &quot;buck,&quot; it would make the word change to &quot;bunk.&quot; Hindi example: &lt;big&gt;संग&lt;/big&gt; -- ''saṃga'' (group, association) -- is often transliterated as ''sanga''.


* Placed at the end of a word (after a vowel with no further consonants), it simply nasalizes the vowel, often sounding as if the English &quot;ng&quot; (as in &quot;song&quot;) had been placed at the end of the word, though lightly.

Hindi examples: &lt;big&gt;में&lt;/big&gt; -- ''meṃ'' (in).


The '''''candrabindu''''' (meaning &quot;moon dot&quot;) is very similar to the ''anusvara'' and is notated with a dot and a small crescent (see below). When placed above a vowel, the vowel becomes nasalized.

Hindi example: &lt;big&gt;महँगा&lt;/big&gt; -- ''mahaṃgā'' (meaning &quot;expensive&quot;).

The '''''visarga''''' is notated with what looks like an English colon. It is transliterated with ''ḥ''. It is only found at the end of words, and only found on Sanskrit loan words. It has the effect of adding a ''h'' as well as a lighter version of the preceding vowel. For example, &lt;big&gt;नमः&lt;/big&gt; is pronounced ''namaha'', with the last ''a'' having as little emphasis as possible.

The '''''halant''''' is a small diagonal line which indicates that the default vowel &lt;big&gt;अ&lt;/big&gt; -- ''a'' is not to be pronounced. It only appears at the end of words. In Hindi, however, this symbol is almost never seen, as, unlike Sanskrit, the default vowel is almost never pronounced on the final consonants of words. Example: &lt;big&gt;नाम्&lt;/big&gt; -- ''nām'' (name).

==Conjuncts==

Very often, two or more consonants are combined.

'''This page is part of the [[Hindi]] course.'''

== Word order ==

The word order in Hindi/Urdu is:
* The adjective is before the noun
* The verb is always at the end of the phrase
* Similar to Classical Latin and Greek in structure

Hindi: N1 A1 N2 postp1 N3 postp2 N4 cmkr3 LtV1 LtV2 VectorVerb AuxBe



English: N1 Verb prep3 N4 prep2 N3 prep1 A1 N2

The word order can change to put emphasis on a part of the sentence.

So to say ''My friend's pretty mother cooks food very well'',  ''Mere dost ki khoobsurat ma khana aachese banathi.'' Translated word for word, this is ''My friend of pretty mother food well cooks.&quot;

Simple way to order words in a sentence: Adjective subject object verb adverbs
== Sentence components ==

* case markers and compound post-positions mark the various arguments given to a verb
* many predicates are so-called light verb expressions, consisting of several words followed by a vector verb.  The most common of these vectors is karna, the verb to do.

=== Case markers ===

* ne - marks the subject or topic (but only in the past perfective tense for transitive verbs)
* ka/ke/ki - marks the genitive
* ko - marks the accusative or dative, although occasionally this is the subject
* se - typically means &quot;from&quot; or &quot;by&quot;, also marks the passive agent
* mein, par - locative &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot;

Subjects, objects, and destinations are sometimes not marked at all.

=== Compound post-positions ===

Most English prepositions (which don't otherwise translate with a case marker) will translate
with a ke/ki followed by a noun.  It is useful to think of the ke/ki paired with these particular
nouns as being a compound post-position.

e.g. - &quot;Anyone&quot; + &quot;ke khilaf&quot; means &quot;against&quot; + &quot;Anyone&quot;

Hello 168.212.239.2,

I saw your edits (2-18.25 and 18.27 UTC) on the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet.

I compared them to KPJas's original.

I was not aware that Shakespeare characters broke out into 21st-century teen-speak.

I do know that Elizabethian plays are often bawdy, but not to the extent that a stage direction would show 'below the waist'.

I will delete your edits accordingly.

Thank you,

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear 68.79.170.99,

Here is what people do when they track your IP address (and have exhausted the powers given them by the Wiki form):

They go to a site like DNS-Stuff.com.

They look at the address.

They report abuse to the abuse e-mail.

They are most careful to find out who you are and where you live.

Your ISP will almost certainly take you off it's a serious charge and there is enough evidence. You may be under civil or criminal charges.

Even though what you may do is not illegal, it most certainly is unethical and immoral.

Glad to see the boys (and girls!) who play American Army have a sense of honour regarding these matters.

Thank you

A '''Bulghur Burger''' is a tasty [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] patty for use in sandwiches.

==Ingredients==

*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]] 
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
*1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulghur]] 
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] 
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]], chopped 
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], grated 
*1/4 cup fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], chopped 
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] 
*dash ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

==Preparation==
#Bring the water to a boil.  
#While it is heating, use a heavy pan or [[Cookbook:Frying pan|skillet]] to [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the garlic and bulghur in the oil on medium-high heat for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  
#Add  the boiling water.  Return to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low.  
#Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the water is absorbed and the bulghur is soft but still chewy.  
#Preheat the oven to 375 °F (190 °C) if you plan to bake the burgers.  
#When the bulghur is ready, stir in the scallions, carrots, parsley, tahini, tomato paste, soy sauce, mustard, and pepper.  With moistened hands, form the bulghur mixture into 6 to 8 burgers.  
#Cook them in a lightly oiled heavy skillet on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, flipping the burgers once when the outside is crunchy, or bake on an oiled baking sheet for 20 minutes.

==Tips, tricks and variations==
*For a different flavour and more protein, add 1 cup of mashed cooked [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]] to the cooked bulghur along with the other ingredients, before forming the burgers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't get the Info-Ecosystem, how does it connects to the book?
I think it is very unrelated.

please tell me what you think, especialy the one who added it.

:It seems to me there are some good ideas in the section but much is undefined. I've read quite a lot of college mathematics and much of it doesn't make sense to me (even as a metaphor). The author is welcomed to give some concrete practical examples. Maybe we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg? You must know the whole iceberg in order to make sense of the tip, and most readers don't. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 10:01, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:For instance: Be mindful that multiplication with zero is zero. Fine. This might be interpreted as &quot;the effort of copying information to k new pieces of the same information is zero&quot;, which in turn might be interpreted as &quot;it's free to give away a digital picture to everyone who wants it&quot;. But what has that to do with increasing the intelligence? Are you refering to the intelligence on a larger scale, the intelligence of humanity? Maybe that should be more clearly stated. Maybe it should be placed in another section like Systems engineering or something like that. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 10:20, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:And what is meant by exponentiating information? Of course exp(0) = 1 if 0 is a number, matrix or something else we have a theory for, but what is the definition of exp(x) where x is information? Information is not a clearly defined word. If we had a preciese mathematical definition of the word, we could make a digital filter filtering out information from a random source. That would clearly be amazing. Observe that Shannon's definition of information is not what we usually mean by information. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 10:20, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)</text>

==Problems==
*1. A man fires a rock out of a slingshot directly upward. The rock has an initial velocity of 15 m/s. How long will it take for the rock to return to the level he fired it at?

*5 It takes a man 10 s to ride down an escalator. It takes the same man 15 seconds to walk back up the escalator against its motion.  How long will it take the man to walk down the esculator at the same rate he was walking before?

Prerequisite: Calculus
*24. Starting with the definitions of velocity and acceleration derive the kinematics equation for constant acceleration x = x0 + v0t + (1/2) at^2.

*25. A cockroach starts 1 cm away from a wall. It starts running in a line directly away from the wall with a velocity of 1 cm/s, acceleration of 1 cm/s^2, jerk (d^3 x/dt^3) of 1 cm/s^3, d^4 x/dt^4 of 1 cm/s^4, and so on.  How far is the cocroach from the wall after 1 s?

==Solutions==
1. 3 s.  Use the kinematics equation y = y0 + v0t + 1/2 at^2.  Let the rocks initial height y be 0.  Plugging the values into the equation yields 0 = 15t - (1/2) 10t^2.  Factoring and solving for t yields solutions of 0 s and 3 s. Hence it takes the rock 3 s to return to its original height.  

24. The quickest solution is to write the taylor series for x, this yeilds the solution immediately. Another route to the solution is to solve the differential equation by seperating the variables.  

25. e cm. The taylor series for positions is x = x0 + v0 t + (1/2!) a0 t^2 + (1/3!) j0 t^3 + ... . Since x0, v0, a0, ... are all equal to one and t, t^2, t^3, ... are all equal to one, you have the following series: x = 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 + ... . This is a series that sums to e, thus the cockroach travels e cm after one second.

__NOTOC__
==Introduction==

In principle, we could use the methods described so far to predict the behavior of matter by simply keeping track of each atom.

In practice, this is not a useful approach. Instead, we treat matter as a continuum.

In this section we will see how this is done, and how it leads us back to waves.

For an example, we will consider a set of ''N''+1 identical springs and masses, arranged as in the previous section, with spring 0 attached to the wall, and mass ''N'' free.

We are interested in what happens for large ''N'', the ''continuum'' limit.

The system has three other parameters; the spring constant ''k'', the particle mass ''&amp;Delta;m'', and the spring rest spacing ''&amp;Delta;a'', where variable names have been chosen for future convenience. These can be combined with ''N'' to give a similar set of parameters for the system.

Suppose all the masses are displaced by ''d'' from rest, with total displacement ''D''=''dN'' of the system end, then the total potential energy is ''kNd''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 = ''kD''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2''N''), so 

* The system's spring constant is ''K''=''k/N''
* The system mass is ''m''=''&amp;Delta;mN''
* The system rest length is ''a''=''&amp;Delta;aN''

If, as we increase ''N'' we change the other three parameters to keep ''K'', ''m'', and ''a'' constant then in the large ''N'' limit this ''discrete'' system will look like a spring with mass ''continuously'' distributed along its length.

For coordinates, we will use the displacements of each mass, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For large ''N'' the displacement will vary approximately continuously with distance. We can regard it as a continuous function, ''x'', with

:&lt;math&gt;x(n\Delta a)=x_n \,&lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic energy of the system is then simply

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \sum_0^N \dot{x}_n^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The total potential energy is similarly

:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{1}{2}k x_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}k \sum_1^N (x_n-x_{n-1})^2 &lt;/math&gt;

From this we may deduce the equations of motion in two different ways.

==Equations of motion: First approach==

If we take the large ''N'' limit first, these sums become integrals.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
T &amp; = &amp; \frac{m}{2a}\sum_0^N \dot{x}_n^2 \Delta a \\
\lim_{N \rarr \infty} T &amp; = &amp; \frac{m}{2a} \int_0^a \dot{x}^2 ds
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the distance from the wall, and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
V &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}k x_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}k \sum_0^{N-1} (x_n-x_{n+1})^2 \\
  &amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}k x_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}K \sum 
\left( \frac{ x(n\Delta a+\Delta a)- x(n\Delta a)}{\Delta a} \right)^2 a \Delta a\\
\lim_{N \rarr \infty} V &amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}k x(0)^2 
+ \frac{1}{2}Ka \int \left( \frac{dx}{ds} \right)^2 ds
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the springs always remain attached to the wall, ''x''(0)=0.

The integrand for ''T'' is the product of the density and the square of the velocity, just as we might naively expect. Simalarly, ''V'' is the integral of the potential energy of a infinitesimal spring over the length of the system.

Using the Lagrangian will let us get equations of motion from these integrals.

It is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
L &amp; = &amp; \frac{m}{2a} \int_0^a \dot{x}^2 ds - \frac{1}{2}Ka\int_0^a \left( \frac{dx}{ds} \right)^2 ds \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{m}{2a} \int_0^a  (\dot{x}^2 - \frac{Ka^2}{m} x^{\prime 2}) ds\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The action of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;\int L dt = \int \int \mathcal{L}(\dot{x},x^\prime) dx dt \quad 
\mbox{ where } \mathcal{L}=\frac{m}{2a}(\dot{x}^2 - \frac{Ka^2}{m} x^{\prime 2}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we are integrating over both space and time, rather than just space, but this is still very similar in form to the action for a single particle.

We can expect that the principle of least action will lead us to the natural extension of Lagrange's equations to this action,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x^\prime}+
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}} = 
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be proven, using the calculus of variations. Using it for this particular Lagrangian gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial t^2} - \frac{Ka^2}{m}\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial s^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is a ''partial differential equation''. We will not be discussing its solution in detail, but we will see that it describes waves.

First, though, we will confirm that these equations are the same as we get if we find the equations of motion first, then take the large ''N'' limit.

==Equations of motion: Second approach==

First, we will look at the potential energy to see how it depends on the displacements.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
V &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}k x_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}k \sum_0^{N-1} (x_n-x_{n+1})^2 \\
  &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}k \left( x_0^2 \cdots (x_{n-1}-x_n)^2 + (x_n-x_{n+1})^2
\cdots  (x_N-x_{N-1})^2 \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}k \left(
2x_0^2 -2x_0 x_1 \cdots -2x_n x_{n+1} + 2x^2_n -2x_n x_{n+1} \cdots
x^2_N - 2x_N x_{N-1} \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}k \left( 2x_0^2 -2x_0 x_1 \cdots 2x_n (x_n-x_{n+1}-x_{n-1}) 
\cdots x^2_N - 2x_N x_{N-1} \right) \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we need to treat the displacements of the first and last masses differently from the other coordinates, because the dependence of the Langragian on them is different.

The kinetic energy is symmetric in the coordinates,

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \Delta m \sum_0^N \dot{x}_n^2&lt;/math&gt;

Using Lagrange's equations, we get that, for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta m \ddot{x}_0 + 2k x_0 = k x_1,&lt;/math&gt;

for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta m \ddot{x}_N + k x_N = k x_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt;

and, for all the other ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta m \ddot{x}_n + 2k x_n = k (x_{n+1}+x_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

We can replace ''k'' and &amp;Delta;''m'' by the limiting values K and m using

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{\Delta m} = \frac{K a^2}{m \Delta a^2} &lt;/math&gt;

giving us

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\ddot{x}_0 &amp; = &amp; \frac{K a^2}{m}  \frac{x_1-2x_0}{\Delta a^2}\\
\ddot{x}_n &amp; = &amp; \frac{K a^2}{m} \frac{x_{n-1}+x_{n+1}-2x_n}{\Delta a^2}\\
\ddot{x}_N &amp; = &amp; \frac{K a^2}{m} \frac{x_{N-1}-x_N}{\Delta a^2}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Looking at the general structure of the right hand side, we see difference between the displacement at nearby points divided by the distance between those points, so we expect that in the limit we will get differentials with respect to ''s'', the distance from the wall.

As ''N'' tends to infinity both ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; tend to ''x''(0), which is always zero, so the equation of motion for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is always true.

In the continuum limit, the equation for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{x}(a) = -\frac{K a^2}{m} \frac{1}{\Delta a} \frac{dx}{ds} &lt;/math&gt;

Since &amp;Delta;''a'' tends to zero, for this to be true we must have &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;'=0 at ''a''.

For the other displacements,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\lim_{\Delta a \rarr 0} \frac{x_{n-1}+x_{n+1}-2x_n}{\Delta a^2} &amp; = &amp; 
\lim_{\Delta a \rarr 0} &amp; \frac{1}{\Delta a} 
\left( \frac{x_{n+1}-x_n}{\Delta a} - \frac{x_n-x_{n-1}}{\Delta a} \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; \lim_{\Delta a \rarr 0} &amp;
\frac{x^\prime((n+1)\Delta a)-x^\prime(n\Delta a)}{\Delta a} \\
&amp; = &amp; \left. \frac{d^2 x}{ds^2} \right|_{x=a} &amp; \\ \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so we get the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial t^2} - \frac{Ka^2}{m}\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial s^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

just as with the other approach.

==Waves==

It is intuitively obvious that if we flick one of the masses in this system, vibrations will propagate down the springs, like waves, so we look for solutions of that form.

A generic travelling wave is

:&lt;math&gt;x = A \sin (\omega t - \kappa x + \alpha) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this informed guess into the equation gives

:&lt;math&gt; -A \omega^2 \sin (\omega t - \kappa x + \alpha) = 
-\frac{Ka^2}{m} \kappa^2 \sin (\omega t - \kappa x + \alpha) &lt;/math&gt;

so this wave is a solution provide the frequency and wavenumber are related by

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^2 =  \frac{Ka^2}{m} \kappa^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The speed of these waves, ''c'', is

:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{d\omega}{d\kappa} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{Ka^2}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we've gone from Newton's laws to waves.

We can do the same starting with a three-dimensional array of particles, and deduce the equations for longitudinal and transverse waves in a solid. Everything we said about waves earlier will be true for these systems.

This particular system has two boundary conditions: the displacement is zero at the wall, and a local extrema at the free end. This is typical of all such problems.

When we take account of the boundary conditions we find that the correct solutions is a combination of standing waves, of the form

:&lt;math&gt;x = A_m \sin \left( \frac{2b+1}{2}\frac{\pi s}{a} \right) 
\sin \left( \sqrt{\frac{Ka^2}{m}}\frac{2b+1}{2}\frac{\pi}{a}t +\alpha_m \right) &lt;/math&gt; 

where ''b'' is any integer.

If we also knew the initial displacement we could use Fourier series to obtain the exact solution for all time.

In practice, ''N'' is typically large but finite, so the continuum limit is only approximately true. Allowing for this would give us a power series in 1/''N'', describing small corrections to the approximation. These corrections can produce interesting effects, including solutions, but we will not calculate them here.

The continuum limit also fails for small wavelengths, comparable with the particle spacing.

==Fields==

In the continuum limit, the spring is described by a variable which is a function of both position and time. Variable such as this are commonly referred to as ''fields.''

At first sight, classical fields look quite different to classical particles. In one case position is the dependent variable; in the other, it is an independent variable. However, as the above calculations suggest, fields and particles have an underlying unity, if we take a Lagrangian approach.

We can deal with both using essentially the same mathematical techniques, extracting information about both the field and the particles in that field from the same source.

E.g., once we know the Lagrangian for electromagnetism, we can deduce both the partial differential equations for the EM fields, and the forces on charged particles in those fields, from it. We will see precisely how later, when we come to study electromagnetism.

In the example above, the field Lagrangian was the continuum limit of a Lagrangian for the discrete system. It did not have to be. We can investigate the fields described by any Lagrangian we like, whether or not there is an underlying mechanical system.

So far, we've looked at waves and movement under Newton's law, and seen how the study of movement can lead us back to waves. Next, we will look at special relativity, and see how Einstein's insights affect all this.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Evelien. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Evelien~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kinematics in one dimension''' involves motion where the position can be represented by a single number. Motion in other directions (if any) are ignored. For solving kinematics problems without calculus, use of following equations is necessary (these can be derived using calculus):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
v_f &amp;= a t + v_i \\
x_f &amp;= (1/2) a t^2 + v_i t + x_i \\
v_f^2 &amp;= v_i^2 + 2 a s
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

== Without Calculus ==
# A man fires a rock out of a slingshot directly upward. The rock has an initial velocity of 15 m/s. How long will it take for the rock to return to the level he fired it at?
# It takes a man 10 seconds to ride down an escalator. It takes the same man 15 s to walk back up the escalator against its motion.  How long will it take the man to walk down the escalator at the same rate he was walking before?
# A man riding a bicycle at a speed of 25 km/h passes a parked car. When the bicycle is 100 m ahead of the car, the car starts. The car instantly accelerates to a speed of 50 km/h, and subsequently maintains that speed. Find out when and where the car passes the bicycle, using both a graphical method and an arithmetical method. 
# Cinderella leaves the ball at quarter to twelve in a coach travelling at a speed of 12 mph. Five minutes later the prince also leaves the ball following her. Calculate the speed at which the prince reaches her just as the clock strikes twelve. 
# Two sporty snails are having a race. Because one of them is a famous sprinter, the other is given a head start of 1.0 meters. 15 minutes after the start of the race the sprinter catches up with the slower one. The sprinter was creeping at a speed of 60 cm/min. Calculate the speed of the slower snail.
# Miss Anna Litical wants to meet a friend living 150 miles away. She starts at 8:30 with an average speed of 50 mph. Her friend starts 30 minutes later travelling at a speed of 35 mph. When and where do they meet?

== With Calculus ==

# Starting with the definitions of velocity and acceleration, derive the kinematics equation for constant acceleration ''x'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' + (1/2) ''a t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
# A cockroach starts 1 cm away from a wall. It starts running in a line directly away from the wall with a velocity of 1 cm/s, acceleration of 1 cm/s^2, jerk (''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''x''/''dt''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of 1 cm/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''x''/''dt''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of 1 cm/s^4, and so on.  How far is the cockroach from the wall after 1 s?

==The Quantum Numbers==

These four numbers are used to describe the location of an electron in an atom.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1px&quot;
|-
! Number
! Symbol
! Possible Values
|-
| Principal Quantum Number
! &lt;math&gt;n \,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Angular Momentum Quantum Number
! &lt;math&gt;\ell \,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots , (n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Magnetic Quantum Number
! &lt;math&gt;m_\text{l} \,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -\ell, \ldots, -1, 0, 1, \ldots ,\ell \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Spin Quantum Number
! &lt;math&gt;m_\text{s} \,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle +1/2, -1/2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Principal Quantum Number (''n'') ===
Determines the '''shell''' the electron is in.  The shell is the main component that determines the energy of the electron (higher ''n'' corresponds to higher energy), as well as nuclear distance (higher ''n'' means further from the nucleus).  The row that an element is placed on the periodic table tells how many shells there will be.  Helium (''n'' = 1), neon (''n'' = 2), argon (''n'' = 3), etc.

=== Angular Momentum Quantum Number (''l'') ===
Also known as azimuthal quantum number. Determines the '''subshell''' the electron is in.  Each subshell has a unique shape and a letter name. The ''s orbital'' is shaped like a sphere and occurs when ''l'' = 0.  The ''p orbitals'' (there are three) are shaped like teardrops and occur when ''l'' = 1.  The ''d orbitals'' (there are five) occur when ''l'' = 2.  The ''f orbitals'' (there are seven) occur when ''l'' = 3.  (By the way, when ''l'' = 4, the orbitals are &quot;g orbitals&quot;, but they (and the ''l'' = 5 &quot;h orbitals&quot;) can safely be ignored in general chemistry.)

This number also gives information as to what the '''angular node''' of an orbital is. A [[w:Node_(physics)|node]] is defined as a point on a [[w:Standing_wave|standing wave]] where the wave has minimal [[w:Amplitude|amplitude]]. When applied to chemistry this is the point of zero-displacement and thus where no electrons are found. In turn angular node means the planar or conical surface in which no electrons are found or where there is no electron density.

Here are pictures of the orbitals.  Keep in mind that they do not show the actual path of the electrons, due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  Instead, they show the area where the electron is most likely to occur (say, 90% of the probability).  The two colors represent the two different spin numbers (the choice is arbitrary).

|F orbitals →

|[[Image:F4M1.png|50px]]
|[[Image:F4M2.png|50px]]

|[[Image:F4M-1.png|50px]]
|[[Image:F4M-3.png|50px]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Magnetic Quantum Number (''m''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
Determines the '''orbital''' in which the electron lies. For example, there are three p orbitals in shell ''n'' = 2: the magnetic quantum number determines which one of these orbitals the electrons reside in. The different orbitals are oriented at different angles around the nucleus.  See how each p orbital has the same general shape, but they point in different directions around the nucleus.

=== Spin Quantum Number (''m''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
Determines the '''spin''' on the electron. +&amp;#189; corresponds to the up arrow in an electron configuration box. If there is only one electron in an orbital (one arrow in one box), then it is always considered +&amp;#189;. The second arrow, or down arrow, is considered -&amp;#189;.

=== Some Examples ===
Let's examine the quantum numbers of electrons from a magnesium atom, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;Mg.  Remember that each list of numbers corresponds to (''n'', ''l'', ''m''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;).
{|-
|Two s electrons:
|(1, 0, 0, +&amp;#189;)
|(1, 0, 0, -&amp;#189;)
|-
|Two s electrons:
|(2, 0, 0, +&amp;#189;)
|(2, 0, 0, -&amp;#189;)
|-
|Six p electrons:
|(2, 1, -1, +&amp;#189;)
|(2, 1, -1, -&amp;#189;)
|(2, 1, 0, +&amp;#189;)
|(2, 1, 0, -&amp;#189;)
|(2, 1, 1, +&amp;#189;)
|(2, 1, 1, -&amp;#189;)
|-
|Two s electrons:
|(3, 0, 0, +&amp;#189;)
|(3, 0, 0, -&amp;#189;)
|}

=== The Periodic Table ===

Notice a pattern on the [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table]].  Different areas, or blocks, have different types of electrons.  The two columns on the left make the s-block.  The six columns on the right make the p-block.  The large area in the middle (transition metals) makes the d-block.  The bottom portion makes the f-block (Lanthanides and Actinides).  Each row introduces a new shell (aka energy level).  Basically, the row tells you how many shells of electrons there will be, and the column tells you which subshells will occur (and which shells they occur in).  The value of m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined by some of the rules we will learn in the next chapter.  The value of m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; doesn't really matter as long as there are no repeating values in the same orbital.

{{Info|To see the pattern better, take a look at [[w:Periodic table (by blocks)|this periodic table]].}}

I've deleted the conversation under 'Ordering at a Restaurant&quot; because it focuses on certain topics (wine, for example), gives an example before introducing the topic, and looks too much like [[German: Level II]]. I hope you don't mind.

I've also deleted the 'nationalities' section: Unless it relates to restaurants, it belongs in [[German:Beginner Lesson 5|Lesson 5]]. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 22:40, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Guido, could you construct a list of different types of food in Germany under &quot;Ordering at a Restaurant in Germany&quot;? It would be a big help. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 22:46, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Hey SamE, That's ok with me. I'm sorry, but what do you mean, a &quot;different types of food&quot;? Like Meat, Salads, Fish and so on?
:Regards
:--- [[User:Guido|Guido]] 06:44, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::I mean different types of restaurants, such as seafood or steak or hamburgers, and whatever else is common and/or popular in Germany. If McDonald's is popular, then that would go in the list, too.

::As for the nationalities, we would need a direct way to say &quot;We eat at the Japanese restaurant.&quot; and &quot;He likes Mexican food.&quot; If we would need to teach the nationalities to do this, we could reinstate that section (but not as a major section, as a subsection or subsubsection). But I think that belongs in lesson 5. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:12, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

''Just like in last lesson, where you could say, &quot;Ich spiele Fußball gern.&quot;, you can also extend it to food. &quot;I like to eat cheeseburgers.&quot; is translated as &quot;Ich esse Cheeseburger gern.&quot;''

Nobody in German says ''&quot;Ich (verb) (noun) gern&quot;''. It must be ''&quot;Ich (verb) gerne (noun)&quot;''! Example: Ich esse gerne Cheeseburger

:Wow, that's not at all what I've been taught. Could you clarify this with one of the native German speakers on this site (with a username). I'm sorry, but I don't want to make that change only based on what an anon says. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:39, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::He / she is right. It is not wrong, but uncommon. You could answer ''Ich spiele Fußball gerne'', e.g. if someone asks '''''Wie gerne''' spielst du Fußball'' (How much do you like playing soccer?; you can use ''gern'' as well as ''gerne'') - but that are niceties. --[[User:Thomas G. Graf|Thomas G. Graf]] [I see, Sma already said it: depends on the situation] 19:20, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Well you cannot tell it definetly, because you can say &quot;Ich mag (das Fach) Deutsch gern(e).
But you also can say &quot;Ich mag gerne Kartoffeln.&quot; so both structures can be used, but it depends on the situation where it is used. [[User:Sma|Sma]] 14:26, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I'd like to leave ''würden'' out of this lesson, as it is a very advanced verb form (imperfect subjunctive) that really shouldn't be introduced until year 3. I hope you don't mind. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 23:19, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: no problem, I have already guessed why you put it out again, but actually it is the most polite form to ask for the bill, but you´re with the fact, it should be talked about later on [[User:Sma|Sma]] 16:02, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Looks pretty cool, what you're doing here. But I spotted a mistake.
Actually &quot;dankeschön&quot; doesn't mean &quot;thanks, pretty&quot;. The &quot;schön&quot; is probably more of an adverb than an adjective. I think &quot;dankeschön&quot; is shortened für &quot;Ich danke schön&quot; which literally translates to &quot;I thank prettily&quot;. It is definitely no compliment.
--- Conny from Germany

---

I spotted a mistake too.
At the section 'Main Dishes'
You can't say &quot;das Hot Dog&quot;
Correct: &quot;der Hot Dog&quot;
-- Stephan from Germany

: I would say &quot;das HotDog&quot;. - iBlue from Germany.

And BTW the dialogs are not understandable for me. - iBlue


==Sorry, this Dialogue is *complete* BS==

Frans: Hallo, Greta! Wie geht's?
* Frans is no German name, it's Franz. BTW Greta and Franz are quite senior names now... don't expect to meet anyone under 50 with these names...
Greta: Sehr gut. Ich habe Hunger.
* &quot;I'm fine. I'm hungry.&quot; ...sense?!
Frans: Ich auch. Möchtest du etwas essen?
Greta: Ja!
In der Gaststätte
Greta: Ich möchte Salat, Brot, und Wasser.
* no articles, no sense
Frans: Hast du jetzt keinen Hunger?
* of course she's hungry, otherwise she wouldn't order would she?
Greta: Nein, ich habe viel Hunger. Was bekommst du?
* Nein has to be &quot;Doch&quot;
Frans: Ich bekomme Apfelstudel, ein Stück Kuchen, und einen Eisbecher.
* Apfelst_r_udel actually _is_ a cake (Kuchen). And who takes a cup of ice cream _with_ two pieces of cake? 
Greta: Das ist schrecklich. Du sollst eine Bratwurst haben.
* &quot;That is awful. You shall posess a sausage.&quot;... wtf?! and why?!
Frans: Nein, ich bin zufrieden. Ich habe nicht so viel Hunger.
* &quot;No, I'm fine. I'm not so hungry&quot; - well - I guess a sausage shouldn't be that much more than two pieces of cake with a cup of ice cream?!

please, PLEASE let these dialogues be at least a) a bit senseful b) (reality-)checked by native speaking Germans. Really. Don't want to offend anyone who has invested his time and effort, but you cannot expect to learn German with this...

[[User:Endymi0n|Endymi0n]] 05:05, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

: Alright, I feel that I have to reply to this. First of all, you can't expect a first year german student to be able understand an actual german conversation by lesson three. What the writers were trying to do is create a somewhat realistic situation based on the vocabulary they already know, which is quite limited. A few corrections I feel that you should be aware of: first off, articles aren't always required. Think about how you would sound if you used an article for every single noun you used in english. Secondly, the phrase &quot;Du sollst eine Bratwurst haben&quot; means, in english, &quot;You should have a bratwurst&quot;, not &quot;You shall possess a sausage.&quot; Most of these sentences do, in fact, make sense. So perhaps you should stop ranting about corrections that should be made to tailor to your personal preference. Just because you don't have ice cream with your cake doesn't mean that an imaginary person can't say that for the purposes of an educational conversation. [[User:MasterSheep|MasterSheep]] 01:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

::The dialogue seems really odd to me.
::''Franz 	Hallo, Greta! Wie geht's?''
::: Endymi0n already said something about the choice of names. 
::''Greta 	Sehr gut. Ich bin hungrig.''
::: This is a contradiction. There should be something in between to resolve it, e.g. “Sehr gut, aber im Moment habe ich Hunger.”
::''Franz 	Ich auch. Möchtest du etwas essen?''
::''Greta 	Ja!''
::''	In der Gaststätte''
::''Greta 	Ich möchte Salat, Brot und Wasser.''
::: This is not a typical German dish that can be ordered from the menu. And why would anyone go to a restaurant for it? I would buy these things in a supermarket.
::''Franz 	Hast du jetzt keinen Hunger?''

Hey guys, I don't want to read the whole book to find some misstakes, but if anyone has a question about grammar or the German language, just mail at hahaha@mailueberfall.de . I'm a German (I'm a Native speaker, live in Germany, and have the identity card of the Federal Republic of Germany), so I think I would be able to answer all questions.
There's one thing you should add to the lessons: There are not many information about the German culture, the people, the history, our food...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Semantic Analysis ==
This is roughly the equivalent of checking that some ordinary text written in a natural language (e.g. English) actually means something (whether or not that is what it was intended to mean).

The purpose of semantic analysis is to check that we have a meaningful sequence of tokens. Note that a sequence can be meaningful without being correct; in most programming languages, the phrase &quot;x + 1&quot; would be considered to be a meaningful arithmetic expression. However, if the programmer really meant to write &quot;x - 1&quot;, then it is not correct.

=== Name Table ===
{{TODO|Complete}}
Time to read Aho&amp;Ullman/Dragon book carefully.

Semantic analysis is the activity of a compiler to determine what the types of various values are, how those types interact in expressions, and whether those interactions are semantically reasonable. For instance, you can't reasonably multiply a string by class name, although no editor will stop you from writing

 &quot;abc&quot; * MyClass
To do this, the compiler must first identify declarations and scopes, and typically records the result of this step in a set of symbol tables. This tells it what specific identifiers means in specific contexts. It must also determine the types of various literal constants; &quot;abc&quot; is a different type than 12.2e-5.

Then it must visit all locations where identifiers and literals are used, and verify that the use of the identifier/literal, and the results computed, are compatible with the language definition (as in the above example).

As to how this is done: typically the source code is parsed, some representation of the program is constructed (syntax trees are very popular), and that representation is walked (&quot;visited&quot;) element by element to collect/validate the semantic information. The symbol table is usually just a set of hash tables associated with the syntax tree representing a scope, hashing from identifiers to structures containing type declarations.

=== Type Checking ===
In a statically typed language, immediately following the parsing phase is the type checking phase. This attempts to catch programming errors based on the theory of types. In practice this is checking things like a variable declared as a string is not used in an expression requiring an integer.

In a dynamically typed language no type checking is performed (it is actually deferred until runtime).

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called JuanjoConti. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name JuanjoConti~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

all of the pages in the evolutionary biology text (so far) are actually being composed as part of a writing assignment for a summerschool class. rather than having my students write term papers that end up in my filing cabinet, i thought i'd have them submit their work here. i am delighted to see that the community is already supplying feedback.</text>

==Ingredients==
*2-2½ cups shrimp stock (shrimp peels and parts,dried shrimp flakes, mirapoix, peppercorns)
*3-4 strips thick smoky [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
*1 lb large [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], peeled (use peels to make stock)
*1 pint (divided) heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*1 recipe coarse grain [[Cookbook:Hominy Grits|hominy grits]], time to complete when Shrimp are ready to serve
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], minced
*2-3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
*3-4 [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]], sliced, to garnish
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne]], [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]], to taste

==Procedure==
#Slice the bacon into 1 inch pieces bacon &amp; fry until not too crisp; remove &amp; reserve
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] onion &amp; garlic in bacon fat until just softened (about 2-3 minutes)
#Add chilies
#Lightly season shrimp &amp; add; sauté until ~half cooked – just turning pink, then remove &amp; reserve w/ bacon
#Deglaze with sherry
#Add 1 cup (250 ml) cream &amp; bring to boil, reduce
#Add 1 cup shrimp stock, bring to a high simmer and reduce

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vibrato:  In a video interview BB King said that he does not use string Bending, but his style does include very heavy use of Vibrato to sustain notes (and please listeners). Demonstrating his Vibrato, his thumb was around the neck and his pinkie free (little finger unused) and sticking in the air when fretting with another finger, and he &quot;wiggles&quot; his hand such that you notice his pinkie wave. This wiggle transfers to the string without it seeming to move, and it is not bending or altering the pitch noticably (so this is different than the described repeated bend-release bend-release method; or this is a much less pronounced effect!). I believe his movement is &quot;all in the wrist&quot;, and not especially elbow movement, but perhaps his arm is also slightly in motion (from the wrist area, up into his hand, then exaggerated at the extreme = pinkie wave).</text>

As of 2014, installing apps is probably the most common way people use digital signatures. Both Android and iOS require an app to be digitally signed before it can be installed.&lt;ref&gt;
Android Developers.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptography is generally used to provide some form of assurance about a message. This assurance can be one or more of four general forms. These forms are message &lt;i&gt;confidentiality&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;integrity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;authentication&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;non-repudiation&lt;/i&gt;. Up until the advent of [[PKI|public key encryption]], cryptography was generally only used to provide confidentiality, that is, communications were encrypted to keep their contents secret. This encryption generally implies the sender to know the scheme and key in use, and therefore provides some rudimentary authentication. Modern digital signatures are much better at providing the assurance of authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation than historical symmetric-key encryption schemes.

Digital signatures rely on the ability of a public-key signing algorithm to sign a message -- to generate a signature from the message with a private key. Later, anyone with that signature can verify the message using the corresponding public key. (This uses the keys in the opposite order as public-key encryption and public-key decryption to provide confidentiality -- encryption with a public key and decryption only with the private key). However, to provide digital signing, a signer must use his private key to sign the message--or some representation of the message--that he wants to sign with his private key, so that anyone who knows his public key can use it to verify that only his private key could have signed that message.

There are a number of relevant details to proper implementation. 

First, the signature itself is useless if the recipients do not have a verified copy of the signer's public key. While perhaps the best method for exchanging that key would be to meet face-to-face, this is often not possible. As a result, many [[PKI|public key infrastructures]] require the creation of a [[Certificate Authority]] whose public key is pre-shared via some trusted method. An example of this would be SSL CA's like VeriSign, whose certificates are pre-installed in most popular browsers by the computer manufacturer. The CA is what's known as a &lt;i&gt;Trusted Third Party&lt;/i&gt;, an individual or organization who is trusted by all parties involved in the encrypted communications. It is the duty of this organization to keep its private key safe and secret, and to use that key to sign public keys of individuals it has verified. In other words, in order to save the trouble of meeting face-to-face to exchange keys with every individual you wish to communicate with, you might engage the services of a trusted third party whose public key you already have to go meet these individuals face-to-face. The third party can then sign the public keys and send them along to you, so that you end up with a verified copy without the trouble of exchanging each key pair face-to-face. The details of signing itself we will get to in a moment. 

An alternative method commonly used for secure e-mail transmission via [[PGP]] or [[GPG]] is known as a &lt;i&gt;web of trust&lt;/i&gt;. A web of trust is similar to the creation of a certificate authority, with the primary difference being that it is less formal. Rather than creating an organization to act as a trusted third party, individuals will instead sign keys of other individuals they have met in person. In this manner, if Alice has Bob's key, and Bob signs Charlie's key, Alice can trust Charlie's key. Obviously, this can be extended over a very complex web, but this ability is also a great weakness; one compromised individual in the web--the weakest link in the chain of trust--can render the rest useless.

The actual implementation of signing can also vary. One can sign a message simply by encrypting it with his private key--it can be decrypted by his public key, and the act of valid encryption can only be performed by that secret key, thus proving his identity. However, often one may want to sign but not encrypt messages. To provide this functionality at a base level, one might send two copies of the message, one of which would be encrypted. If a reader wishes to verify that the unencrypted message he has read is valid, he can decrypt the duplicate and compare the two. However, even this method is cumbersome; it doubles the size of every message. To avoid this drawback, most implementations use [[Hash Functions]] to generate a hash of the message, and use the private key to encrypt that hash. This provides nearly the same security as encrypting a duplicate, but saves space.

Many early explanations of public-key signature algorithms describe public-key signing algorithms as &quot;encrypt a message with a private key&quot;. Then they describe public-key message verify algorithms as &quot;decrypt with the public key&quot;.
Many people prefer to describe modern public-key cryptosystems as having 4 independent high-level functions -- encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify -- since none of them (if properly padded to avoid chosen-ciphertext attacks) can be substituted for any of the others.&lt;ref&gt;

'''[[w:C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]''' (pronounced &quot;See Sharp&quot;) is a multi-purpose computer [[w:programming language|programming language]] suitable for a wide variety of development needs. This Wikibook introduces C# language fundamentals and covers a variety of the base class libraries (BCL) provided by the Microsoft .NET Framework.

==Introduction==
:''Main introduction: [[C Sharp Programming/Foreword]]
{{Wikipedia|C Sharp (programming language)}}
{{PDF version}}
{{clear}}
Although C# is derived from the [[w:C programming language|C programming language]], it introduces some unique and powerful features, such as delegates (which can be viewed as type-safe function pointers) and lambda expressions which introduce elements of functional programming languages, as well as a simpler single class inheritance model (than C++) and, for those of you with experience in &quot;C-like&quot; languages, a very familiar syntax that may help beginners become proficient faster than its predecessors. Similar to [[w:Java programming language|Java]], it is [[w:object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], comes with an extensive ''class library'', and supports exception handling, multiple types of [[w:polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], and separation of interfaces from implementations. Those features, combined with its powerful development tools, multi-platform support, and ''generics'', make C# a good choice for many types of software development projects: [[w:Rapid application development|rapid application development]] projects, projects implemented by individuals or large or small teams, Internet applications, and projects with strict reliability requirements. Testing frameworks such as [[w:NUnit|NUnit]] make C# amenable to [[w:test-driven development|test-driven development]] and thus a good language for use with [[w:Extreme Programming|Extreme Programming]] (XP). Its [[w:Strongly-typed programming language|strong typing]] helps to prevent many programming errors that are common in weakly typed languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plain text is encrypted using the Vigenère cipher by first choosing a keyword consisting of letters from the alphabet of symbols used in the plain text. The keyword is then used to encrypt the text by way of the following example.

Using:
Plain text: ilikewikibooks 
and choosing:
Keyword: cta

1. Map all the plain text to numbers 0-25 or however long your alphabet is
   ilikewikibooks converts to 8 11 8 10 4 22 8 10 8 1 14 14 10 18

2. Map your keyword to numbers the same way
   cta maps to 2 19 0

3. add your key to your plain text in the following manner
   8  11  8  10   4  22  8  10  8  1  14  14  10  18
   2  19  0   2  19   0  2  19  0  2  19   0   2  19
   resulting in
   10 30  8  12  23  22 10 29   8  3  33   14  12  37

4. take each resulting number mod 26 ( or for the general case mod the number of characters in your alphabet)
   resulting in
   10 4   8  12  23  22 10 3    8  3  7    14  12   11 

5. map each number back to a letter to get the resulting cypher text
   keimxwkdidhoml

The message can easily be decrypted with the keyword by reversing the above process.
The keyword can be any length equal to or less than that of the plain text.


Without the keyword the primary method of breaking the Vigenère cipher is known as the Kasiski test, after the Prussian major who first published it. The first stage is determining the length of the keyword.


===Determining the key length===
Given an enciphered message such as:
 Plaintext:  TOBEORNOTTOBE
 Keyword:    KEYKEYKEYKEYK
 Ciphertext: DSZOSPXSRDSZO

Upon inspection of the ciphertext, we see that there are a few digraphs repeated, namely DS, SZ, and ZO. It is statistically unlikely that all of these would arise by random chance; the odds are that repeated digraphs in the ciphertext correspond to repetitions in the plaintext. If that is the case, the digraphs must be encoded by the same section of the key both times. Therefore, the length of the key is a factor of the distance in the text between the repetitions.

{| border=1 cellpadding=2
!Digraph
!First Position
!Second Position
!Distance
!Factors
|-
|DS
|1
|10
|9
|3,9
|-
|SZ
|1
|10
|9
|3,9
|-
|ZO
|1
|10
|9
|3,9
|}

The common factors (indeed, the only factors in this simple example) are 3 and 9. This narrows down the possibilities significantly, and the effect is even more pronounced with longer texts and keys.

===Frequency analysis===
Once the length of the key is known, a slightly modified frequency analysis technique can be applied. Suppose the length of the key is known to be three. Then every third letter will be encrypted with the same letter of the key. The ciphertext can be split into three segments - one for each key letter—and the procedure described for the [[../Breaking Caesar cipher|Caesar cipher]] can be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Metaphysics is hard to define.  The term itself can mean &quot;beyond physics&quot; but it's tricky to get more precise without inviting controversy. Early use of the term simply referred to the topics covered by the work placed ''after'' (hence ''meta'') the ''Physics'' in the traditional editing and commentary of Aristotle's works made by the Greek Peripatetic philosopher Andronicus Of Rhodes. 
Let's look at what metaphysics is ''not''.  Newton's theories about gravity, Einstein's theories of relativity, and most of the work on quantum mechanics are clearly not metaphysics.  These theories make specific predictions about observable phenomena.  The theories are subject to being disproven because we can compare their predictions to actual results that we can get in the real world.  For example, if we were to state that &quot;for every atom in this universe, there is a corresponding atom in a parallel universe&quot; then this is not physics because it cannot be disproven:  we cannot presently detect the presence of atoms in parallel universes.  

This brings up an interesting problem for metaphysics.  The theory that all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms was considered metaphysics at one time.  When people began to invent instruments capable of detecting such tiny things, atomic theory moved out of metaphysics into physics.  So metaphysics is always &quot;at the frontier&quot; and some of it may become physics in the future.  

Religion is also not metaphysics.  Religion is based on a set of convictions that may well make predictions about the world or explain why certain phenomena occur, but certain kinds of change are not allowed without disturbing the integrity of the religion.  This is not to say that religions can't change, but their overall integrity has to be preserved to some extent.  For example, some religions (such as Greek Mythology) have explained that mysterious phenomena are caused by many different gods.  Within the context of such a religion, it would be impossible to change this belief to say that all of the phenomena are caused by a single god.  To do this would be essentially to invent a new and contradictory religion.  

This raises another interesting problem for metaphysics.  It may often tread on sacred ground and come into conflict with religion.  Socrates was one casualty of this tendency.  

These considerations give us some boundaries, and we can define metaphysics more readily inside those boundaries.  

Metaphysics is concerned with explaining the way things &quot;are&quot; in the physical world. It is concerned primarily with 'being as being' i.e. with anything in so far as it has act of existence. However, metaphysics is not concerned with examining the physical properties of things that exist, but is, instead, the study of the underlying principles that give rise to the unified natural world. As such, the statement that &quot;Evil does not exist&quot; is metaphysical because it is a statement that deals with the object 'evil' as opposed to 'good' which is a metaphysical subject, whereas the statement that &quot;all things are composed of atoms, which are in turn composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons&quot; is definitely not metaphysics, utmost a concern of physical sciences.  

Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy, and part of the answer to the question &quot;What is Metaphysics&quot; requires us to define the difference between science and philosophy.  'Science' is taken here as empirical sciences or non-empirical sciences. In physical science, it's important for new explanations to make predictions that can be tested by experiments.  But this is not a requirement of philosophy, specifically that of metaphysics.  Instead, we reduce any philosophical statement to its ultimate concept or propositions. The ultimate concept of metaphysics is being while that of propositions is the principle of contradiction.  In the case of the above statement that all things are made up of smaller things and so on to infinity, this explanation is clearly untestable because we'll never have an instrument capable of detecting anything that is infinitely small. But then, metaphysically, one can be sure that it is impossible to have an infinite regression of materiality but must arrive at the ultimate or smallest particle of matter. But then, the philosopher can further ask : What is the ultimate composition of matter?&quot; this time the answer cannot be anymore 'the smallest particle of matter' since the smallest particle of matter is matter also. Thus, Thales' question: 'What is the ultimate stuff?' is a metaphysical question not an empirical one. His question separated physical science from philosophy. Aristotle offered an answer: his hylomorphic doctrine which states that any material reality is ultimately composed of prime matter (not the matter as we know it) and substantial form.  

Metaphysics is not religion because religion involves act of faith, faith guiding reason. In case of metaphysics, it limits its certitude on reason alone. 
So in summary, here is one answer to the question &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot;:  

''Metaphysics is not the branch of philosophy that explains physical phenomena using reason and logic in a way that falls outside the bounds of either religion or science' rather it is a philosophical science which deals with transcendental concepts such as being, one, true and good which in its simplest form is 'being as such'. What really makes Metaphysics hard to define is its object: being. Being cannot be defined properly but only descriptively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since I am sure I'm not the only one who will be editing this page, let's agree on some standards so that everything is cohesive.  Here are my suggestions:

1.  Certainly we should use follow the Einstein summation convention.

2.  Let's agree to use the same signature for the Minkowski metric.  I propose the &lt;math&gt;(- + + +)&lt;/math&gt; signature, i.e., the Minkowski metric &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\eta}&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\eta} (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = -u^0v^0 +u^1v^1 + u^2v^2 + u^3v^3&lt;/math&gt;.

In the last sections we talked about a number of operations involving tensors.  One
of them is to take a covariant vector and contravariant vector
and turn them into scalar. Another is to get a contravariant vector
and put it into a tensor and get out a force.

Since we want to do math with these, let us try to see how we can
represent these.  We take as an example trying to combine a
contravariant vector (v) which represents the direction and speed
we are travelling in and a covariant vector (w) which represents
the rate of ''distance'' at which a temperature is changing.  We want to get the scale
invariant quantity describing the rate of ''time'' at which the temperature is changing
as we move in direction v.

Now we could do it really abstractly.  For example if we want
to combine a contravariant tensor and covariant tensor to get a
scalar we could write...

&lt;math&gt;f = \bold{v} \cdot\bold{ w}&lt;/math&gt;

This is just our old friend the dot product.  This has the advantage
that it is short and simple to write.  However, the problem with this
is that it doesn't let us know what f, v, and w are.  f is a scalar.  v is a 
contravariant tensor.  w is a covariant tensor.  This wasn't a problem
in basic vector calculus, where we just had to deal with scalars and 
vectors.  But it is a problem now that our mathematical zoo has more animals.

The next approach would be to write everything as a component.  So we have

&lt;math&gt;f = v^1 w_1 + v^2 w_2&lt;/math&gt;

The trouble with this is that it is a lot of typing of the same
numbers, over and over again.  Lets write it out in summation notation.

&lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{\mu=1}^2 v^\mu w_\mu&lt;/math&gt;
                                                                                     
Better...  But that summation sign, do we really want to write it over and over and over and over?  What does it give us?  We can be really clever and just write

&lt;math&gt;f = v^\mu w_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

and just know that when we see the same index on top and on the bottom, we mean to take a sum.  This is called &lt;b&gt;Einstein summation notation&lt;/b&gt;.
Whenever one sees the same letter on both superscript (&quot;upper&quot;) indices and subscript (&quot;lower&quot;) indices in a product, one automatically sums over the indices.  Note that in GR, indices usually range from 0 to 3.  (Note:  Greek letters typically range from 0 to 3, while Roman letters range from 1 to 3).

Here are some more examples of the Einstein summation notation being used:


1.  &lt;math&gt;v^\mu \sigma_\mu = \sum_{\mu=0}^3 v^\mu \sigma_\mu = v^0 \sigma_0 + v^1 \sigma_1 + v^2 \sigma_2 + v^3 \sigma_3&lt;/math&gt;

2.  &lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} S_{\alpha \beta} = \sum_{\alpha , \beta =0}^3 T^{\alpha \beta} S_{\alpha \beta} = T^{ 0 0}S_{0 0} + T^{ 1 0}S_{1 0}+ T^{ 2 0}S_{2 0}+ T^{ 3 0}S_{3 0}+ T^{ 0 1}S_{0 1} + T^{ 1 1}S_{1 1} + &lt;/math&gt; etc. (16 terms total)

3.  &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} = R^{\rho}_{\ \mu \rho \nu} = \sum_{\rho=0}^3 R^{\rho} _{\ \mu \rho \nu} =
R^{0} _{\ \mu 0 \nu}+R^{1} _{\ \mu 1 \nu}+R^{2} _{\ \mu 2 \nu}+R^{3} _{\ \mu 3 \nu}&lt;/math&gt;

==Identities==
Several identities arise from indicial notation.
;Contraction:
Since &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i=j&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j\delta^j_k = \delta^i_k\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^i_jx_{ij}=x_{mm}=\mathrm{trace}(x_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;

;Differentiation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial x_j} = \delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x_{ij}}{\partial x_{k\ell}} = \delta^i_k\delta^j_\ell&lt;/math&gt;

== Averages ==
An average is simply a number that is representative of data. More particularly, it is a measure of central tendency. There are several types of average. Averages are useful for comparing data, especially when sets of different size are being compared. It acts as a representative figure of the whole set of data.

Perhaps the simplest and commonly used average the '''arithmetic mean''' or more simply [[Statistics:Summary/Averages/mean#mean|mean]] which is explained in the next section.

Other common types of average are the '''median, the mode, the geometric mean,''' and the '''harmonic mean,''' each of which may be the most appropriate one to use under different circumstances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A PROLOG variable can represent anything; a number, a name, a structure, an array, something as complicated as the known universe. 
A PROLOG program works by constraining the variables until eventually they have particular values; then telling you what the values are.
A simple program might be

  X is 3+2.

and when you run it, the result will be

  X=5
  Yes.

The program might not go as far as to constrain the variables to have exact values, 
so you might get

  equal(A,A).   % Explains that things are equal to themselves
  X is 3+2, equal(f(X,Z),Y).
  X=5
  Y=f(5,_)
  Yes

where the '_' means that you have a variable remaining as part of the solution.

You can also get a 'Yes' result for more than one value of the variables; this is called 'nondeterminism', and is OK.
If no values of the variables will make a solution, PROLOG will say 'No'.

=== Mean, Median and Mode ===

==== Mean ====
The mean, or more precisely the arithmetic mean, is simply the arithmetic average of a group of numbers (or '''data set''') and is shown using -bar symbol &lt;math&gt;\bar {}&lt;/math&gt;. So the mean of the variable ''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'' is &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;,  pronounced &quot;''x''-bar&quot;. It is calculated by adding up all of the values in a data set and dividing by the number of values in that data set
''':&lt;math&gt;\bar x={\sum_{}x\over n}&lt;/math&gt;.'''For example, take the following set of data: {1,2,3,4,5}. The mean of this data would be:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x={\sum_{}x\over n}={1+2+3+4+5 \over 5}={15 \over 5}=3&lt;/math&gt;

Here is a more complicated data set: {10,14,86,2,68,99,1}. The mean would be calculated like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar x={\sum_{}x\over n}={10+14+86+2+68+99+1 \over 7}={280 \over 7}=40&lt;/math&gt;

==== Median ====

The median is the &quot;middle value&quot; in a set. That is, the median is the number in the center of a data set that has been ordered sequentially.

For example, let's look at the data in our second data set from above: {10,14,86,2,68,99,1}. What is its median?

*First, we sort our data set sequentially: {1,2,10,14,68,85,99}
*Next, we determine the total number of points in our data set (in this case, 7.)
*Finally, we determine the central position of or data set (in this case, the 4th position), and the number in the central position is our median - {1,2,10,'''14''',68,85,99}, making 14 our median. 

{{Helpful hint|hint = 
An easy way to determine the central position or positions for any ordered set is to take the total number of points, add 1, and then divide by 2. If the number you get is a whole number, then that is the central position. If the number you get is a fraction, take the two whole numbers on either side.
}}

Because our data set had an odd number of points, determining the central position was easy - it will have the same number of points before it as after it. But what if our data set has an even number of points?

Let's take the same data set, but add a new number to it: {1,2,10,14,68,85,99,''100''} What is the median of this set?

When you have an even number of points, you must determine the ''two'' central positions of the data set. (See side box for instructions.) So for a set of 8 numbers, we get (8 + 1) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4 1/2, which has 4 and 5 on either side.

Looking at our data set, we see that the 4th and 5th numbers are 14 and 68. From there, we return to our trusty friend the mean to determine the median. (14 + 68) / 2 = 82 / 2 = '''41'''.
find the median of 2 , 4 , 6, 8 =&gt; firstly we must count the numbers to determine its odd or even
as we see it is even so we can write : M=(4+6)/2=10/2=5 
5 is the median of above sequentiall numbers.

==== Mode ====
The mode is the most common or &quot;most frequent&quot; value in a data set. Example: the mode of the following data set (1, 2, '''5''', '''5''', 6, 3) is 5 since it '''appears''' '''twice'''. This is the most common value of the data set.
Data sets having one mode are said to be '''unimodal''', with two are said to be '''bimodal''' and with more than two are said to be '''multimodal''' . An example of a unimodal dataset is {1, 2, 3, '''4''', '''4''', '''4''', 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9}. The mode for this data set is 4. An example of a bimodal data set is {1, '''2''', '''2''', '''3''', '''3'''}. This is because both 2 and 3 are modes.
'''Please''' '''note''': If all points in a data set occur with equal frequency, it is equally accurate to describe the data set as having many modes or no mode.

==== Midrange ====
The midrange is the arithmetic mean strictly between the minimum and the maximum value in a data set.

====Relationship of the Mean, Median, and Mode====

The relationship of the mean, median, and mode to each other can provide some information about the relative shape of the data distribution.  If the mean, median, and mode are approximately equal to each other, the distribution can be assumed to be approximately symmetrical.  If the mean &gt; median &gt; mode, the distribution will be skewed to the left or positively skewed.  If the mean &lt; median &lt; mode, the distribution will be skewed to the right or negatively skewed.

===Questions===

1. There is an old joke that states: &quot;Using median size as a reference it's perfectly possible to fit four ping-pong balls and two blue whales in a rowboat.&quot; Explain why this statement is true.

[[Statistics]] | [[Statistics/Summary/Averages/mean|Mean]]

=== Geometric Mean ===

The Geometric Mean is calculated by taking the ''n''th root of the product of a set of data.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}=\sqrt[n\;]{\prod_{i=1}^n x_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For example, if the set of data was:

1,2,3,4,5

The geometric mean would be calculated:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[5]{ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5} = \sqrt[5]{120} = 2.61&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Of course, with large ''n'' this can be difficult to calculate.  Taking advantage of two properties of the logarithm:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\log(a\cdot b) = \log(a) + \log(b)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\log( a^n ) = n \cdot \log( a )
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

We find that by taking the logarithmic transformation of the geometric mean, we get:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\log\left(\sqrt[n]{ x_1 \times x_2 \times x_3 \cdots  x_n}\right) =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\log(x_i) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Which leads us to the equation for the geometric mean:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}= \exp \left(  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\log(x_i) \right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== When to use the geometric mean ===

The arithmetic mean is relevant at any time several quantities add together to produce a total. The arithmetic mean answers the question, &quot;if all the quantities had the same value, what would that value have to be in order to achieve the same total?&quot;


In the same way, the geometric mean is relevant any time several quantities multiply together to produce a product. The geometric mean answers the question, &quot;if all the quantities had the same value, what would that value have to be in order to achieve the same product?&quot;

For example, suppose you have an investment which returns 10% the first year, 50% the second year, and 30% the third year. What is its average rate of return? It is not the arithmetic mean, because what these numbers mean is that on the first year your investment was multiplied (not added to) by 1.10, on the second year it was multiplied by 1.50, and the third year it was multiplied by 1.30. The relevant quantity is the geometric mean of these three numbers. 
Written by Hafiz G m

It is known that the geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean (equality holding only when A=B). The proof of this is quite short and follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt A-\sqrt B)^2&lt;/math&gt;  is always a non-negative number. This inequality can be surprisingly powerful though and comes up from time to time in the proofs of theorems in calculus. [http://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/questionCorner/geomean.html Source].

This book explains different aspects of serial data communication. Serial data communications is the foundation for most forms of data communications used with modern computing devices. The focus of the articles in this book will be around the implementation of RS-232 (aka RS-232C, aka V.24, aka EIA-232D, [[#A Note on Terminology|etc.]]) based serial data communication and will explore a wide range of implementations and uses for serial data transfer.

==Rank and Dimension==
Now that we have talked about tensors, we need to figure out how to classify them.  One important
characteristic is the &lt;b&gt;rank&lt;/b&gt; of a tensor, which is the number of indicies needed to specify the
tensor.  An ordinary [[Wikipedia:Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a rank 2 tensor, a [[vector|vector]] is a rank 1 tensor, and a [[scalar|scalar]] is rank 0.  Tensors can, in general, have rank greater than 2, and often do.

Another characteristic of a tensor is the '''dimension''' of the tensor, which is the count of each index.  
For example, if we have a matrix consisting of 3 rows, with 4 elements in each row (columns), then 
the matrix is a tensor of dimension (3,4), or equivalently, dimension 12.

The important thing about rank and dimension is that they are invariant to changes in the coordinate
system.  You can change the coordinate system all you want, and the rank and the dimensions don't change.
This brings up the important question of how tensors do change when you change the coordinate system.  One thing we shall find when we look at the question is that in reality there are two different types of vectors.

==Contravariant and Covariant Vectors==
Imagine that you are driving a car at 100 kilometers per hour to the east, or along the positive x-axis.  We shall call your velocity vector '''v'''.  For now, we will keep the vectors one-dimensional.
Suddenly you realize that you are in a meter-ish mood and so we want to figure out how fast you are going 
using meters instead of kilometers.  Quickly changing your coordinate system, you find that you are traveling 100 * 1000 = 100 000 meters per hour easterly.  We will call this vector '''v''''.  No problem.  

Now you are in the rolling countryside, and you notice the temperature changing.  We then draw a map of how the temperature changes as we move across the countryside.  We then travel along the path of steepest descent, or fastest cooling.
At our current position, the temperature falls at 10 Celsius degrees per kilometer toward the east.  Let's call this temperature gradient vector '''w'''.  Again, you go into a meter-ish mood.  Doing a quick calculation you figure out that the gradient of the temperature change is -10/1000 = -.01 Celsius degrees per meter.  We shall call this vector '''w''''.

Did you notice something interesting?

Even though we are talking about two vectors we are treating them very differently when we change our coordinates.  In the first case, the vector reacted to the coordinate change by a multiplication.  That is to say, '''v''''=k•'''v'''.  In the second case, we did a division: '''w''''=1/k•'''w'''.  The first case we were changing a vector that was distance per something, while in the second case, the vector was something per distance.  These are two very different types of vectors.  The graphic below depicts the vectors representing '''v''', '''v'''', '''w''', and '''w''''
[[File:Covariant_and_Contravariant_Vectors.JPG|5000px|thumb|The first set of vectors, representing velocity, is contravariant; as the scale decreases from kilometers to meters, the length of the vector increases.  The second set of vectors, representing temperature gradient, is covariant; as the scale decreases from kilometers to meters, the length of the vector decreases as well]]
The mathematical term for the first type of vector is called a &lt;b&gt;contravariant vector&lt;/b&gt;.  The second type of vector is called a &lt;b&gt;covariant vector&lt;/b&gt;.  Sometimes a covariant vector is called a &lt;b&gt;one form&lt;/b&gt;.  

::&lt;b&gt;Attempting a fuller explanation&lt;/b&gt;

::It is easy to see why '''w''' is called covariant.  Covariant simply means that the characteristic that '''w''' measures, change in temperature, increases in magnitude with an increase in displacement along the coordinate system.  In other words, the further you travel from a fixed point, the more the temperature changes, or equivalently, change in temperature ''covaries'' with change in displacement.

::Although it is a bit more difficult to see, '''v''' is called ''contravariant'' for precisely the ''opposite'' reason.  Since '''v''' represents a velocity, or ''distance per unit time'', we can think of '''v''' as the inverse of ''time per unit distance'', meaning the amount of time that passes in traveling a certain fixed amount of distance.  ''Time per unit distance'' is clearly ''covariant'', because as you travel further and further from a fixed point, more and more time elapses.  In other words, time covaries with displacement.  Since velocity is the ''inverse'' of time per unit distance, than it follows that velocity must be ''contravariant''.

::The difference is also evident in the units of measure.  The units of measure for '''v''' are ''meters per hour'', whereas the units for '''w''' are ''degrees Celsius per meter''.  The coordinate system is position in space, measured in units of ''meters''.  So again, we see that the coordinate system appears in the numerator of '''v''', which suggests that '''v''' is ''contravariant''  (with inverse time in this case), whereas the coordinate system appears in the denominator of '''w''', which indicates that '''w''' is ''covariant'' (with change in temperature).

::'''Contravariant''' vectors describe those quantities where the distance units comes at the numerator (like ''velocity''), whereas '''covariant''' are those where the distance unit is at the denominator (like ''temperature gradient'').


These are, of course, just fancy mathematical names.  As we can see
contravariant vectors and covariant vectors are very different from each other and we want to avoid confusing them with each other.  To do this 
mathematicians have come up with a clever notation.  The components of a contravariant vector are represented by superscripts, while the components of a covariant vector are represented by subscripts.  So the components of vector '''v''' are &lt;i&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; while the components of vector '''w''' are &lt;i&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

==Scale Invariance==
Now that we have contravariant vectors and covariant vectors, we can do something very interesting and combine them.  We have a contravariant vector that describes the direction and speed at which we are going.  We have covariant vector that describes the rate and direction at which the temperature changes.  If we combine them using the [[Wikipedia: Dot product | dot product]]

:&lt;math&gt; f \ \ = \ \  \bold{v} \cdot \bold{w} &lt;/math&gt;

dT/dt = 100 · -10 = -1000 degrees Celsius per hour

we get the rate at which the temperature changes, ''f'', as we move in a certain direction, with units of degrees Celsius per second.  The interesting thing about the units of ''f'' is that they do ''not'' include any units of distance, such as meters or kilometers.  So now suppose we ''change'' the coordinate system from meters to kilometers.  How does ''f'' change?

:&lt;math&gt; f \ \ = \ \  \bold{v'} \cdot \bold{w'} &lt;/math&gt;

dT/dt = 100,000 · -.01 = -1000 degrees Celsius per hour


It doesn't.  We call this characteristic '''scale invariance''', and we say that ''f'' is a '''scale invariant''' quantity.  The value of ''f'' is ''invariant'' with changes in the ''scale'' of the coordinate system.

Now so far we have been treating '''w''' as if it were just an odd type of 
vector.  But there is a another more powerful way of thinking about '''w'''. 
Look at what we just did.  We took '''v''', combined it with '''w''' and got something
that doesn't change when  you change the coordinate system.  Now one way of
thinking about it is to say that '''w''' is a function, that takes '''v''' and converts it into a scale invariant value, ''f''.  In plainspeak, '''w''' would be the function that takes in any velocity of a particle and produces the change in temperature that the particle experiences each hour (for the specific temperature field declared earlier).

==Vector Spaces and Basis Vectors==

This fact that a covariant vector like '''w''' can convert any contravariant vector like '''v''' into a scale invariant value like ''f'' is summarized by saying that '''w''' is a [[w:linear functional|linear functional]]. 

Let us be more precise about the word ''like''.  Mathematical operations, such as ''converting one sort of vector into another sort of vector'', are done on [[w:vector space|vector space]]s. See [[w:vector space|vector space]] for a careful definition of vector spaces. Here, loosely speaking, let us say that a vector space is a set of vectors which can be added together and multiplied by numbers and that the result is always another vector in the same vector space.

Let us define &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be the vector space of contravariant vectors like '''v'''.  

Then, the set of all covariant vectors like '''w''', which convert vectors like '''v''' from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; into scalars like ''f'', which we can also call the set of all [[w:linear functional|linear functional]]s '''w''' on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, can be given the name &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt;, which we call the [[w:dual space|dual space]].

&lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; is also a vector space.  Remember, we can view '''w''' as a vector or as a function, depending on which of its properties we wish to emphasize.

Now we can be more careful about the word ''like'' by saying which spaces '''w''' and '''v''' must be a member of:
any vector '''w''' in &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; (called a '''covariant''' vector, or a '''1-form''') can convert any vector '''v''' in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (called a '''contravariant''' vector) into a scale invariant value like ''f''. (We have not said what space or set ''f'' is a member of: in practice, we will usually only be interested in ''f'' as a member of the set of real numbers.)

Any vector space has a set of [[w:basis (linear algebra)|basis]] vectors.  That is to say, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; may be written as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\alpha} v^\alpha \mathbf{e}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; where,
* &lt;math&gt; {\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is an index ranging from 1 to the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;} are the basis vectors of vector space &lt;math&gt; \mathbf V&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; v^\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

Note that although components of contravariant vectors are written with superscript (&quot;upper&quot;) indices, the basis vectors are written with subscript (&quot;lower&quot;) indicies.  If the set {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;} is a basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \in V&lt;/math&gt; is written as the linear combination &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=v^\mu \mathbf{e}_\mu&lt;/math&gt;. (We are using Einstein summation notation, detailed in the [[General Relativity/Einstein Summation Notation|next section]]; this is shorthand for &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mu} v^\mu \mathbf{e}_\mu&lt;/math&gt;.)

Before moving on to covariant vectors, we must define the notion of a '''dual basis'''.  Remember that elements of &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; are linear functionals on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  So we can &quot;apply&quot; covariant vectors to contravariant vectors to get a scalar.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; returns a scalar.  Now, the dual basis is defined as follows:  if {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;} is a basis for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then the dual basis is a basis {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;} for &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}^\mu (\mathbf{e}_\nu) = \delta_\nu^\mu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\delta_\nu^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:Kronecker delta|Kronecker delta]]) for every &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, the components of covariant vectors are written with subscript (&quot;lower&quot;) indices.  As {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;} is a basis for &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt;, we can write a covariant vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} = \sigma_\mu \mathbf{\omega}^\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

We can now evaluate any functional (covariant vector) applied to any vector (contravariant vector).  If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then by linearity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v}) = \sigma_\alpha \mathbf{\omega}^\alpha (v^\beta \mathbf{e}_\beta) = \sigma_\alpha v^\beta \mathbf{\omega}^\alpha (\mathbf{e}_\beta) = \sigma_\alpha v^\beta \delta_\beta^\alpha = \sigma_\alpha v^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, if we define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha (\mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basics of cash flow can be summed up by the concept of time value of money.  This concept is the idea that having money now is better than money in the future, since you can spend it or put it to use.  As a result you should be compensated for the time you do not have the use of your money.  To make equivalent the differences in time we use a flip sided principle knows as discounting (bringing future cash flows to the present) or income (taking present values to the future).  The rate of change required to make cash flows equivalent over time periods is known as the discount rate (both i d and r are common variables for the discount rate, athought i is usually reserved for inflation).  This rate can change with time or for different people.  Imagine how high your discount rate would be if you had won a large cash prize in a radio contest, but had to phone the station within a minute and had no quarters.  

The time that cash flows are discounted to sets a frame of reference for series of cash flows.  This time is usually known as t0 pronounced &quot;t not.&quot;  While any frame of reference can be chosen the most common reference time is now.  In retirement problems the frame of reference can be the date of retirement.  

The basic cash flow equation is FV=PV*(1+r)^t, where FV is the future value (time at some future time), PV is the present value (value at t0, r is the discount (interest) rate, and t is the time between the future value and present value.  The units of time do not matter, but must be the same as the period rate in which r is quoted.  Both are usually in annual terms.  

An example of this is the future value of $100 in one year with a discount rate of 5%.  To solve this problem you would evaluate the following statement:
 FV=$100*(1+0.05)^1
 FV=$100*1.05
 FV=$105

See that was pretty easy wasn't it.  All of finance can be summed up with variants of that basic formula.

According to this principle, if a decision affects costs and revenues in long-run, all those costs and revenues must be discounted to present values before valid comparison of alternatives is possible. This is essential because a rupee worth of money at a future date is not worth a rupee today. Money actually has time value. Discounting can be defined as a process used to transform future dollars into an equivalent number of present dollars. For instance, $1 invested today at 10% interest is equivalent to $1.10 next year.

== Introduction ==
Welcome to the wonderful world of serial data communications.  This is a part of a series of articles that will cover many aspects of serial data communications.  I am going to try and start from the beginning and follow a layered approach to working with serial data and by the time we are through we should be able to transfer just about any sort of data that you would care to send over wires between computers.  Possibly even without wires (wireless data communication).

There are so many aspects about this subject that sometimes it is a very hard nut to crack.  I'm going to dive down and try to start with the basics and introducing the RS-232 serial data communications standard.

== Why Serial Communication? == 
{{cleanup|bad form/style (too conversational) near &quot;I will&quot;}}
First of all, the basic standards that I will be describing are, from the perspective of computer technology, positively ancient.  Some of you reading this could perhaps find your grandparents or even great-grandparents using this protocol when they were in College.  At the same time, it is so solid in concept that the reason for abandoning it should always be questioned.  Indeed, there have been several other data transmission methods that have been developed since the RS-232 serial data protocol was established, but this workhorse is still widely used and seems to go through a rebirth every once in a while.

When all else fails, RS-232 serial communication can be relied upon.  When you are trying to get two pieces of computer equipment together, sometimes newer communications methods have hard limitations that can't be worked out due to number of connections, RF interference, distance limitations, being behind physical barriers, in sensitive areas like medical equipment where stray voltages can be a problem, or that you absolutely need to rely upon the data being transmitted.  A sister protocol to RS-232, the RS-422 protocol, even allows transmissions for several miles of cable.

Serial data communication is widely implemented.  While it is sometimes presumed that a PC can deal with just about any problem you want to throw at it, there are a number of electronic devices that are full of data which needs to be recorded.  In part because of the age of this protocol, there are many legacy devices that have RS-232 serial data as the only access to the outside world. But even many of the latest network devices have RS-232 &quot;console&quot; ports to facilitate initial configuration and provide a means of troubleshooting when the network itself is broken.  Because the hardware is so widely implemented and available, together with many software tools, it is also relatively cheap to develop equipment and software using this system.  Particularly when transmission speed isn't important, but data needs to be sent on a regular basis.  RS-232 serial data is a very reasonable solution instead of a more expensive 10BASE-T TCP/IP solution or high-speed fiber optics.

Serial data communication is also versatile.  While the usual method of transmission is over copper wires between two fixed points, recently there have been some converters that transmit serial data over fiber optic lines, wireless transmitters, USB devices, and even over TCP/IP networks.  What is really surprising here is that all of these transmission methods are totally transparent to the device receiving or transmitting the serial data.  It can also be a carrier for TCP/IP, and be used for private networks.

== OSI Layered Network Communications Model ==
While serial data communication is not strictly a network communication protocol, it is still important to understand the layered communications model when dealing with any sort of communications protocols.  Often people implementing serial data software have to build multiple layers of this model, even if they are not totally aware of it when they are doing it at the time.

Network Layers:

* Application
* Presentation
* Session
* Transport
* Network
* Data-Link
* Physical

Often serial data communication does not implement all of these different layers, and even more often these different layers are combined in the same module or even the very same function. This model was originally developed by the International Organization for Standards (ISO) in 1984 to help give a good idea of where different networking structures could be separated and intermingled. The point here is to know that you can separate different parts of communications sub-systems to help with the debugging process, and to move structures from one sub-system to another.

If your software is well written using a model similar to this one, the software subroutines in layers above and below do not have to be rewritten if the module at a particular layer is changed. To achieve this you need to establish strong standards for the interface between the layers, which will be covered in other sections of these articles. For example, a web browser does not need to know if the HTML is being sent over fiber optic cables, wireless transmissions, or even over a serial data cable.

=== Serial Comm Layers ===
For serial data communication, I see this layer model as more common:

* Serial Data Applications
* Serial Networks
* Packet Challenge/Verification
* Basic Serial Packets
* 8250 UART processing
* Raw RS-232 Signals

In the case of many serial data applications, not all of these layers are implemented.  Often it is just raw packets being transmitted in one direction, but sometimes even just a signal of any kind can indicate some action take place on a computer, regardless of content.  It is possible to simply take the logic level of a raw RS-232 signal in your software, but at some point the data does need to be converted and the voltages involved with RS-232 can damage hardware, so this is very seldom done.

== Software Examples ==
I don't want to get into a holy war over programming languages with this series of articles.  For the moment, I'm going to be using Turbo Pascal and Delphi as the programming languages, if for no other reason then the fact that I am most comfortable programming in this development environment.  If a good C/C++ guru would like to &quot;translate&quot; these routines, I would welcome that, as well as other programming languages where applicable.  Serial communication is complicated enough so please avoid esoteric languages like Intercal or Malbolge.  A good BASIC implementation would be welcome, as would LISP.  I'll try to avoid language-specific features and simply deal with functions in a generic sense, which good programmers should be able to translate to the language of their choice.

These articles are meant to teach you the basics of serial data communication, not to be a functioning serial data driver.  Still, all code examples will be checked and sent through an actual compiler before being listed in the articles, and hopefully fully debugged.  There is no one single way to accomplish these steps and tasks, so I am going to encourage a hands-on approach to dealing with software and setting up networks.

While I've had quite a bit of experience in dealing with several serial data protocols (on the packet level), I am by no means the topmost expert at this.  As I said earlier, I have considerable experience in dealing with communications at many levels, and I'd like to share some of my very hard-won knowledge.

== Applications in Education ==
While I am only a Software Engineer and don't have the &quot;formal&quot; credentials necessary for making an educational textbook, I do believe that there is much that could be taught about computer networking by students experimenting with serial data communication.  The audience that I am aiming for with these articles are the High School hackers/computer geeks and undergraduate CS majors.  A High School teacher that wanted to tackle a subject like this, or if you wanted to cover a special topic course in a university setting where students could get some very hands-on experience with communications protocols.  Every layer of the OSI model could be demonstrated in a manner that students would learn from first-hand experiences why certain rules/systems have been implemented on the Internet, what standards documents mean, and perhaps even participate in creating standards documents.

If you are a professor or High School instructor interested in using this text, I would be particularly interested in adapting this text to better suit your needs, or working with you in covering this subject.

From a professional''' perspective''', this is a topic that is seldom taught at a university, and usually only in passing when they are rushing through a whole bunch of other protocol suites.  Software developers are usually introduced to this topic by having their supervisor dump a bunch of specification documents on their desk, a driver disk with API documentation, and perhaps a typically short deadline in order to get something working that should have been working sometime last year.  Software developers who really understand serial data communication are worth gold, and often even these developers only learn just enough to get the immediate job done.

I've also found that skills learned from developing serial data communications also translate into other projects and give a deeper understanding of just about any data transmission system.  In addition to the other groups I mentioned, I am also aiming for those unfortunate software engineers who are trying to learn just about anything about this very difficult subject and don't know where to begin.  Documentation about serial communication is sparse, and sometime contradictory.

This doesn't have to be that complicated of a subject, and it is possible for mere mortals to be able to understand how everything works.

[[Image:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|350px|right|Probability density function for the normal distribution. The red line is the standard normal distribution.]]

==== Measure of Scale ====
When describing data it is helpful (and in some cases necessary) to determine the ''spread'' of a distribution. One way of measuring this spread is by calculating the variance or the standard deviation of the data.

In describing a complete population, the data represents all the elements of the population. As a measure of the &quot;spread&quot; in the population one wants to know a measure of the possible distances between the data and the population mean. There are several options to do so. One is to measure the average absolute value of the deviations. Another, called the variance, measures the average square of these deviations.

A clear distinction should be made between dealing with the population or with a sample from it. When dealing with the complete population the (population) variance is a constant, a parameter which helps to describe the population. When dealing with a sample from the population the (sample) variance is actually a random variable, whose value differs from sample to sample. Its value is only of interest as an estimate for the population variance.

=====Population variance and standard deviation=====
Let the population consist of the N elements x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,x&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. The (population) mean is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^Nx_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''(population) variance'' &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the average of the squared deviations from the mean or (x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;mu;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - the square of the value's distance from the distribution's mean.

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \frac 1N  \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the squaring the variance is not directly comparable with the mean and the data themselves. The square root of the variance is called the Standard Deviation &amp;sigma;. Note that &amp;sigma; is the root mean squared of differences between the data points and the average.

=====Sample variance and standard deviation=====
Let the sample consist of the n elements x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, taken from the population. The (sample) mean is:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nx_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The sample mean serves as an estimate for the population mean &amp;mu;.

The ''(sample) variance'' ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a kind of average of the squared deviations from the (sample) mean:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \frac 1{n-1}  \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Also for the sample we take the square root to obtain the (sample) standard deviation ''s'' 


A common question at this point is &quot;why do we square the numerator?&quot;  One answer is: to get rid of the negative signs.  Numbers are going to fall above and below the mean and, since the variance is looking for distance, it would be counterproductive if those distances factored each other out. 
&lt;!--sorry but this is absolute tosh - I've been reading it in every textbook, but to do that you could just take the absolute value - I'm quite sure it has more to do with the respective weighting of larger and smaller distances from the mean. And really, I guess it has to do with some maths wizardry which cooked up the whole function and its relation to other values. --&gt;

====Example====
When rolling a fair die, the population consists of the 6 possible outcomes  1 to 6. A sample may consist instead of the outcomes of 1000 rolls of the die.

The population mean is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac 16 (1+2+3+4+5+6) = 3.5&lt;/math&gt;,

and the population variance:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2=\frac 16 \sum_{i=1}^n (i-3.5)^2=\frac 16(6.25+2.25+0.25+0.25+2.25+6.25)=\frac {35}{12} \approx 2.917&lt;/math&gt;

The population standard deviation is:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sqrt{\frac {35}{12}} \approx 1.708&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice how this standard deviation is somewhere in between the possible deviations.

So if we were working with one six-sided die: ''X'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, then &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.917.    We will talk more about why this is different later on, but for the moment assume that you should use the equation for the sample variance unless you see something that would indicate otherwise.

Note that none of the above formulae are ideal when calculating the estimate and they all introduce rounding errors. Specialized statistical software packages use more complicated [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Handbook_of_Descriptive_Statistics/Measures_of_Statistical_Variability/Variance logarithms that take a second pass] of the data in order to correct for these errors. Therefore, if it matters that your estimate of standard deviation is accurate, specialized software should be used. If you are using non-specialized software, such as some popular spreadsheet packages, you should find out how the software does the calculations and not just assume that a sophisticated algorithm has been implemented.

===== For Normal Distributions =====

The empirical rule states that approximately 68 percent of the data in a normally distributed dataset is contained within one standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95 percent of the data is contained within 2 standard deviations, and approximately 99.7 percent of the data falls within 3 standard deviations.

&lt;!-- I changed the numbers back to s = 100.  s=15 is the standard deviation for IQ, not SAT scores. They aren't exact for SAT scores, but they are an okay approximate. -- Llywelyn --&gt;

As an example, the verbal or math portion of the SAT has a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This means that 68% of test-takers scored between 400 and 600, 95% of test takers scored between 300 and 700, and 99.7% of test-takers scored between 200 and 800 assuming a completely normal distribution (which isn't quite the case, but it makes a good approximation).

==== Robust Estimators ====

For a normal distribution the relationship between the standard deviation and the interquartile range is roughly: SD = IQR/1.35.

For data that are non-normal, the standard deviation can be a terrible estimator of scale. For example, in the presence of a single outlier, the standard deviation can grossly overestimate the variability of the data. The result is that confidence intervals are too wide and hypothesis tests lack power. In some (or most) fields, it is uncommon for data to be normally distributed and outliers are common.

One robust estimator of scale is the &quot;average absolute deviation&quot;, or ''aad''. As the name implies, the mean of the absolute deviations about some estimate of location is used. This method of estimation of scale has the advantage that the contribution of outliers is not squared, as it is in the standard deviation, and therefore outliers contribute less to the estimate. This method has the disadvantage that a single large outlier can completely overwhelm the estimate of scale and give a misleading description of the spread of the data. 

Another robust estimator of scale is the &quot;median absolute deviation&quot;, or ''mad''. As the name implies, the estimate is calculated as the median of the absolute deviation from an estimate of location. Often, the median of the data is used as the estimate of location, but it is not necessary that this be so. Note that if the data are non-normal, the mean is unlikely to be a good estimate of location.

It is necessary to scale both of these estimators in order for them to be comparable with the standard deviation when the data are normally distributed. It is typical for the terms ''aad'' and ''mad'' to be used to refer to the scaled version. The unscaled versions are rarely used.

[[File:Histogram of the Michaelson-Morley Speed of Light Data.png|center]]

It is often useful to look at the distribution of the data, or the frequency with which certain values fall between pre-set bins of specified sizes.  The selection of these bins is up to you, but remember that they should be selected in order to ''illuminate'' your data, not ''obfuscate'' it.

A histogram is similar to a [[../Bar Charts|bar chart]]. However histograms are used for continuous (as opposed to discrete or qualitative) data. The defining property of a histogram is:
:The area of each bar is proportional to the frequency.
If each bin has an equal width, then this can be easily done by plotting frequency on the vertical axis. However histograms can also be drawn with unequal bin sizes, for which one can plot frequency density.
  
To produce a histogram with equal bin sizes:

* '''Select a minimum, a maximum, and a bin size.''' All three of these are up to you.  In the histogram data used above the minimum is 1, the maximum is 110, and the bin size is 10. 
* '''Calculate your bins and how many values fall into each of them.'''  For the histogram data the bins are:
** 1 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 10, 16 values.
** 10 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 20, 4 values.
** 20 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 30, 4 values.
** 30 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 40, 2 values.
** 40 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 50, 2 values.
** 50 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 60, 1 values.
** 60 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 70, 0 values.
** 70 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 80, 0 values.
** 80 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 90, 0 values.
** 90 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 100, 0 value.
** 100 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 110, 0 value.
** 110 &amp;le; ''x'' &lt; 120, 1 value.
* '''Plot the counts you figured out above.'''  Do this using a standard [[Statistics:Displaying_Data/Bar_Charts|bar plot]].



=== Worked Problem ===

Let's say you are an avid roleplayer who loves to play Mechwarrior, a d6 (6 sided die) based game.  You have just purchased a new 6 sided die and would like to see whether it is biased (in combination with you when you roll it).

==== What We Expect ====

So before we look at what we get from rolling the die, let's look at what we would expect.  First, if a die is unbiased it means that the odds of rolling a six are exactly the same as the odds of rolling a 1--there wouldn't be any favoritism towards certain values.  Using the standard equation for the [[Statistics:Summary/Averages/mean#mean|arithmetic mean]] find that ''&amp;mu;'' = 3.5.   We would also expect the histogram to be roughly even all of the way across--though it will almost never be perfect simply because we are dealing with an element of random chance.

====  What We Get ====

Here are the numbers that you collect:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
| 1
| 5
| 6
| 4
| 1
| 3
| 5
| 5
| 6
| 4
| 1
| 5
| 6
| 6

| 1
| 5
| 6
| 3
| 4
| 5
| 5
| 5
| 2
| 4
| 4
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==== Analysis ====
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{X} = 3.71&lt;/math&gt;

Referring back to what we would expect for an unbiased die, this is pretty close to what we would expect.  So let's create a histogram to see if there is any significant difference in the distribution.

The only logical way to divide up dice rolls into bins is by what's showing on the die face:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
| '''1''' || '''2''' || '''3''' || '''4''' || '''5''' || '''6'''
|-
| 16 || 9 || 17 || 21 || 20 || 17
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

If we are good at visualizing information, we can simple use a table, such as  in the one above, to see what might be happening.   Often, however, it is useful to have a visual representation.  As the amount of variety of data we want to display increases, the need for graphs instead of a simple table increases.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Histogramofdice.png]]
&lt;/center&gt;

Looking at the above figure, we clearly see that sides 1, 3, and 6 are almost exactly what we would expect by chance.  Sides 4 and 5 are slightly greater, but not too much so, and side 2 is a lot less.  This could be the result of chance, or it could represent an actual anomaly in the data and it is something to take note of keep in mind.  We'll address this issue again in later chapters.


===Frequency Density===

Another way of drawing a histogram is to work out the Frequency Density.

;Frequency Density: The ''Frequency Density'' is the frequency divided by the class width.

The advantage of using frequency density in a histogram is that doesn't matter if there isn't an obvious standard width to use. For all the groups, you would work out the frequency divided by the class width for all of the groups.

=== Storage Management - Garbage Collector ===
In computing there are new tools that are waiting to emerge when developers can find the technology capable of supporting them. One good example is that 50 years ago John L. McCarthy came up with an idea to automatically reclaim the memory of objects that are no longer needed during the execution of Lisp programs. It was the origin of the garbage collection concept in computer science.

One of the tasks performed at runtime--as the compiled program is run
by the user--is the management of allocated memory blocks, so as to
minimize memory usage by deallocating blocks that will no longer be
used. This is referred to as &quot;garbage collection.&quot; Garbage collection
is not available in all languages and compilers, but it is implemented
in many of the most widely used. It takes much of the burden of memory
management off of the programmer--when implemented correctly--and
improves performance. 

Ideally, garbage collectors (hereinafter GC) would remove every allocation that will
never be used again. In practice, we can assume that if there is any way to reference to a block, it can be used again; if not, it would not be used (except accidentally). So GC works by retaining memory blocks that can be reachable by tracing every reference path at a moment and freeing the rest. For example,

 '''function''' concat (string1, string2)
 {
   new_string = alloc (string1.length + string2.length);
   copy (string1, new_string);
   copy (string2, new_string + string1.length);
   return new_string;
 }

This function returns a newly allocated memory block that is the concatenation of given two strings. Because the function only returns a new string and does not know how it is going to be used, it is the caller of this function that is responsible for freeing it, like:

 var old = null
 var string = 'Writing compilers is '
 if you have not finished this book {
   string := concat (string, 'anything but ')
   old := string
 }
 string := concat (string, 'fun!')
 if old != null {
   free (old)
 }

By letting GC free memory blocks when needed, the above can be simplified to:

 string = 'Writing compilers is '
 if you have not finished this book {
   string := concat (string, 'anything but ')
 }
 string := concat (string, 'fun!')

In practice, an execution path and reference dependencies can be far more complicated than the above; thus, it should be easy to imagine how GC would be a great help.

==== Brief History of Garbage Collection ====
In the Beginning, there was Static Allocation, and for a Time, it was
Good. FORTRAN, circa the mid-1950's, had no garbage collection at
all. Once a block of memory was allocated, it stayed allocated. The
programmer could not deallocate it, even if he tried.

Circa 1958, Algol implemented a form of memory management called
stack allocation. Following that, languages like C implemented heap
allocation, which allows the programmer to arbitrarily allocate and
de-allocate memory from the heap of available memory. In C, this is
done with the call &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt;. While this allows very
flexible memory allocation and de-allocation by the programmer,
careless (mis)use often results in memory leaks and dangling pointers;
programmer errors are not handled by the compiler or runtime
environment. 

In order to overcome the barriers of programmer error, we must either
better instruct our programmers, or provide better systems for memory
management. The string of non-accredited technical institutes that
seem to have sprung up in the United States obviously do nothing to
solve the former problem, so it is up to us to approach the latter.

==== Implementing Garbage Collection ====
There are two basic approaches to garbage collection: reference
counting and batching (or tracing).

===== Reference Counting =====
In reference counting, a reference counter is associated with every
allocated object. Whenever a reference is made to that object, the
counter is incremented. When one dereferences that object, the counter
is decremented. When the counter reaches 0, there are no existing
references to this allocated object, so it can be safely removed
(because there is no way for it to be accessed in the future).

When an object O is created, we also create a reference counter for O,
calling it &lt;code&gt;rc[O]&lt;/code&gt;. At creation, &lt;code&gt;rc[O] = 0&lt;/code&gt;. When
we create a reference to O, we perform &lt;code&gt;rc[O]++&lt;/code&gt;. When we
destroy a reference to O, &lt;code&gt;rc[O]--&lt;/code&gt;. When we decrement, we
check to see if the counter is now 0. If it is, we free O.

To allow allocation of memory, we maintain a list of free memory
blocks. When we allocate blocks, we remove them from the free
list. When we deallocate, we add them to the list. Obviously, a major
drawback of this method of allocation is fragmentation; having to
defragment memory to allow allocation in the requested size can create
inexplicable slowdowns for memory allocation. To prevent this, one can
defragment the memory at some set interval, or perform more complex
deallocation to keep memory contiguous, but the solution to this
problem is likely to be non-trivial.

Reference counting has the primary advantages of being simple to
implement, requiring no work at an interval, and thus avoiding the
necessity to pause the current operating to sort out our garbage
collection (which can lead to highly inexplicable pauses during
seemingly ordinary operation). 

However, reference counting has a number of severe limitations, namely
it's inability to detect cyclical pointers (e.g. A references B and B
references A, in which case neither A nor B will ever be collected),
it's cost to pointer operations and use of space, and it's
computational cost to allocation as a result of fragmentation. Some of
these problems have solutions in the form of augmented reference
counting, but some are best solved by using a different form of
garbage collection.

===== Batching/Tracing =====
In batching, the heap is viewed as a directed graph, with pointers as
edges between allocated space (which we view as nodes in the graph).To
do garbage collection, we traverse the graph and mark each node we
reach. If a node is not marked, it cannot be reached and can be safely
deallocated.

Unlike reference counting, this method must be run at a specific time
(reference counting, of course, is performed as a feature of ordinary
allocation and deallocation). Garbage collection--when it must be
performed at a specific time rather than simply as the program runs,
as with reference counting--can be performed when storage is
exhausted, before a segment of code that needs to run quickly is
executed, or simply during idle time when there's nothing for the
computer to do. The best way depends somewhat on the type of program
running; for example, in Microsoft Word, there is enough idle time
(while the user sits thinking up funny parenthetical statements) that
the third option is best. On a real-time system, however, it might be
better to do garbage collection always before certain code runs. 

Batching relies on accurate identification of memory pointers. There
are a number of issues here; something that appears to be an integer
may be a pointer, while something that appears to be a pointer may not
be. A language could be designed specifically to avoid this confusion,
but many popular languages, such as C and C++, are not designed in
such a way. The compiler could mark at compile-time as pointers
anything used as a pointer, but again this requires extra
overhead. Some of the same methodology could be applied at runtime,
but with additional runtime costs. Regardless of how this is done,
however, it is important to be conservative with pointer
identification. When it doubt, it is best to assume something is a
pointer than is not. After all, it is far better to have extra
un-collected garbage than to eliminate blocks that will later be used.

== Introduction ==

There are 3 main types of handling errors:

* acknowledge or retry (ACK-NAK).

* &quot;Forward Error Correction&quot; (FEC)

* Pretend It Never Happened

== ACK-NAK ==

Each packet is checked by the receiver to make sure it is &quot;good&quot;.

If it *is* good, the receiver (eventually) tells the sender that it came through OK -- it acknowledges (ACK) the packet.


All versions of ACK-NAK absolutely require
[[Serial_Programming:Bi-directional_Communication|Two Way Communication]]
.

==== How does the ''receiver'' know it's good ? ====

The sender calculates a checksum or CRC for the entire packet (except for the footer), then appends it to the end of the packet (in the footer/trailer).

The typical CRC is 32 bits, often a [[Wikipedia: Fletcher's checksum| Fletcher-32]] [[Wikipedia: checksum | checksum]].

Aside: Note that the checksum or CRC are forms of '''hashing''', ie, irreversibly shrinking data.  Checksums and CRCs are weaker algorithms than &quot;cryptographically strong&quot; message authentication code algorithms such as MD5 or SHA variants.  Cryptographically strong algorithms can detect errors better than checksums or CRCs, but they take more time to calculate.

Whenever the receiver receives a packet, the receiver calculates exactly the same checksum or CRC, then compares it to the one in the footer/trailer. If they match, the entire packet is (almost certainly) good, so the receiver sends an ACK.

When there's even the slightest question that the packet has any sort of error (which could be *either* in the actual data *or* in the header *or* in the checksum bits -- there's no way for the receiver to tell), the receiver discards it completely and (in most cases) pretends it never saw it.

If it's not good, the ''sender'' sends it again.

==== How does the ''sender'' know it wasn't good ? ====

It never got the ACK. (So either the packet was corrupted, *or* the ACK was corrupted -- there's no way for the sender to know).

==== &quot;Stop-and-wait ARQ&quot; ====

The simplest version of ACK-NAK is &quot;Stop-and-wait ARQ&quot;.

The sender sends a packet, then waits a little for an ACK.
As soon as it gets the ACK, it immediately sends the next packet.
If the sender doesn't hear the ACK in time, it starts over from the beginning, sending the same packet again, until it does get an ACK.

The receiver waits for a packet. If the packet passes all the error-detection tests perfectly, the receiver transmits an ACK (acknowledgment) to the sender.

Subtleties:
If the receiver receives the packet perfectly, but the ACK message is delayed too long, then the transmitter sends another copy of the message (a &quot;communication echo&quot;).
Imagine the packet contained the message &quot;deduct $11,000 from Fred's account.&quot;.
When the receiver gets this second copy of the packet, what should it do?
Certainly it should send an ACK (otherwise the transmitter will keep trying to send this packet over and over).
Either or both of the following problems could occur:
* The delayed first ACK could hit the transmitter after it transmits the second copy of the message, so it transmits the next packet. Then the second ACK hits the transmitter, tricking the transmitter into thinking that &quot;next packet&quot; has been successfully received, when it hasn't.
* When the receiver gets 2 identical consecutive packets saying &quot;deduct $11,000 from Fred's account&quot;, are these 2 legitimate independent transactions, and so it should deduct $22,000 from Fred's account? Or is it really just 1 transaction, with a bit of echo, and so should deduct a total of only $11,000 from Fred's account?

Both of these problems can be solved by adding a &quot;sequence number&quot;.
The transmitter keeps a count of how many independent packets it has transmitted to that receiver, and puts that sequence number in the header of each packet.
But when it re-transmits a packet, it re-transmits that same identical packet with that same identical sequence number.
Also, the receiver, rather than sending a generic &quot;ACK&quot; message, specifies which particular packet it is responding to by putting its sequence number in the ACK message.
When there is a communication echo, the receiver sees the same sequence number, so ACKs that sequence number (again) but then discards and ignores the extra, redundant copy of a packet it already received.
When the transmitter is sending a new packet that merely happens to contain the same data, the receiver sees a different sequence number, so it ACKs that new sequence number, and takes another $11,000 out of Fred's account. Poor Fred.

A 1-bit sequence number (alternating 1 - 0 - 1 - 0 for each new packet, and ACK1 ACK0 ACK1 ACK0 in response) is adequate for a stop-and-wait system.
But as we will see, other ARQ protocols require a larger sequence number.

Subtleties:
Some early protocols had the receiver send a NAK (negative acknowledgment) to the sender whenever a bad packet was received, and the sender would wait indefinitely until it received *either* an ACK *or* a NAK.
This is a bad idea.
Imagine what happens when (a) a little bit of noise made a bad packet, so the receiver sends the NAK back to the sender, but then (b) a little bit of noise made that NAK unrecognizable.
Alternatively, imagine a shared-medium network with 1 sender and 2 receivers. What happens when a little noise messes up the &quot;destination&quot; field of the packet ?

With &quot;Stop-and-wait ARQ&quot;, the sender and the receiver only needs to keep 1 packet in memory at a time.

==== streaming ARQ ====

The sender sends a packet, then the next packet, then the next, without waiting.

As it sends each packet, it puts a copy of that packet in a &quot;window&quot;.

Each packet is consecutively numbered.
(The sequence number must be at least large enough to uniquely identify every packet in the window).

... turn-around time ... bouncing off geostationary satellites ...

The receiver occasionally transmits an acknowledgment (&quot;I got all packets up to 8980&quot;, &quot;I got all packets up to 8990&quot;).

If the receiver is expecting packet number 9007, but it receives a packet with an *earlier* number (that it had already received successfully), it transmits (or possibly re-transmits) a &quot;I got all packets up to 9006&quot; message.

When the sender receives an acknowledgment of any packet in the &quot;window&quot;, it deletes that copy.

When the sender's window gets full, it waits a little, then tries re-sending the packets in the window starting with the oldest.

So when the sender suspects an error in some packet, it resend *all* packets starting with the erroneous packet. This guarantees that the receiver will (eventually) receive all packets in order.

Optionally,
If the receiver is expecting packet number 9007, but it receives packet number 9008, it may transmit a negative acknowledge (NAK) for 9007, and ignores any higher packet numbers until it gets packet 9007.

When the sender receives a NAK for any packet in the window, it re-starts transmission with that packet (and keeps it in the window).

With &quot;streaming ARQ&quot;, the sender needs to keep the entire window of packets in memory at a time.
But the receiver still only needs to handle 1 packet at a time, and handles them in consecutive order.

(Some people think of &quot;streaming&quot; as one big packet the size of the window using &quot;stop-and-wait&quot; protocol, divided into smaller &quot;sub-packets&quot;).

=== Selective Repeat ARQ ===
{{Wikipediapar||Selective Repeat ARQ}}

A selective repeat ARQ system is a kind of streaming ARQ.

But instead of the receiver only handling 1 packet at a time, and discarding all packets higher or lower than the one it is looking for, the receiver tries to keep a copy of all packets it receives in a window of its own, and negotiates with the sender to try to resend *only* the erroneous packets.

== FEC ==

If you have only one-way communication,
you are forced to use Forward Error Correction, sometimes called EDAC (Error Detection And Correction).

You transmit the data, then (instead of a CRC) you transmit &quot;check bits&quot; that are calculated from the data.

... NASA space probes ... compact disks ...

The simplest kind is &quot;repeat the message&quot;.

If I send the same packet twice, and noise only corrupts one of them, *and* the receiver can tell which one was corrupted, then no data was lost.
If I send the same packet 3 times, and noise corrupts any one of them, then the receiver can do &quot;best 2 out of 3&quot;. The &quot;check bits&quot; are 2 copies of the data bits.
In fact, noise could corrupt a little bit of *all three* of them, and you could still extract all the data -- align the 3 packets next to each other,
and do &quot;best 2 out of 3&quot; for every bit. As long as there were only a few bits of noise in each packet, and the noise was in a different place in each packet, all the data can be recovered.

... (put picture here) ...

There are some very clever kinds of FEC (Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes) that can correct all kinds of common errors better than &quot;best 2 out of 3&quot;, and only require the same number of &quot;check bits&quot; as there are data bits.

== Pretend It Never Happened ==

A sender often streams audio and video live, in real-time.

What should a receiver do when a packet gets mangled ?

If it sends a message back to the sender, asking it to resend that packet,
by the time the reply gets back, it's probably several video frames later.
It's too late to use that information.

Rather than pausing the entire movie until the request makes a round-trip, it's far less jarring to the audience if the receiver silently discards the mangled packet, fills in as best it can (for example, with nearby pixels' colors), try not to draw attention to the error, and continue on as if nothing had happened.

{{NOTE|Signal degradation should be documented and easily findable as to let users know that there is no guarantee of exact reproduction.}}

== combination ==

Even when they have 2-way communication, sometimes people use FEC anyway. That way small amounts of noise can be corrected at the receiver. If a packet is corrupted so badly that FEC cannot fix it, the protocol falls back on ACK-NAK retransmission (or on Pretend It Never Happened).

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The biological species concept, which was first introduced by Ernst Mayr, defines a species as a population whose members have the potential to interbreed to produce viable, fertile offspring, but do not produce healthy offspring with other species. 

==How do species originate?==

===Different Modes:===

There are different modes of speciation that can lead to the origin of species. We will focus on ''allopatric'' and ''sympatric'' speciation, but will also introduce two other modes: ''parapatric'' and ''peripatric''. Gene flow, the loss or gain of alleles in a population due to the migration of fertile individuals or between gamete populations, is reduced in all of these speciation modes.  A recent trend towards designating speciation events as ''ecological speciation'' or ''nonecological speciation'' is motivated by a desire to focus more on the process, rather than the geography, leading to speciation events.  This dichotomy may be somewhat misleading, however, as empirical work indicates that ecological factors are important in driving speciation regardless of whether or not gene flow is present, leading many to question whether speciation is ever truly nonecological.

===Allopatric Speciation:===

A geographic barrier is the predominant means by which allopatric speciation occurs.

====How it works====
          
#There are two populations that interact by interbreeding, which allows for gene flow (genetic exchange), within a broad geographic range. The resulting offspring are fertile because these populations are of the same species. 
#A geographic barrier arises, isolating the two populations. The newly isolated populations now go through a period of isolation. Some of the individuals within a population might exhibit a trait more suitable for the new environment. This variant allows for differential survivorship and reproduction. Those individuals that carry the trait are more likely to survive in the new environment. Therefore, they will leave more offspring. Gradually, the variant trait will become dominant. Theoretically, this would happen with both of the newly isolated populations resulting in reproductive isolation.
#The geographic barrier ends. The two populations now have the opportunity to interbreed again. If the populations do not recognize each other as potential mates or cannot produce fertile offspring, speciation has occurred because the populations are reproductively isolated. The two populations have become two different species. If speciation has not occurred, the populations can still interbreed successfully to produce viable, fertile offspring.

An organism's mobility plays a significant role in allopatric specition. Two populations of birds would not be hindered by an emerging mountain range because of their ability to fly. The size and remoteness of a population also play a major role in speciation. There is a greater chance of a species forming in a small, isolated population because natural selection and genetic drift are more likely to alter the gene pool there.

These barriers are not limited to the more recognizable ones, mountain ranges and rivers, though. Populations can also become reproductively isolated by members of a population colonizing a new remote area without the presence of their parent population. 

{{TextBox|'''Examples of Allopatric Speciation: Ring Species and Adaptive Radiation'''
[[Image:ringspecies.jpg|right]]
;Ring Species:A species distributed around some geographic barrier, with the populations that have diverged the most in their evolution eventually meeting where the ring closes.

In this example, gene flow occurs throughout most of the circuit except for where the two populations overlap. The idea behind a ring species is that given enough distance and time, populations will diverge in their genetic makeup hindering their ability to interbreed.

;Adaptive Radiation: A process characterized by periods of isolation and dispersal. This example of allopatric speciation usually occurs when there are new areas for a species to occupy, after mass extinctions, or when natives have not colonized an area.

Adaptive radiation can be seen in the evolutionary history of the Hawaiian Archipelago, which consists of numerous volcanic islands. Each island is physically diverse, allowing for natural selection to occur, which can lead to reproductive isolation. This type of allopatric speciation is exemplified in the evolutionary history of honeycreepers. There are over 20 living species of honeycreepers that all evolved from a single species that had colonized an island. Honeycreepers dispersed to the different islands and evolved. Those that came back to their native island were not capable of interbreeding with the natives anymore because the visiting honeycreepers had adapted to their new environment.}}

===Sympatric Speciation===

Speciation does not only occur when there is a geographic barrier separating two populations; Sympatric speciation occurs when divergent selection causes preferred mating with genetically similar individuals but not with the parent population, hence reproductively isolating one part of the population from another.

====Sympatric Speciation in Plants====

Plants frequently undergo this type of speciation. The most common type of sympatric speciation is a mutant condition called polyploidy, which is caused by a doubling of chromosomes during cell division. Autopolyploid mutations occur when an individual has more than two chromosome sets, all derived from a single species. A more common type of polyploidy species is an allopolyploid, which forms a hybrid from two species. Sympatric speciation generally occurs in plants through hybrids of related species and errors in cell division, producing fertile polyploids. 

{{TextBox|'''Example: Autopolyploidy'''

The parent species of a population is diploid (2n). A meiotic error during gamete production doubles the chromosome number from diploid to a tetraploid (4n) zygote. This zygote can now self pollinate or mate with other tetraploids, but cannot interbreed with the diploids of the original population. The offspring of a tetraploid with a diploid would create a triploid (3n), which would be sterile because of unpaired chromosomes. Gene flow has been reduced.

This type of speciation was first discovered by Hugo de Vries, a botanist. He studied variation among primrose species. During his breeding experiments with ''Oenthera lamarckiana'' (a diploid, 14 chromosome species of primrose), he discovered a new tetraploid (4n) species with 28 chromosomes. He named this tetraploid species ''Oenthera gigas''. This species could not interbreed successfully with its parent species.}}

{{TextBox|'''Example: Allopolyploidy'''

Two different species interbreed, combining their chromosomes to form a polyploid hybrid. A meiotic error during gamete production results in sterile hybrids because the haploid chromosomes from the two species cannot pair up. There are some mechanisms that can allow for a sterile hybrid to become fertile though. A sterile hybrid might be fertile with another sterile hybrid of its kind, but not successful when interbreeding with the parent species. Gene flow has been reduced.

Polyploid plant species are very common. Scientists have recorded many new species of plants due to allopolyploidy: ''Tragopogon (goastsbeard)'', ''T. dubius'', ''T. pratensis'', and ''T. porrifolius''. Many of the plants we eat are also polyploids: cotton, potatoes, and wheat. Wheat is one of the best examples of polyploidy. Bread, which comes from a species of wheat called ''Triticum aestivum'', results from allopolyploidy. Geneticists create hybrids and use chemicals that result in meiotic and mitotic errors to create more polyploids.}}


====Sympatric Speciation in Animals====

Sympatric speciation is less common in animals than plants, but still exists. Animals can become reproductively isolated by becoming dependent on different resources than those used by their parent species. It is possible for there to be a genetic change that selects for different resources. Sympatric speciation in animals, which isolates the species reproductively, results from preferences for different habitats, food, resources, and breeding partners. 

One of the best examples of sympatric speciation in animals is with the 200 different species of cichlids that inhabit Lake Victoria in East Africa. Sympatric speciation has occurred here as a result of variations in available resources, as well as  selective mating based on coloration. This idea was tested by a group of scientists at Holland’s University of Leiden using ''P.pundamilia'' (blue back) and ''P. nyererei'' (red back). Although females of the ''P. pundamilia'' species only mated with males of the same species in normal lighting, they mated with the ''P. nyererei males'' in monochromatic orange lighting which made the two species appear identical. The resulting hybrids between the two species were still fertile. Mate choice based on coloration led to sympatric speciation within the cichlid species in this case.

===Parapatric Speciation===

In the absence of a geographic barrier, parapatric speciation can also lead to the emergence of a new species. In this type of speciation, gene flow is reduced because individuals are reproducing with the mates closest to them. Therefore, mating is not random. The phenotypes are gradually divergent from the extreme forms, but are all equally present within the population. Gene flow is reduced within the population. Parapatric speciation cannot produce separate species in the absence of divergent selection.

===Peripatric Speciation===

This type of speciation correlates (?) with allopatric speciation. It occurs in a few members of the population, which exhibit a different appearance than the majority.  Genetic drift plays the major role in speciation. This mode is the hardest to support with evidence.

== Structure to follow ==

This book has been restructured so many times but there is an effort under way to merge some of the duplicate material.

A [[Japanese/Practical Lessons/Syllabus|syllabus]] and [[Japanese/Practical Lessons|lesson plan]] was created for the so-called &quot;Practical Lessons&quot;. This may be useful for future contributors, but never turned out any lessons.

=== Lessons ===

There are many ways to organise a lesson, this is one:
# Dialogue (by posters, conversations, or whatever.)
# Discussion of Vocabulary in Dialogue
#* Discuss various uses of vocabulary if necessary (e.g., politeness)
#* Optional links to dialogues for previously learned vocabulary
# Grammar
#* Discuss grammar points, giving more examples if necessary.
#* Link to previous grammar points (maybe by categories)
# Optional Quick Review
# Optional link to Wikiversity for practice work.

=== Reading material ===

== Style guide ==
=== Romanisation ===
Learning the Japanese scripts will give the student useful insight into the language that the simple (and limited) romanisations cannot offer.
Romanisation (''rōmaji'') should, therefore, only be used in introductory lessons to assist with the learning of the kana, and in the reference guides. Kana and kanji should be used in all subsequent lessons.

Please use the [[w:Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles|Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles]]. Specifically:

* Consonants will be written using the Revised Hepburn system (s, sh, z, j, t, ts, ch, f)
* &quot;n&quot; mora will be written n' before a vowel, or &quot;y&quot; (''zen'aku'', ''kon'yaku'')

Examples:
* しつ: shitsu
* どうぞ: dōzo
* えいご: eigo
* せんぱい: sempai
* せんや: sen'ya (as different from せにゃ ''senya'')
* {{furi|東京|とうきょう|}}: Tōkyō

The macrons (Ā,ā,Ē,ē,Ī,ī,Ō,ō,Ū and ū) are easily added through the edit interface by choosing &quot;Romaji&quot; in the drop-down list below the &quot;Save page&quot; button.

=== Furigana ===
The lessons make extensive use of furigana. Please use the following templates to insert furigana:

* {{tlx|furi|楽|たの|しい}}: {{furi|楽|たの|しい}}

=== Conversations ===
For conversations with Japanese and English side by side, use {{tl|Japanese conversation}}.

=== Patterns and examples ===
Sentence patterns and examples can be highlighted using the {{tl|Japanese pattern}} and {{tl|Japanese example}} templates.

=== Related modules ===
Linking to related modules makes it easier for readers to refer to past lessons (e.g. to brush up on topics), vocabulary lists (e.g. when practicing new sentence patterns) or other useful content (such as the [[../Verb conjugation table/]]). The {{tl|Japanese related}} template can be used to consistently style these links.

=== Vocabulary pages ===
Please place vocabulary lists on subpages of [[Japanese/Vocabulary]] and use {{tl|Japanese vocabulary entry}} to structure them. The {{tlx|Japanese related|vocabulary}} can be used to conveniently link to the list from lesson pages.

=== Stroke order ===
[[File:不-red.png|right|thumb|90px|Black to red fade]]
[[File:永-order.gif|left|thumb|100px|Gif animations]]
There is [[commons:COM:SOP|a project on the Wikimedia Commons]] to upload images and animations of the stroke order for characters. There are directions on how to contribute. It's easy with the use of some free programs. Please contribute so that we'll have a standardized reference for our Wikibook users.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Linne.jpg|thumb|right|Carolus Linneaus (1707-1778) laid out much of the foundation of modern taxonomy]]

'''Carolus Linnaeus''' (1707-1778) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. One of his principle contributions was the taxonomic system of  binomial nomenclature. He turned away from his love of botany in order to pursue the medical field (?). While studying in the Netherlands, he published his first work, entitled ''Systema Naturae'' (1725). In this work, he introduced his idea of three (?) main kingdoms created from the use of his classification system. His systema naturae was a continuous work that ended up in multiple volumes as the concepts of classification were modified with the growing number of species of plants and animals. 

==Scientific Thought== 
The scientific thinking of Linnaeus began with natural theology. Because of his religions beliefs, he believed that it was possible to find an understanding of God by looking at His creations. In part of ''Systema Naturae'', he explained how he thought that the divine order of the creations of God would possibly be revealed by studying nature and its origins.

Linnaeus' love of botany brought his first taxonomic categories to be those of plants. He based each group of plants on the number and arrangement of the plant's reproductive organs. This did not work as well as Linnaeus planned because it created a system that was very unnatural in the sense that it did not compare many other similarities and differences that are important to categorizing plants. He first separated the plants into a large group (?), and then used smaller categories to further diversify the plants. He gave each plant two names which is the origin of binomial nomenclature. This form of classifying has been modified throughout the years and is still used today.

Binomial nomenclature consists of the two Latin names given to an organism. The first is the name of the genus to which the organism belongs, also referred to as the generic epithet. Genera are further divided into species, identified by the specific epithet (the second part of the name). The combination of these two category names creates the scientific name of organisms. Even though Linnaeus was not (?) the first to use the binomial naming system, he was the first to use it frequently enough for the system to be accepted and used more often by scientists everywhere.

Linnaeus' thoughts on evolution are very different from the modern day theories. He believed that species were immutable. Even thought Linnaeus believed in immutability, he did believe that the creation of new species was possible, but that it is limited. (?)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hutton (1726 – 1797) is best known for his theory of gradualism. Hutton was a geologist who left the medical field in order to travel and study the earth’s surface. When Hutton’s ideas began to circulate, geology was not a subject that was given much attention. The focus of the time was mineralogy.

In 1785, Hutton published his paper titled ‘Theory of the Earth.’ In this paper, he explained how the study of geology confines itself as the study of the material makeup of the earth. He suggested many explanations and origins for many geological occurrences ranging from molten rock formations to the origins of materials found on sea floors.

Hutton began his paper with his studies of atmospheric changes in a section he termed ‘Theory of Rain.’ In this section of his paper, Hutton went into detail of how moisture accumulates in the atmosphere until enough has gathered to form a dense moisture filled cloud with visible precipitate in the form of rain.

It was not until the third version of the Theory of the Earth was published when Hutton introduced his theory of gradualism. This is where he recognized that change did occur, but that change was the gradual culmination of slow processes happening over great amounts of time. By using this idea, it is possible to observe the earth today and make assumptions about the past since change happened over such a long period of time, the earth today must be relevant to the earth of the past.

[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.jpg|thumb|right|Jean-Baptise Lamark (1774-1829)]]

'''Jean-Baptiste Lamarck''' (1774 – 1829) was a French botanist who proposed two ideas that had great impact in the theory of evolution. Lamarck did not believe that a species could become extinct. Instead, he saw the idea of extinction as every member of a species evolving into another species. He believed that change was brought about through use and disuse and inheritance of acquired characteristics. This was the first time that a mechanism was proposed in order to explain how a change in a species occurred.

The first idea of use and disuse is only the first part of Lamarck’s revolutionary thought. It is referred to as the 'First Law' of his publication, ''Philosophie Zoologique''. . The use or disuse theory explains that the parts of an organism that the organism uses most will undergo hypertrophy and will become more developed. Hypertrophy is the growth of a specific organ or tissue. So by this idea, the more an organism uses a part of its body, the larger and more developed that part will become. The parts of the organism that are not used as much undergo atrophy and begin to degrade from lack of use. This means that the part of the organism will get decrease in size due to the lack of use for that particular part of the organism. This is the beginning of the idea of inheritance of acquired traits.

The inheritance of acquired traits, also known as his 'Second Law' in Philosophie Zoologique, is the idea that the traits of an organism that undergo hypertrophy will be inherited by the next generation. This hypertrophy suggests an adaptation to the environment that can be passed on to the next generation through the genetic code of the organism.

Even thought Lamarck made astounding progress throughout his life, this theory of evolution has been revised by following studies. The Lamarckian view of evolution is seen as a tendency for a species to reach perfection where it is actually simply adapting to their environment in a single generation. We now know that the inheritance of acquired characteristics is not an actual mechanism of evolution. 

Darwin saw that Lamarck had some very good ideas that could lead to evolution. Many of Lamarck’s ideas can be seen in Darwin’s Origin of Species. Lamarck was a believer in immutability. Darwin used this idea to further his research on how species were indeed mutable. Darwin also used Lamarck’s inheritance of acquired characteristics as support for his natural selection idea. He used Lamarck’s basic structure, but changed the theory Lamarck used into the actual mechanism of natural selection. Instead of saying that the traits one organism acquires during its lifetime to better its success, Darwin said that these characteristics would eventually reveal themselves in offspring and later generations instead of in the present organism. These were just some of the ideas Darwin modified while writing the Origin of Species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Empiricism''' is a philosophical idea based on the idea that all reliable knowledge about the world is gained in the process of experience. Famous empiricists were Hume, Locke and Berkley, basing themselves on ideas already postulated by Aristotle, that we are born with the Tabula Rasa which receives throughout our lives information on which it can base all thinking and knowing. The movement of empiricism was in part a countermovement to what Descartes and Spinoza had proposed as rationalism. Knowledge derived from experience is called ''a posteriori''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rationalism''' is a philosophical movement declaring that the most certain form of knowledge is derived from reason and that our senses are not reliable submitters of information about the outer world. The most famous rationalists were Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, creating theories of knowledge totally independent from any experience. The senses, according to the rationalists, can not tell us real truth, for example: we could dream that we are the king of the world and not truly be, but the angles of a triangle still sum up to 180 degrees. Knowledge from reason alone and not experience is known as ''a priori''.  Plato is considered by many to be the main precursor to rationalism, whereas his student, Aristotle, is often considered to be a precursor to empiricism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thomas Malthus lived from 1766 to 1834. In 1798, he published the Principle of Population where he made the observations that the human race would be likely to overproduce if the population size was not kept under control.

Malthus then focused his studies on the human race. His calculations and theories produced an idea that the human population would increase geometrically while the food supply and natural resources would only increase arithmetically. This is a potential explanation for the predicted poverty and famine. He concluded that as more offspring are born, a more competitive nature would arise. As more offspring come into the population, fewer resources will be available for the population. This has the potential for competition between organisms for survival due to lack of resources. This competitive nature would be necessary for survival of individuals within a large population size unable to be supported by the environment. He believed that this uncontrollable population size would eventually be the cause of famine and poverty among humans. His reasoning behind this idea was divine intervention. He believed that this would be the punishment for man if he became too lazy.

Malthus’ Principle of Population caused Darwin to rethink many issues while coming up with his theory of natural selection. Malthus’ work made Darwin realize the importance of overpopulation and how it was necessary to have variability in different populations. Darwin also used Malthus’ ideas to use competition as well as the survival in numbers idea to come up with his full idea of natural selection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Georges Cuvier''' (1769 – 1832) is known for two topics that are very important to modern science. First, he is considered the founder of the study of functional anatomy. By studying the makeup of the body and its arrangements, he was able to make certain assumptions about body parts by simply examining others.

Cuvier was very interested in Linnaeus’ classification system. After extensive study, he modified the system. The system of taxonomy now included the realm of fossils. He was the first to realise that fossils were the organic remains of extinct animals. Because of his work with fossils, he was given the title of Father of Paleontology. Cuvier was also a believer of immutability of characteristics which rejected evolutionary theory as well as Lamarck’s idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics.

The most important contribution of Cuvier was his theory of catastrophism. Through his fossil study, he came to notice that some layers (strata) differed from other layers. He also observed that certain fossils were not present in all layers and some completely disappeared after a certain level. This gave Cuvier the idea that the reason for this observation was mass extinction. By adding these two ideas together, he came to his idea of catastrophism: the idea that the boundaries between the strata correspond with catastrophes that occurred throughout time that wiped out entire species. This was his explanation of why certain fossils sometimes disappeared after being found in some strata.

Cuvier’s theory of catastrophism is important to evolution because it gave other scientists a basis to work from. Many other discoveries and ideas come from some theory backing up or going against catastrophism. This theory is also import today with the ongoing investigation of the Chicxulub crater off of the Yucatán peninsula.  This crater is a geologic finding potentially reinforces this theory making catastrophism a possible extinction mechanism of the dinosaurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We can hone our analytic and problem-solving abilities, and improve the way we think about thinking, by studying fundamental questions. It is often the reasoning and answers other people have come up with when faced with similar questions that can help most. This is useful in both academic and practical applications.

The choice of essential ''questions'' is itself also interesting, as well as the ''answers'' - both questions posed, and answers given by particular philosophers depend on the time or era in which they lived.

Often, philosophers will go into professional fields such as law, medicine, and government. However, philosophy is about a great deal more than just academic education, analytical skills, and improving one's prospects for employment. It is not to be confused with history, semantics or debating (though all these elements are part of the study).

The study of philosophy is best undertaken seriously as an attempt to understand oneself and the universe, and even to reconcile the two. While a few years of reading up on philosophical history will certainly improve the quality of one's thinking, philosophy truly becomes worthwhile when it changes our lives. A thorough examination of internal and external life can dramatically change the way we see the world, casting a clearer light on phenomena that we were once immersed in. In this way, the study of philosophy is the study of our lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pragmatism is a philosophy that was developed and passed on by Peirce, Quine, James, and others.

The Correspondence Theory of Truth, which was held by Aristotle among others, holds that when we say something is true, this means that my understanding of reality corresponds with reality.  So if I say that the Sun revolves around the Earth, it is not true because this does not correspond to reality.  On the other hand, a Pragmatist would say that if it &quot;works&quot; for you, if it does not make your life problematic and has no significant impact on your life, then it is &quot;true&quot; in the sense that it works; it's pragmatic.  This is similar to the perspectivist view adopted by Nietzsche.

General Topology is based solely on set theory and concerns itself with structures of sets. It is at its core a generalization of the concept of distance, though this will not be immediately apparent for the novice student. Topology generalizes many distance-related concepts, such as continuity, compactness, and convergence.

===Question &amp; Answer===

Have a question?  Why not ask the very textbook that you are learning from?

1. What is the difference between topology, algebra and analysis?

* Topology is a generalization of analysis and geometry. It comes in many flavors: point-set topology, manifold topology and algebraic topology, to name a few. All topology generalizes concepts from analysis dealing with space such as continuity of functions, connectedness of a space, open and closed sets, (etc.). Algebraic topology attributes algebraic structures (groups, rings etc.) to families of topological spaces to distinguish topological differences in those families. Manifold topology works with spaces that are locally the same as Euclidean space, i.e., surfaces. Often manifolds are equipped with extra structure, such as smooth, PL, symplectic, etc. A naive description of topology is that it identifies those qualities of a space that do not change under twisting and stretching of that space. As such, it is popularly referred to as &quot;rubber sheet geometry.&quot;  In reality topology does far more than this, in fact providing a rigorous foundation under all branches of mathematics dealing with &quot;spaces.&quot;

* Algebra deals with the structure of sets under various operations with particular properties. Commonly studied algebraic objects include Groups, Rings and Field. One of the major results from Algebra include Galois Theory, which eventually shows that there is no general solution to quintic polynomial equations by radicals. Also important results from Algebra are the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (which says that, in the Field of Complex numbers, every non constant polynomial has at least one root), Group Classification, and much more. 

* Analysis (or specifically real analysis) on the other hand deals with the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the standard topology and algebraic structure of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Analysis provides rigorous proofs for the definitions of derivatives and integrals, as well as treatments of sequences and limits. One can, in some sense, view it as a rigorous treatment of the Calculus.


2. How are the concepts of base and open cover related?  It seems that every base is an open cover, but not every open cover is a base.  But, why are both concepts needed?

*The terms base and open cover are not evidently related. Every base is an open cover which is probably the main relation. Take a second countable topological space for instance (second countable means that the space has a countable base for its topology). Such a space satisfies the property that every open cover has a countable sub-cover. To prove this we use the countability of the base. Basically, for any open cover, we choose for each element of the space, an element of the open cover containing it and hence a basis element contained in that element of open cover. Therefore, for any open cover, we can generate a open cover of basis elements that is an 'open refinement' (see Wikipedia for definition). From here we can get properties of open covers from properties of the base. If the base is countable, we can generate a countable open cover from the original cover.

The reason we have both definitions is because these two things have different properties. The most useful fact about a base is that it determines the topology. A basis must have &quot;arbitrarily small&quot; sets, that is, any open set contains a basis element. On the other hand, an open cover does not determine the topology at all. It can be used to build things such as partitions of unity, and often draws on the compactness property.

3. What is a homology?

*While homotopy is what one would want to study at first, it turns out that most questions in homotopy theory are rather hard. If we &quot;replace&quot; the spheres of homotopy theory with simplices we can extract similar information about &quot;holes&quot; in the space (often what one is interested in), we get a much more computable sequence of groups. The Hurewicz theorem even gives us that in some cases the homotopy groups can be calculated via the homology groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Section Move==

I believe it would be a good idea to compile all of the sections of differential equations under a seperate module. Having its own section on the mathematics bookshelf would help with the overall organization of the mathematics section. There are so many different topics in differential equations that I feel the move is justified.

[[User:Spammy|Spammy]] 16-06-04

That would have some advantages, but differential equations also clearly come under the calculus heading, and should be fully covered there, which means leaving those pages where they are.

Fortunately, Wikibooks has more flexibility than paper books. I see two obvious options.

*We could copy the ODE coverage from this wikibook to a new ODE book, then expand on it in the new book to cover much beyond this book's scope, while leaving this book's coverage largely unaltered (since its ODE coverage is no more than I'd expect for a book of its declared scope.) Presumably PDE's would be treated in the same way.

*We could regard the Calculus book as a multiple volume series, making the mathematics bookshelf an hierarchical list (which would certainly help with its organisation). Trying to fit all the maths books in at the same level obscures the dependance relations between the subjects, and multi-volume series are reasonably common for textbooks. 

:Do this, and the current Calculus book would be left with only links to its subsidary books, possible interleaving chapters from different books in a suggested order.

I prefer the second option. Anyone else got an opinion? [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 18:35, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Just wanted to add that there is a Wikibook on differtial equation. Would save time and effort, if work on that book was coordinated from here. Would be better still if that effort was integrated into this, as Carando above suggests

:I agree with all of the above. Differential Equations do not belong in an introductory calculus textbook, except as a small reference for further reading. [[Special:Contributions/128.120.218.130|128.120.218.130]] ([[User talk:128.120.218.130|talk]]) 22:14, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

:I too agree that a comprehensive exposition of diff eqs belongs elsewhere.  However, there is a little bit of it in Stewart and it is usually briefly touched in third-semester calculus (at the couple of schools I've been at).  So perhaps we should keep a bit.

==Explain the old style differential notation==

It would be useful to have an explanation of the old style of writing differential equations where the dx and dy already appear as separate quantities, such as  y - sin^2(x) dx + sin(x)dy = 0.  The article shows treating separable equations by using dx and dy separately, but older texts also present non-separable equations with the differentials apart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter concisely describes the basic set theory concepts used throughout this book—not as a comprehensive guide, but as a list of material the reader should be familiar with and the related notation. Readers desiring a more in-depth understanding of set theory should read the [[Set Theory]] Wikibook.

==Basic Definitions==
The empty set is denoted by symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;. A finite set consisting of elements &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Set theorists commonly, albeit sloppily, do not distinguish strictly between a singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; and its single element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

For a more in depth understanding of how elements of sets relate to each other, we must first define a few terms. Let ''A'' and ''B'' denote two sets.
*The ''union'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\bigcup{B}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all ''x'' that belong to either ''A'' or ''B'' (or both).
*The ''intersection'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\bigcap{B}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all ''x'' that belong to both ''A'' and ''B''.
*The ''difference'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\backslash B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A-B&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\notin B&lt;/math&gt;.
**In contexts where there is a set containing &quot;everything,&quot; usually denoted ''U,'' the ''complement'' of ''A'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;U\backslash A&lt;/math&gt;.
*The ''symmetric difference'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\Delta B&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by &lt;math&gt;A\Delta B=(A\backslash B)\bigcup{(B\backslash A)}&lt;/math&gt;.
*''A'' is a ''subset'' of ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if every element in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; also belongs to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, when &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in A:x\in B&lt;/math&gt;. A key property of these sets is that &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;.
*''A'' is a ''proper subset'' of ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\subsetneq B&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \ne B&lt;/math&gt;. (We do not use the notation &lt;math&gt;A\subset B&lt;/math&gt;, as the meaning is not always consistent.)
*The ''cardinality'' of ''A,'' denoted &lt;math&gt;\left|A\right|&lt;/math&gt;, is the number of elements in ''A''.
*;Examples:
**&lt;math&gt;\left|\left\{1,2,3,4,5\right\}\right|=5&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;\left|\varnothing\right|=0&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;\left|\left\{\varnothing\right\}\right|=1&lt;/math&gt;
*The ''power set'' of ''A,'' denoted &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all subsets of ''A.''
*;Examples:
**&lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=\left\{\varnothing\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;P(\left\{x\right\})=\left\{\varnothing,\left\{x\right\}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;P(\left\{x,y\right\})=\left\{\varnothing,\left\{x\right\},\left\{y\right\},\left\{x,y\right\}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;\left|P(A)\right|=2^{\left|A\right|}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[W:Tuple|Ordered ''n''-tuples]] are denoted &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
For two ordered sets &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;X=Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \mathbb{N}, 1 \le i \le n:x_i = y_i&lt;/math&gt;.

''N''-tuples can be defined in terms of sets. For example, the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; was defined by [[w:Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kazimierz Kuratowski]] as &lt;math&gt;\left(x,y\right):=\left\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Now ''n''-tuples are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n)\ :=\ \{\langle 1,x_1\rangle ,\langle 2,x_2 \rangle ,\ldots,\langle n,x_n\rangle \}.&lt;/math&gt;

We now can use this notion of ordered pairs to discuss the ''Cartesian Product'' of two sets. The ''Cartesian Product'' of ''A'' and ''B'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A\otimes B&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all possible ordered pairs where the first element comes from ''A'' and the second from ''B''; that is, 
:&lt;math&gt;A\otimes B=\left\{ (a,b)~\left| ~a\in A,~b\in B \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now that we have defined Cartesian Products, we can turn to the notions of ''binary relations'' and ''functions''. We say a set ''R'' is a ''binary relation'' from ''A'' to ''B'' if &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq A\otimes B&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R&lt;/math&gt;, it is customary to write ''xRy''.
If ''R'' is a relation, then the set of all ''x'' which are in relation ''R'' with some ''y'' is called the ''domain'' of ''R'', denoted dom''R''.
The set of all ''y'' such that, for some ''x'', ''x'' is in relation ''R'' with ''y'' is called the ''range'' of ''R'', denoted ran''R''.
A binary relation ''F'' is called a ''function'' if every element ''x'' in its domain has exactly one element ''y'' in its range such that ''xFy''. Also, if ''F'' is a function, the typical notation is &lt;math&gt;F(x)=y&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''xFy''.

There are a few special types of functions we should discuss.
A function &lt;math&gt;F:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''onto'' a set ''B'', or a ''surjective'' function from ''A'' to ''B'', if ran&lt;math&gt;F=B&lt;/math&gt;.
A function ''F'' is said to be ''one-to-one'' or ''injective'' if &lt;math&gt;a_{1}\in \text{dom }F,~a_{2}\in \text{dom }F,\text{ and}~a_{1}\ne a_{2}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;F(a_{1})\ne F(a_{2})&lt;/math&gt;.
A function that is both injective and surjective is called ''bijective''.

==Exercises==
If you can successfully answer the following problems, you are ready to study topology! Please take the time to solve these problems. 

# Prove that the empty set is a subset of every set.
# Consider the set &lt;math&gt;A_n=(-n,n)&lt;/math&gt; for each ''n'' in the set of natural numbers. Does the union over all &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; (for ''n'' in the set of natural numbers) equal &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; (the set of all real numbers)? Justify your answer.
# Using &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; from above, prove that no finite subset of &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; has the property that the union of this finite subset equals &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. Once you study topology, you will see that this constitutes a proof that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is not compact.

[[Image:SS-lyell.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Lyell was the author of ''Principles of Geology'', in which he introduced the theory of uniformitarianism.]]

'''Charles Lyell''' lived from 1797 to 1875. Throughout his life, his first love was geology. By using his studies of the Earth, Lyell was one of the first scientists to try and create a time scale for the history of the earth. 

His book titled ''Principles of Geology'' is thought to be one of the most important scientific books ever written because it proposed a way to study the forces that changed the geology of the earth by observing geology of the modern world. This directly contrasted the theories of catastrophism and supernatural occurrences. In this book, he introduced his theory of uniformitarianism. This is the idea that by using observations of current natural processes, we can predict how processes occurred in the past. In order to do this, we must accept that changes in nature occurring millions of years ago are similar to the changes that occur today. This idea of a uniform process of change is the basis of the theory of uniformitarianism. He also believed that each of these processes followed the already known natural laws. He thought that the changes the earth went through would continue on the same path throughout the rest of the existence of the earth. This theory is very important in the aspect that it can possible explain occurrences like mountain building, glaciation and volcano creation. 

Darwin was very impressed by Lyell’s geologic findings in Principles of Geology. He studied Lyell’s work as he traveled on the Beagle. As he explored the coastlines of South America, Lyell’s book had a great influence on how Darwin looked at the geologic aspects of the land. In turn, many of Darwin’s experiences and findings reinforced many ideas put forth by Lyell in Principles of Geology.

'''Teaching assistants in [[w:France |France ]]''' are non-nationals granted temporary work [[w:Visa (document)|visas]] to teach their native languages in French public schools. English, Spanish, Italian and German language assistants are the most common. 

This guidebook serves current, potential, and past teaching assistants in France. (For those of us who have already served our terms, helping those who follow can be therapeutic.) It strives to assemble in one place, and improve upon, information useful to assistants — perhaps to any foreigner living in the Hexagon.

In this guidebook you will learn about being an assistant: the application and acceptance process, the paperwork, teaching and eventually leaving. You will also learn about traveling on a budget in [[w:Europe|Europe]]. If any of its information has fallen out of date or is lacking, please do [[w:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|contribute]].

Currently, much of the information in this guide is geared towards American English assistants. Being a [[w:Wiki|Wiki]], we hope that it will grow to accommodate everyone in the program, eventually [[Wikibooks_portal|spanning languages]]. 

Add your name and contact info to the [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Teaching_Assistant_in_France_Survival_Guide/Directory Teaching Assistant Directory] (for all languages) if you'd like to get in touch with other assistants in your académie, or perhaps e-mail former assistants for advice.

Some teaching assistants in the program do not go to metropolitan France at all; they go to [[w:Département d'outre-mer|overseas departments]] such as [[w:Guadeloupe |Guadeloupe ]]. If you're one of them, you'll find this guide needs a whole new chapter: please write it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[General Relativity]]

A '''tensor''' is a powerfully abstract entity.  And while its abstractness makes it a somewhat difficult thing to describe, we can begin to get a feel for what a tensor is through a non-abstract example.

Suppose you are sailing.  The wind is coming from a certain direction and can be described as a '''vector''', a directional quantity.  Now there are many ways to represent this vector.  For example, you can represent it as a speed from a certain direction (&lt;math&gt;\vec w&lt;/math&gt;).  Alternatively, you can break it up into components and describe the vector as a combination of a certain amount of wind from the east and another amount from the south (&lt;math&gt;\vec w'&lt;/math&gt;).  But despite the different ways of describing this vector, there is still this underlying abstract thing &amp;mdash; the wind speed from a certain direction.

Now there is another important vector &amp;mdash; the force that the wind produces when it hits the sail.  If the direction of the force were always the same as the direction of the wind, then we could represent the relationship with a '''scalar''', which just multiples the wind vector by a constant factor to get the force vector.

However, life isn't that easy because the force is not always in the direction of the wind.  In fact it usually isn't.  So we can't represent the relationship between the wind and the force by a simple scalar.  However, there is one important useful fact that we can use &amp;mdash; the relationship between the wind speed and the force on the sail is (approximately at low speeds) '''linear'''.  That is, if you double the speed of the wind, you double the force.  The function that computes the force from the wind is a '''linear operator'''. The fact that this operator is linear lets us represent it in terms of a matrix, relative to a given basis:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T = \begin{pmatrix} x &amp; y \\ z &amp; v \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that just like you can change the way you represent the speed of the wind(&lt;math&gt;\vec w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec w'&lt;/math&gt;), and the force it produces (&lt;math&gt;\vec F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec F'&lt;/math&gt;), you can change the way you represent the operator that connects the two.  In fact, whenever you change the representations of the wind and the forces, you will have to change the matrix in order to talk about the same situation.  However, just like a vector is an abstract thing that can represent the wind or the force that the wind produces when it hits the sail, there is another kind of abstract thing that you can use to represent the relation between these things.  In symbols

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F = T \cdot \vec w&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F' = T' \cdot \vec w'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


That thing in the middle, that T, is an example of a tensor.  It is defined by the way in which &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; relates to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  Tensors are really abstract things, but we now can begin to see the power of this abstractness.  For one thing you can do algebra with tensors.  So, say instead of one sail T, you have two sails T and U.  We can represent the total force 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F = T \cdot \vec w + U \cdot \vec w&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now because T and U are matrices and are linear we can combine them to form a new tensor V.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F = (T + U) \cdot \vec w&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F = V \cdot \vec w \ \mathrm{where} \ V = T + U\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can also multiply two tensors together.  We have the force that the wind produces on the ship.  Now the force that the ship produces on the water, when wind is acting on ship with force &lt;math&gt;F_{wind}&lt;/math&gt; can be represent also as a tensor (the same way we did with wind, sail and ship):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F_{ocean} = W \cdot \vec F_{wind}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F_{ocean} = W \cdot V \cdot \vec w&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec F_{ocean} = X \cdot \vec w&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;where tensor &lt;math&gt;X = W \cdot V = W \cdot (T + U)\,&lt;/math&gt; characterizes ship and both sails.&lt;/center&gt;

== So what is a tensor? ==

Now that we have seen an example of a tensor, we can be more explicit
about what a tensor is.  A tensor is a '''linear function'''.  In the 
case that we described, a tensor takes a vector and turns it into another
vector.  We can be more general and talk about tensors that turn a 
vector into a scalar or a scalar into a vector.

At this point, you should get some sense as to why tensors are important
in general relativity.  General relativity is all about matter changing
the way that distances work.  How do you find a distance?  Well you take a
vector and put it into a function.  If the distance is short enough the
function is ([[w:Taylor series|approximately]]) linear, and you can describe it as a tensor.

== Special tensors ==

One special tensor is called the Kronecker delta tensor.  It is just the 
identity matrix. 

An identity is like 0 for normal addition (adding 0 to a number keeps it the same) and 1 for multiplication (multiplying a number by 1 gives the number itself).

The identity matrix is often represented by &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, where 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j = \left\{ 
\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; i = j \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; i \ne j \end{matrix}
\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Actually, the fact that &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt;  is actually a tensor (rather than just a symbol that has two indices) is due to the fact that a mixed tensor that has this as its components in any one coordinate frame, will have the same components in any frame! Technically, we call such entities numerically invariant tensors.

== Applications of tensors ==

Tensors are used in many places.

Apart from general relativity, tensors are used extensively in '''Continuum Mechanics'''. Tensors can be used to specify the stress at any point in the continuum. Such tensors are called '''stress tensors'''. The stress at any small surface (a tiny region around a point) in the continuum can be obtained by the matrix multiplication of this stress tensor and the unit vector (column vector) that is normal to the surface.

== General relativity in one page ==

There are two things that can be described with tensors.  

One is the curvature.  A tensor describes how much things are bent.  Using this tensor you can do things like calculate distances and angles, and figure out the shortest path through an area of space.

The second is stress-energy which is roughly how much energy and momentum exists in a particular location and what direction it is flowing in.

The basic equation of general relativity relates these two tensors. That's the basic idea.  Everything else involves just getting used to doing the math.

== Exercises ==

(Note: What I'd really like to do here is to have people add their answers to an answers page where they can see other people's answers.)

1) Describe an example of a tensor.

2) Suppose you have a situation in which the response of the sail to the wind is non-linear.  How can you describe this in terms of tensors?

3) Can pressure be expressed as tensor?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Statistics/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;


Statistics is a diverse subject and thus the mathematics that are required depend on the kind of statistics we are studying.  A strong background in [[Algebra#Linear_algebra|linear algebra]] is needed for most multivariate statistics, but is not necessary for introductory statistics.  A background in [[Calculus]] is useful no matter what branch of statistics is being studied.  

At a bare minimum the student should have a grasp of basic concepts taught in [[Algebra]] and be comfortable with &quot;moving things around&quot; and solving for an unknown.  
Most of the statistics here will derive from a few basic things that the reader should become acquainted with.

== Absolute Value ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|x| \equiv \begin{cases}
			x, &amp; x \ge 0 \\
			-x, &amp; x &lt; 0
		\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;


If the number is zero or positive, then the absolute value of the number is simply the same number.  If the number is negative, then take away the negative sign to get the absolute value.

=== Examples ===

*|42| = 42
*|-5| = 5
*|2.21| = 2.21

== Factorials ==

A factorial is a calculation that gets  used a lot in probability.  It is defined only for integers greater-than-or-equal-to zero as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n!  \equiv \begin{cases}
			n \cdot (n-1)!, &amp; n \ge 1 \\
			1,  &amp; n = 0
		\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Examples ===

In short, this means that:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
| 0! =|| 1 || = 1 
|-
| 1! =|| 1 &amp;middot; 1 || = 1 
|-
| 2! =|| 2 &amp;middot; 1 || = 2 
|-
| 3! =|| 3 &amp;middot; 2 &amp;middot; 1 || = 6 
|-
| 4! =|| 4 &amp;middot; 3 &amp;middot; 2 &amp;middot; 1 || = 24 
|-
| 5! =|| 5 &amp;middot; 4 &amp;middot; 3 &amp;middot; 2 &amp;middot; 1 || = 120 
|-
| 6! =|| 6 &amp;middot; 5 &amp;middot; 4 &amp;middot; 3 &amp;middot; 2 &amp;middot; 1 || = 720
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Summation ==

The summation (also known as a series) is used more than almost any other technique in statistics.  It is a method of representing addition over lots of values without putting + after +.  We represent summation using a big uppercase sigma: &amp;sum;.

=== Examples ===

Very often in statistics we will sum a list of related variables:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
	\sum_{i=0}^n x_i = x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Here we are adding all the ''x'' variables (which will hopefully all have values by the time we calculate this).  The expression below the &amp;sum; (''i''=0, in this case) represents the index variable and what its starting value is (''i'' with a starting value of 0)  while the number above the &amp;sum; represents the number that the variable will increment to (stepping by 1, so ''i'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, and then 4). Another example:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^4 2i = 2(1) + 2(2) + 2(3) + 2(4) = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that we would get the same value by moving the 2 outside of the summation (perform the summation and then multiply by 2, rather than multiplying each component of the summation by 2).

=== Infinite series ===
There is no reason, of course, that a series has to count on any determined, or even finite value—it can keep going without end.  These series are called &quot;infinite series&quot; and sometimes they can even converge to a finite value, eventually becoming equal to that value as the number of items in your series approaches infinity (&amp;infin;).

=== Examples ===

&lt;center&gt;
{|
| &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \frac{1}{1-r}, &lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\left| r \right| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

This example is the famous [[Wikipedia:Geometric series|geometric series]].  Note both that the series goes to &amp;infin; (infinity, that means it does not stop) and that it is only valid for certain values of the variable ''r''.  This means that if ''r'' is between the values of -1 and 1 (-1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; 1) then the summation will get closer to (i.e., converge on) &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; / &lt;sub&gt;1-''r''&lt;/sub&gt; the further you take the series out.

== Linear Approximation ==
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;


Let us say that you are looking at a table of values, such as the one above.  You want to approximate (get a good estimate of) the values at 63, but you do not have those values on your table.  A good solution here is use a linear approximation to get a value which is probably close to the one that you really want, without having to go through all of the trouble of calculating the extra step in the table.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
f\left(x_i\right) \approx \frac{f\left(x_{\lceil i \rceil}\right) - f\left(x_{\lfloor i \rfloor}\right)}{x_{\lceil i \rceil} - x_{\lfloor i \rfloor}} \cdot \left(x_i - x_{\lfloor i \rfloor}\right) + f\left(x_{\lfloor i \rfloor}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is just the equation for a line applied to the table of data.  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the data point you want to know about, &lt;math&gt;x_{\lfloor i \rfloor}&lt;/math&gt; is the known data point ''beneath'' the one you want to know about, and &lt;math&gt;x_{\lceil i \rceil}&lt;/math&gt; is the known data point ''above'' the one you want to know about.

=== Examples ===

Find the value at 63 for the 0.05 column, using the values on the table above.

First we confirm on the above table that we need to approximate the value.  If we know it exactly, then there really is no need to approximate it.  As it stands this is going to rest on the table somewhere between 60 and 70.  Everything else we can get from the table:

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
f(63) \approx  \frac{f(70) - f(60)}{70 - 60} \cdot (63 - 60) + f(60) = \frac{1.66691  - 1.67065}{10} \cdot 3 + 1.67065 = 1.669528
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Using software, we calculate the actual value of ''f''(63) to be 1.669402, a difference of around 0.00013.  Close enough for our purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At first glance, special relativity seems weird.  A number of
rules which we use to understand the world no longer apply.
These rules include the rule that velocities can be
added to each other, the rule that time and space are different
things, the rule that matter and energy are separate, the
rules for momentum.  Because we can no longer rely on our
normal intuition to figure things out, things can seem bizarre and confusing.

Fortunately, the apparent oddness of special relativity  
does not arise from deep complexity.  Underneath the surface,
there are some very beautiful simple symmetries and rules, and these symmetries and rules allow us to relate special relativity with the physics with which we are familiar, with only a few minor amendments.

Nevertheless, some of the ideas of special relativity seem so
contrary to the way that we naively expect that the universe ought to behave and to our everyday experience that a perfectly
natural reaction is that special relativity could be not
possibly be correct.  

However, numerous experiments have demonstrated that it's
not special relativity that is incorrect, but rather our
low speed intuition about how things should work.  
After all, we don't normally deal with things moving at 
close to the speed of light, and there is no particular reason
to believe that our low speed thinking applies at high speed.
And experiments clearly indicate that they don't.
Furthermore, it turns out that many ordinary phenomena
really are the result of relativity. Magnetism, for example, 
is a purely relativistic phenomenon that we see daily but which can't be properly explained without relativity.

But coming to this realization was difficult for physicists.
One way of intuiting special relativity is take the journey that physicists did.  We shall start with the ordinary everyday universe of classical Newtonian physics, which we studied in the previous two books, and then gradually travel out to the places which are odd.  We are helped in this journey by the fact that the road has already been travelled by generations of physicists who gradually came to the realization that the world was stranger than they had imagined.

Therefore, the approach we shall take is to first go down a short historical survey which illustrates why special relativity is necessary.  We shall then talk about the great conceptual breakthrough that Albert Einstein made, and then from the simple axioms that he figured out we shall see the subtle consequences that follow. We shall see too how straightforward special relativity really is, how simple at its heart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was one of the most influential individuals in the history of science.  Although he published a number of important works during his lifetime, he is best known for [http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/1228 ''The Origin of Species'' (1859)]. Although the idea that species evolve was not a new one (see [[Evolutionary Biology/Evolution before Darwin|Evolution before Darwin]]), it was not widely accepted in Darwin's time.  Aside from the enormous body of evidence that species in fact ''do'' change over time, in ''Origin,'' Darwin fully developed '''natural selection''' as the first plausible mechanism regarding ''how'' they change.  A great deal of Darwin's success arose from the details of his life, travels, and the circle of influential individuals with whom he associated.  

== Early Life ==

[http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/rdarwin.html Robert Darwin] (1766-1848) sent his son Charles to medical school at Edinburgh University when he was only 16 years old.  Charles found it boring, and withdrew at age 18, after which his father sent him to Christ College in Cambridge to study for the clergy.  While at Christ College, Darwin became interested in botany and insects, and he attended several botany lectures.  One of Darwin's teachers, John Stevens Henslow, launched Darwin's interest in geology.  Professor Henslow was known to teach his students to make careful observations of natural phenomena.  While enrolled at Christ College, Darwin found himself unfit for a life as a minister.

== HMS Beagle ==

The most important experience of Darwin's life was his trip aboard HMS ''Beagle'' as a naturalist, a person familiar with natural history, particularly in zoology and botany.  Darwin was not the top choice as a naturalist aboard the ''Beagle''; he was very fortunate to even receive this opportunity.  Robert FitzRoy, the captain of the ''Beagle'', initially asked Henslow, Darwin's professor, to be the naturalist of the ship, but Henslow's wife discouraged him.  Then, Henslow's brother-in-law was approached to replace Henslow, but he too rejected the job.  Finally, Henslow recommended Darwin as a well-qualified replacement.  Captain FitzRoy was originally cold to the idea of having Darwin on the voyage, but he ultimately decided that he would allow Darwin on the journey.  Darwin's position at first was the captains travel companion, since FitzRoy had already given a surgeon named McKormick the naturalist position.  McKormick, though, left the position soon after the ''Beagle'' departed England, leaving Darwin as the naturalist.

The ''Beagle'' left England in 1831, and it returned in 1836.  The overall purpose of the voyage was to map uncharted areas of the South American coastline. While aboard the ''Beagle'', Darwin read [[Evolutionary Biology/Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]]s ''Principles of Geology'' (1830). Lyell was a famous geologist and eventually became a lifelong friend of Darwin.  He developed the theory of uniformitarianism, which holds that the Earth is very old, and that geological changes are due to slow, continuous processes.  These processes, such as erosion and deposition, are constant.  Lyell's uniformitarianism view opposed the generally-accepted catastrophism view proposed by [[Evolutionary Biology/Georges Cuvier|Georges Cuvier]].  Catastrophism is the theory that changes in the earth are due to natural disasters.

== Later Life and Sickness ==

A month after returning to England, Darwin proposed to Emma Wedgwood, his first cousin.  On January 30, 1839, they got married.  Darwin became sick around this time.  He may have been infected by ''Trypanosoma cruzi'', a parasite prevalent in both Central and South America.  The infection causes [[w:Chagas Disease|Chagas' disease]].  Darwin showed many of the symptoms related to Chagas disease: flatulence, vomiting, palpitations, and insomnia.  Whatever sickness Darwin had, it caused him to stay near home for much of the rest of his life.  Darwin was not even able to attend his father's funeral due to the severity of his illness.  However, this sickness may have given him more time to read, think, and write.  He inherited a lot of money, and his wife brought a significant amount of money into the marriage, affording him additional time towards his studies.

== Basis of Evolution ==

From recovered notes, historians know that Darwin saw unique species of plants and animals in South America, such as finches and iguanas.  He noticed that organisms differed more as a function of geographic distribution than as a function of climate: the temperate South American animals more closely resembled the tropical South American animals than the temperate European animals.  Also, some characteristics of the fossils Darwin observed in South America paralleled some contemporary South American organismal features.
While on the Gal&amp;aacute;pagos Islands, Darwin had collected many species of finches.  

After returning to England, Darwin gave this collection of finches to John Gould, a man who studied birds.  Gould measured the differences in beak sizes of the finches, and his measurements showed great variances.  The sample included small, medium, and large beaks.  Darwin began to ponder how and why this diversity in the finches' beak structure took place.  He imagined that these changes within populations may better adapt them to their local environment.  He soon realized that adaptation and speciation were closely related.  A new species may develop as a result of slow, gradual adaptations, just as a big change in the Earth could occur from slow continuous processes.  Darwin thus began to formulate his theory of natural selection as the main process in evolution.
  
Almost a half century earlier, Robert Malthus had written ''An Essay on the Principles of Population'' (1798).  This essay explained that human growth rate is geometric whereas food production is only arithmetic.  Continuation of geometric human growth in this fashion leaves a huge discrepancy between food and population.  Darwin read this in 1838, and he pictured this discrepancy as a struggle for existence.  In most cases, the struggle for existence is not an obvious battle, and some may not even regard it as a struggle.  What actually takes place is an inheritance of favorable characteristics.  &quot;Favorable characteristics&quot; cause individuals to survive better.  Since they survive better, individuals that inherit favorable characteristics will gradually represent greater numbers in the population.  Darwin saw that eventually favorable characteristics would replace the unfavorable ones, and a new species would arise.

== Natural Theory and God ==

Before Darwin's publications, natural theology dominated.  Natural theology is the idea that God's plan can be known through human reason.  According to this logic, adaptation of any given organism is evidence that God intended the adaptation for a specific function.  Knowing that his theory would contradict the beliefs of natural theology and would cause anger once published, Darwin procrastinated publication.

Besides coming from religious individuals, strong beliefs came from scientific minds.  Those who did believe in evolution around Darwin's time thought that it occurred by the inheritance of acquired characteristics, a theory known as Lamarckism (proposed by [[Evolutionary Biology/Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]).  Lamarckism claims that the parts of the body that are used frequently during an individuals lifetime are exaggerated in the offspring.  This, however, was later proven false through genetics. The theory of &quot;Inheritance of Acquired Characters&quot; as it is called by scientific community was proved false by August Weismann, a German evolutionary theorist. Weismann cut the tails of lab rats over many generations but could not find any change in the length of the tails of new-born rats. He also concluded that piercing of ear pinna, wearing of tight clothes for a slimmer waist by women of middle ages, all carried out over generations doesn't change any of those characters during birth. The changes an individual makes to his body in his lifetime do not alter his sex cells. Only changes that affect the &quot;Germ Cells&quot; or sex cells of an individual in lifetime are inherited by the next generation.

== Origin of Species and Publication ==

Throughout his life, Darwin corresponded with scholarly groups, friends, and colleagues.  Lyell knew of  Darwin's ideas regarding natural selection, and suggested he publish them quickly.  Not long after, Darwin received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace, another British naturalist working in Southeast Asia.  Wallace wanted Darwin to review his work before publication.  As Darwin began to read, he was shocked to find that Wallace's theory was almost exactly the same as his own.  Initially, Darwin worked with Wallace, and in 1858, they publicly announced to the Linnaean Society of London the theory of natural selection.  Because Darwin had begun writing notes on his theory of natural selection on September 28, 1838, well before Wallace, and he had much more thoroughly explained it, he is credited for the theory of natural selection.

In 1859, the first edition of ''The Origin of Species'' was published under the name: ''On The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life''.  His theory of natural selection states that the individuals best adapted to their environment will produce the most offspring.  This will result in an increase in the proportion of individuals with the favorable genotypes.  Although this increase in favorable genotypes is the cause for natural selection, genetics was not well-understood until Gregor Mendel's paper, written in 1865, was re-discovered in 1900.

In ''The Origin of Species'', Darwin did not relate his theory of natural selection to humans because he knew it would cause even more outrage among his friends and family.  In addition to ''The Origin of Species'', Darwin wrote 19 other books, and he addressed human evolution in two of his publications late in his life: ''The Descent Of Man, And Selection In Relation To Sex'' (1871) and ''Expression Of Emotions In Man And Animals'' (1872).

== Effects ==

Darwin's observations, experiments, and theories affect many scientific fields, including ecology and geology.  Even modern day pesticide companies take Darwin's theory of natural selection into account when developing a mixture of chemicals targeted for a certain pest.  Knowing that natural selection will favor a pest with resistant genes and cause this chemically resistant pest to grow in proportion, developers periodically change the chemical composition. 

Darwin revolutionized the world of science with his publication of ''The Origin''.  His theory came to affect the entire culture because it was seen to question the very underpinnings of the worldview.  The debate continues even today as is seen with the creationism versus evolution controversy in some school systems.  Darwin's theory of natural selection unified biology, and he unalterably changed the world. The &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot; had profound effect on all other branches of science as well. It was for the first time during the course of scientific history, that science was separated from the concept of god/religion and was purely judged on the merits of experiment, observation and inference. In a way Darwin's theory provided complete freedom to science.

==Introduction to the History of Life==
It is very interesting that life began from simple chemical molecules. Starting from the formation of the universe from simple elements such as hydrogen and helium 13.7 billion years ago, until now, with ''Homo sapiens'' evolving and trying to expand its colony to a new planet, there is one great history of life. To understand those sequences in chronological order, it is important to understand the geologic time scale. There are two ways to represent geologic time: relative time, which deals with divisions and subdivisions of the Earth's geology in a specific order based on relative age relationships, and absolute time, which is usually obtained from [[w:Radiometric_dating|radiometric dating]] methods performed on igneous rocks, such as volcanic ash layers or lava flows, to determine numerical ages.

== Chemical Origins of Life ==

{{Wikipedia|Origin of life}}

The study of evolution is incomplete without first a consideration for the origin of life itself. Any theory of biology would be incomplete without a finite and irreducible origin. Life emerging from non-life, or &quot;abiogenesis&quot; is a tricky subject to study because scientists are typically divided as to what precisely constitutes &quot;life.&quot; In its simplest possible form, life consists only  of simple replicating chemical structures, such as amino acids and short RNA chains. These simple molecules are typically not what people think of when talking about &quot;life&quot;, although it does serve as a convenient starting point to further studies of evolution.

The atmosphere of earth was significantly different before the advent of living organisms. Without plants and a replicable process of photosynthesis, the atmosphere was almost completely devoid of oxygen. Nitrogen and Carbon rich compounds, such as ammonia and methane, were far more common in the environment then they are now. Combined with excess geothermal heat and lightning, it is hypothesized that genetic building blocks could have formed from these chemicals. 

=== Miller-Urey Experiment ===

=== Wächtershäuser's Hypothesis ===

Chemist Gunter Wächtershäuser put forth a similar hypothesis to Miller and Urey, except that instead of external energy sources of electric arcs and UV radiation, energy required by organic molecule synthesis could have come from redox reactions involving sulfides of Iron. This theory is consistent with the idea that life may have originated near hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. While Wächtershäuser's experiments did succeed in producing simple and more complicated amino acids, those acid chains were noted to hydrolyze quickly in the surrounding chemical environment.

=== Martin and Russell ===

Based off the Wächtershäuser hypothesis, William Martin and Michael Russell proposed that life could have had hydrothermal origins and microstructural origins. Ocean floor structures known as &quot;black smokers&quot;, which provide essentially a mostly-enclosed microcavern filled with iron sulfides would provide both the geothermal energy necessary by Wächtershäuser's hypothesis, but also the security necessary to prevent the amino acid chains from hydrolyzing. In such a black smoker, it is theoretically possible for the various components of life: DNA and RNA chains, protein synthesis, and enzyme interaction could have all formed simultaneously, without having first to develop a lipid cell membrane. The eventual synthesis of a lipid membrane, possibly as a lipid coating of the inside of the black smoker, would have enabled the new protocell to leave the black smoker and travel the ocean independently.

It is interesting to note that Archaea, simple single-cell organisms, can be found to live in black smokers. Some recently-discovered forms of bacteria have been found that utilize the faint light of the black smokers for photosynthesis, the first recorded case of photosynthesis occurring without sunlight.

=== &quot;Gene First&quot; and &quot;Metabolism First&quot; ===

There are two competing theories of thought as to the origin of life. The first theory, &quot;Genes First&quot; hypothesizes that self-replicating molecules such as RNA were created from simple amino acids, and later evolved into more complex replicating systems. DNA is not usually considered a candidate, since its replication and formation require the use of complex protein structures to facilitate those tasks, proteins which are unlikely to be produced through non-biological means. This theory suffers from the fact that RNA and similar amino acid structures are sensitive to UV radiation, and they are also prone to hydrolyzing. In essence, a bare RNA chain would have a difficulty surviving both in and out of the ocean.

In contrast to the &quot;Genes First&quot; theory, the &quot;Metabolism First&quot; theory speculates that enclosed environments with metabolic pathways existed first, and later served as a secure enclosed location for the synthesis of Amino acid chains. Alexander Oparin hypothesized that primitive chemical structures could have been self-replicating without the need for RNA or other amino acid chains. Some support for this theory stem from the fact that the Acetyl-CoA metabolic pathway utilizes Iron-Nickel-Sulfur compounds (key to Wächtershäuser's hypothesis) and catalyzes key components in a single, simple step.

A commonality between these two approaches is seen with a simple analogy. Consider a completed grocery list. The list, analogous to genetic material, conveys a description of the contents of a bag of groceries. The bag itself, however, contains the same vital information, by virtue of its contents. Whereas the list contains the information in a coded fashion, the full bag itself contains the exact same information in physical form. The &quot;metabolism first&quot; theory proposes that this &quot;full bag&quot; scenario is in fact simpler than requiring genetic information prior to the production and assembly of proteins. 

To further explain the &quot;Metabolism First&quot; theory, it helps to simplify what is meant by metabolism. In the simplest explanation, metabolism is the utilization of energy to construct more complex materials from simpler components. In the &quot;metabolism first&quot; theory, a boundary between the outside environment and the interior of the system is required. The abiosythesis of lipid bilayers similar to those found in the cell membrane of all living cells has been produced in the laboratory, though any physical means of separating the system from the environment at large would suffice. There must also be a source of energy to drive the reaction. This, according to many adherents, would be facilitated by what are known in chemistry as &quot;redox&quot; (an abbreviation of reduction/oxidation) reactions. When one chemical gains electrons, it is said to be reduced, the chemical losing electrons is said to be oxidized. Redox reactions occur in many current biological processes. It is responsible for the transfer of electrons in the light dependent phase of photosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria and all chloroplast bearing eukaryotes, and the absorption of oxygen in our hemoglobin. However, any source of energy could be a candidate for the earliest forms of energy consumption, including pH differentials, sharp temperature gradients, even radioactivity. 

Along with energy utilization, some mechanism of coupling must have existed in order to use the energy to drive further chemical reactions. Catalysts are chemicals that work as intermediaries between substrates and products. Consider hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide will break down into water and oxygen gas when mixed with a catalyst. The catalyst itself is not consumed in the reaction, but is able to continue functioning after the reaction has taken place. Depending on the substrate, any number of naturally occurring minerals and chemicals can act as catalysts. Catalysts serve to speed up chemical reactions. Hydrogen peroxide will spontaneously degrade into water and molecular oxygen, however, the presence of a catalyst speeds up this reaction to the point that it has been used a fuel source for torpedoes and even spacecraft.  With energy extracted from the environment, suitable substrates and a catalyst to speed up the reaction, energy storing intermediate materials could have been produced. These materials could later release their stored chemical energy to facilitate further reactions. 

Some form of cyclic reaction is established in the &quot;metabolism first&quot; scenario. Consider an organic substrate A. When A is catalyzed and energy is introduced, a new chemical B is produced. B can now be used to carry out further chemical reactions, utilized by C, D, and so forth. In the end, B is reconverted to A, closing the cycle. Cyclic reactions are favorable in this scenario, since the replenishment of A does not require the further extraction of the material from the environment. This ensures that the system will be able to continue to exist even if A becomes scarce in the environment. The increased complexity of a cyclic system also allows for adaptation within the system. If one of the further pathways (C, D, etc.) is adversely affected by environmental conditions, different pathways can be included or take the place of the non-functioning portion.

Finally, the system must have some means of growing and reproducing in order to be considered life. To grow, the system must gain materials faster than it loses it, either by diffusion into the surrounding environment, or through some other means, such as precipitation of waste materials. Reproduction can be achieved as an accidental process. Consider a &quot;compartment&quot; of some kind, like a bubble of wax in a Lava Lamp. Within the bubble, the network of pathways extracts energy from the environment, creates some system of reactions that produce more materials for the chemical pathways. The bubble expands with the increase of its contents. Environmental conditions such as current or temperature gradients cause the bubble to pinch off, creating two bubbles containing similar concentrations of materials. If the concentrations are adequate, two separate networks have been formed. These two networks can continue to grow and split off into further networks, allowing them to compete for resources in the environment. This competition for resources is the beginnings of Darwinian evolution. 

At some point in their evolution, these chemical networks must have made the leap from a content-based information storage to a coded form. As the networks grew in complexity, it would be more favorable to have some means of imprinting the necessary contents. A transferable coded form of information would allow a greater chance of sustainable systems to result from division of the parent system.

==Mesozoic Era (245 million years ago)==
The time period between 245 million years ago and 65 million years ago is called Mesozoic Era. Mesozoic Era is mostly known for many dinosaurs, which evolved in the Triassic and became very diverse in Jurassic Period. This Mesozoic Era lasted for about 180 million years and it is some times called the age of reptiles. Similar to the Paleozoic extinction, at the end of Mesozoic Era, dinosaurs became extinct. In this period, there were many changes to the terrestrial vegetation. For example, gymnosperms, such as conifers, were evolved in this Era and the earliest angiosperms were also diversifying in this Era. During Triassic Period, the first dinosaurs appeared. At this time, molluscs were the dominating invertebrates. In the Jurassic Period, many dinosaurs evolved and thrived. The first birds also evolved in this Period, of which the fossil Archaeopteryx is seen as an early example. For plants, the first flowering plant or angiosperms evolved together with gymnosperms. The Mesozoic Era ended with a large extinction of the dinosaurs. Mammalian creatures prospered after this.

==Cenozoic Era (65 million years ago until now)==
Compared to the other Eras that lasted for hundreds of million years, the Cenozoic Era spans only for about 65 million years. This era is divided into two major Periods; the Tertiary(now referred to as the Paleogene and Neogene) and Quaternary Periods. The Tertiary Period was when major radiation of mammals and birds occurred. Insects also predominated this Era. Similarly to the Mesozoic Era, angiosperms diversified. Around 35 million years ago, the first primate groups appeared. The first human-like apes appeared around 5 million years ago. The Ice Age marks the end of the Tertiary period and the beginning of the Quaternary period. As temperatures rose, extinctions were common. The Quaternary period is also known for evolution of Homo sapiens.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The next step on the road to relativity was the development of
the equations of electromagnetism by James Clark Maxwell.  One
direct consequence of these equations was the prediction of
electromagnetic waves, which were quickly identified with things
such as light.

One of the first difficulties of electromagnetic waves was the apparent lack of medium.  Unlike other wave phenomena, like waves on a string or ocean waves, physicists knew little of what was &quot;waving&quot; in the case of an electromagnetic wave.  To get around this difficulty, they just assumed that there was a medium filling all of space called the '''luminiferous aether''', in which electromagnetic waves propagate.

A second difficulty was that Maxwell's equations predicted that these electromagnetic waves always
traveled at the same speed ''c'', regardless  of the speed of the observer.  This immediately led to the question &quot;With respect to what?&quot;  Of course, the accepted answer at the time was with respect to the rest frame of the luminiferous aether, called the '''aether frame'''.  This was an attempt to salvage Galilean relativity, which requires the speed of the wave to depend on the observer.

The next advance came from people attempting to study the aether.

This section describes some of the details of the vi program itself (such as command line features), and other advanced vi features for aspiring vi power users. 

== Command line invocation ==

Different vi clones of course have different ways of starting the program (invocation). Usually, however, command-line versions of vi share a common basic set of command line options. These following command line options and flags are typically available. In addition, vi can be started under different names. Depending on the name used to start vi, it may either behave slightly differently or load a different vi clone.

&lt;!-- 
      
Using verbatim to format the options looks so ugly ... I revert that to definition lists, because

(a) These are the definitions of the options, and NOT examples which ares supposed to be typed verbatim

(b) This is how it is done in typical Unix, and therefor vi manual pages, too (when in rome, do what ...)

--&gt;

The common command line options and flags are

; -  
or 
; -s
: Suppress. All interactive user feedback is suppressed (not written to the terminal). This allows to pipe editing commands through the editor, and use it as a kind of stream editor. There are probably better streaming editor tools on Unix, like '''sed'''(1), '''awk'''(1),  or '''Perl'''(n). 

: Note, &quot;-&quot; is a common Unix notation to indicate standard input. It has been chosen as an alternative to &lt;tt&gt;-s&lt;/tt&gt; by the vi authors to provide a familiar look when piping commands. It does not really mean 'read from standard input' since vi does that anyhow.

; -C
: En''c''ryption. vi prompts the user for a key (a kind of password), and uses this key to encrypt its files before writing. It also uses this key to decrypt any file opened with vi. This feature is not supported by many clones, and the encryption algorithm is a very weak one (it is based on a 256-element one-rotor algorithm). The algorithm is easy to crack. It is compatible with the Unix '''crypt'''(1) command. See also &lt;tt&gt;-x&lt;/tt&gt;.

; -l
: (lower-case letter L) Change some default settings so they are more useful for editing LISP source code.

; -L
: (upper case letter L) Lists all files which have been saved during a crash. See &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt;, too.

; -r ''filename''
: Recover the file ''filename'' after a crash. Use &lt;tt&gt;-L&lt;/tt&gt; to get a list of files which can be recovered.

; -R
: Readonly. Files can only be viewed, not written.

; -S
: [[#Tags|Tags]] are not sorted. When a ''tag'' file is used, this flag tells vi that the tag file is not sorted, therefore vi will use a slower algorithm to look up tags. See &lt;tt&gt;-t&lt;/tt&gt;, too.

; -t ''tag''
: Edit (open) that file which contains the given ''tag''. This of course requires that a tag file (called ''tags'') is available.

; -v
: Start in visual mode. Only useful if the editor is started under the name '''ex''' and not '''vi'''.

; -V
: Verbose. Commands read via standard input are echoed to standard error. This is useful for debugging when the editor is used as a streaming editor. 

; -w''number''
: Window size. Set the editor's number of lines to ''number''. vi behaves as if the terminal has only ''number'' number of lines. This was used in the old days to speed up things when connecting via a slow terminal or modem line.

; -x
: Encryption. Similar to &lt;tt&gt;-C&lt;/tt&gt;. The difference is that vi tries to guess if a file that is opened needs decryption or not. &lt;tt&gt;-C&lt;/tt&gt; on the other hand always runs the decryption when a file is opened.

; +''command''
or
; -c ''command''
: Execute the command ''command'' before allowing the user to enter own commands. The most common usage is to use this to position the editor at some specific line in a file. E.g.

 vi +10 list.txt

: will open the file &lt;tt&gt;list.txt&lt;/tt&gt; and position the cursor at line 10. Another common usage is to specify a pattern:

 vi +/END script.awk

: This will open the file &lt;tt&gt;script.awk&lt;/tt&gt; and position the cursor at the first occurrence of the pattern 'END'.

As already mentioned, vi can be started using different names (all may not be available depending on the particular clone):

; vi
: The usual way to start vi.

; view
: vi starts in read-only mode.

; vedit
: A few settings are changed to better suit beginners: ''magic'' is cleared, ''showmode'' and ''novice'' are set, and ''report'' is set to 1.

; ex -v
: Same as just typing &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;

== Commands: Objects &amp; Operators ==
=== General ===

Until now, this tutorial has just talked about commands, and that commands can be used in conjunction with things like word counts. E.g. &lt;tt&gt;d2w&lt;/tt&gt; has been explained as the operator &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;elete applied to two words. Note the &lt;tt&gt;2w&lt;/tt&gt; part. You have learned that this part specifies to which text the operator should apply. And indeed, the &lt;tt&gt;2w&lt;/tt&gt; part specifies to which objects of the text (words, lines, characters etc.) the operator is supposed to be applied. And you have seen that the same object specifiers can be used with all types of operators - as long as the combination makes sense.

vi commands in fact follow a general schema. Commands are made up from operators and objects:

    [[''count''] '''operator'''] [[''number''] '''object''']

This means the ''operator'' should be executed ''count'' times on ''number'' of ''object''s. Almost all parts are optional. Also, some operators don't take objects at all. This operator/operation syntax is vi's heart. It is why people either love or hate vi. People love it, because it is such a simple schema. Once one knows the few operators (not more than ten), and a few of the objects one can be very productive in vi. People who hate vi simply can't get this schema, and the fact that there is a difference between command and insert mode, into their heads.

=== Objects ===

We told you that things like the &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; command moves one word. We actually cheated a little bit when telling you this. There is no such thing as a &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; command. &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; is an object specification, not a command. The object specification was given without an explicit operator like &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;. In such a case vi uses the implicit default operator. And that operator is ''move''.

Whenever you use an object specification without an  operator, the operator ''move'' will be used. Therefore, object specifiers degrade to move commands. The following is a list and summary of all object specifier. Logically, you can use them in conjunction with operators, or to move around if used stand-alone. You have seen a few of them already:

==== Paragraph, Section, Sentence Objects ====
; }
: Everything until next paragraph end.

; {
: Everything until previous paragraph end.

; ]]
: [Everything until next section end.]
; [[
: [Everything until previous section end.]

; )
: Everything until next sentence end.

; (
: Everything until previous sentence end.

==== Line Objects ====

; [''number'']G
: Everything until line ''number''. If ''number'' is omitted, last (not first) line in file. The first line can be addressed as &lt;tt&gt;1G&lt;/tt&gt; instead.

; [''number'']H
: ''number'' of lines after the first line currently on screen. If number is not given, the first line on the screen.

; [''number'']L
: ''number'' of lines before the last line currently on screen. If number is not given, the last line on the screen.

; M
: The middle line of the screen.

; j
: One line down from current line.

; k
: One line up from current line.

; _
: (underscore) The current line as a whole.

==== Positions within Lines ====

; 0
: (Digit 0). Backward to first column of line. Same as &lt;tt&gt;1|&lt;/tt&gt; (not &lt;tt&gt;0|&lt;/tt&gt;).

; ^
: Backward to first non-whitespace character.

; $	
: Forward to end of line.

; [''number'']|
: Column ''number'' of the current line. If number is not given, column 1 is used.

; t''char''
: Before the next appearance of character ''char'' on the current line.

; T''char''
: Backwards after the next appearance of character ''char'' on the current line.

; f''char''
: Next appearance of character ''char'' on the current line.

; F''char''
: Previous appearance of character ''char'' on the current line.

; ;
: Repetition of the last &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; command.

; ,
: Repetition of the last &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; command, but in opposite direction.

; +
or
; &lt;CR&gt;
: To the first non-whitespace character on the next line.

; -
: To first non-whitespace character on the previous line.


==== Word Objects ====
; w
: Forward to next begin of a word.

; e
: Forward to next end of a word.

; b
: Backwards to next begin of a word.

==== Character Object ====

; h
or
; &lt;BS&gt;
: Left character.

; l
or
; &lt;SPACE&gt;
: (lower-case letter L or space) Right character.


==== Pattern Matching Objects ====

; {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|}} : Forward to the beginning of the first match of pattern ''pattern''.
; {{Vi/RPattern|''pattern''|}} : Backwards to the beginning of the first match of pattern ''pattern''.
; {{Vi/key|n}} : Repeat the last &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;.
; {{Vi/key|N}} : Repeat the last &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; in opposite direction.
; {{Vi/key|%}} : To next matching (, {, or [.

=== Operators ===

The previously listed objects can be used as arguments to operators. If no operator is given, the default ''move'' operator is used. The number of operators in vi is surprisingly small - ten in total. Here is a list of the operators:

''needs better descriptions, a few of them are separately described later in this module''

==== Operators taking Objects ====
; c : change - change the addressed objects. In fact, the text is replaced by what is typed in.

; d : delete - delete the addressed objects. The deleted text is placed in the undo buffer.

; y : yank - copy the text of the addressed objects into the buffer.

; &lt; : shift left - object arguments can only be objects which address lines [[#Indenting and shifting|Indenting and Shifting]].

; &gt; : shift right - object arguments can only be objects which address lines [[#Indenting and shifting|Indenting and Shifting]].

; ! : ''bang'' filter-through - filter lines through an external program. Objects can only be objects addressing lines [[#Filtering|Filtering (stub)]].

==== Operators not taking Objects ====

r, s, 

; x : Delete character. Use the ''d'' operator for deleting other objects than characters. 

; ~ : Flip case of character at cursor position. An uppercase letter becomes its lowercase equivalent, and a lowercase letter becomes its uppercase equivalent.

==== Special Operator Forms ====

There are two special forms when typing an operator:

# Typing the character in upper-case, instead of lower-case. E.g. &lt;tt&gt;Y&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; , and
# doubling the character. E.g. &lt;tt&gt;yy&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;.

== 'Strange' lines on the screen ==

vi was written at a time when terminal or modem connections were slow. Therefore, vi used several optimisation techniques to limit the need for redrawing the whole screen. In such cases, vi used to display lines beginning with a special marker. Modern vi's seldom have the need for such performance optimizations any more, but they still have the habit to display such lines.

There are two special markers used:

 ~''line''
A leading '~' indicates that the line is past the end of the file (non-existent). This can be observed, for example, when vi is started on a new or empty file.

 @''line''
The line is only on the screen, not in the file. This happens for deleted lines. If ''wrap'' is enabled (the default), this also happens for lines that are too long to show on the screen all at once.

== Indenting and shifting ==

vi supports auto-indentation of text lines and also provides command for manual indentation. This is useful when editing program source code. It is a common convention in many programming languages to use indentation to increase readability of the source code.

=== Options ===

The option &lt;tt&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/tt&gt; (sw) determines how much space is used for indentation. E.g.

 {{Vi/key|ESC}}{{Vi/Ex|:set}} shiftwidth=4{{Vi/key|CR}}
or
 {{Vi/key|ESC}}{{Vi/Ex|:set}} sw=4{{Vi/key|CR}}

tells vi to use four spaces for indentation.

The option [&lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt;]&lt;tt&gt;autoindent&lt;/tt&gt; (ai) tells vi to use auto identation or not. Auto indentation is turned on by

 {{Vi/key|ESC}}{{Vi/Ex|:set}} autoindent{{Vi/key|CR}}
or
 {{Vi/key|ESC}}{{Vi/Ex|:set}} ai{{Vi/key|CR}}

And it is turned off by

 {{Vi/key|ESC}}{{Vi/Ex|:set}} noautoindent{{Vi/key|CR}}
or
 {{Vi/key|ESC}}{{Vi/Ex|:set}} noai{{Vi/key|CR}}

=== Command Mode ===

Shifting lines is done with the &lt; and &gt; commands. &lt; moves the text one &lt;tt&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/tt&gt; to the left (outdenting), while &gt; moves the text one &lt;tt&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/tt&gt; to the right (indenting). The number of lines which can be affected are specified in vi's typical way. However, only ''[[#Objects | objects]]'' which identify lines, and not ''objects'' which identify words or individual characters can be used.

E.g.

 &gt;G

moves all lines from the current line until the end of the file to the right.

Or

 &lt;}

moves all lines from the current line until the end of the paragraph to the left. Of course, the shift commands can be used in conjunction with &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;, which indicates the next opening bracket. E.g. to shift the lines encompassing the current cursor position up to the first line with a matching (, {, or [ to the left one would type:

 &lt;%

Like with all commands it is also possible to specify a line count:

; [''number'']&lt;&lt; 
or 
; &lt;[''number'']&lt;
: Moves ''number'' of lines, starting at the current line, one &lt;tt&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/tt&gt; to the left (outdenting). If ''number'' is not given, 1 is assumed - this leads to the shifting of the current line to the left.

; [''number'']&gt;&gt; 
or 
; &gt;[''number'']&gt;
: Moves ''number'' of lines, starting at the current line, one &lt;tt&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/tt&gt; to the right (indenting). If ''number'' is not given, 1 is assumed - this leads to the shifting of the current line to the right.

The &lt; and &gt; commands can also be used with a marker. In this case, the reference to the marker is placed between the two characters of the command:

; &lt;'m&lt;
: Shifts the lines from the marker ''m'' up and including the current line to the left.

; &gt;'m&gt;
: Shifts the lines from the marker ''m'' up and including the current line to the right.

=== Insert Mode ===
; ^t
: Moves ''shiftwidth'' to the right. Note, it is a common mistake to use the &lt;TAB&gt; key instead of &lt;tt&gt;^t&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;TAB&gt; inserts a Ctrl-I character and moves to the next multiple of ''tabstop'', and not to ''shiftwidth''. So &lt;TAB&gt; only works if ''tabstop'' and ''shiftwidth'' are set to the same value. 

: Since it is not a good idea to set ''tabstop'' to anything else than 8, &lt;TAB&gt; can only be used instead of &lt;tt&gt;^t&lt;/tt&gt; for indenting when ''shiftwidth'' is also set to 8.

; ^d
: In autoindent mode, backtabs one ''shiftwidth''. E.g. if autoindent is on, and one wants to enter the follwing text:

 if(true) {
     printf(&quot;done&quot;); // start sw indent
     return;
 } // bracket moved back to the left

:one would type

 if(true) {&lt;CR&gt;
 '''^t'''printf(&quot;done&quot;); // start sw indent&lt;CR&gt;
 return;&lt;CR&gt;
 '''^d'''} // bracket moved back to the left&lt;CR&gt;

There are some special variants of &lt;tt&gt;^d&lt;/tt&gt;, too:

; &lt;small&gt;^&lt;/small&gt;^d
: (the letter ''^'' followed by Ctrl-D). When this is typed first on a new line, all autoindent is killed (the insertion point is moved to the beginning of the line). Autoindent is then continued on the next line.

: E.g. to enter the following text when using autoindenting

         an indented paragraph
         another line in the indented paragraph
 .F roff formating commands have to start at column one with a '.'
         more text in the indented paragraph

one would type

 '''^t'''an indented paragraph&lt;CR&gt;
 another line in the indented paragraph&lt;CR&gt;
 '''^^d'''.F roff formating commands have to start at column one with a '.'&lt;CR&gt;
 more text in the indented paragraph&lt;CR&gt;

; 0^d
: (the digit ''0'' followed by Ctrl-D). Kills all autoindent (moves cursor to the beginning of the line), and leaves autoindent off, until text is once manually indented (using &lt;tt&gt;^t&lt;/tt&gt;).

: E.g. to enter the following text when using autoindenting

      INTEGER FUNCTION FAC(N)
      FAC = 1
      DO 100 I = 2, N
           FAC = I * FAC
 C
 C PROVIDE LABEL TO END LOOP
 C A HINT FOR THOSE GRASSHOPPERS: THIS IS FORTRAN CODE :-)
 C
 100  CONTINUE
      RETURN
      END
    
: one would type

 &lt;ESC&gt;:set sw=5&lt;CR&gt;
 o'''^t'''INTEGER FUNCTION FAC(N)&lt;CR&gt;
 FAC = 1&lt;CR&gt;
 DO 100 I = 2, N&lt;CR&gt;
 '''^t'''FAC = I * FAC&lt;CR&gt;
 '''0^d'''C&lt;CR&gt;
 C PROVIDE LABEL TO END LOOP&lt;CR&gt;
 C A HINT FOR THOSE GRASSHOPPERS: THIS IS FORTRAN CODE :-)&lt;CR&gt;
 C&lt;CR&gt;
 100  CONTINUE&lt;CR&gt;
 '''^t'''RETURN&lt;CR&gt;
 END&lt;CR&gt;

== Modelines ==

Modelines are lines in text files which are specially interpreted by vi when such a text file is opened. When the &lt;tt&gt;modeline&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;ml&lt;/tt&gt;) (in some version of vi also called &lt;tt&gt;modelines&lt;/tt&gt;) option is turned on (e.g. in the users &lt;tt&gt;.exrc&lt;/tt&gt; file), vi scans the first and last five lines of each opened file for text of the form

 ''unrelated text'' &lt;tt&gt;vi:&lt;/tt&gt;''command''&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; ''more unrelated text''

or

 ''unrelated text'' &lt;tt&gt;ex:&lt;/tt&gt;''command''&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; ''more unrelated text''

Each ''command'' from such lines is taken and executed as it would have been typed by the user. Any text in front of the modeline-marker (&lt;tt&gt;vi:&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ex:&lt;/tt&gt;) or behind the closing &lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; is ignored for the modeline interpretation. This can be used to place modelines in comments if they are used in some programming source code.

Here is an example Java source code file. It contains a modeline on the second and third line, in a Java comment:

 /* 
  * vi:set sw=4 ai:
  * vi:set showmatch: 
  */&lt;br /&gt;
 package gnu.freesoftware;
 public class Interpreter {
     public Interpreter() ...
          ...

When modelines are turned on, and this file is opened, &lt;tt&gt;shiftwidth&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;sw&lt;/tt&gt;) is set to 4, &lt;tt&gt;autoindent&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;ai&lt;/tt&gt;) is turned on, and the &lt;tt&gt;showmatch&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;sm&lt;/tt&gt;) option is turned on, too. There is no particular reason why two &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; commands on two modelines are used other than to demonstrate that all modeline commands found in the first and last five lines are executed, and not just the first.

Modelines can be used to play some practical jokes. E.g., a file with the modeline

 vi:q!:

immediately closes the editor and makes it impossible to edit the file as long as modelines are turned on.

Modelines get outright dangerous if they mess with system files. E.g., if the super user (administrator) of a Unix system has modelines turned on, and is tricked into opening a file with the following modeline, the important Unix password file is overwritten with the contents of the opened file:

 vi:2,$w! /etc/passwd:
 root:A shiny new root password:0:0:System Administrator:/:/bin/sh
 anotheruser:Another shiny new password:1:0:Just another user:/home/anotheruser:/bin/sh

Therefore modelines should only be turned on in a controlled environment. This is sad, since in principle it is a nice idea that files are able to provide the editor with a configuration best suited to edit that file.

There are some other problems with modelines. Classic vi versions always set a file's status to ''modified'' if they find a modeline, even if no editing in the file has taken place. This forces the user to leave the editor with &lt;tt&gt;:q!&lt;/tt&gt; instead of just &lt;tt&gt;:q&lt;/tt&gt;. If instead &lt;tt&gt;ZZ&lt;/tt&gt; is used to leave, the file is written. This causes tools like '''make''' to think the file has changed if it in fact hasn't.

== ''.exrc'' Configuration File ==

''This module is a [[#Power_Users|stub]]. You can help Wikibooks by [[Wikibooks:Find or fix a stub|fixing it]].'' For a start:

.exrc files are files containing vi (and ex) configuration data. The format of the data in such a file is that of ex commands, without the leading ':' (column). Typically, .exrc files are used to load some default mappings (map and map! ex commands) or define particular defaults. E.g. the following .exrc file would set autoindent and the shiftwidth when vi is started:

 set ai
 set sw=4

Normally, a .exrc file is placed in the user's home directory. Since the file name starts with a '.', the file is hidden under Unix-like operating systems. It is possible to place .exrc files in other directories, too. Vi can read the .exrc file in the current directory from which it is started. However, this feature is considered a security risk and turned off by default. It is considered a risk, because similar jokes can be played with .exrc files as with what has been described for modelines. The .exrc file in a user's home directory is considered safe, because on a correctly configured Unix system only the particular user should have write access to it.

There are three important things which should be observed when working with a classic vi and .exrc files:

#.exrc files must not contain empty lines. Classic vi chokes on these lines with all kinds of cryptic error messages.
#There is no official way to place a comment in .exrc files. However, since the beginning of time the following hack is used and is known to work: A line which starts with a &quot; (quotation character) is ignored by vi.
#Classic vi is very picky about map and map! commands. Definitions which by all means should work can trigger strange error messages. This is due to classic vi's limited parser and interpreter for such definitions. Spliting a map or map1 command in several smaller ones can sometimes help.

Many clones have relaxed these rules by allowing empty lines in an .exrc file, and by officially specifying the &quot; as the comment character. Also, good clones should have no problem with map or map! specifications.

 &quot;
 &quot; This is a comment in an .exrc file
 &quot; A .exrc file must not contain empty lines, so
 &quot; comment lines need to be used to separate entries

== Tags ==

=== Overview ===

Vi can use so called ''tag files'' (or ''tags'') to allow for quick navigation (jump) to &quot;interesting&quot; information in a set of files. The most common usage for this is to navigate within source code files. E.g. to jump from the usage of a certain function to the function's definition, possibly in another file.

The mechanism is relatively simple. You tell vi to go to a particular tag. vi looks up the file in which the tag can be found, opens that file and jumps to the location of the tag in that file. In order to find the file and position of a tag, vi consults a ''tag file''. A ''tag file'' contains an index of tags. A tag is an item (e.g. some programming language object) for which such an index entry can be found in a tag file. When vi is asked to jump to a particular tag, vi looks up the index entry for that tag, and uses the information to jump to the particular item.

In order to use this feature one first has to create a tag file, or a set of tag files, containing entries for all potentially interesting items. These tag file or files then need to be made known to vi - if the default file name is not used. This can e.g. be done by having appropriate commands in an &lt;tt&gt;.exrc&lt;/tt&gt; file.

Modern IDEs provide similar navigation features, but without the need to build a tag file separately. IDEs build the necessary index on-the-fly or use fast brute-force full-text search algorithms. The need for the extra step of creating a tag file for vi is annoying by modern standards. Still, vi's tag file system works and is usable.

=== Tag File Format, Creation &amp; ctags(1) ===

The creation of a tag file typically requires to use a tool which analyses the input text files (e.g. programming source code) and generates entries for each item of interest found in the input text file. The most common tool is called '''ctags'''(1) and is a standard Unix program. Several vi clones come with own versions of ctags, sometimes called differently. 

ctags knows the syntax of a number of programming languages and generates index information for items like function names, and macro definitions.

In case ctags is not available, or the available version of ctags does not support the programming language in use it is also possible to generate tag files with text processing tools like '''awk'''(1), '''sed'''(1) or '''perl'''(n) and some clever scripts, because tag files are ASCII files.

Typically an entry in a tag file looks like

  ''tag-name''&lt;TAB&gt;''file-name''&lt;TAB&gt;''ex-command''

; ''tag-name''
: The name of the item. E.g. a function name or macro name.

; ''file-name''
: The name of the file in which the ''tag-name'' item can be found

; ''ex-command''
: An ex editor command indicating how to locate the item in the file. This can be any ex command. But two types of ex commands make the most sense:
# In the simple form ''ex-command'' is a line number, which is indeed a valid ex command.
# Usually, however, it is a better idea to use a search pattern like &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;''tag-name''&lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;. This provides some flexibility if the file is edited later. It reduces the number of times the tag file has to be re-build, because something moved inside a file. ctags also mostly generates pattern search commands and not line numbers.

Typically vi clones allow for some extensions of this format. Check the particular documentation.

A tag file should be sorted in alphabetic order to speed up operation. If this can't be done, vi's [[#Command line invocation|-S]] command line option can be used.

It is usually not a good idea to generate tag files by manually running ctags or an own tool. Instead the building of tag files is usually better integrated into the software build system. For Unix this means using ''Makefiles''. Typically, the '''make'''(1s) targets for generating tag files are called ''tags'', because that's the name of the to be created tag file:

 # Makefile snippet
 SRCS = ... # all source code
 tags: $(SRCS)
         ctags -dt $(SRCS)

=== Ex Commands ===

By default, vi looks in a file called &lt;tt&gt;tags&lt;/tt&gt; for any tags. This file name can be changed with the following ex command. In fact, more than one file name can be specified. They are all loaded to find tags. The command is maybe best placed in a project-specific &lt;tt&gt;.exrc&lt;/tt&gt; file.

; &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;set tags=''filename''[\ ''filename ...]&lt;CR&gt;
: Set name of files which contain tag information. The syntax of the command varies a little bit from vi to vi version if more than one tag ''filename'' is supposed to be provided. Filenames have either to be separated by &quot;&lt;tt&gt;\ &lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (backslash space) or &quot;&lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (semicolon).

Naviation to tags can be done via the following ex command. There is also a vi command to do this.

; &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;ta ''tag-name''&lt;CR&gt;
: or
; &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;tag ''tag-name''&lt;CR&gt;
: Look up the ''tag-name'' in the tags file(s), open the file named in the index entry and execute the ''ex-command'' from the index entry. This effectively positions the user at the file and position where the symbol ''tag-name'' is defined. The command also remembers the current file and position on the tag stack.


== EX commands in vi ==
Ex is a line editor that serves as the foundation for the screen editor vi. Ex commands work on the current line or on a range of lines in a file.

''Syntax of Ex commands'' &lt;br /&gt;
''':[address] command [options]'''&lt;br /&gt;

':' specifies an Ex command.

'''Address''' &lt;br /&gt;
The 'address' specifies the lines number or range of lines that are the object of command.If no address is given,the current line is the object of the command.&lt;br /&gt;

Address Ranges can be specified by any of the following ways in Ex command syntax.

=== Vi Commands ===

Navigation to tags can be done via the following vi command:

; ^]
: Take the ''tag-name'' at the cursor position, look it up in the tag file(s) and navigate to it, similar to the &lt;tt&gt;:ta&lt;/tt&gt; ex command. The command also remembers the current file and position on the tag stack.

The following command uses the tag stack to go back to the previous position. Older vi's don't have it implemented:

; ^T
: Get the previous position and file from the tag stack and return to it. The data is removed from the file.

=== Command Line ===

Vi can also be started with a tag name instead of a file name. See the [[#Command line invocation|-t]] command line option.

== Shell escape ==

While one is working in vi there might arise a need to run another operating system command. In these modern days this is not a big issue. One can open another terminal window and do as pleased. However, this is not necessary when working with vi. Vi, like many of the older interactive Unix tools, contains features to run operating system commands or start a command line interpreter (shell) from within the editor. This dates back to the times when there were no graphical user interfaces and an editor like vi would take up the complete screen of the terminal (a real terminal of course, not a terminal emulation). Being able to run commands from vi spares one the need to first quit the editor just to look something up, e.g. in a manual page.

In addition, vi provides features to insert the text output of other commands directly into the text under editing.

=== Ex Commands ===

The editor commands to run another command from within vi are in fact implemented as ex commands. That is, they start with the familiar ':' in command mode.

To execute one command from within vi, one would type

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;!''command''&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;

At the end of the ''command'' one has to hit Return (the second &lt;CR&gt; shown above) to go back to vi. Vi then repaints the screen and continues where editing was left.

In order to repeat the last ''command'', one can simply type 

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!!&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It is possible to append to a previous command by using &lt;tt&gt;:!!&lt;/tt&gt;, followed by whatever should be appended. For example, the second of the following two commands

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!ls&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;
 :!! | more&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

is actually equal to

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!ls | more&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

(Note, '''ls''' is the Unix command to list a directory, '''more''' is the Unix command to paginate output, so it doesn't just scroll off the screen).

Once something is appended to a command, it becomes part of the last remembered command. So in the example above, another

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!!&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

would be equal to

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!ls | more&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

and not

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!ls&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Two placeholders can be used in shell escapes to denote the current file name or the name of the previously edited file name:

; % :is a placeholder for the current file name, 
; # :is a placeholder for the previously edited file name.

For example, if one is editing some shell script and wants to try it out, one could type the following commands to save the file (&lt;tt&gt;:w&lt;/tt&gt;), set the file's attributes to executable (&lt;tt&gt;!chmod ...&lt;/tt&gt;), and run it (&lt;tt&gt;!%&lt;/tt&gt;):

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 :!chmod 755 %&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;
 :!%&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If the file's name is, e.g. ''script.sh'', the above would be equal to typing

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 :!chmod 755 script.sh&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;
 :!script.sh&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;


Instead of running a command from within vi it is also possible to start the shell from within vi. vi has an own command for this, which looks up the user's default shell (e.g. the Bourne shell or the C shell) and starts it. It is important to note that a new shell is started. The user is not returned to the shell from which vi was started. The command is called '':sh'', and it can be used as it follows:

 &lt;ESC&gt;:sh&lt;CR&gt;
 $ #''shell commands, when done exit shells:''
 $ exit&lt;CR&gt;

=== Vi Commands ===

It is possible to filter all or parts of a text currently under editing through an external program. The original text is then replaced with the output of the external command.

The classic example for this feature is the usage of the Unix text formatter '''fmt'''. vi itself doesn't have any specific formating capabilities, however, by running the text or parts of it through an external formater from within vi, the desired formatting is easily achieved.

The vi command for filtering text is &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; (note, as opposed to the ex shell escape command, there is no leading &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;). &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; follows the usual vi command format. So one can specify the scope to which it should apply. E.g. &lt;tt&gt;!!&lt;/tt&gt; means to filter the current line, or &lt;tt&gt;!}&lt;/tt&gt; means to filter the current paragraph.

The &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; vi command has to be followed by by the name of the external program to be used for filtering. E.g. in order to format the current paragraph with the already mentioned Unix text formatter '''fmt''', one would type

 !}fmt&lt;CR&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used to just insert the output of some external command into the currently edited text. To do so, one would first create a new empty line (e.g. with &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;), and then use &lt;tt&gt;!!&lt;/tt&gt;  to replace the empty line with the output of a command. For example,

 o&lt;ESC&gt;!!ls&lt;CR&gt;

would include a listing of the files in the current directory into the text under Unix.

== Execute command from Buffer ==

''This module is a [[#Power_Users|stub]]. You can help Wikibooks by [[Wikibooks:Find or fix a stub|fixing it]].''

; @''b''
: Execute command stored in buffer ''b''.

== vi for Programmers ==

Classic vi provides a number of features which are useful for programmers. Vi was made by programmers for programmers -- but at a time when programming was different. Classic vi's programming support is, by today's standards, not too great, but of course still usable. And it is still more convenient to use vi for editing programming code than any of the ''...pad'' editors like '''notepad''' (Windows) or '''dtpad''' (CDE/Motif). vi probably works best on Unix systems due to the many text filters that come with Unix and the ease with which additional special-purpose filters can be scripted.

Useful features in vi for programmers are:

=== Autoindent and manual Shifting of Lines ===

See [[#Indenting and shifting|Indenting and shifting]]

=== Modelines ===

Modelines to set per-language defaults - if security is not an issue (see [[#Modelines|Modelines]])

=== Tags for Navigating ===

See [[#Tags|Tags]]

=== Shell Escapes ===

See [[#Shell escape|Shell escape]]

* One way to use shell escapes is to run a ''makefile'' or the compiler from within vi. It is in general a good idea to first save the current file before trying to compile it:
 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!make&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 ''or''
 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!cc %&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 ''and afterwards''
 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!!&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* Another way is  filter source code through an external command, e.g. through a comment-reformator for the specific language. For example, the following command will filter the current paragraph through a external comment-reformator called '''recomment''' (not a standard Unix program, but available as a separate script).

 &lt;nowiki&gt;!}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''recomment''
: See [http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3/split/recomment] for the '''recomment''' script for Unix.

=== Editing multiple Files ===

vi can be started with a list of files:

 vi file1 file2 file3 ...

Combined with other Unix features, like file matching, this can be a powerful feature. E.g. to open all C source code, including header files in a directory (.h), the following command can be used:

 vi *.[ch]

Or to find all files which contain a certain keyword and open them, something like

 vi `grep -l Keyword *.txt`

can be used.

Once vi has been started with a list of files it is possible to navigate within the list with the following commands: 

; &lt;nowiki&gt;:n&lt;/nowiki&gt; : next - Move to the next file in the file list
; &lt;nowiki&gt;:rew&lt;/nowiki&gt; : rewind - rewind the file list and open the first file in the list.

vi clones like vim typically provide more commands, e.g. to go back one file in the file list.

=== Flip between two Files ===

* Flip between two files using &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; as the name of the last file. E.g. to flip between a C source file and the corresponding header file.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:e x.c&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:e x.h&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
 ''some changes to x.h, then going back to x.c''
 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:e#&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* Flipping between two files using &lt;tt&gt;CTRL-^&lt;/tt&gt;. This is one of the forgotten vi commands.

=== The '''error'''(1) Program ===

The '''error'''(1) program on Unix can be used to capture error messages from compilers and later jump from error message to error message in the editor. '''error''''s way of working is archaic. It parses error messages from the compiler and inserts them as comments into the source file in which the compiler detected the error. Since '''error''' marks error messages with &lt;tt&gt;###&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;%%%&lt;/tt&gt; in the source file, navigation can be done with vi commands like &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt;.

There are two common ways to use error with vi:
# From outside vi and letting error start vi. error can start vi on all files which produced an error during compilation, using the &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt; flag:
 $ cc *.c 2&gt;&amp;1 | error -v
 # Notes:
 #  cc    - the C compiler
 #  *.c   - all C files in the current directory
 #  2&gt;&amp;1  - Standard error output is redirected to normal standard output
 #  |     - the output is feed to error as input
: 2. From inside vi, on the current file. First the file is saved, then it is tried to compile it, processing potential error messages with '''error''', then the potentially changed source file is re-read (&lt;tt&gt;:e!&lt;/tt&gt;), and finally the first mark is searched with &lt;tt&gt;/###&lt;/tt&gt;:
 ''first time''
 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!cc % 2&gt;&amp;1 | error&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:e!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
 /###&lt;CR&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 ''and afterwards''
 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:!!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:e!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;
 /###&lt;CR&gt;

; Note&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; : '''error''' is a horrible kludge and can really mess up source code and a version control system! We recommend you try it at least once and form your own opinion. Also have a look at error's man page first. vi clones like vim provide a much more sensible system. Here the editor executes the compiler (or '''make'''(1s)) and captures the output of the compiler. The information is recorded in an error message file by vim. vim then allows to navigate the source code by extracting file names and line numbers from the error message and jump to these positions. This is the same mechanism as provided by IDEs.

=== Macros &amp; Shortcuts ===

vi's provides the &lt;tt&gt;:map&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:map!&lt;/tt&gt; commands to define useful shortcuts and macros, and &lt;tt&gt;ab&lt;/tt&gt; to provide abbreviations.

: ''Todo: Provide a few such macros?''
 qqI//&lt;Esc&gt;jq
 places a comment at the beginning of a line and moves down
: ''Is this (above) what you mean by macro?''

== nroff/troff Typesetting Support ==

=== Overview ===
vi provides support for editing text files for the Unix typesetters '''nroff''' and '''troff'''. The most &quot;common&quot; usage for this typesetter these days is probably to write manual (man) pages for Unix applications.

The support for writing nroff/troff input text files is always active, there is no special vi mode or option which needs to be turned on. Already from this it can be concluded that there aren't too many nroff/troff specific operations in vi. In fact, vi just provides simple ways to navigate between nroff/troff paragraphs and sections. Nevertheless, these features help when editing nroff/troff files.

nroff's/troff's text file format is simple. Normal text and macros are mixed, where macros indicate how the text should be formatted. A macro starts with a '.' in column one, followed by a one or two letter macro name followed by optional macro arguments. A typical nroff/troff text file with some macros might look like:

 .SH &quot;A SECTION HEADER&quot;
 Some text making up the first paragraph in the section.
 More text in the paragraph.
 .PP
 A new paragraph has been started.
 More text in this second paragraph.
 .PP
 Yet another paragraph.
 .\&quot;
 .\&quot; A comment infront of the next section header
 .\&quot;
 .SH &quot;SECTION HEADER 2&quot;
 Paragraph text.

To simplify navigation in such a text file vi knows the common macro names for sections (the &lt;tt&gt;.SH&lt;/tt&gt; in the above example) and paragraphs (the &lt;tt&gt;.PP&lt;/tt&gt; in the example) and provides commands to move to the next/previous section. The list of macro names is configurable in vi.

Several of the common vi features also help when editing nroff/troff text. E.g. shell escapes to run the typesetter from within vi. The following will format the current file with the manual page macros:

 &lt;ESC&gt;:w&lt;CR&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;!nroff -man % | more&lt;CR&gt;

=== Options  ===

The following options are used to define the nroff/troff macro names as known by vi. Like all options, one changes them by using the &lt;tt&gt;:set&lt;/tt&gt; ex command:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;set ''option''[=''value'']

;sections :List of macro names which vi interprets as section delimiters. Two consecutive characters in the list form one macro name. Typically, vi's default contains &lt;tt&gt;.SH&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.NH&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.H&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;.HU&lt;/tt&gt;. So the ''sections'' option reads like

 sections=SHNHH HU

;paragraphs :or
;para :List of macro names which vi interprets as paragraph delimiters. Two consecutive characters in the list form one macro name. vi's default typically contains &lt;tt&gt;.IP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.LP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.PP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.QP&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.PL&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.Ib&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.p&lt;/tt&gt;. So the ''paragraphs'' option reads like

 paragraphs=IPLPPPQPPLIbp

=== Vi Commands ===

When in command mode, the following commands relate to working on nroff/troff text:

;[[ :Moves to the previous section.

;]] :Moves to the next section.

;{ :Moves to the previous paragraph.

;} :Moves to the next paragraph.

And, for completeness:

;( :Moves to the previous sentence.

;) :Moves to the next sentence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Special relativity isn't that odd. Telling people it is only puts them off, and makes it harder for them to learn what is really quite simple.

We should try to sound reassuring, not scare the readers away. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 12:40, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)
--------------

Actually my teaching experience has been the opposite:

1) People are more interested in odd things.  Also there is a 
big difference between odd and simple.  

:Mildly odd things, which they can understand without too much effort, then move on to the next curiosity. I've put titbits in the earlier sections to quirk peoples curiosity, and encourage them to read further, but it's important not to overstate the problem, or people will be put off. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

2) The biggest problem I've found in teaching special relativity
is that people try to use their normal intuition, and this causes
confusion.  A blunt statement that your normal intuition about velocities won't work, helps a lot.
[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 14:43, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:Blunt, to me, tends to convey the message, &quot;if you don't like this, get lost.&quot; I'd rather aim for a ''clear'' but ''gentle'' statement, which tries to avoid discouraging anyone. Repeat the first few time that &quot;classical physics gives ''this'' result, but that isn't quite right. The real answer is ''this''&quot; and I find people get the message.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I find the first example of summation confusing. I presume that in the rest of the book, the spatial part of the product will have negative signs. Maybe the expansion into component should be avoided at this point?

Bartosz, 16:54, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)


Please clarify what is confusing and I will try to fix it.  As far as the spatial parts having negative signs, I am using the standard of giving the Minkowski metric a signarure of &lt;math&gt;(-+++)&lt;/math&gt; (go to the main GR page and then go to the discussion-read the note about standardizing notation).  So the time component will inherit the negative sign and the spatial part will have positive signs.  However, in the first example in this section, the metric does not come into play (it is just a summation of numbers).  -[[User:Lathem|Lathem]]

== Greek vs. Roman indices ==

Probably it's a good idea to include a comment in this section about the difference between Greek indices and Roman indices (one ranges from 0 to 3, the other from 1 to 3).

* I agree completely; done.

-[[User:blathem|blathem]]

== Identities ==

Could someone explain the derivations of the identities in the last section?

Also, why are both indicies in the Kroenecker delta written subscript?

__________

I actually disagree with the first identity; if i=k, but i≠j, then you have &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j\delta^j_k = (0)(0)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_k=1\,&lt;/math&gt;. It's true otherwise, however, by transitivity. And if it is using summation notation -- which, by the way, isn't exactly clear atm -- then the above case is the only case when it's true, and it seems false otherwise. Maybe someone can clarify/correct me? Anyway...
The second identity is just the sum of the main diagonal.
The differentiation identities say: the partial derivative of any tensor component with respect to itself is 1, and with respect to any other component is 0.
Not sure how to include the explanations on the main page, but I'll leave this up here for now.

P.S. I fixed the indices. [[User:Luolimao|Luolimao]] ([[User talk:Luolimao|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Luolimao|contribs]]) 23:54, 3 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Assistant in France Applications.jpg|thumb|Some of the program's paperwork]]
Almost everyone who applies to the Assistant program is accepted. The only real criterion is that you are a native speaker of your language. This is not to say that the application process is easy, especially if you are unfamiliar with French paperwork. Don't be discouraged if there are parts of the application you do not understand. Ask your French teacher for help, or ask on the discussion page.

Note for those applying from the United Kingdom: The easiest route is via the British Council Assistantship Scheme, this requires no french paperwork. It is also worth noting are now entitled to an ERASMUS grant from the EU if you are applying through a UK University (and you are of EU nationality). This grant can be worth a lot of money, so it is well worth finding out more about it.

==Technical details==
[[Image:Assistant in France Form.png|thumb|150px|left|Application form]]
The American version of the application, which is mostly in French but has some instructions specific to American assistants, is available at the [http://www.frenchculture.org/education/support/assistant/ French culture] site. 

The file is in Microsoft Word format, and it is possible to fill out almost the entire form on your computer. It's best to print the completed application in [[w:A4|A4]] size paper if you can find it; otherwise it will be shrunk to fit American paper's dimensions.

You will need a passport sized ID photo to attach to the application. Shop around a bit for these (drugstores, photo labs, copy shops…), as their prices are often unreasonable. Look for eight or more for less than $10 — you will need more photos for paperwork before and after you get to France. Remember that French passport pictures are 35mm by 45mm, not the American 2 by 2 inches. It's ok to have an American one for the application, but for later photos, they have to be French sized.

==Regions==

On page 10, the application asks for your “preferred geographical location.” You are allowed to specify three ''académies'' in order of preference — these educational divisions correspond with the [[w:List of regions in France|administrative regions of France]]. All of them are large, and you will have no opportunity to make your request more precise. Many assistants request the [[w:Paris|Paris]] ''académie'' — dreaming of a glamorous life in the [[w:Le Marais|Marais]] — but are placed in some scary Paris suburb. 

It's best to find an entire region that might be interesting to you. If you like mountains, select a region near the [[w:Pyrenees|Pyrenees]] or the [[w:Alps|Alps]]. If you are attracted to [[w:Italy|Italy]], [[w:Spain|Spain]], [[w:Germany|Germany]], [[w:Belgium|Belgium]], [[w:Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] or [[w:Switzerland|Switzerland]] in addition to France, select a region close to the particular border. If travel is important to you, make sure you select a region that is well serviced by the [[w:SNCF|SNCF]] (the railway).

Another consideration to take into account is the size of town/city you will be placed in. If you're placed in Paris or any other major metropolis you'll have a ready circle of fellow assistants. However, you can also be placed in a tiny village where you're the only language assistant (which can be lonely). There are three checkboxes for specifying the size of town/city on the application, from a rural town to large metropolis.

Here is a link to a well-detailed [http://web.archive.org/web/20020206230329/http://www.quid.fr/france.html?zoom=2 map] of France.

Also, here are links to downloadable maps of the [http://membres.lycos.fr/cartesferro/ train network] and TGV routes.

==School level==

You also must select what level of school you would like to work in. Different levels of school have different contract lengths. IUFM assistants work for 6 months; high school assistants for 7 months.  Primary assistants have two options: a contract of 7 months where they work along side a French teacher, or a contract of 9 months where they are expected to plan the lessons and lead the class by themselves.

High school assistants generally speak much less French with their students and much more of the language they are teaching. If you teach in primary schools, you're likely to spend most of your 12-hour week speaking French (which can be good practice). Some high school assistants receive very little guidance from the teachers. It is not uncommon for a high school assistant to get nothing but a key to a classroom and a schedule of when they need to be there. It all depends on the individual school and the teachers there.

==Acceptance==

Your first acceptance letter (the ''lettre de présentation'') only tells you which ''académie'' and school level you've been placed in, and it can come as late as mid-summer if you have previously been wait-listed (as of the 2011-12 application cycle, ''most'' acceptance e-mails seem to have gone out  by late May for applicants chosen in the first 'round' of selections). Shortly afterwards, you'll receive an ''arrêté'' (administrative order) telling you in exactly which schools you've been placed.  The ''arrêté'' can arrive as late as mid-August, so if you're still waiting on it as summer goes on, don't panic (yet)!   Usually the TAPIF office in Washington, D.C. asks that participants who have not received ''arrêtés'' by mid-August contact them, so that they can try to track it down or at least help assistants determine the best course of action to try and get their visas and arrive in France on time.  (NB: The most recent Assistant Handbook states that questions regarding the whereabouts of ''arrêtés'' will NOT be addressed before mid-August, so as hard as it might be to wait, hold off on e-mailing the program coordinator until that time. Chances are it IS on its way.)

If the first letter mentions “[[w:Toulouse|Toulouse]],” however, don't start looking for apartments in Toulouse. Each ''académie'' is named for the largest city in the region, but only a few of the assistants in each ''académie'' will actually be assigned to schools in this 'capital' city.  It is therefore best to wait until you get your specific placement to search for housing. Do, however, [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide/Preparation#Airplane tickets|start looking for plane tickets]].

[[Image:Dive.jpg|thumb|250px|Diving in]]
After you've received your letter of acceptance and decided once and for all to ignore the objections of your friends and family, it's time to prepare for your year abroad. 

==Travel dates==

Before you buy tickets, you will need to decide if you want to travel around Europe before your assistantship. Although you may be anxious to tour the continent, there are a few reasons you may want to wait:
* Your baggage for the full year is more than you will want to lug around Europe.
* You will be living off your savings until the end of October when you receive your first salary payment.
* You'll want to travel again during the two-week long ''toussaint'' vacation at the end of October.
* You will need to have your arrêté de nomination and get your visa at your home (US) consulate before leaving.

If you aren't travelling beforehand, you should schedule your arrival for a few days before your contract begins. You should plan on returning from France  at least a few days after the end of your contract to make sure you receive your last paycheck.

==Airplane tickets==

If you are not coming home for winter vacation, it may be cheapest to buy a single round trip ticket for earlier than you expect to return and then just change it once your return date is available on the airline website (depending on the airline, 9-11 months in advance.) Another possibility is to buy two roundtrip tickets and to not use the return on either of them (one-way tickets are almost always more expensive). It's difficult and expensive to find a plane ticket with a return longer than nine months, and “open return” tickets are even worse. In most cases you will be better off buying the cheapest ticket you can find for your arrival window. Having a return date that you may use to “bail out” after a month or two is not a bad idea either.  StudentUniverse.com and BT-Store.com both offer cheap options for one-way tickets (just over half the cost of a round trip ticket).  Better yet, buy a flexible ticket from statravel.com if it's not too much more expensive.  You can't always book tickets more than six months in advance (and almost never more than 11 months), so you'll have to buy an early return ticket.  But after a few months you'll be able to reschedule for April, May, or June for only the change fee ($50-$300 plus the difference between the original return flight cost and the cost of your new return flight. Keep in mind that the cost difference can be substantial, sometimes around $200 extra.)

Remember that there are several large airports in France. You can fly into Paris, Lyon, Nice, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and a few others. It's often not much more expensive to fly all the way to your region. Check train schedules and prices before you buy your plane tickets. If your academie is located near airports in another country, consider flying there instead. Flights to Brussels or Frankfurt, for example, are sometimes less expensive than flights directly into Paris.

Also, look into [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/promotion-train/TGV_Prems_a_reserver_a_lavance.html Prem's fares] out of Paris. These are cheap train tickets that can be purchased from two weeks to two months in advance. It might be cheaper for you to fly into Paris and take a train. A Prem's fare from Paris to Toulouse or Nice can be as low as 25€.

==Packing==

It is hard to pack for a year in a foreign country. A rule of thumb is to lay out everything you think you need, and then get rid of half of it. Avoid bringing heavy things. Avoid bringing too much clothing. Remember that you're bound to buy quite a bit while you're in Europe. France has big, government-regulated sales two times a year (''les soldes''), in mid-January and early July, and are usually four to six weeks long.

If you have a digital camera, bring it. If you don't have one, and you can afford it, buy one (try [http://www.overstock.com Overstock]). Film is expensive in France, and you'll want to take a lot of pictures of your travels and your friends. Also, MP3 players pack much better than your CD collection. Bring your mobile phone if it is [[w:Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM 900/1800]] (not 1900) and will work in Europe, but leave its power adapter unless it is international (230V, you can easily buy an adapter in France for most phones). To use your GSM phone with a local subscription make sure it is not SIM-locked or network/operator locked. Don't use your US subscription, the roaming surcharge will cost you an arm and a leg, and the rest of your body. Get, for example, a prepaid local SIM card/subscription.

Be careful with WLAN equipment. France does not allow the usage of all WLAN channels in all locations or with the full transmission power or at all. The US FCC approval means nothing in France. And, at least in 2002, outdoor usage of WLAN equipment required a special license not to be issued to private persons. Make triple sure your equipment is legal in France, because some of the WLAN frequencies are used by the French military, and you might get in real serious trouble. 

Here is a list of things that are more expensive or harder to find in France:

# Dental floss
# Sunscreen
# Peanut butter
# Electronic equipment
# Underwear
# Contact lens solution
# Over-the-counter medication (especially antacid)
# Blu-tack (and it's not blue here, it's yellow - le tac patafix!)

Not only is underwear expensive, but so is laundry. The more socks and underwear you have, the less often you'll have to go to the laundromat.

Bring as little as possible, because without a doubt you will bringing back much more. There is no reason to bring a heavy journal or a photo album with you. Think practically. Once you think you've packed, try walking around the block with everything. If it's too much to handle, you're bringing too much. You might be alone on a train or a bus somewhere in France. You'll be tired and hungry and it might be hot.

Do not bring your leather jacket. It rains most of the winter.

Teaching materials to bring (use your own judgment):
# Maps (one of your country is helpful), pictures, info about your hometown
# Photos of you and your family
# Restaurant menus, recipes, brochures, travel stuff about your country
# Magazines (ie Teen People, teen magazines)
# Popular music, especially with easy to understand lyrics
# High school yearbook (or copies of some pages)

You will be able to get plenty of information and lesson plan ideas over the internet, so don't overdo it, but it's always helpful to have props to use, no matter what you're teaching.

==Making contact==

Over the course of the summer you will likely receive further correspondence from your ''académie'', some of it possibly from the establishment or school system where you'll be working. If someone is taking care of your lodging, this will likely be indicated.

In late August or September, someone from your school system may contact you by email to help arrange your arrival. If you don't hear from anyone, start trying to make contact yourself in September. The correspondence that you received earlier likely contains some email addresses; as much as they love paperwork and paper mail, everyone in the school administation has email. Making arrival arrangements by international post is expensive, slow, and unnecessary.

Be persistent! It's reasonable for you to expect some communication before you arrive in the country and to know whether or not you will immediately have somewhere to sleep. If emailing doesn't work, call the school and explain that you are the language assistant. And if writing emails and making phone calls in French intimidates you, remember that the alternative is walking out of a train station in France without knowing exactly where to go.

[[Image:Airplane_landing_in_France.jpg|thumb|250px|An airplane landing in France]]

Arriving alone in a foreign country is a jarring experience. Even well-travelled assistants are sometimes driven to tears in their first few days. The best way to keep your spirits up is to stay busy and stay smart: decisions you make now will affect the rest of your year in France.

==From the airport==

Unless you work in a city and are flying directly into that city, part of your travel will likely be by rail. Remember to get your [http://www.12-25-sncf.com/carte/avantages/ Carte 12-25] immediately if you're 25 or under. Unless you've bought a [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/dynamic/_SvTermCommVoySaisieLf?_TMS=1088004907301&amp;_DLG=SvTermCommVoySaisieLf&amp;_LANG=FR&amp;_AGENCY=VSC&amp;_TMS=1088004907105 Prem's] ticket in advance, buying the card now will get you a big discount on your first trip (in fact, the card will likely pay for itself on your first trip if you're going far enough). Just bring a passport picture to a ticket counter at any train station (this is easier than buying one online). The SNCF services remote towns by bus only, but the same tickets and discounts apply.

Make a photocopy of your Carte 12-25. If you lose it, this will help you get a new one.

**Note: if you're turning 26 before going to France, you might want to consider buying the Carte 12-25 in advance.  You are allowed to buy it the day before your 26th birthday and use it for the year, but you cannot buy it after you've turned 26.

==Lodging==

===The lucky ones===

If your school ''has'' arranged for your lodging, breathe a sigh of relief. You'll normally have to pay a small monthly sum to stay in the ''internat'', and its funishings may be spare beyond reason, but at least you'll have somewhere to sleep.

===The others===

If your school ''has not'' arranged for your lodging, you will arrive in your town and literally have no place to go. This happens most often in larger cities, with busy school system offices that pay little attention to assistants.  Assuming you arrive by train, make your way to one of the hotels near the train station (there are always a few). Looking up a place in a Lonely Planet or similar guide before you leave home and phoning ahead to make a reservation might be a good idea - you'll be tired and weighed down with luggage. You can expect to pay around 30 - 40 € per night for a single room with no toilet. You'll want to find something cheaper immediately. Don't be ashamed to share your troubles with teachers or anyone else at your school or ''inspection''; it's not uncommon for teachers to take in assistants while they find a place to live. 

[[Image:Toulouse apartment.jpg|thumb|Sunny Toulouse apartment]]

Another accommodation solution is to take a room in a Foyer des Jeunes Travailleurs. They're organisations providing accommodation for young people up the age of 30. Accommodation ranges from single bedrooms to studios with their own kitchenettes and bathrooms, it varies from foyer to foyer. They usually have a cafetiera, a common room, internet access and maybe even a minigym and a bar! In larger towns it should be easy to arrange a short stay whilst you're looking for an apartment - again, phone ahead, maybe a couple of weeks before you leave. In smaller towns where you might be the only assistant, or indeed the only foreigner, a FJT might be a good longer-term solution as it's a great way to meet (French!) people by getting involved in the activities they run (like sports, yoga, theatre, cultural nights, trips) or by just hanging out. And the rent's usually very cheap (typically around 100 € per month if you get benefits - see below) and they will help you with all your paperwork, which is rather useful! They will also usually only charge you the reduced rent whilst you wait for your benefits application to come through, which many landlords might not be so willing to do.  
You can look up FJTs on the Union des Foyers des Jeunes Travailleurs web page: [http://www.ufjt.org/menu.htm]. If no luck there (not all FJTs are members) try googling or asking at the mairie when you arrive in your town.

===Apartments===
Many assistants have never had to find their own apartments before, much less do it in French. Consider asking someone at your school for help; one of your teachers should be happy to help you make phone calls to set up appointments. Most regions have free classified ad newspapers. Get a feel for the average prices, decide what you can afford, and then start looking at apartments. Be sure to see a few before you make your decision! And attention girls: it is generally not smart to go to view apartments alone. Try to make arrangements to view the apartments in pairs. In all likelihood, you won't have the necessary paperwork to sign a lease (''un bail'') for at least a week anyway.

A major difference between American and French apartments : there are no large companies who own apartment complexes. Instead, each individual apartment has a different owner, with whom you must negotiate the lease.

A typical French apartment lease, following the [http://www.pratique.fr/vieprat/log/loc/daf2006.htm law of July 6, 1989], lasts for three years with the option to [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide/Returning home#Apartment lease|exit from the lease]] at any time as long as you warn your landlord three months in advance. (It’s also possible for a landlord to write up a lease for less than a year that does not have this option, when the apartment is furnished.) Most landlords hate French paperwork as much as you do, and so their ideal tenant is one who will stay for the full three years. It is in your interest, then, to be vague about your own departure plans. Perhaps you’ll stay for the Summer – who knows?

===Furniture and your welfare===

When you're looking for an apartment, remember that your rent can be subsidized by the generous [http://www.caf.fr French welfare system]. Believe it or not, assistants have full rights to public funds (we do pay taxes, after all). The amount of ''aide au logement'' to which you are entitled (you can [http://www.caf.fr/SimuLog.htm calculate it online]) is determined by a few different factors:

*Your income
*The size of the city you live in
*The size of the apartment
*Your roommates' (if any) income
*Whether the apartment is furnished.

The best apartment to have is a large, unfurnished one. The amount of aid goes down drastically if you have a small, furnished studio. It may seem silly to buy furniture for such a short stay, but it's possible to do it cheaply and actually save hundreds of euros.

Look around your town and ask your teachers about used furniture stores, sometimes called ''salles de vente''. You'll probably need to either have someone take you there or have things delivered, but just remember that France could be paying for some of it. Another option is &quot;vide grenier&quot; sales, which are similar to community garage sales - keep an eye out for posters in your town.

==Calling home==

Whether your arrival in France is hard or soft, you'll likely want to talk to your friends and family back home soon, and at length. There are lots of ways to do this, ranging in cost from zero cents a minute to $50 for a short call. ''Fais gaffe!''

The cheapest way is to use voice-over-IP (that is, Internet phone) either from services such as Skype, either from DSL providers such as [http://www.free.fr Free].

===The scam===

Many public phones have stickers or posters, both official and unofficial looking, advertising cheap international calls with a credit card. Never, in France or any other country, use one of these services! Their rates, which are not usually posted, are simply awful. Calling their free number and giving your credit card number may seem like a good idea when you're desperate, but you won't be happy when you see your credit card bill.

===Old reliable===

Purchasing a real France Telecom card (with a chip) is a good idea. This will allow you to make calls within France easily and at a reasonable rate, and you can call home at a rate that, while not good, is at least discernable. 

Cards are sold for amounts of 7.50 € and 15 €, each with a certain amount of credits that you can watch count down as you make the call. These fast and easy cards are particularly useful when you're only calling home to ask that someone call you back.

To make an international call from France, you first dial 00, then the country code, then the number you are calling. For the U.S., you will dial something like 
 00-1-xxx-xxx-xxxx

===''Rappelez-moi S.V.P!''===

If you're calling the U.S., it's a good bet that the rate for a direct dialed call from home is better than the FT card's rate. (And if it's your parents, they probably have more disposable income than a French assitant!) Fortunately, every public telephone in France can be called from abroad at the number posted above or near the phone.

To call from the U.S., you first dial 011, then France's country code 33, then the number in France ''leaving off the leading 0.'' This comes out to
 011-33-x.xx.xx.xx.xx

===For those frequent stateside callers===

You're probably skeptical of the “10 10” numbers advertised by worn-out celebrities during Jerry Springer commercial breaks. You should be! One of these services, however, has been a big help to assistants: it's the cheapest way to talk ''by phone'' between the U.S. and France. 

[http://www.1010987.com/ 10 10 987] : as of this writing a U.S. to France call is 53¢ to connect, 3¢ per minute afterwards. Ask people to call you at a French landline phone with this service and they really won't have cause to complain about the cost of the call. They will complain about the numeric soup of numbers required, though. Get ready…
 10-10-987-011-33-x.xx.xx.xx.xx

Since July 2004, 10-10-987 does apply a mobile phone surcharge. It's presently 12¢ a minute for France, significantly eroding the benefit of the service. Now there's no terribly cheap way to talk on a mobile phone in France for more than a few minutes, whether you're talking to your ''potes'' or your parents.

Similar services also exist '''in France''' - a favorite is Telerabais (http://www.telerabais.com/index2.php).  You can call pretty much anywhere in the world for 1.4 cents nights and weekends, and 2.8 cents per minute during peak periods.  There are also reduced rates for calls to mobiles.  No switching of services is required, the bill will just come as an extra page on your normal phone bill.  

For a call to the US, you would dial the US access code: 0811 310 310, then 001+area code+phone number, then press #.  You are charged from the moment the operator starts talking, so it's in your interest to start dialing right away!

===Discount calling cards===

If the jumble of numbers required to call France is too much for some people, or if you don't always want to be taking a free ride, you'll need to find a good calling card.

In larger French cities you will be able to find calling cards with reasonable rates. A 15 € card should get you at least a few hundred minutes of talk time. Go to a large ''Tabac'' and ask for a discount international card, and check the rates printed on the card before you buy it.  In larger cities look for the orange EuroMaxi cards usually sold by shady looking vendors or automated telecarte machines. It will give you about 5 hours to the U.K, Canada, France and the United States.

These cards do trade quality for quantity. Be prepared to redial several times if the call doesn't go through. Sometimes, there is a very annoying echo or a delay in the conversation. And you may need to let the service automatically call you back at your pay phone to get the best rate. It's a hassle, but in the end this is the only practical way to have a long conversation dialed out from a French pay phone in the rain after dark while your stateside pal is sipping an afternoon martini by the pool.

===Fixed lines, VoIP and Internet access===

If you have your own apartment and an activated telephone line, waste no time signing up for [http://www.tele2.fr Tele2] or [http://onetel.fr onetel].

[http://www.neuf.com Neuf Telecom] are also a good bet - they do ADSL deals and cheap international calling. It may also be possible to get your land line set up through them, which is a bonus as they don't demand the one year's minimum engagement à la France Telecom.

The preferred way to access the Internet is through ADSL. [http://www.wanadoo.fr Wanadoo] offers ADSL service almost everywhere in France outside of some rural areas. However, other companies such as [http://www.free.fr Free] offer better deals. Typical rates are 30€ a month for broadband ADSL (a whopping 16 mbit/s for Free in good circumstances), digital TV and unlimited calls to land lines within France ''and to any phone in the US or Canada''. [http://www.orange.fr Orange], through FranceTelecom, offers a similar package.

=== Roaming mobile phones ===

Don't use a foreign mobile phone service in France if you can avoid it, it's obscenely expensive. See [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide/Arrival#Mobile phones|below]] for information on a French subscription.

===Instant messaging===

If you've got a computer, a microphone, speakers and an internet connection of reasonable speed, instant messaging is your best option by far. Get a hold of some IM software such as MSN Messenger or Yahoo! Messenger and you're set. True, your parents or friends back home will need to be online at the same time. But it's free, and none of the above alternatives can beat that!

===Skype: The Cheapest Rates!===

Skype is a program that enables you to make phone calls from your computer, as long as you have an internet connection. You may also need a headset with a microphone, it depends on how your computer is set up. Rates to the US (landlines and mobiles) are 2 euro cents a minute. Rates to other countries are low, too! See http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/rates/.

First, you will have to create a Skype account. Then, you buy a SkypeOut credit. You pay 10 or 20 euros, you choose.  Next, call whomever you want and talk for hours! You are always able to see how much money you still have left on your account and you can just buy more credit as needed. 

However, if you don't feel like paying 2 cents a minute to call home, there is an even cheaper way to chat with friends and family back home. If they download Skype and you have Skype, you can talk through Skype together, for FREE! You can also instant message, in case you catch laryngitis, from chatting too long.  Visit http://www.skype.com to sign up.

==Banking==

===Required documentation===

You will need an account with a French bank in order to receive your salary. While a savings account is sufficient for that purpose, a checking account with a bank card is required for cell phone and internet contracts. Several pieces of documentation are typically required to open a bank account in France:

* passport
* ''justificatif de domicile'': something that definitively indicates your address in France.

The ''justificatif de domicile'' could be a lease, a phone bill, or a letter from a school administrator asserting that you live somewhere. Sometimes banks will accept customers without these; however, many banks are wary of opening accounts for foreigners without a reliable address.

===First steps===

You will most likely need to make an appointment to open your bank account. Make an appointment with a bank that is convenient to you. When you make your appointment, request a brochure on the accounts available. If the reception at the bank is rude, find another bank. As you will see in [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide/Living|the next module]], these are people you will have to deal with over and over throughout the year.

''La Poste'' (or, more properly, la ''Banque Postale'') is the post service's financial arm. It has a wide network of agencies (that is, any post office) and tends to be very relaxed about people with little revenue and ''justificatifs''. Its only inconvenience is that the post offices may have long lines, which may be a hindrance if you really have to show up in person (you'll use your card for most transactions anyway).

===Fees===

Banks in France bear little resemblance to those in the United States. Bank cards are not free; they generally cost 30 € up front or are billed monthly. On the other hand, withdrawals from other banks are generally free (or you may get 3 or 4 free withdrawals each month, which should be sufficient). Checks are free. However, even having access to the bank's web site is often a paid service. Glean what information you can from brochures and be sure to ask questions about each service (including account closure!) before you open your account.  

The Compte Bagoo offered by La Poste, available for those between 18 and 25 years old, is a good option.  The fees incured for this account are minimal; generally around four dollars every three months.  There are several different types of visas and check type cards to choose from, along with the additional bonus of free checks, which come in handy when you need to pay for the cafeteria at school.  The best part about this account is that your liability is limited similarly to what you would expect from an American account for both your checks and bank card.  This can be reassuring if you plan on spending any amount of time in Barcelona.  They even send you monthly magazines as a Bagoo account member.

If you do plan on traveling, check your bank's fees and commissions for purchases or cash withdrawals outside the euro zone as they can be high (sometimes a percentage+a fixed fee).  BNP Paribas is partners with Bank of America, meaning debit cards from either bank can be used at either bank's ATM's for free for an unlimited number of withdrawals.  Other banks in this network (a debit card from any bank in the network can be used at any other bank in the network for free) include Deutsche Bank, Scotia Bank, and Barclay's for non-American assistants.

===Bank cards===
France has an advanced ''carte bancaire'' system, in place since around 1985, that allows you to pay for purchases just about anywhere in France using your bank card and code. In many ways this system is superior to anything available in the United States, as it checks the PIN code using a small microchip on the card for almost any purchase done in person. This allows fast, easy transactions all over the country... and deters thieves, since stolen cards are hardly usable inside the country for lack of the PIN.

But unlike ATM and credit cards in the U.S., where your liability is  [http://www.nolo.com/lawcenter/ency/article.cfm/ObjectID/36CE716A-D287-414B-992B6EFC72E4557A/catID/A255AF52-3FB9-4A67-A55A147C244F92F6 normally limited to $50 or less], a stolen bank card in France could leave you owing the bank thousands of euros if it is determined that you were at fault. Even if you're not, recovering the money may take time and a lot of quarrelling with the bank.

Though it may seem unlikely that someone could steal your card and know your PIN, you shouldn't underestimate creative thieves. (One assistant was pick-pocketed by criminals who had spied her code from a balcony at McDonald's. They took far more than her account balance, and after an extended fight with the bank she was granted only part of the money back.) Hunch over that code entry machine, use one hand as a blind, and don't expect sympathy from the bank for what they consider carelessness.

Be especially careful of internationally capable bank cards. Because standard ''cartes bancaires'' only function in France, French banks have linked into Visa and MasterCard networks to allow their customers to make bank card purchases abroad. Unfortunately, the same consequences apply for purchases made through these relatively insecure networks. If you are traveling outside France and your wallet is stolen, a criminal can charge money to your account without needing to know the code until you manage to call the bank's number in France to cancel the card, and then you'll have to complain about the loss and ask to be refunded. If you ''do'' have a French bank card with a Visa logo, cough up the extra euros for bank card insurance or leave it at home when you travel.

A better solution is to get a bank card without the Visa or MasterCard logo and use ATMs (or American credit cards) when you travel abroad. Or, if your bank offers it, look for a card with Visa Electron. These cards can be used to make purchases outside of France (particularly in the U.K.), but will always require the PIN. If your bank manager is unable to understand what you want, feel free to leave without opening the account. There are many confused bank employees in France who are unaware that purchases can be made abroad without the PIN, or that purchases can be made in France without a Visa; you do not want one of these people to be your bank manager.

==Mobile phones==
The mobile phone system in Europe, like everything else, is different. For once, people do not pay for incoming calls, but the price for calling mobile phones from land lines is higher than the price to call other land lines.

===Will you need one?===

You will most certainly want a mobile phone as soon as possible. Everyone else will have one, and you'll feel left out if you don't. If you are one of the lucky assistants provided with lodging upon your arrival, you would have to be extraordinarily lucky to have a landline as well, as very few ''internants'' have working ones. If you move into a private apartment, you could likely have your landline up and running in a few days and theoretically do without a mobile phone — you'll want one anyway, of course.

===The easy solution===

The fastest, easiest, and safest way to have a mobile phone is to bring a Europe-capable GSM phone with you to France. In that case, you only need to purchase a power adapter for the phone and a SIM card (''une puce''). These cost around 30 €. Although remember to get it unlocked from the network before you leave, especially if you're coming from the UK! You won't need to enter into a contract, and you won't need to wait for all the documents required to enter into the contract. Do this if you can!

Another way is to get a pay-as-you-go phone (as we call them in the UK - &quot;sans abonnement&quot; in France). This means you make a one off payment which gets you the phone, the SIM card and a bit of credit - instead of having a contract you buy top-up cards from a tabac, then activate them by ringing a number. Currently on the Orange website [www.orange.fr], the cheapest deal is 79 €. Note that pay-as-you-go plans are quite costly compared to regular contracts, where you pay a fixed amount each month and get a number of minutes of credit each month. If you intend to talk regularly over your mobile phone, you may want to get one of these, but it is more of a hassle to set up.

Sending short messages (SMS) is also considerably cheaper than talking.

Other mobile phone providers are: Bouygues Telecom [http://www.bouyguestelecom.fr/home.htm] (if you can pronounce it!) and SFR [http://www.sfr.fr]. SFR and Orange have the best coverage - important if you're in a small town! You just need some ID to get a 'sans abonnement', (give your address as the school where you're teaching, explain you're an assistant if necessary) which means you can get the phone as soon as you arrive.

You might be able to get a handset secondhand from a previous assistant and therefore cut your start-up costs. Have a look on the Assistants in France webpage to see who's advertising.

===Contracts===

If you don't have a compatible phone already, you can either buy one at full price or you can enter into a mobile phone contract (''abonnement'') and receive a discount. Several things are required, some of which you will not have for at least a few weeks:
* passport
* ''justificatif de domicile''
* R.I.B. (''Relevé d'Identité Bancaire'') — this will come with your bank account
* bank card

The mobile phone carrier [http://www.sfr.fr/ SFR] has contracts ranging from six months to two years. The longer the contract, the better the deal on the phone and monthly credit allowance. As the salespeople will assure you, it is possible to [[Teaching Assistant in France Survival Guide/Returning home#Breaking contracts|terminate the contract]] if you are a foreigner when you depart permanently from France. However, keep in mind that having to cancel a phone contract will add to the paperwork and general stress of your departure. Signing a contract that you can fulfill is a better choice.

===“08” Numbers, phone cards===

Don't call numbers beginning with 08 from your mobile phone. Not only will you pay the high rate of that 08 number, you will also have to pay for the airtime out-of-pocket, not from your ''forfait''. (Free numbers, 0800, can't usually be called from mobiles.) For this reason, most international calling cards will be useless with your phone. But if you look hard enough, you may find a card with a Paris (01) or other access number. So long as you have the ''forfait'' minutes to spare, you can use these cards to call home relatively cheaply (compared to dialing directly, even with ''SFR Monde'', et al.).

==''Carte de Séjour''==
Obtaining a ''carte de séjour'' is one of the many administrative responsibilities of a language assistant that is a ''ressortisant hors-UE'' or non-EU citizen.  This process tends to vary by ''académie'', ''départment'', ''préfecture'', and ''établissement scolaire'', in addition to usually varying between different ''fonctionnaires'' within a ''préfecture''.

The basic objective is to submit the necessary paperwork to get your ''carte de séjour'' as soon as you can.  Your visa is valid for roughly 2 to 3 months, therefore you need to apply for your carte de  séjour before your visa expires.  You should receive specific instructions from your ''académie'' at your first stage, regarding your obligations.  The general series of steps is as follows:

===''Visite médicale''===
At your first stage or soon thereafter, you should receive an appointment for a medical visit (basically a checkup to confirm you're in good health while working in France).  This visit is conducted by the ''Agence Nationale de l'Accueil des Etrangers et de Migrations'' or ANAEM, and it is best to avoid missing this appointment as it will seriously delay getting a carte de séjour.  It consists of two parts, a lung x-ray and a visit with a doctor at the ANAEM office in your area.  You are excused from work to attend this appointment.  If you are reading this before leaving France, remember to bring your vaccination records as they are requested at the visit, though generally, assistants without them have been to pass the visit without a problem.  At the end of the visit with the doctor, you will be given a certificate that says your health is in good condition.  This document, the ''certificat de controle medicale'' will be one of several to be submitted with your ''carte de séjour'' request.

This is a sample [http://www.ielanguages.com/documents/Medvisit.jpg ''certificat''] from a recent assistant.

===''Rendez-vous à la préfecture: deposer le dossier''===
At some point, depending on the prescribed procedures for your départment, académie, or school, you will receive a convocation to come to your designated préfecture, sous-préfecture, mairie, or commissariat to drop off your carte de séjour request paperwork.  You may also be told you can come by during certain hours during the days they're open, at your leisure.  At your appointment, you will leave copies of several documents (your ''académie'' or even better, your ''préfecture'', should be able to tell you which exactly you will need if you have questions):

*your ''arrêté de nomination''
*your ''certificat de controle medicale''
*your ''attestation de domicile'' from your landlord (whether an individual or your school's principal)
*copies of your passport information page, your visa, and your entry stamp into France
*the ''attestation'' that you are indeed working as a language assistant in France
*an official copy of your birth certificate (''extrait d'acte de naissance''), translated into French
*three passport-size photos
*the request form that is provided at the ''préfecture''

The meaning of official or certified has yet to be determined, but call your ''préfecture'' to confirm what they will be requiring.

Assuming you have brought all the required documents, you will leave with a ''récépissé de demande de carte de séjour''.  This document, with your photo stamped on it, acts as your ''carte de séjour'' until the real card actually arrives.  It has the following data on it:

''Préfecture'', dossier number, date of entry into France, first and last names, place and date of birth, parents' names, nationality, family situation, address in France, expiration date of the récépissé, signature of the ''fonctionnaire'', your signature

This is a [http://www.ielanguages.com/documents/Recepisse.jpg ''récépissé''] from a recent assistant.

Last, it includes a box that says that the ''récépissé'' is not valid unless accompanied by the document identifying the requestor with document number (this seems to always be your passport and passport number).  DO confirm that your passport number is correct BEFORE leaving.  It also states your ''carte de séjour'' will be valid for one year.

===Obtenir votre ''carte de séjour''===
You should receive a notice several weeks later that your residency card is ready to be picked up, and the notice will give directions and hours of business for when and where to get it.  This card is what allows you to stay past the normal three months granted for tourists.

[[Image:Hendaye sunset.jpg|thumb|300px|The sun sets over Hendaye Plage]]
Finishing a year abroad is not as easy as you would like it to be. Instead of planning goodbye parties, you may be busy trying to close your various French accounts, making shipping arrangements, terminating leases, and attending to other mundane business. 

French assistants are often unprepared for the baggage they accumulate in one academic year, both administrative and physical. Don't be caught off guard! The earlier you start making departure arrangements, the more time you'll have to say good-bye properly when you do leave.

==Terminating contracts==

===Apartment lease===
If you signed a three year lease, you need to advise the landlord of your intent to depart '''three months in advance'''. This is generally done by ''lettre recommandée'', so that you can later request proof of delivery if necessary.

===Mobile phones, Internet===
When you opened your mobile phone or ADSL (Internet) account, you may have been told that it would be easy to get out of a contract if you present a plane ticket. It isn’t easy, nor will a plane ticket be of any help. With SFR, for example, you will need to supply a ''justificatif de domicile''. This particular administrative bug-a-boo probably doesn’t exist for your home country – ''tant pis,'' they don’t care! Their only concern is filing the right paperwork.

Ask your parents to mail you a signed and dated letter (English is fine) attesting that you will be returning to live at their address on a particular date. Take this letter to your mobile phone company '''at least a month before your departure''' to ask for your ''résiliation''. They will likely refuse to do this in the store and give you a phone number to call. When you call and explain your situation, they will give you an address or a fax number where you can submit your claim. Do all of these things early and correctly, and they just might close the account. 

Generally speaking, terminating ADSL or phone subscriptions can be difficult for the French too, because companies do not strive too much to make it easy. If sending paper mail to a company who you suspect may give you trouble, always use certified mail (''lettre recommandée'') and cancel the automatic withdrawal authorization that they have on your account, if they have one. The ''lettre recommandée'' will be proof that you took action with respect to the company.

==Furniture==
If you were lodged in your school or furnished apartment, you have one less thing to worry about. But if you did need to purchase furniture, you certainly aren’t going to try to bring it home with you. Ask your landlord if they are interested in buying your furniture. If not, ask them to offer it for purchase to the next people renting the apartment. If that doesn't work, just start asking everyone you know if they need furniture. You can also place ads in the local petites annonces, in boulangeries, grocery stores, etc and at the university (if there is one in your town).  At worst, perhaps someone from your school will hold on to it for next year’s assistants - things like pots and pans, plates, etc would be really useful and wouldn't necessarily take up much space in someone's garage for the summer.

==Excess baggage==
During your stay, you've probably collected more clothes, souvenirs, and gifts than you can fit in your bags. Even if you are able to pack everything (and transport it by yourself!), the party may be over when you check in at the airport. Depending on the airline, your baggage weight allowance could be much lower than what you would like to bring home. Beyond this allowance you are charged a fee per kilogram of luggage; sometimes it is reasonable, usually it isn't. You will need to determine what the rules are for your airline and find some means to weigh your luggage.

There are several alternatives to bringing everything with you on the plane home. In larger cites you might find some international shipping options at interesting prices. If you can get to an airport, look into [http://www.airfrance.com/double6/home.nsf/(LookupPublishedWeb)/Z3-PublishedMarketZ3en?OpenDocument AirFrance Cargo]. If you're in a small town, your only option might be the [http://www.laposte.fr Post Office], which becomes prohibitively expensive if you need to send more than two kilograms. Ask about the book and brochure rate (''le tarif livres brochures''), which is cheap if you are sending only books out of the country – apparently they do check the contents!

As a last resort, carry everything with you and plead. Application of the luggage weight limits and fees is – strangely – at the discretion of ticketing agents. Sometimes they will look the other way for nice, desperate teaching assistants (who, naturally, have nothing but good things to say about the ''douceur de vie'' in France) returning home with a year’s worth of souvenirs. Just be prepared to throw some heavy pieces of France in the garbage, if need be.

==Closing your bank account==

===Excess €s===
After a year of borderline poverty, you’ll find yourself with more money in euros than you know what to do with just before you leave. Your last month’s salary should appear in your account at whatever its normal time is; if you had an apartment, you will have the deposit back, and if you sell furniture or other things you can’t take home, that’s even more money for you. Unless you plan on returning to France the following September, you’ll need to close your bank account and do something with all of that cash. Whichever option you choose, make an appointment with your account manager for the account closing (at least a week in advance as usual).

===Wire transfer===
The easiest option, and the one likely to be proposed by your account manager, is to have the money wired to your home bank account after your departure. This allows you to keep the account open for any last minute ''virements'', such as an electricity or phone bill. But after a year with a French bank account, you should see the catch in this immediately: the closing, wire transfer, and currency conversion fees are unreasonably high. If you let the bank handle everything, they will take more than 100 € for themselves after you’ve left the country.

Further, your account funds will still be available to your similarly untrustworthy mobile phone company that may not have processed your contract termination paperwork in a timely manner, unless you have closed their authorization.

===Leaving the account open===
American ATM cards used abroad often give good exchange rates with minimal fuss. Why not leave your French account open, take its card with you, and withdraw your money from home? This way, you could be sure that the final debits for your account have cleared (paying your last electricity bill takes about a month). The problem with this approach is that using your French ''carte bancaire'' outside the eurozone is not very practical. Your withdrawals are usually limited to a maximum of 250 € per week, and the bank will take around 3% for the currency conversion. Figuring out how exactly much would require a thorough reading of your finely printed fee schedule, and possibly a conversation with the Microsoft Excel paper clip. Good luck! When you want to close the account, you will need to mail a letter to your bank requesting such, with your bank card (cut into bits) enclosed. On balance, you may not feel so bad about stiffing the electric company for your last month’s bill.

===Complete withdrawal===
Depending on your situation, your best option could be to keep your money in euros. This will allow you to close your French account on the spot and handle the currency conversion at your leisure. If you’re feeling bold, you could take all of the money 200 € notes; otherwise, put most of the money in a bank check. If you think you’ll be in Europe again any time soon, or if you’re traveling immediately afterward, spending this money should be easy. Even if you don’t plan to spend it for a year or two, consider that typical currency conversion fees will far exceed any interest you would earn on the money if it were in a bank.

If you must exchange the money, shop around for a good conversion rate. The currency conversion site [http://www.xe.com/ucc/ XE] can tell you exactly what your money in euros is worth in your home currency at a given time, but don’t expect to get this rate from anyone. Instead, use it as a guideline to see exactly how much of your money a currency broker wants to take. Without getting bogged down in a discussion of conversion rates and fees (commissions), keep it simple. If you have 800 €, XE may quote a value of $990.90. With this number in mind, ask your bank, exchange bureau, or post office “How much in dollars will you give me for 800 €?” The answer will never be as high as the figure from XE (no one works for free!), but if you ask around you can at least be sure you aren’t being ripped off.

==Good-bye!==
We hope this guide has been helpful to you throughout your time in France, and that you are free enough of administrative entanglements to spend your final weeks traveling and seeing friends. One last word of warning: prepare yourself for the slight culture shock you may experience when you get home. [[w:fr:Fromage|Some]] [[w:fr:Vin|parts]] of your French life you are sure to miss terribly!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Veterinary medicine is one of the most diverse of all universitarian studies. A veterinary student on his way to his approbation as a veterinary doctor will have at least the following subjects: Botany, Zoology, Veterinary Anatomy, Parasitology, Microbiology and Immunology ,Histology, Pathology, Histopathology, organic, inorganic and Bio-Chemistry, Molecular Pathology, Physiology, Pharmacology, animal nutrition and feeding, animal care and management,Dairy and poultry science,animal genetics and breeding,animal surgery,obstetrics and gynaecology,embryology and theriogenology,Veterinary medicine, Toxicology and vet jurisprudence, Fodder cultivation and agronomy,agricultural extension,statistics ,Wild life and zoo animal medicine ,vet public health ,Lab animal management,vet ethics and legal aspects, etc.
This is a book with everything needed to get a degree in Veterinary Medicine, it's here to satisfy public interest in medical care for animals, with self-help advice how to keep your pet healthy for example. Nothing here is intended to replace professional health care by qualified Vets!

== History of Veterinary Medicine ==
It all began when people tried to optimize their meat-production system. There's references to aiding cows in birth dating back to ancient Egypt, Veterinaries have been sent to war, to help maintain the horses of the cavalry, or replace the fallen human surgeons on the battlefield, especially because they had a better command of anatomy. Veterinaries are helping archaeologists in reconstructing the living conditions of ancient civilisations on the basis of animal bones found.

In Germany there even is a professor who habilitated in the field of veterinary history, teaching the subject (and Latin/Greek language basics) at the [[Wikipedia:University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover| Wikipedia: University of Veterinary Medicine, Hanover]].

== Anatomy of the domestic animals ==
A very broad topic, for which 2 years of intense study doesn't seem to be enough. Even seasoned practitioners have to consult their books from time to time. As new discoveries are made, various parts are rewritten.

Belgian cuisine is very similar to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French Cuisine]], but there are some specific regional dishes.
* [[Cookbook:Asperges à la Flamande|Asperges à la Flamande]] (asparagus with eggs and butter sauce)
* [[Cookbook:Stoofvlees|Stoofvlees]] (meat stew)
* [[Cookbook:Gentse waterzooi|Gentse waterzooi]] (chicken meal soup)
* [[Cookbook:Water Konijn|Water Rabbit]] (Muskus Rat, actually very tasty, stems from creative cooking in the trenches of WW1)
* [[Cookbook:Rabbit with Abbey Beer (Konijn met Paterbier)|Rabbit with Abbey Beer]] (Real rabbit, stewed with strong brown abbey beer)
* [[Stoemp]] (a potato, carrot and onion dish)
* [[Chicons au Gratin]] (Gegratineerd Witloof) (chicory (endives) with ham and cheese sauce)
* [[Carbonnades à la Flamande]] (cubed beef in a beer sauce, similar to [[Cookbook:Boeuf Bourguignon|Boeuf Bourguignon]])
* [[Lapin à la Gueuze|Lapin à la Gueuze/Konijn in Geuze]] (Rabbit in Gueuze beer)
* [[Liège waffles]]

==Belgian fries==
A strange event happened in the history of Belgian cuisine. Belgian historians claim that the so-called &quot;[[Cookbook:French Fries|French fries]]&quot; are actually a Belgian invention. French has nothing to do with the country France, it's from the verb to french, ie. to slice into thin strips.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

This dressing is similar to several commercial brands.  It is excellent on salad, rice or as a marinade.  

== Ingredients ==
*1 1/3 Cup [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola Oil]]
* 2/3 Cup Water
*6     T [[Cookbook:Tahini|Tahini]]
*6     T [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|Cider Vinegar]] (Heinze)
*4     T [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|Lemon Juice]] (RealLemon)
*5     T [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|Soy Sauce]] (Kikkoman)
*6     cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* 1/8 tsp [[Cookbook:Xanthan gum|Xanthan gum]]

*2     T [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|Sesame seeds]] Toasted
*2     T [[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
*2     T [[Cookbook:Chive|Chives]]

== Procedure ==
# In a blender combine first eight ingredients and mix on high for about two minutes. You will see a change in the texture of the mixture as the Xanthan gum starts to work, the result is a very smooth, creamy appearance.
# Add the final three ingredients and blend on low, just until mixed. 

Makes about three 8oz. bottles @ ~$.75ea.

== Notes, tips and Variations ==
* Xanthan gum is available in grocery stores, look in the natural grains section.  It is a white powder, about $10 for an 8oz bag.
* Be careful with the Xanthan gum; too much and the mixture will turn into a rubbery glob, too little and the oil and water will separate.
* If brand substitutions are made then the recipe may need adjustment.  This dressing has a very strong flavors that need to be balanced.  When in balance, the flavor really explodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[General Relativity]]

We have seen that a 1-form (&quot;covariant vector&quot;) can be thought of an operator with one slot in which we insert a vector (&quot;contravariant vector&quot;) and get the scalar &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} \left( \mathbf{v} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, a vector can be thought of as an operator with one slot in which we can insert a 1-form to obtain the scalar &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \left( \mathbf{\sigma} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  As operators, they are linear, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} \left( \alpha \mathbf{u} +\beta \mathbf{v} \right) = \alpha \mathbf{\sigma} \left( \mathbf{u} \right) + \beta \mathbf{\sigma} \left( \mathbf{v} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''tensor of rank n''' is an operator with n slots for inserting vectors or 1-forms, which, when all n slots are filled, returns a scalar.  In order for such an operator to be a tensor, it must be linear in ''each slot'' and obey certain transformation rules (more on this later).  An example of a rank 2 tensor is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T^\mu_{\ \nu} \mathbf{e}_\mu \otimes \mathbf{d}x^\nu&lt;/math&gt;.  The symbol &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced &quot;tensor&quot;) tells you which slot each index acts on.  This tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be of type &lt;math&gt;(1,1)&lt;/math&gt; because it has one contravariant slot and one covariant slot.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\mu&lt;/math&gt; acts on the first slot and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}x^\nu&lt;/math&gt; acts on the second slot, we must insert a 1-form in the first slot and a vector in the second slot (remember, 1-forms act on vectors and vice-versa).  Filling both of these slots, say with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, will return the scalar &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} \left( \mathbf{\sigma}, \mathbf{u} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  We can use linearity (remember, the tensor is linear in each slot) to evaluate this number:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} \left( \mathbf{\sigma}, \mathbf{u} \right)
= T^\mu_{\ \nu} \mathbf{e}_\mu \otimes \mathbf{d}x^\nu \left( \sigma_\alpha \mathbf{d}x^\alpha, u^\beta \mathbf{e}_\beta \right) 
= T^\mu_{\ \nu} \mathbf{e}_\mu \left( \sigma_\alpha \mathbf{d}x^\alpha \right) \mathbf{d}x^\nu \left( u^\beta \mathbf{e}_\beta \right)
= T^\mu_{\ \nu} \sigma_\alpha u^\beta \delta^\alpha_\mu \delta^\nu_\beta
= T^\mu_{\ \nu} \sigma_\mu u^\nu
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


We don't have to fill all of the slots.  This will of course not produce a scalar, but it will lower the rank of the tensor.  For example, if we fill the second slot of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, but not the first, we get a rank 1 tensor of type &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; (which is a contravariant vector):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{T} \left( \cdot \ , \mathbf{u} \right) 
= T^\mu_{\ \nu} \mathbf{e}_\mu \otimes \mathbf{d}x^\nu \left( \cdot \ , u^\gamma \mathbf{e}_\gamma \right) 
= T^\mu_{\ \nu} \mathbf{e}_\mu \left( \cdot \right) \mathbf{d}x^\nu \left( u^\gamma \mathbf{e}_\gamma \right) 
=T^\mu_{\ \nu} \mathbf{e}_\mu u^\gamma \delta^\nu_\gamma = T^\mu_{\ \nu} u^\nu \mathbf{e}_\mu
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


For another  example, consider the rank 5 tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}=S^{\alpha \ \ \mu \nu} _{\ \beta \gamma} \mathbf{e}_\alpha \otimes \mathbf{d}x^\beta \otimes \mathbf{d}x^\gamma \otimes \mathbf{e}_\mu \otimes \mathbf{e}_\nu&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a tensor of type &lt;math&gt;(3,2)&lt;/math&gt;.  We can fill all of its slots to get a scalar:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} \left( \mathbf{\sigma}, \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{\rho}, \mathbf{\xi} \right)
= S^{\alpha \ \ \mu \nu} _{\ \beta \gamma} \sigma_\alpha u^\beta v^\gamma \rho_\mu \xi_\nu
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  

Filling only the 3rd and 4th slots, we get a rank 3 tensor of type &lt;math&gt;(2,1)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} \left( \cdot \ , \cdot \ , \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{\rho}, \cdot \right)
= S^{\alpha \ \ \mu \nu} _{\ \beta \gamma} v^\gamma \rho_\mu \mathbf{e}_\alpha \otimes \mathbf{d}x^\beta \otimes \mathbf{e}_\nu
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



As a final note, it should be mentioned that in General Relativity we will always have a special tensor called the &quot;metric tensor&quot; which will allow us to convert contravariant indices to covariant indices and vice-versa.  This way, we can change the tensor type &lt;math&gt;(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; and be able to insert either 1-forms or vectors into any slot of a given tensor.

==Conditional Structures==
===The if Statement===

'''Conditional structures''' are used to control which statements get executed. They are composed of three fundamental elements:
* '''if''' statements;
* '''elseif''' statements; and
* '''if else''' statements.

Conditionals in PHP are structured similarly to those found in [[C++ Programming|C++]] and [[Programming:Java|Java]]. The structure begins with an '''if''' clause, which is composed of the word &quot;if&quot; followed by a true/false statement in parentheses '''( )'''. The subsequent code will be contained in a '''block''', denoted by curly braces '''{ }'''. Sometimes the braces are omitted, and only one line will follow the '''if''' statement. '''elseif''' and '''else''' clauses sometimes occur after the '''if''' clause to test for different statements.

The '''if''' clause says &quot;If this statement is true, I want the program to execute the following statements. If it is false, then ignore these statements.&quot; In technical terms, it works like this: When an '''if''' statement is encountered, the true/false statement in parentheses is evaluated. If the statement is found to be true, the subsequent block of code contained in curly braces is executed. However, if the statement is found to be false, the program skips those lines and executes the next non-blank line.

Following the '''if''' clause are two optional clauses: '''else''' and '''elseif'''. The '''elseif''' (or '''else if''') clause says &quot;If the last statement was false, let's see, if this statement is true. If it is, execute the following code. If it isn't, then skip it.&quot; '''elseif''' statements are only evaluated when the preceding '''if''' statement comes out to be false. Otherwise they are skipped. Other than that, the '''elseif''' clause works just like a regular '''if''' clause. If it is true, its block is executed, if not, its block is skipped.

Finally, the '''else''' clause serves as a &quot;catch-all&quot; for an '''if''' statement. Essentially the '''else''' statement says &quot;If all of the preceding tests fail, then execute this code.&quot;

===Example 1===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$foo = 1;
$bar = 2;
if($foo == $bar) {
  echo &quot;$foo is equal to $bar.&quot;;
} elseif ($foo &gt; $bar) {
  echo &quot;$foo is greater than $bar.&quot;;
} else {
  echo &quot;$foo is less than $bar.&quot;;
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example 2===

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$lower = 10;
$upper = 100;
$needle = 25;
if(($needle &gt;= $lower) &amp;&amp; ($needle &lt;= $upper)) {
  echo &quot;The needle is in the haystack.&quot;;
} elseif (($needle &lt;= $lower) || ($needle &gt;= $upper)) {
  echo &quot;The needle is outside of the haystack.&quot;;
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Conditional Expressions===

'''Conditional values''' function via basic formal logic. It is important to understand how the '''if''' clause, among other clauses, evaluates these conditional values.

It is easiest to examine such with ''boolean'' values in mind, meaning that the result of a conditional value will be either TRUE or FALSE and not both. For example, if variable $x = 4, and a conditional structure is called with the expression if($x == 4), then the result of the expression will be TRUE, and the '''if''' structure will execute. However, if the expression is ($x == 0), then the result will be FALSE, and the code will not execute. This is simple enough.

This becomes more complicated when complex expressions are considered. The two basic operators that expressions can be conjoined with are the '''AND''' (&amp;&amp;) and '''OR''' (||).

====Examples====

We are given variables $x and $y.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  $x = 4;
  $y = 8;
&lt;/source&gt;

Given the complex expression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  ($x == 4 AND $y == 8)
&lt;/source&gt;

We are given a result of TRUE, because the result of both separate expressions are true. When expressions are joined with the AND operator, both sides ''must be'' true for the whole expression to be true.

Similarly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  ($x == 4 OR $y == 8)
&lt;/source&gt;

We are given a result of TRUE as well, because at least one expression is true. When expressions are joined with the OR operator, at least one side ''must be'' true for the whole expression to be true.

Conversely,

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  ($x == 4 AND $y == 10)
&lt;/source&gt;

This expression will return FALSE, because at least one expression in the whole is false.

However,

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  ($x == 4 OR $y == 10)
&lt;/source&gt;

This expression will return TRUE, because at least one expression in the whole is true.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Code Blocks===

A code block is one or more statements or commands that are contained between a pair of curly braces '''{ }'''. Blocks are used primarily in loops, conditionals and functions. Blocks can be nested inside one another, for instance as an '''if''' structure inside of a loop inside of a function.

If, after one of the conditional statements, there is no block of code enclosed by curly braces, only the next statement will be executed. It is recommended that you avoid using this to help prevent accidents when adding extra code after the block.
{{Code:Error
|The following code will not work as intended:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if(FALSE)
  echo 'FALSE evaluates to true.';
  echo 'Who knew that FALSE was TRUE?';
&lt;/source&gt;
|The second '''echo''' statement was executed, despite the '''if''' clause. The lack of brackets caused the if statement to only apply to the first statement, making the second statement evaluate regardless of the outcome of the '''if''' statement.
}}
To avoid this problem, make sure to use brackets with conditional statements, even if there is only a single line of code to be executed. This prevents the error in the above code from occurring when you add an extra line after the existing block.
{{Code:Valid
|This code fixes the previous bug.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if(FALSE)
{
  echo 'FALSE evaluates to true.';
  echo 'Who knew that FALSE was TRUE?';
}

&lt;/source&gt;
|The second '''echo''' statement should never be executed in this snippet.
}}

in the distro dependent section are you meaning to have it sectioned something like

* RedHat

** Tips
** Is it right for you
* SuSe
** Information

or someway else?

== Merge with linuxquestions.org? ==

Rather than have useful Linux documentation spread across multiple wikis, I wonder whether it wouldn't be better to merge this content with http://wiki.linuxquestions.org?  They are using a Creative Commons license, so it can't be moved over wholesale unless all the contributors up to a certain version agree.  But wholesale copying may not be the best approach anyway. -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 22:24, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

== Say 'no' to: &quot;Merge with linuxquestions.org?&quot; ==

I'm inclined to disagree.  While I applaud what LQ is doing, I don't see the flexibility there that I do here.  For instance, if I thought that another entry should be added under &quot;Linux Sections&quot; I don't think I could add it.  I just don't see a way to do that.  Here, however, the structure of the document is more completely within our control and such needs can be addressed.

Links to LQ and other sites should certainly be included, but such homogenization is probably not the answer we are looking for.

== Problem with Open Source definition ==

I have a small problem with how Open Source is defined. “Being an open source program means that (if you wanted to) you could view the source code of the operating system and change it to suit your needs.”

Open Source does not mean GNU’s definition of Free Software. Both Free Software and Open Source are not the same thing as the article leads one to think. Websites for example are Open Source. We can all look at the source code and study it to a certain extent. Looking at a website source code does not mean that I can change the source code of the website, nor does it mean that I can copy it and use it for my own doings. As with the website source code example, we see that Open Source doesn’t mean that it is equivalent to Free Software. I know that Open Source is commonly used interchangeably with Free Software but in truth this is a very bad practice. At least I feel it is. Open Source refers to the source code of a application being open for others to see it, but it gives no rights to the user who is looking at it apart from viewing the source code. Free Software gives explicit rights to the user, one of them being the right to view and study the source code. Free Software is a license and Open Source is not.

I think this something that new comers should be clear about when dealing with conversations about Open Source and Free Software. Any one agrees? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 15:09, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

== Merge with [[Linux Guide/Installing Linux]] ==

I wouldn't think that you should merge these two. This is (or hopefully will be) in my opinion a good guide for people who are computer-orientated but have never used linux. So I'm against. But certainly an interesting idea. [[User:Friendly.demon|Friendly.demon]] 20:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)


I do not think this should be merged with installing Linux. I am a newbie and I have come hunting here via a Google search &quot;linux for newbies&quot;. Many newbies will be like me, someone else installed it for them and now they are tryng to learn things themselves. So far the documentation I have found is absolutely woeful, it assumes so much knowledge. ''User delta_tango, sorry I can't register forany more Wikis, I'm losing track.'' &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:58.160.202.148|58.160.202.148]] ([[User talk:58.160.202.148|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/58.160.202.148|contribs]]) [[2006-06-02]].&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;!-- removed heading since this is answering the &quot;merge&quot; issue --&gt;

As a beginner to Linux, one of the major issues I face is the general lack of material, (that I can find) that covers this very area. There seems to be lots of more technical material that is targeted at user who knows something about Linux but not for individuals who are trying to convert from &quot;other operating systems&quot; to Linux.  I have attempted to read the other document that you wish to combine this one with but, in my opinion they are targeted at totally different audiences. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Beardman|Beardman]] ([[User talk:Beardman|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beardman|contribs]]) [[2006-10-13]].&lt;/small&gt;

'''Keep separate.''' I think it's valuable to have a &quot;brief, introduction to Linux&quot; type of title that is separate from others like &quot;installing,&quot; &quot;configuring,&quot; etc. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Davidbspalding|David Spalding]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Davidbspalding|ta'''!'''k]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Davidbspalding|y'''@'''wp]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;/&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:contributions/davidbspalding|Contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:There's zero reason to have separate '''books''' for this. I hope to merge much of the linux documentation into one book in the future. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:26, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

== Changes suggested ==

I think since this is Linux for Newbies, we should change the current layout of material:
* Discussion of runlevels should go. This is relevant only for distro hackers.
* More focus should be put on GUI applications and using them. The current terminal section is OK, but the regular user will only use it as a last resort.
* Some security information. Some people will panic and try to install an antivirus on Linux until we explain it's usually not necessary.
* The section about useful applications at it currently is is harmful, because considering that only the scary console based apt-get way of installing packages is presented, people will try to download them from the websites and install them manually instead of using the package manager.
* Pipes are used in the commands though they are not explained.
* I think there could be a simple guide to installing Linux from a Live CD or from the text installer. The current Installing Linux chapter in the Linux Guide relies heavily on terminal. Another option would be to change the Guide.
* Text should be split into chapters for easier reading - there's currently quite a lot of it.
* We definitely need an explanation about the X Server, because I have found some people that think that Linux is &quot;built on top of a command line&quot; like Windows 95. Also explain to people that the desktop environment is only a collection of programs, not a part of the kernel like in NT-based systems and can be changed easily.
* I would opt for more focus on explaining the differences between Windows and Linux, because this is the reality.

==Don't Merge Installation with Usage==


I am definitely a Newbie and also being considered elderly have some difficulty in recalling specifics of commands that i previously enter:(.

I have two OLPC XO computers and they have Linux on them. I don't care how it got there. It is available through the Terminal. The same for the Macintosh that i have. So I don't need an extensive chapter on installing Linux here. Installing Linux would, i think, have to do with acquiring and installing some distribution like UBUNTU, FEDORA, BSD, into a computer usually, but not always, through terminal commands or a GUI. Linux for Newbies should concentrate on The Command Line entries to a Terminal that is already there.  

What i am most interested in is how to use the commands(or as some call them &quot;programs within the Shell&quot; to accomplish some result. There are a lot of manuals that take the encyclopedic approach to commands, as does the Terminal command man and help and --. That's not helpful when you have a specific goal in mind. Kind of like a teacher handing you a dictionary and telling you to write an essay on &quot;How to Start a Car&quot;(and you don't know what a Car is). 

Some important things that require step by step sequences of commands (forget about these characters like ; that say execute commands in sequence and also scripting for now. I would be happy to enter them one at a time, wait for completion, then enter the next one)

1.  Listing what is in my computer, and what is running: la and ps commands do that but have several different variations (arguments) that produce different outputs. And of course you have to interpret what the output means. 

2.  Not running output off the screen and being unable to scroll back: |less following command that produces a listing. Remember that :q gets you out. 

3.  Finding my way: The concept of PATH is very hard to grasp when you are used to pointing and clicking icons or items on a menu or a folder listing. Here is where some of that tricky punctuation comes into play: .  ..   /  ~ come to mind.

4.  When there is a storage device such as a USB (or SD) drive (stick, floppy, or HD) connected to the computer what commands will transfer programs or data onto them or from them. How would you run an application or print data from them?

5.  The commands wget yum and rpm tar are involved in obtaining applications from the internet and perhaps installing them. Most instructions from a given web site tell you to use these commands (or worse make you have to decide on several alternatives) and they apparently work and the result goes somewhere (that pesky PATH again). But then the user is in &quot;left field&quot; as to what then to actually get them to run on the target computer. See 6.

6.  A clear cut set of commands to install Flash Player and Java. These for some reason never are included in distributions and attempts to load them and have them work with a previously loaded browser become very iffy.

7.  Getting out of situations: A lot of descriptions tell you in great detail how to do a set of operations, but don't say what to do to get out. For example if you use | less the end of the list is a big black square. Type :Q and you are out. Up and Down arrows scroll you up and down hopefully.

I have rambled on perhaps to excess and exposed some ignorance. A lot of the basic names for things escapes me. However, I hope I make the point that &quot;Linux for Newbies&quot; cannot be all encompassing. Stick to Terminal Commands with this one. 

Regards: (BTW this is my first &quot;EDIT&quot; since registering. I did learn enough through observation to see that == on either side will make Title-size text)</text>

Incidentally, I should ask whether you have anything against NSF. You posted a number of Summer Research links on the BS in Physics page, but you failed to post the motherload -- the NSF-funded REU programs. This is where the vast majority of physics majors nowadays get their summer internships. 

Finally, would you mind answering my more coherent questions on the [[Talk:Wikiversity:Bachelor_of_Science_in_Physics|BS Talk Page]]?

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Roadrunner. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Roadrunner~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">I originally designed this WikiBook a few years ago, while in graduate school at Georgia Institute of Technology.

My intention was not at all to make an exhaustive textbook of any sort, but instead to make a '''quick mathematical reference and/or primer''', with notation matching that of Misner/Thorne/Wheeler.

A few years ago, when I designed this WikiBook, things just did not fall into place...in particular, there were a lot of issues with people posting in the book writing vague descriptions of things instead of using mathematics.   At one point I just gave up....

For whatever reason, I would like to revive this WikiBook.  I believe it still has potential.

If you do are interesting in working on this WikiBook, please contact me.

==Various comments==

I am thinking of a (hopefully temporary) major overhaul of the book.  There are many sections on advanced topics which are not being touched.  I propose temporarily deleting those so that we can finish the introductory topics first.  I will keep a copy of anything I delete in the GR Main discussion page in case somebody is actually planning on writing these sections.  Let me know what you think.  -[[User:Lathem|Lathem]]

Probably it is better if you move them into an appendix for now.

As a grad student working in LIGO, may I suggest some additions to the gravitational waves section? A little bit on the linearized theory, and into some detection methods. If OK by you, I may add to that section.

What would be nice is an short set of exercises for all the new set of ideas that are introduced as an option for a reader to get a grasp, personally i know that when i see things i do not quite grasp them by reading them and need a few exercises varying in difficulty before i appreciate what the things are done for, e.g., why and what is something used for and off the top of my head i cannot quite think of any specific situation.

I plan to type some of my notes in here beginning with tensor algebra and then going over to tensor calculus prepared from the books by Inverno and Pathria as well as a text on mathematical physics popular for undergraduate courses in my country.

Now that we have established some of the basic of tensor algebra and curved space, lets try to do 
something within that curved space.  We start by taking a derivative.  In Einstein notation, taking
a derivative looks like


&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} f (x^i)
&lt;/math&gt;

In the spirit of seeing how things work when we transform coordinates, we convert the coordinates from
&lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x^{\prime i}&lt;/math&gt; by a tensor transformation &lt;math&gt;x^{\prime i} = A^i_k x^k&lt;/math&gt;

So let's figure out what our derivatives look like in our new coordinate system.

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\prime j}} f(x^{\prime i}) =
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{k}} f(x^{\prime i}) \frac{\partial x^{k}}{\partial x^{\prime j}} =
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{k}} f(x^{l}) \frac{\partial x^{l}}{\partial x^{\prime i}}
\frac{\partial x^{k}}{\partial x^{\prime j}}
&lt;/math&gt;

So if the transform is a constant we get a very nice result.....


The result is much less nice if the transform changes with location, that is to say instead of transform &lt;math&gt;A^{i}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; we use the transform
&lt;math&gt;A^{i}_{k} (x^{j})&lt;/math&gt;

What we have here is a nice part, and a not so nice part.  If only there
was a way to get rid of the not so nice part.  At this point we do an
interesting trick and that is to redefine the notion of derivative.  Instead of defining derivative as simply the way we do in Euclidean space, we create a new type of derivative called the &lt;b&gt;covariant derivative&lt;/b&gt;.  The covariant derivative is like the normal derivative, except that we
add a &quot;fudge factor&quot; to get rid of the not nice parts of the equation 
so that the result transforms nicely.

In General Relativity we write our (4-dimensional) coordinates as &lt;math&gt;(x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3)&lt;/math&gt;.  The flat Minkowski spacetime coordinates (&quot;Local Lorentz frame&quot;) are &lt;math&gt;x^0=ct&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^1=x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^2=y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x^3=z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are the usual 3-dimensional Cartesian space coordinates.

A '''comma derivative''' is just a convenient notation for a partial derivative with respect to one of the coordinates.  Here are some examples:


1.  &lt;math&gt;T^\alpha_{\ \beta , \gamma} = \frac {\partial T^\alpha_{\ \beta}} {\partial x^\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;


2.  &lt;math&gt;f_{, \mu} = \frac{\partial f} {\partial x^\mu}&lt;/math&gt;


3.  &lt;math&gt;w^\mu_{\ , \nu} = \frac{\partial w^\mu} {\partial x^\nu}&lt;/math&gt;


4.  &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\alpha_{\ \beta \gamma ,\mu} = \frac {\partial \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \beta \gamma}} {\partial x^\mu}&lt;/math&gt;


If several indices appear after the comma, they are all taken to be part of the differentiation.  Here are some examples:


1.  &lt;math&gt;S_{\alpha \ ,\mu \nu}^{\ \beta} 
= \left( S_{\alpha \ ,\mu}^{\ \beta} \right)_{, \nu}
= \frac {\partial} {\partial x^\nu} \left( \frac{\partial S_\alpha^{\ \beta}} {\partial x^\mu} \right)
=\frac {\partial^2 S_\alpha^{\ \beta}} {\partial x^\nu \partial x^\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;


2.  &lt;math&gt;f_{, \alpha \beta \beta}
=\left[ \left( f_{, \alpha} \right)_{, \beta} \right]_{, \beta}
= \frac{\partial^3 f} {\partial^2 x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;


Now, we change coordinate systems via the '''Jacobian''' &lt;math&gt;x^\mu_{\ , \nu}&lt;/math&gt;.  The transformation rule is &lt;math&gt;x^{\bar \mu} = x^\mu x^{\bar \mu}_{\ , \mu}&lt;/math&gt;.


Finally, we present the following important theorem:


''Theorem:''  &lt;math&gt;x^\alpha_{\ , \mu} x^\mu_{\ , \beta} = \delta^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt;


''Proof:''  &lt;math&gt;x^\alpha_{\ , \mu} x^\mu_{\ , \beta} = \sum_{\mu=0}^3 
\frac {\partial x^\alpha} {\partial x^\mu}
\frac {\partial x^\mu} {\partial x^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, which by the chain rule is &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial x^\alpha} {\partial x^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, which is of course &lt;math&gt;\delta^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


So, as a matrix, the matrix inverse of &lt;math&gt;\left( x^\alpha_{\ , \mu} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left( x^\mu_{\ , \beta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; are tensors of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} \otimes \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; of rank &lt;math&gt;n+m&lt;/math&gt;.  The components of the new tensor (pronounced &quot;T tensor S&quot;) are obtained by multiplying the components of the old tensors.  In other words, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T^{\alpha}_{\ \beta} &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}=S_{\mu \nu}, &lt;/math&gt;then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} \otimes \mathbf{S} = T^{\alpha}_{\ \beta} S_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;.


For example, if T and S are two contravariant, one-rank tensors, then their tensor product is a two-rank, contravariant tensor.

== Discussions ==

=== Scope ===

First, all of the items in the table of contents are good topics-- but this book would be HUGE.  I'm going to create a Serial communications bookshelf, because I think we need to create several volumes; among them:

==== Basic Serial Communications ====
This volume should contain only the basics of serial data communications (and I mean the BASICS-- synchronous, asynchronous, parity, basic RS-232 protocol, and that's it) along with some demo code that will work between two PCs with a null modem cable.  The goal should be to avoid overwhelming a novice C programmer who suddenly has to talk to &quot;something on a serial port&quot;.

==== Advanced Serial Communications ====
This volume should contain stuff that's going to come up for anything beyond simple applications.  Cabling limitations should be discussed (why only 50 ft. at 19.2Kbps? capacitance! etc.) Baud rate detection and other advanced concepts go here.

==== Practical Modem Communications ====
Should contain that gigantic Hayes AT command set reference we've come up with, along with descriptions and specs for XModem, YModem, YModem-G, ZModem, and, of course, Kermit.  Should also cover ASCII/ANSI translation issues.  Basically, BBS nostalgia time!

==== Serial Communications for Microcontrollers ====
This should cover the implementation of serial communications facilities on microcontrollers that are taken for granted on PCs-- UARTS, FIFOs, etc.-- and should try not to re-cover ground from the previous books.  I suggest the PIC16F84 as a micro with a UART, and another Microchip part without a UART to cover implementing one, as reference source code for both cases is available from Microchip.

There is obviously potential overlap here with, say, &quot;Advanced Microcontroller Programming&quot; or &quot;PIC Microcontroller Programming&quot; or whatever we have/will have.
ll

==== Universal Serial Bus Technical Manual ====
This will take a while, but there's more than enough source material.  Should cover cabling, protocol, building small devices around USB &quot;glue&quot; chips and micros, writing basic host-computer drivers, etc.  I suggest a simple USB-based LCD controller as the demo project.

I have started writing about the USB technology. It may take a while and I need help. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 09:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==== Serial ATA Technical Manual ====
Ouch.  Not very many people on the planet have the background to discuss implementing both sides of a Serial ATA chain-- the controller and the drives.  We need contacts at Seagate or SerialATA.org for this one...

I'll modify this more soon, no doubt...

Breakpoint (and others),

I have not &quot;abandoned&quot; this book... I've just had some real life issues come up that have pulled me away.  Also, I was working on the 8250 UART programming section where it just wasn't flowing the way I wanted it to work.  Instead I'm going to try and rewrite that section almost from scratch or try to see what I can get fixed on it.  This is the fundimentals of modem communication as well, so really does fall into a major subsection.

I had an original outline that was more to what I originally wanted to accomplish here, but it appears as though there are some others who want to add more to general serial programming in other areas.  Much of this added material sort of broke up my outline, so the general structure of this book is suffering right now.  That is fine, and certainly I feel that these other topics need to be added, it is just that the book needs to be reorganized a little bit as well.

A direction I wanted to get more into was serial packet communication as well.  This was the &quot;core&quot; of what I really wanted to write about, but there is some preliminary information I wanted to get in first, such as raw RS-232 serial communicaion.  Eventually I want this to move on to general low-level network communications done over serial data links, as a teaching tool to explain network concepts that normally get taken care of by a Network Interface Card, but can be done &quot;manually&quot; by software that can be written by an undergraduate or even high school student.  Perhaps a modified version of this original book I intended should be on the serial data &quot;bookshelf&quot; as one of several books available.

=== Microcontroller reference? ===
I am interested in very simple communication schemes -- ones that will run on the tiny microcontrollers that I can buy for less than US$ 2.

I hope that this WikiBook becomes a reference for people who are developing new protocols -- so they can understand *why* previous protocols do it that way, so they can (a) keep the good parts of those protocols, things that turn out to be the best possible way of doing something, while (b) avoiding the icky things in current protocols that turned out, in retrospect, to be bad ideas. Everyone who designs a new ''ad hoc'' protocol seems to slam into the same sorts of pitfalls.

A nice reference on RS-232 and RS-485 might be nice;
perhaps even extend to USB and FireWire and EtherNet.

=== Serial Reference Data sheets ===

There are some reference materials available for RS-232 communication, but they are both proprietary (involve copyrights) and are reference orientated, which is a lousy way to try and learn a subject.  I would like to add an appendix section to this Wiki book that goes over the items discussed as more of a reference work, as that also has value once you learn the information.

Other things I think would be useful would be the 8250 software specs (the typical UART chip on PCs), 8259 programming (the PIC controller and more info about what goes into it), and a similified explaination of TCP/IP packets, compared to the packet systems I'll be showing in these articles.

Right now I'm trying to find a few images that I can use legitimately to show DB-9 and DB-23 male and female plugs.

=== other mechanical connectors ===

I see you've added pictures to [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Connections]]. Very nice.
Would it be OK to add other mechanical connectors to that page, or should we use a different page ?

Other mechanical connectors:
* Last week I saw a cable with the standard 9 pin RS-232 plug on one end, and what looked like a stereo jack on the other end to plug into a digital camera.
* Many people use 2 pins (usually the outer 2 pins) of 4 pin RJ-11 telephone plugs for RS-485 serial communication (AppleTalk)
* Is there a standard for connecting the TX, RX, GND of RS-232 to the 4 pins of a RJ-11 connector ? Paul Campbell says &quot;I wired the GND to the yellow line, TXD to the black line and RXD to the red line.&quot; http://www.taniwha.com/~paul/fc/ass2.0.html
* I have a cable with the standard 9 pin RS-232 plug on one end, and a tiny connector (2 mm pitch) to plug into my HP calculator on the other end. (Exactly like http://www.engr.uvic.ca/~aschoorl/faq/48faq-12.html and http://www.area48.com/makeacable.html ... not the http://net.supereva.it/enrico.freeweb/cable49g.htm version).

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:26, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I don't have any problem with trying to add any other connectors.  I believe a &quot;DB-15&quot; connector may also have some value.

--[[User:Robert_Horning|Rob Horning]]


=== RS-232 on RJ11 ===

The #1 problem with the RJ-11 connector is that it is not even remotely standardized regarding what wires are used for what RS-232 pin values.  There are some interesting problems with hooking up an RS-232 line through a home phone network, however.  The suggestion that you are making here to connect using a two-wire serial connection (transmit and ground, or ignoring ground altogether) would have some interesting value, as most homes (at least in the USA) are wired with a 4 wire phone system, but usually only two wires are in use with the other two &quot;reserved&quot; for a second phone line.  With FCC regulation changes basically granting control of the phone system to the home owner, you are pretty free to do what you want on your phone system, as long as it stays within your home.  If it goes on to another building, it starts to get a little more messy in a legal sense.  Even more outside the USA.

I would like to propose that we &quot;establish&quot; an RJ-11 wiring standard, if we can't get one that even looks remotely common.  This group of wiki pages could even get something simple going that could even be submitted as an RFC, and we could demonstrate that this does have an affect on the internet, so it would be a legitimate fourm for submitting a standard.  Much sillier standards are submitted as RFCs, such as IP over carrier pidgeon or the Twelve Nights of the Enterprise (like the Twelve Days of Christmas).  This has some real value because it is something that is openly useful and has practical applications.  I especially like RJ-11 for RS-232 because it is a very easy wiring system to implement for a home hobbist, and can be used as a &quot;backup network&quot; for normal RS-232 systems.  Even better, wouldn't it be nice to have an RJ-11 connector act as a serial connector for a laptop or PDA?  Certainly it would be easier to implement than using a traditional male DB-9 connector.

--[[User:Robert_Horning|Rob Horning]]

''The #1 problem with the RJ-11 connector is that it is not even remotely standardized''

Not for RS-232. However, it *is* standardized for RS-485 -- The AppleTalk / LonTalk standard.

RS-485 is a small improvement on RS-232 -- most RS-232 equipment (such as my Hayes modem) can directly connect to most RS-485 equipment (such as my Apple Macintosh), with the right adapter cable.

I agree that discussing and proposing standard for RS-232 on RJ11, here in this wikibook, could be useful.

Should we make an article listing the various ways to connect RS-232 to a RJ11 connector ?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:46, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

* The &quot;8051 Board&quot; at http://www.ustr.net/offers/index.shtml uses a RJ11 for its RS-232 connector. (Unfortunately I can't tell from the schematic http://www.ustr.net/offers/board1diags.shtml which pin connects to RX, which pin connects to TX, which pin connects to GND, and to what, if anything, the other pin is connected).

(Moved from the main page and placed there anonymously):

The difference between
* [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Technical Manual]]
* [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]]
is ... um ...

---------------

I'm going to remark that this difference is mainly because of the following:

* The two &quot;wikibooks&quot; were written (or at least started) by different authors.
* They have differnet goals in mind (reference vs. tutorial)
* Would be complimentary.


This wikibook is a mess right now, partly because there have been a bunch of &quot;cooks&quot; trying to go at this with no coherant strategy.  I'm going to try and push forward now that I have a little bit of time on my hands, and get a couple more chapters done.
[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:10, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
:As one of the 'crocks' who contributed a lot of stuff I have just decided that I will leave you and your wikibook alone. You don't want contributes, you won't get contributions from me. Follow your coherent strategy and vision as much as you like. Hint: If you don't want to be disturbed, don't place your oh-so-coherent stuff on a wiki.

::I did not suggest that nobody should contribute.  The point here was that modules have been added that don't fit in with the flow of the book itself.  It is never my intention anyway to delete anything unless it is obvious spam (subjective, I know) or a substantial rework is done to expand what is said or to fix grammar issue.  That is called editing.  If something is added here that I don't like, I may move it to the serial programming bookshelf directly, but keep in mind that my opinion is as valid as anybody else's.  I am suggesting that before you start a completely new module, to at least read through what has already been done, read the introduction and goals of this wikibook (this is rather substantial), and try to make it fit in with this as a book you might see published in a dead tree format.  Not all of the added content to this wikibook so far meets that standard, IMHO (and that is my opinion).  BTW, I would consider that to be good guidelines for editing just about any Wiki module/article, and try to tread lightly before understanding the community that is putting the content together.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:31, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I think it might be a good idea to try to merge a couple of half-finished wikibooks, ending up with a three-quarters-finished wikibook.
I agree that it's a good idea to distinguish &quot;reference&quot; from &quot;tutorial&quot;.
But perhaps that would be easier done by breaking the list of chapters on the index page into &quot;introduction&quot;, &quot;tutorial&quot;, and &quot;advanced reference&quot; sections.
I stuck in some &quot;merge&quot; suggestions.
If no one objects, I'll start merging them together.
(It will be easy enough to split them back apart if we decide it's really too big for a single wikibook, right ?)
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:54, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Thanks DavidCary.  I came up with this wikibook as an initial concept and started to write content, but it appears as though there is a need to develop more kinds of material for serial data programming.  I love the more general serial data communication bookshelf idea (started by Breakpoint) and I think it could be used better.  The question as I see it is what should be put into the bookshelf as separate items and what could be used in this tutorial?  If this main page is going to be the jumping off point, perhaps it needs to be reworked a bit more.  As a book, I would like this to be (at least as a possibility) something you can thumb through in a dead-tree format as well.  Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, even if the interface looks largly the same. [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:31, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Removing &quot;Stub&quot; Status for the main page ==

I know that Breakpoint was &quot;concerned&quot; that this set of pages was abandoned, but I hope that the idea of this being abaondoned has been dispelled for at least the moment.  My concern at the moment by advertising that this is a work in progress is that it tends to attract vandals and others who are merely intent on random changes rather than trying to read the structure and trying to make something that fits into this book.

For this reason I have removed the stub warning and call for articles.  Users can still edit here, and I am encouraging others to help participate, but don't rub in my face (as well as all the other contributors here) that this is a tough, complex, and very technical subject that is going to take time to write material for.  I expect that this will take another year or two before it is completely written, and even then there are going to be some changes.

In addition, calling this front page a &quot;stub&quot; is totally wrong.  While some sub-modules can correctly be called a stub, as an introduction and table of contents it shows exactly what it is, the introduction to a large wikibook.  I feel that this introduction is complete with the vision I have for this book, and while there are some changes that can be made, this is more style than substance.

I do like the % completed remarks that show off how much of the module has been written.  I want to keep those marks on the page, and keep them updated as parts of this wikibook get completed.

If there are contributions that you (who are reading this talk page) or anybody else wants to make, please feel free to add to them here.  I've tried very hard not to edit or remove anything on here... even obvious vandalism, without reviewing it first and seeing if it is appropriate to be placed here.  I may do some moving around of content in the future as I get some more modules completed, particularly when they don't fit into the overall motif of this book I've been trying to work toward.  Even then, I'm going to try and keep that content here on Wikibooks in some manner, although it may be moved to another collection of pages.

[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:33, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

== Merging with Serial Bookshelf ==

I think it is a simply stupid idea all around.  This is a '''book''', not a bookshelf.  I actually supported the idea of a full bookshelf for serial programming, and this book is cluttered with a number of topics like the USB technology and serial ATA hard drives that really merit their own seperate Wikibooks.

I have a roadmap and plan for this book, and that roadmap can be disputed and changed.  That is fine.  Just don't turn this into a Wikiproject conglomeration and a dumping ground for a bunch of stubs that a bunch of deletionists want to get rid of.  Besides, I'm still writing more content even now, and it is progressing along on a snails pace, but I am adding a little bit of content everyday.

IMHO, this move to dump the content is going to destroy the flow and feel of this Wikibook.  I don't mind other people working on the stuff I'm writing, but please read the introduction, title page, and a couple of completed chapters before you start dumping other stuff here.  Try to harmonize any other additions with the rest of this book and not just throw random stubs around that seem like they need a home.

In short, if the Serial Bookshelf gets merged into this Wikibook, I'm going to have no choice but to make another bookshelf or dump the contents onto the Computer Science bookshelf where perhaps they really do belong.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:13, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

== Book renaming ==

I am proposing that this book be renamed from its present Programming:Serial Data Communications name to simply Serial Data Communications, with the rest of the modules having a similar renaming occur.  If there aren't any objections to this, I'm going to perform this change within a week.  Most of this is to conform to the spirt of [[WB:NP]], but there may be other directions we can go as well.  I do propose to keep the colon naming convention between modules, and as this is a &quot;grandfathered&quot; book as per the naming policy, it is not against policy to keep this naming format. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:33, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

:Since there has been no major objection, I'm going to go ahead and do some page renaming.  I'm still going to preserve the colon naming convention, as it is &quot;grandfathered&quot; in as per [[WB:NP]].

== DE9F ==

I'm amused to see that the connector picture is labled DE9F. I understand the historical context: I'm just not sure about the relevance of that label to this article. Is this the right place for the re-definition of reality on historical lines?

Is that picture actually of a DE9F (a particular part number), or it it really an anonymous '9 pin serial female' connector?  If it really is a DE9F, it needs to have a company name associated with the part number. If it has been discontinued under that part number, it needs to have dates. Arcane part numbers are meaningless without a company name.

I tried briefly to look it up: http://www.arrownac.com/ has lots of components described as DB9F, but none described as DE9F. I'm sure that if I looked hard enough, I could find someone willing to sell me a 'DE9F', but that's not really the point is it?.

(david)[[User:218.214.148.10|218.214.148.10]]

:There is generally a dash: DE-9. The 'F' means female. Many people erroneously call it a &quot;female DB-9&quot; which is technically incorrect, but since nobody ever puts just 9 pins in the larger DB-size shell it doesn't cause confusion. --[[User:66.215.203.188|66.215.203.188]] 00:31, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

== Introduction ==

RS-232 is a standard for serial data communication between computing equipment. This standard dates back to 1962 but has been substantially revised over the years to accommodate changes to communications technology. At a minimum, an RS-232 connection may consist of a single wire connected between two pieces of equipment. The simplest connection in common usage contains three wires: transmit (tx), receive (rx), and ground (gnd). However, a fully implemented connection can contain as many as 25 wires. Early RS-232 connections were commonly used to connect terminal equipment to modems, so these topics are often intertwined. because the half time of the delivery date is 2.5 micro sec a count

== Data Terminal/Communications Equipment ==

In the world of serial communications, there are two different kinds of equipment:

* DTE - Data Terminal Equipment
* DCE - Data Communications Equipment

=== Straight Serial Connections ===

In practice, the distinction between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Communications Equipment (DCE) is simply a matter of function. This is an instance where the subjects of modems and serial communication equipment have been mixed together. Here, the modem can be thought of as the DCE and the terminal that faces a user is the DTE. Years ago, when the use of timeshare computing systems was common, the user would dial a telephone, place the telephone's handset against an acoustical modem, and that modem would be connected to a simple dumb terminal with an RS-232 cable. The typical connection speed was usually 50 baud or 110 baud, though very fast connections could reach 300 baud; baud rates are explained in more detail later in this book.

As a side note, when the very first IMPs (Interconnection Message Processors) that formed the first nodes/routers of ARPAnet (the ancient predecessor of the Internet), this was exactly the connection system they were using. This later gave way to other communication systems, but this was the beginning of the Internet.

In a more modern setting, imagine a piece of equipment in a very dangerous place, like in a steel processing mill that measures the temperature of the rollers or other steel processing equipment.  This would also be a form of what we now refer to as a piece of &quot;Data Communication Equipment&quot; that we would also want to be able to control remotely.
The PC that is used in a control room of the mill would be the Data Terminal Equipment.  There are many other similar kinds of devices, and RS-232 connections can be found on all kinds of equipment.

The reason this is called a &quot;straight&quot; connection is because when the cabling is put together, each wire on each end of the connection is connected to the same pin.  This wiring system will be explained later in this book.

=== Null Modems ===

Often you don't always want to connect a piece of equipment to a computer, but you would also like to connect two computers together.  Unfortunately, when connecting two computers with a &quot;straight&quot; serial connection, the two computers are fighting each other on the same wires.

One way to make this work is to connect the two computers to each other with a pair of modems.  As explained earlier, this is a very common task, and in the 1980's and early 1990's it was common to have &quot;Bulletin Board Systems&quot; (BBS) where computers would call each other up with modems and exchange all sorts of information.

Now imagine if these two computers are in the very same room.  Instead of going through the physical modems, they go through a &quot;null modem&quot;, or a modem that really doesn't exist.  In order to make this work you have to &quot;cross&quot; some of the wires so when you transmit some information on one end, the other computer is able to detect and receive that same information.

In addition to simply allowing a computer to communicate and transmit data to another computer, a null modem connection can be used to &quot;simulate&quot; the behavior of DCE equipment.  This will be particularly important later on with some of the discussion in this series of articles, where you can experiment with writing some of your own serial communication software.  In my own experience, I've had to write these &quot;emulators&quot; in many instances, either because the equipment that I was trying to communicate with wasn't finished, or it was difficult to obtain a sample of that equipment and all that I had available to me was the communication protocol specification.

=== Loopback Connectors ===

Sometimes instead of trying to communicate with another computer, you would like to be able to test the transmission equipment itself.  One practical way of doing this is to add a &quot;loopback&quot; connector to the terminal device, like a PC with a serial data connection. This connector has no cable attached, but loops the transmit lines to the receive lines.  By doing this, you can simulate both the transmission and receiving of data.  Generally speaking, this is only done for actually testing the equipment, but can be used for testing software components as well.  When this sort of connector is used, you will receive every byte that you transmit.  If you separate out the transmission subroutines from the data capture subroutines, it can provide a controlled system for testing your application.

=== Protocol Analyzer ===
==== General ====

When it starts to get very difficult to examine the serial data being transmitted by the equipment, sometimes it is nice to be able to take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the information being transmitted. This is done with a protocol analyzer of one kind or another.

What is done is a modification of the cabling that allows for a third computer to be able to simply read the data as it is being transmitted.  Sometimes the communication protocol can get so complicated that you need to see the whole exchange, and it needs to be examined in &quot;real-time&quot; rather than going through some sort of software debugger.  Another purpose of this is to examine the data exchange for purposes of doing some reverse engineering if you are trying to discover how a piece of equipment works.  Often, despite written specifications, the actual implementation of what is occurring when transmitting data can be quite a bit different than what was originally planned.  Basically, this is a powerful tool for development of serial communications protocols and software, and should not be ignored.

There are common ways to connect a protocol analyzer, which are discussed in the following.

==== Y &quot;Cable&quot; ====

A ''Y &quot;Cable&quot;'' is not just some cable, but also contains electronics - assuming it is not a low quality cable. It is supposed to be placed in between a serial line and it mirrors all signals on a third connector. This third connector can then be connected to a protocol analyzer (e.g. a PC with some display software):


 +-----+  serial  +---------+  serial  +-----+
 | DTE |----------| Y Cable |----------| DCE |
 +-----+          +---------+          +-----+
                       |
                       |
                  +----------+
                  | Analyzer |
                  +----------+ 

It is recommended not to use a passive Y cable. Such a cable overloads the transmitters at the DTE and DCE, which might result in the '''destruction of the transmitters'''. The RS-233 standard requires that transmitters are short-circuit safe. However, modern, highly integrated equipment might no longer be compliant to that particular aspect of the standard.

Often, the line going to the analyzer is also just a serial line, and the analyzer is a PC with a serial interface and some display software. The disadvantage of such a simple Y cable solutions is that it only supports half-duplex communication. That is, only one site (DTE or DCE) can talk at any time. The reason for this is that the two TX lines from the DTE and DCE are combined into one TX line going to the analyzer. If the DTE and the DCE both send at the same time, their signals get mixed up on the third line going to the analyzer, and the analyzer probably doesn't see any decode-able signal at all.

&lt;!-- Need more references --&gt;
See http://www.mmvisual.de/fbintermdspy.htm for an example of some simple circuitry for a Y cable.

More advanced Y cable solutions provide the TX data from the DTE and DCE separately to the analyzer. Such analyzers are capable of displaying full-duplex communication. Advanced professional systems not only display the decoded digital information, but also monitor the analog signal levels and timing.

==== Man-in-the-Middle ====

In this scenario the analyzer sits in the middle between the DTE and DCE. It is basically some device (e.g. a PC) with two serial interfaces. The analyzer mirrors each signal from one site to the other site, and also displays the traffic.

 +-----+  serial  +----------+  serial  +-----+
 | DTE |----------| Analyzer |----------| DCE |
 +-----+          +----------+          +-----+

In principle, a simple version of such an analyzer can be built with any PC with two serial interfaces. All that is needed is some software, which is not too difficult to write. Such a device will, however, lack a convenient feature. Professional analyzers are able to auto-sense the speed of the serial communication. A home made solution needs to be configured to match the speed of the serial communication. Professional devices are also optimized to ensure minimal delay in the circuitry. Also, a simple homegrown, PC-based analyzer can't be used to analyze faults due to signal voltage level problems. Nevertheless, any kind of protocol analyzer is much better than nothing at all. Even the most simple analyzer is very useful.

=== Breakout Box ===
[[File:KL_Break_Out_Box_RS-232.jpg|thumb|A typical breakout box with LEDs, patch field and DIL switches]]
An RS232 breakout box (a BOB) is a rather nifty piece of hardware which usually combines a number of functions into one. It basically consist of two RS232 connectors, and a patch field (or switches) which allows to change the wiring between the connectors. A patch field and small pieces of wires are preferable over (DIP) switches alone, since the patch field allows access to the signals for other purposes, too. 

A breakout box is very useful if the pinout (DTE/DCE) of a particular device is not known. The patch field allows to quickly change the wiring from a [[Serial_Programming:RS-232_Connections#Straight_Serial_Connections|straight connection]] to a [[Serial_Programming:RS-232_Connections#Null_Modems|null modem]] connection, or to set up a [[Serial_Programming:RS-232_Connections#Loopback_Connectors|loopback connection]].

Since the patch field provides access to all signals it also allows to use the breakout box to connect a [[Serial_Programming:RS-232_Connections#Protocol Analyser|protocol analyzer]] or an oscilloscope. Better breakout boxes also provide some signal level information on their own, by having LEDs who inform about the signal voltage. This information is useful when trying to identify an unknown pinout. High-end BOBs contain circuitry to measure ground potential difference and pulse traps circuitry to find signal glitches.

Commercial breakout boxes are available in many varieties. It is also possible to build a useful BOB from a handful of simple parts on a circuit board. The patch field can be made from DIL IC sockets, and the wiring of the LEDs is simple if 2-pin dual-color LEDs are used (3-pin LEDs will not work). Each signal line should be connected via such an LED and a 680 Ohm resistor in serial to GND (Signal Ground). The home-made breakout-box is completed with a couple of RS232 connectors, possibly also one to attach a protocol analyzer and some simple metal or plastic case.

=== Character Sequence Generator ===

Another nifty piece of hardware and/or software which is useful for developing and testing serial applications and  equipment is a character sequence generator. Such a generator produces a repeated sequence of serial line data. For example such a generator might repeat the famous &quot;The quick brown fox ...&quot; sentence in an an endless loop. Another common test sequence is the generation of all 8-bit codes from 0x00 to 0xFF in a loop. Such a loop contains all 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit ISO Latin 1 characters, plus the first 32 non-printable control characters and can e.g. reveal decoding errors or transmission errors. Also very common is a modem test sequence, using generic modem commands ([[Serial Programming:Modems and AT Commands]]) to build up a modem connection, send some data and tear the modem connection down in a loop.

Commercial hardware character generators provide a heap of additional features, often combined with a protocol analyzer. As such they are rather expensive. However, just like with a BOB, it is possible to build a useful DIY character sequence generator for small cash. This can either happen with software on a normal computer (some simple endless software loop sending the same data again and again to a serial interface), or with a few pieces of cheap electronic components. Some small stand-alone hardware is often more convenient in the field and in development for quick tests than e.g. a PC or laptop with some software.

A simple classic hardware character generator basically consists of a baud-rate generator, a UART ([[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming]]), an (E)EPROM, a binary counter and a line driver ([[Serial Programming:MAX232 Driver Receiver]]). Typically, each of these components is a simple single IC. The (E)EPROM is supposed to contain the character sequence(s). The baud-rate generator drives the UART and the binary counter. The binary counter drives the address lines of the (E)EPROM. The result is that the character sequence is produced at the data lines of the (E)EPROM. These data lines are feed into the UARTs input. The UARTs output is connected to the serial line driver. All this can be easily fitted on a small prototype board in a simple case. 

A more modern hardware character generator can be build around one of these small micro controllers (e.g.
[[Atmel AVR]]). This is particularly easy, since these micro controllers already contain serial interfaces, and just require a little bit of serial programming - which is the topic of [[Programming:Serial Data Communications|this book]].

== Connection Types ==

If you wanted to do a general RS-232 connection, you could take a bunch of long wires and solder them directly to the electronic circuits of the equipment you are using, but this tends to make a big mess and often those solder connections tend to break and other problems can develop.  To deal with these issues, and to make it easier to setup or take down equipment, some standard connectors have been developed that are commonly found on most equipment using the RS-232 standards.

These connectors come in two forms:  A male and a female connector.  The female connector has holes that allow the pins on the male end to be inserted into the connector.

=== EIA/TIA 574: DE9 ===

This is a female DE9 (incorrectly known as &quot;DB-9&quot;) connector (properly known as DE9F):

[[Image:RS-232.jpeg|200px|Female DB-9 Serial Connector]]

The female DE-9 connector is typically used as the &quot;plug&quot; that goes into a typical PC.  If you see one of these on the back of your computer, it is likely not to be used for serial communication, but rather for things like early VGA or CGA monitors (not SVGA) or for some special control/joystick equipment.

And this is a male &quot;DE-9&quot; connector (properly known as DE9M):

[[Image:9 pin d-sub connector male closeup.jpg|200px|Male DB-9 Serial Connector]]

This is the connector that you are more likely to see for serial communications on a &quot;generic&quot; PC.  Often you will see two of them side by side (for COM1 and COM2).  Special equipment that you might communicate with would have either connector, or even one of the DB-25 connectors listed below.

=== RS-232C: DB-25 ===

This is a female DB-25 connector (also known as DB25S):

[[Image:Parallelport.jpg|200px|Female DB-25 Serial Connector]]

This DB25S is what you normally find on an IBM compatible PC used as the parallel (printer) port.  It is also on the computer end of a modem cable in older PCs that have 25 pin serial port connectors. This connector type is also used frequently for equipment that conforms to RS-232 serial data communication as well, so don't always assume if you see one of these connectors that it is always parallel.  When the original RS-232 specification was written, this was the kind of connector that was intended, but because many of the pins were seldom if ever used, IBM PC compatible serial ports were later switched to the DB-9 DE9S connectors carrying all the required signals as on the DB connectors in the original IBM-PC. (Yes, this is comparatively recent equipment for this standard).

This is a male DB-25P connector (also known as DB25P):

[[Image:Scsi extern db25 st.jpg|200px|Male DB-25 Serial Connector]]

Male DB-25 connectors are usually used on one end of a PC printer cable for parallel data communication, which is beyond the scope of this series of articles.  The DB25P is also used on the the modem end of an external modem cable.  You should be aware that this connector is also used for serial communications on many different types of equipment, using many different types of communications protocols.  In fact, if you have a random piece of equipment that you are trying to see how it works, you can presume that it is a piece of serial equipment.  Hacking random connectors is also beyond the scope of this document, but it can be an interesting hobby by itself.

=== mini-stereo plug connector ===

This is a male mini-stereo plug connector:

[[Image:Klinkenstecker stereo 3.5mm.jpg|200px|mini-stereo_plug connector]]

Some digital cameras and calculators come with a cable that has a mini-stereo plug connector on the end the plugs into the camera, and a DB-9 connector on the end that plugs into the PC.

It is a poor connector, as it short circuits segments while being plugged/unplugged.

The &quot;PicAXE&quot; systems use [http://profmason.com/?p=218]
* 1: base ring: ground (pin 5 of DB9)
* 2: middle ring: serial output from PicAXE to serial input of PC (pin 2 of DB9)
* 3: tip of pin: serial output of PC to serial input of PicAXE (pin 3 of DB9)

{{Wikipedia|LANC}}
The &quot;LANC&quot; systems often use a 2.5 mm stereo jack:

* base ring: ground
* middle ring: +5 to +8 VDC from the camera
* tip: normally pulled high with a resistor to +5V (idle; logical 1); pulled low (start bit and logical 0) to send commands or status. (open collector). Generally the remote control sends the first 2 byte command. The camera replies with 6 status bytes.

LANC uses 9600 bps serial.

=== RS-232D: RS232 on RJ45 ===

RS-232D defines a standard connector much smaller than a DB-9 plug.
[http://zytrax.com/tech/layer_1/cables/tech_rs232.htm#rj45].

(RS-232 on a RJ45 modular jack is also known as &quot;EIA/TIA - 561&quot;)

=== RS232 on RJ11 ===

Is there a standard for connecting the TX, RX, GND of RS-232 to the 4 pins of a RJ11 connector ? 
* [http://mondo-technology.com/upp.html Luhan Monat] uses DB9-5 ---&gt; RJ11-1; DB9-3 ---&gt; RJ11-2; DB9-2 ---&gt; RJ11-3. (RJ11-2 and RJ11-3 are the &quot;inner pair&quot;).
* [http://www.taniwha.com/~paul/fc/ass2.0.html Paul Campbell] says &quot;I wired the GND to the yellow line, TXD to the black line and RXD to the red line.&quot;
* [http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/18009/how-do-i-do-the-6-pin-rj11-to-rs232-female-serial-adapter-wiring Russell McMahon] mentions several different &quot;standards&quot; for wiring RS-232 to the 4 pins of a RJ11 connector or the 8 pins of a RJ45 connector.

== Wiring Pins Explained ==

The wiring of RS-232 devices involves first identifying the actual pins that are being used.  

Please note also that in the &quot;PC COMx Port context&quot; end of things some signals are 'inputs' while others are 'outputs' while in the &quot;Modem context&quot; those same signal names referred to now become as 'outputs' where they were just before 'inputs' and vice versa. That is where much confusion has arisen from over the years, as the 'Input' or 'Output' -sense- nature is not noted in most diagrams on the subject in general,  yet in the real world two 'Out' pins seldom can ever work in harmony in RS-232 related +-[3-10]V stuff where the range from -3V to +3V is not a true high or low, except to possibly burden drivers towards their undesired burnout.  

Here is how a '''female''' DB-9 connector is numbered (Note, the connector on a computer is usually a '''male''' connector, so it is mirrored compared to the following image):

[[File:RS232 Buchse 9pol female.svg|150px|DB-9 Female Pinout Diagram]]

If the numbers are hard to read, it starts at the top-right corner as &quot;1&quot;, and goes left until the end of the row and then starts again as pin 6 on the next row until you get to pin 9 on the bottom-left pin.  &quot;Top&quot; is defined as the row with 5 pins.

Here are what each pin is usually defined as on the PC COMx end of things:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! 9-pin
! 25-pin
! pin definition || Direction (PC view)
|-
| 1 || 8 || DCD (Data Carrier Detect) || input
|-
| 2 || 3 || RX (Receive Data) || input
|-
| 3 || 2 || TX (Transmit Data) || output
|-
| 4 || 20 || DTR (Data Terminal Ready) || output
|-
| 5 || 7 || GND (Signal Ground) || -
|-
| 6 || 6 || DSR (Data Set Ready) || input
|-
| 7 || 4 || RTS (Request To Send) || output
|-
| 8 || 5 || CTS (Clear To Send)) || input
|-
| 9 || 22 || RI  (Ring Indicator) || input
|}

One thing to keep in mind when discussing these pins and their meaning, is that they are very closely tied together with modems and modem protocols.  

Whenever interconnecting any serial ports it will be well to note that whatever the case, it should always follow that only one &lt;output&gt; should ever be tied to one or more &lt;inputs&gt; generally speaking.  Further, be it noted that signal names at the COMx end will generally be opposite of the &lt;in&gt;-&lt;out&gt; -sense- at the modem end of things, even though carrying the same mnemonic names.  

Often you don't have a modem attached in the loop, but you still treat the equipment as if it were a modem on a theoretical level.  At least such that you minimally have an &lt;output&gt; going to every &lt;input&gt; in some manner, with no two &lt;outputs&gt; in conflict or without any 'floating' &lt;inputs&gt; tied to no &lt;output&gt; at all.

The following are more formal explanations regarding each signal function in the general sense of its use:

=== DCD (Data Carrier Detect) ===

This is a signal to indicate from the communications equipment (DCE) that the phone line is still &quot;connected&quot; and receiving a carrier signal from the modem at the other end.  Presumably well-written software or serial equipment could detect from this logic state when the telephone has been &quot;hung up&quot; on the other end.  Null-modems often tie DCD to DTR at each end since there is no carrier signal involved.

=== RX (Receive Data) ===

Input to receive the data.

=== TX (Transmit Data) ===

The reverse of RX, this is where the terminal equipment (DTE) is transmitting serial data, using the same format and protocol that the receiver is expecting.  More on the exact protocol further below.  Like RX, think along the lines of &quot;Terminal Transmit&quot; when designing equipment that will be using this pin.

=== DTR (Data Terminal Ready) ===

Basically a signal from the DTE that says &quot;Hello!, I'm ready if you are&quot;.  This is a general indicator to the DCE that the terminal is ready to start sending and receiving data.  If there is some initialization that needs to happen in the communications equipment, this is a way for the terminal equipment to &quot;boot&quot; the receiving equipment. In a null modem setup this signal is often connected to DCD, so the device signals itself that an (imaginary) carrier has been detected, indication that the transmission line is up.

=== GND (Signal Ground) ===

This is an interesting pin to look at.  What it does is try to make a common &quot;ground&quot; reference between the equipment that is being connected to compare the voltages for the other signals.  Normally this is a good thing, because sometimes different pieces of equipment have different power supplies and are some distance away.  The not so pleasant thing about this wire is that it usually is a physical piece of copper that can conduct electricity that is not normally supposed to go down the wire, like a short-circuit or worse yet a bolt of lightning (it happens far more often that you would normally think for this sort of equipment).  That can fry both the DCE as well as the DTE.  Things like fiber converters and ground isolators can help prevent this from happening, but can still be something to worry about.  Over short distances this is generally not a problem.

=== DSR (Data Set Ready) ===

This is the counterpart to DTR with the communications equipment (or computer peripheral on the serial line).  When the DTR is sent as a signal, the communications equipment should change this signal to logic &quot;1&quot; to indicate that it is ready to communicate as well.  If the DCE goes through a &quot;boot&quot; sequence when the DTR gets signaled, it should not signal DSR until it is complete. But many connectors &quot;hard wire&quot; this pin to be directly connected to the DTR pin at each end to reduce the number of wires needed in the cable. This can be useful for connecting devices using existing telephone wires, but prevents applications from using the DTR and DSR for handshaking.

=== RTS (Request To Send) ===

Setting the RTS signal to [[w:RS-232C#Voltage_levels|logic &quot;1&quot;]] indicates to the DCE that the DTE wants to send it data. Resetting the RTS signal to [[w:RS-232C#Voltage_levels|logic &quot;0&quot;]] indicates to the DCE that the DTE has no more data to send.

=== CTS (Clear To Send) ===

This is the response signal from the DCE regarding if the terminal equipment should be transmitting any data.  When this signal is at [[w:RS-232C#Voltage_levels|logical &quot;1&quot;]], the terminal is &quot;permitted&quot; to transmit data.  Like the DTR/DSR pins, this one can be directly connected to the RTS pin to reduce the number of wires needed, but this eliminates the possibility of hardware flow control.  Some software ignores this pin and the RTS pin, so other flow control systems are also used.  That will be explained when we get to actual software.

=== RI (Ring Indicator) ===

Again, thinking back to a telephone modem, this is a signal that indicates that the telephone is &quot;ringing&quot;.  Generally, even on a real telephone modem, this is only occasionally set to -15V for the signal.  Basically, when you would normally be hearing a &quot;ring&quot; on your telephone, this pin would be signaled.  On Null-modems, often this wire isn't even connected to anything.  If you really are connected to a real modem, this does have some strong uses, although there are other ways to have the terminal equipment (like a PC connected to an external modem) be informed that there are ways to communicate this information through the data pins as well.  This will be covered lightly in the software section.

=== Other RS-232 Pins ===

There are other pins that the DB-25 has implemented that the DB-9 doesn't normally use, such as a secondary transmit and receive pin, Secondary CTS/RTS for those alternate pins, a -15V signal for power, a clock, and a couple of other good ideas as well.  The problem with implementing all of these pins is that you also need to run separate wires, and a full set of DB-25 connectors would also mean having 25 physical wires going the full distance between the DTE and DCE.  If this is more than a foot or so, it gets to be a big hassle, particularly if you are going through walls or in a more permanent setting.  If the wrong wire gets clipped in the bundle, the whole thing must be restrung again, or you must go through wire testing like the old-fashioned telephone linemen used to have to do when fixing a phone distribution box.  Often only three physical copper lines are used to connect the DTE to DCE, and that is simply RX, TX, and GND.  The rest can be easily &quot;faked&quot; on the connector end in a manner sufficient for most software and hardware applications.

== Baud Rates Explained ==
Baud and BPS (Bits Per Second) are usually not the same thing, although they are often used interchangeably, particularly in marketing literature. There are several ways to determine what the actual data rate of a particular piece of equipment is, but in popular marketing literature, or even general reference texts, they will almost always refer to &quot;Baud Rate&quot;, even if they are referring to bits per second.

Baud means the number of changes to the transmission media per second in a modulated signal. If each transmission event contains more than one bit of information, then Baud and BPS are not the same. E.g. if each event contains two bits (two bits modulated in an event), then the BPS of such a transmission would be twice as large as the Baud rate. This is not a theoretical case. Typical &quot;high speed&quot; modems use sophisticated modulation on the telephone line, where the bit rate and Baud rate differ significantly on the line. It is important to know this when you build measurement equipment, decoders (demodulators), encoders (modulators), and all sorts of transmission equipment for a particular protocol.

However, software developers typically like to ignore the difference of bit rate and baud rate, because a bit can either have the value true or false - an &quot;event&quot; (a bit) always only has two possible states. They have no basic unit which can e.g. hold four different states. In other words, on the software site the modulation has already been flattened by the demodulator. If a modulation was used which can e.g. transmit 8 bits in an event, the software developer sees them already as a series of 8 consecutive bits, each either true or false. The demodulator took care of that. When it got an event it turned the single 8-bit event into eight single-bit events. Software developers don't see the original single entity with 256 different states (voltages, phases). Since the modulation has been flattened they don't experience the difference between Baud rate and bit rate any more. This is not the fault of the people who defined  a Baud or a BPS. It is just a (welcome) limitation of digital computer hardware.

Baud is actually a shortened term named in honor of Émile Baudot, a French inventor of early teleprinter machines that replaced the telegraph key using Morse Code.  Basically two typewriters that could be connected to each other with some wires.  He came up with some of the first digital character encoding schemes, and the character codes were transmitted with a serial data connection.  Keep in mind this was being done largely before computers were invented.  Indeed, some of these early teleprinter devices were connected to the very first computers like the ENIAC or UNIVAC, simply because they were relatively cheap and mass produced at that point.

In order for serial data communication to happen, you need to agree on a clock signal, or baud rate, in order to get everything to be both transmitted and received properly.  This is where the language purists get into it, because it is this clock signal that actually drives the &quot;baud rate&quot;.  Let's start more at the beginning with Émile Baudot's teleprinters to explain baud rate.

Émile's early teleprinters used 5 data bits and 1 stop bit to transmit a character.  We will go onto formatting issues in a second, but what is important is that six signals are sent through a wire in some fashion that would indicate that a character is transmitted.  Typically the equipment was designed to run at 50 baud, or in other words the equipment would transmit or receive a &quot;bit&quot; of data 50 times per second.  Not coincidentally, French power systems also ran on an alternating current system of 50 Hz, so this was an easy thing to grab to determine when a new character should be transmitted.

Teleprinters evolved, and eventually you have Western Union sending teleprinter &quot;cablegrams&quot; all around the world.  If you hear of a TELEX number, this is the relic of this system, which is still in use at the present time, even with the Internet.  By rapidly glossing over a whole bunch of interesting history, you end up with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in a lawsuit with AT&amp;T.  Mind you this was an earlier anti-trust lawsuit prior to the famous/infamous 1982 settlement.  The reason this is important is because the DOJ insisted that Western Union got all of the digital business (cable grams... and unfortunately this got to be read as computer equipment as well), and AT&amp;T got modulated frequencies, or in other words, you could talk to your mother on Mother's Day on their equipment.  When computers were being built in the 1950s, people wanted some way to connect different pieces of computer equipment together to &quot;talk&quot; to each other.  This finally resulted in the RS-232 standard that we are discussing on this page.

While Western Union was permitted to carry digital traffic, often the connections weren't in or near computer centers.  At this time AT&amp;T found a loophole in the anti-trust settlement that could help get them into the business of being a &quot;carrier&quot; of computer data.  They were also offering to transmit computer data at rates considerably cheaper than Western Union was going to charge.  Hence, the modem was born.

=== Modems Explained ===

The long description of a modem is a &quot;Modulator/Demodulator&quot;, and this description is important.  Since AT&amp;T could only carry &quot;tones&quot;, like music from a radio network or the voice of your mother, they created a device that would electronically create &quot;music&quot; or &quot;tones&quot; that could be carried on their network.  They would then take a computer &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; and &quot;modulate&quot; the bit to a frequency, like say 2600 Hz.  (The exact tones varied based on baud rate and other factors, but there were exact frequency specs here.)  A matching device would be able to look for that &quot;note&quot; or &quot;tone&quot; in the &quot;music&quot; and be able to convert that back to a computer &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;, or in other words, demodulate the music.  Since all you and your buddy on each end of the telephone are only playing music to each other, it was legal for AT&amp;T to have that music on their network.  That only computers could possibly understand this music is besides the point, and the DOJ turned a blind eye on the whole practice, despite objections from Western Union.

The original modems you could rent were AT&amp;T Bell 103 modems.  These were clunky boxes about the size of a shoe box that had a bunch of switches on the outside and an RS-232 cable that connected to the computer equipment you were using.  These boxes were designed for the old-fashioned handset telephones and had pieces of rubber that would go around the &quot;speaker&quot; and &quot;mic&quot; portion of the telephone (no direct copper connection to the telephone equipment back then).  If you wanted to dial the telephone, you had to use the rotary dial on the phone itself... the computer didn't have access to that sort of equipment.  Keep in mind that the FCC regulated just about everything that happened with phone equipment, and AT&amp;T owned everything related to telephones.  You even had to &quot;rent&quot; the modem from AT&amp;T, and that rental charge was on your monthly phone bill.

The Bell 103 was originally 110 baud, although it eventually had a switch to &quot;move up&quot; to 220 baud.  300 baud modems were also fairly common throughout the 1960's and 1970's.  Keep in mind that AT&amp;T (or your local phone company) was the only company you could even rent a modem from, whether you wanted one or not.  By 1982, modems were so commonly used and the POTS telephone network so widespread that this same system of sending &quot;music&quot; over the telephone has been preserved, even though the legal reasons for doing it are no longer valid.  With the advent of ISDN and DSL lines, this is no longer the case and the phone companies are now sending pure digital signals instead.  This is also why DSL lines can carry much more data than an ordinary phone line, even though it is the same pair of copper wires going into your home.

When modems started going to very high speeds, they hit a brick wall of sorts.  It was decided back in the 1950's that telephone equipment would only have to carry tone signals going to about 10kHz.  For normal voice conversations this is sufficient, and you can even tell the difference between a man and a woman on the telephone.  The problem comes in that this means the highest normal &quot;baud rate&quot; that you can send over a home telephone network is about 9600 baud, usually about 4800 baud, because the telephone equipment itself is going to be dropping &quot;bits&quot; as you switch from one tone to another.  Without going into the heavy math, you need to have at least one full &quot;sound wave&quot; in order to be able to distinguish one tone or note from another.  Modem manufacturers did think of something else that could be done to overcome this limitation, however.  Instead of just sending one tone at a time, you could play a whole &quot;chord&quot;, or several distinct tones at the same time.  Finally back to baud vs. bits per second.  With higher speeds, instead of simply sending only one bit, you are sending two or as many as sixteen bits at the same time with varying &quot;chords&quot; of &quot;music&quot;.  This is how you get a 56K BPS modem, even though it is still only transmitting at 9600 baud.

More about modems in [[Serial Programming:Modems and AT Commands]].

== Signal Bits ==

There are four sets of transmission bits that are used in the RS-232 standard.  The positioning of these bits in the RS-232 data stream is all that distinguishes one bit from the other.  This is also where serial communication really hits the &quot;metal&quot;, because each bit follows in a sequence, or in a serial fashion.  All of the other wires, pins, baud rate, and everything else is to make sure that these bits can be understood.  Keep in mind that at this point the entire protocol is based on the transmission of a single character.  Multiple characters can be sent, but they are a sequence of single character transmission events.  How the characters relate is based on what the software does with the data on the next protocol &quot;layer&quot;.

=== Start Bit ===

When a transmission line is not sending anything, it remains in a logical state of &quot;1&quot;, or -15V on the wire.  When you want to send a character, you start by changing the voltage to +15V, indicating a logical &quot;0&quot; state.  Each subsequent bit is based on the baud rate that is established for communication between each device.  This bit signals that the receiving device should start scanning for subsequent bits to form the character.

=== Data Bits ===

This is the primary purpose of serial communications, where the data actually gets sent.  The number of bits here can vary quite a bit, although in current practice the number of bits typically transmitted is eight bits.  Originally this was five bits, which was all that the early teleprinters really used to make the letters of the Alphabet and a few special characters.  This has implications for Internet protocols as well, because early e-mail systems transmitted with only seven bits when they were connected over some RS-232 links.  This worked because the early character encoding schemes, mainly ASCII, only used seven bits to encode all characters commonly used for the English language.  Because computer components work best on powers of 2 (2,4,8,16,32, etc.), eight bits became more commonly used for data storage of individual characters.  Unicode and other coding schemes have moved this concept forward for languages other than English, but eight bits still is a very common unit for transmitting data, and the most common setting for RS-232 devices today.

The least significant bit (LSB) &lt;!-- according to http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/RS-232_specs.html and http://www.arcelect.com/rs232.htm --&gt; is transmitted first in this sequence of bits to form a character.

=== Parity Bit ===

To help perform a limited error check on the characters being transmitted, the parity bit has been introduced.  Parity can detect some transmission errors but not correct.  The value of the parity bit depends on the number of bits set to &quot;1&quot; in the string of data bits.

There are four different kinds of parity configuration to consider:

==== Odd Parity ====

When the sum of bits ends up coming up with an odd number (like the sequence 01110101), this bit will be set to a logical state of &quot;1&quot;.

==== Even Parity ====

This uses the formula of trying to determine if there are an even number of bits set to &quot;1&quot;.  In this regard, it is the exact opposite state of the Odd Parity. For e.g., for a frame with seven bits that has an odd number of ones, the parity bit will be set to one.  So essentially, the entire byte, including parity must have an even number of ones for even parity.

==== Mark Parity ====

Using this concept, the transmission protocol is essentially ignoring the parity bit entirely.  Instead, the transmission configuration is sending a logical &quot;1&quot; at the point that a parity bit should be sent, regardless of if the sequence should have an odd or even count.  This configuration mode is useful for equipment that may want to be testing parity checking software or firmware in the receiving equipment.

==== Space Parity ====

The opposite of Mark parity, this sends a logical &quot;0&quot; for the parity checksum.  Again, very useful for equipment diagnostics.

==== Parity None ====

This isn't really a parity formula, but rather an acknowledgment that parity really doesn't work, so the equipment doesn't even check for it.  This means the parity bit isn't even used.  This can cause, in some circumstances, a slight increase in the total data throughput.  More on that below.

=== Stop Bits ===

This really isn't a bit at all, but an agreement that once the character is sent that the transmitting equipment will return to a logical &quot;1&quot; state.  The RS-232 specification requires this logical state of &quot;1&quot; to remain for at least one whole clock cycle, indicating that the character transmission is complete.  Sometimes the protocol will specify two stop bits.  One reason that this might be done is because the clock frequencies being used by the equipment might have slightly different timing, and over the course of hundreds or thousands of characters being transmitted the difference between two clocks on the two different pieces of equipment will cause the expected bits to be shifted slightly, causing errors.  By having two stop bits the transmission is slightly slower, but the clock signals between the two pieces of equipment can be coordinated better.  Equipment expecting one stop bit can accept data transmitted by equipment sending two stop bits.  It won't work the other way around, however.  This is something to try if you are having problems trying to get two pieces of equipment to communicate at a given baud rate, to add the second stop bit to the transmitter.

=== Data Transmission Rates ===

We got into a discussion of baud rate vs. bits per second.  Here is where baud as the number of bits being transmitted is still off, even if the nominal bits per second is also the same as the baud rate.  By adding start bits, stop bits, and parity bits, that is going to add overhead to the transmission protocol.  All digital transmission protocols have some sort of overhead on them, so this shouldn't be that much of a surprise.  As we get more into data packets and other issues, the actual amount of data being transmitted will drop even further.

Keep in mind that if you are transmitting with 6 data bits, 2 Stop bits, and Even Parity, you are transmitting only six bits of data and four other bits of extra information.  That means even with 9600 baud, you are only transmitting 5,760 bits of data per second.  This really is a big difference, and that is still only raw bits once it gets through the actual serial communications channel.  A more typical 8 data bits, 1 Stop Bit, No Parity will be a little bit better at 9600 baud, with eight bits of data and only two bits used for overhead.  That gives a total throughput of 7,680 bits per second.  A little bit better, but you can't simply presume that the baud rate indicates how much data is going to be transmitted.

== Relationship of Baud Rate to Maximum Distance ==

There are physical limits to how far serial data communication can occur over a piece of wire.  When you apply a voltage onto a wire it takes time for that voltage to traverse the wire, and there are other unstable conditions that happen when you send a &quot;pulse&quot; down the wire and change voltages too quickly.  This problem is worse as wires become longer and the frequency (i.e. baud rate) increases.  This distance can vary based on a number of factors, including the thickness of the wires involved, RF interference on the wires, quality of the wires during the manufacturing process, how well they were installed... e.g., are there any &quot;kinks&quot; in the wires that force it into a sharp bend, and finally the baud rate that you are transmitting the data. 

This table presumes a fairly straight and uniform cable that is typical for most low-voltage applications (i.e., not a power circuit that uses 110V to run your refrigerator, toaster, and television).  Typically something like a CAT-5 cable (also used for local networks or phone lines) should be more than sufficient for this purpose.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Baud Rate
! Maximum Distance (in feet)
! Maximum Distance (in meters)
|-
| 2400 || 3000 || 914.4
|-
| 4800 || 1000 || 304.8
|-
| 9600 || 500 || 152.4
|-
| 19200 || 50 || 15.24
|}

The distance limitation can be mitigated.  There are &quot;short haul modems&quot; that can extend this distance to several miles of cable.  There are also telephone lines, or conventional modems, and other long-distance communications techniques.  There are other ways to handle data in situations like this, and those signals can be converted to simple RS-232 data formats that a typical home computer can interpret.  Distance still can be a limiting factor for communication, although when you are talking about distances like to Saturn for the Cassini mission, serial data communication has other issues involved than just data loss due to cable length.  And yes, NASA/ESA is using serial data communication for transmitting those stunning images back to Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many Chinese families have extensive genealogical records, and in 
most cases there will be copies of these records at the local 
records division which is under the jurisdiction of the Public 
Security Bureau (i.e. the police).  However, because the records
people generally have a police/bureaucratic mindset, it is unlikely
that you will get access to the records by going directly to them.

Instead, the easiest way to get access to these records is to go through
the local overseas Chinese bureau of the particular village
that you are interested in.  Because overseas Chinese bureaus are 
specifically tasked with increasing links with overseas Chinese
in the hopes of getting investment, they are usually extremely
helpful and generally have the bureaucratic pull necessary to gain
access to genealogical records.

The type of records that you will find will usually contain a 
family tree of male members, often going back several hundred 
years, with a paragraph of noteworthy accomplishments of the
male members of a family going back several hundred years.

Recall that a tensor is a linear function which can convert vectors into 
scalars.  Recall also that a distance can be stated as a formula that
converts vectors to a scalar.  So can we express distance with tensors formulas?  Yes, we can.

The first problem comes in, in that tensors are linear functions, but we have some squares in our distance formula.  We can deal with this with a mathematical trick.  Consider the formula for distance in normal three dimensional Euclidean space using cartesian coordinates:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2 = \mathbf{d}x^2 + \mathbf{d}y^2 + \mathbf{d}z^2&lt;/math&gt;

We can rewrite this as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2 = \delta_{ij} \mathbf{d}x^i \mathbf{d}x^j&lt;/math&gt;

Now &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is obviously a tensor.  What type of tensor is it?  Well it takes two contravariant vectors and turns them into a scalar &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt;.  So it must be a covariant tensor of rank 2. &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is called the Kronecker delta tensor, which is 1 whenever &lt;math&gt;i = j&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise. In general, instead of components &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2 = g_{ij} \mathbf{d}x^i \mathbf{d}x^j&lt;/math&gt;

This leads us to a general metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. As shown earlier, in Euclidean 3-space, &lt;math&gt; \left( g_{ij} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the  Kronecker delta matrix.

And that is the equation of distances in Euclidean three space in tensor notation.

Now let's do special relativity using this notation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2=g_{\mu \nu} \mathbf{d}x^\mu \mathbf{d}x^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

where the Greek letters just 
remind us that we are summing over four dimensional space time.  Now in the case of special relativity &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is zero for where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are different, +1 for the space indices 1,2,3 and &lt;math&gt;-c^2&lt;/math&gt; for the time index.  We can call this special matrix
&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, giving us the formulas: 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2=\eta_{\mu \nu} \mathbf{d}x^\mu \mathbf{d}x^\nu &lt;/math&gt;

In general, however, &lt;math&gt;g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; will not be a constant. A simple example where we can see that is spherical coordinates, with the metric

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2 = \mathbf{d}r^2 + r^2 \mathbf{d}\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta \mathbf{d}\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;x^1 = r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^2 = \theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^3 = \phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{11} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{22} = r^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{33} = r^2 \sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g_{12} = g_{13} = g_{23} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. 

Also, a metric may have off-diagonal terms, as in

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}s^2 = 2 \mathbf{d}x \mathbf{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;g_{12} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{11} = g_{22} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Classical Mechanics|Up]] [[Classical Mechanics/Differential Equations|Next]]

== Overview: What is classical mechanics ==

As a prelude to this course, let me describe what classical mechanics is about.

Classical mechanics is a part of physics that deals with the motion of '''point masses''' (very small things) and '''rigid bodies''' (large things that can rotate as a whole but cannot change their shape). This is very useful in practice, since many objects in real life can be approximately considered to be either point masses or rigid bodies in most situations. 

Typical problems solved in classical mechanics are:

* To find the trajectory of a stone thrown into the air with known initial velocity. (The stone is considered to be a point mass.)
* To predict the motion of a spacecraft approaching some planet, if its initial position and velocity far from the planet are known. (The spacecraft is considered to be a point mass.)
* To find out how many revolutions per minute a disc will be executing if we know the strength of the engine driving the rotation. (The disc is considered to be a rigid body rotating as a whole.)
* To find how much energy and how much time is needed to accelerate a small object to a given speed. (Point mass.)
* To find the frequency of oscillations in a system of point masses connected by springs.
Of course, one can consider also much more complicated problems than these. For example:
* A light spinning top stands at an angle on the surface of a heavy cylinder that can roll along a horizontal plane without sliding. Determine the conditions that would allow the top to avoid falling off the cylinder. (Both the cylinder and the top are considered rigid bodies.)
* A spacecraft launched from the Earth needs to reach the surface of Mars within a certain time. Predict the most appropriate time of year for this mission and determine the least amount of rocket fuel needed. (The spacecraft is considered a point mass moving in the gravitational field of the Sun, the Earth, and Mars.)

== Mathematical methods used ==

Classical mechanics uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the properties of bodies mathematically. Thus, coordinates, angles, etc. are numbers that depend on time, e.g. &lt;math&gt;x(t),y(t),z(t),\phi(t),\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and satisfy certain (systems of) ODEs.

One can use several mathematical methods  to solve such equations. In some cases, solutions can be found exactly, for instance: &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}(t)+x(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; has the general solution &lt;math&gt;A\sin(t)+B\cos(t)&lt;/math&gt;. In other cases, solutions are found only in terms of integrals that one cannot evaluate in closed form. Sometimes, one can solve the equation approximately using some method such as perturbation theory. Finally, any ODE can be solved numerically (using a computer program) up to a certain precision. 

Students of mechanics are expected to learn methods of solving certain standard differential equations that are exactly solvable, for instance: multidimensional harmonic oscillators, motion in 1-dimensional force field, motion in 3-dimensional central force field.  Numerical methods for solving ODEs are important in practice but are usually not studied as part of classical mechanics because these methods are not specific to mechanics but are equally applicable to every differential equation. Numerical methods for solving various equations are best studied in a dedicated course that involves hands-on computer programming.

== Newtonian mechanics ==

The first successful theory of  classical mechanics is contained in Newton's '''three laws of mechanics''' that govern the motion of point masses:

# There exist reference frames where a point mass not interacting with other bodies will move with constant speed in the same direction. (If this is not true in some reference frame, then that reference frame is '''not inertial'''. Further laws are formulated in inertial frames.)
# A point mass interacting with other bodies moves with the acceleration &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; found from &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=m\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all forces acting on the body, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body, and &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, i.e. the second derivative of the position vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the time.
# All forces are caused by other point masses, and whenever a point mass 1 exerts a force &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; on a point mass 2, the point mass 2  also exerts the force &lt;math&gt;-\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; on the point mass 1.

The motion of all point masses is described by differential equations which can be solved directly as long as all relevant forces could be predicted or measured. ''I assume'' that you are already familiar with these laws and with typical situations where they apply (e.g. motion of bodies thrown at an angle near Earth) before you start studying theoretical mechanics.

In Newtonian mechanics, a rigid body is simply a collection of point masses connected by &quot;rigid sticks.&quot; These sticks are &quot;rigid&quot; because they always produce exactly such forces as to keep constant distances between all points, regardless of any other forces or motions. Thus the motion of rigid bodies can be described without introducing any other special rules. One ''derives'' the concept of angular momentum, torque, etc., from Newton's laws without any additional postulates.

=== From Newtonian mechanics to &quot;theoretical&quot; mechanics ===

The necessity to consider point masses is certainly inconvenient if one needs to describe liquids and gases, so a special branch of mechanics with its own formalism was developed for that purpose, namely '''continuum mechanics''' (mechanics of continuous media). The formalism of continuum mechanics is generalized to '''field theory''' where the basic object is not a point mass but a &lt;i&gt;field&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. some abstract &quot;substance&quot; that is present at all points in space and shows its influence at every point at once. (Examples are: gravitational field, electric field, and magnetic field.) Such substances may be described by a function of space and time, for example the vector field &lt;math&gt;\vec E(t,\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; describes the electric field. The behavior of fields is usually governed by partial differential equations; for example, the electric field &lt;math&gt;\vec E(t,\vec x)&lt;/math&gt; and the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec B(t,\vec x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy Maxwell's equations.

As more and more complicated problems needed to be solved, various mathematical tools were developed to simplify and to generalize the mathematical description of mechanics. Finally, the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics were discovered. These two formulations still remain the cornerstones of classical mechanics and field theory, as well as Einstein's theory of relativity, and thus indirectly of all modern theoretical physics. These formulations of mechanics are not based on the assumption of &quot;forces&quot; and are equally applicable to point masses, rigid bodies, fields, and continuous media. The main subject of '''theoretical mechanics''' (sometimes also called &quot;analytical mechanics&quot;) is the study of these more refined and more general mathematical formulations of classical mechanics.

== Overview: what is this &quot;minimal standard course&quot; ==

Much of theoretical physics is based on concepts from theoretical mechanics, such as the variation of the action, symmetry transformations, or the Hamiltonian. The goal of this course is to introduce the material that you absolutely need to learn if you would like to have a solid foundation for the study of theoretical physics.

In this text, I do not write the words &quot;definition&quot;, &quot;theorem&quot;, or &quot;proof&quot;  like one does in mathematical texts. However, the same structure is present. I show new concepts in '''boldface''' within the sentence where they are defined.

=== Prerequisites ===

* You can solve simple algebraic equations, such as &lt;math&gt;x - \frac{2}{x} - 1 =0&lt;/math&gt;.
* You can solve simple differential equations such as &lt;math&gt;\ddot x(t) + 2x(t)=3&lt;/math&gt; with initial conditions such as &lt;math&gt;x(0)=1,\dot x(0)=2&lt;/math&gt;.
* You can manipulate three-dimensional vectors, compute vector sums, scalar products, vector (cross) products, projections on axes, angles between lines.
* You are familiar with basic linear algebra (matrices, matrix multiplication, eigenvectors, diagonalization of matrices).
* You can compute (or quickly look up) elementary integrals such as &lt;math&gt;\int_3^4 \sqrt{5x^2+8}~dx&lt;/math&gt;.
* You are familiar with multivariate calculus, can compute partial derivatives, for example &lt;math&gt;\partial _y \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* You are familiar with (European) school-level mechanics, including Newton's laws, forces in static configurations, motion in straight lines and in circles, and basic ideas about rotation of rigid bodies and torque.

=== Core material ===

The '''minimal standard course''' in theoretical mechanics consists of:

* Initial study of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalisms.
** A general formulation of mechanics, applicable to all systems, can be achieved using a variation principle (also known as the '''action principle'''). All information about a particular mechanical system is encapsulated by its '''Lagrangian''', which is a function &lt;math&gt;L(q_i,\dot q_i,t)&lt;/math&gt;. We derive the equations of motion in the general case, for an arbitrary mechanical system.
** You already know how simple mechanical problems can be solved by elementary methods using forces, torques, etc., and now you will see how the same problems are reformulated using Lagrangians. You will see that is rather straightforward to find the Lagrangian for any particular system. Then it becomes apparent that many problems are much easier to solve using these formulations.
** You need to gain some experience formulating various mechanical problems in terms of Lagrangians. Basically, you should be able to deal with any practical situation involving point masses, springs, sticks, ropes, frictionless rails, pendulums, balls rolling along cylinders rolling along planes, and so on. You need to learn how to best choose the coordinates or how to discover conservation laws in such systems. This comes only with experience solving practice problems.
** Rotation of rigid bodies presents extra difficulties because of the complicated geometry. You need to learn some methods for dealing with these situations efficiently (tensor of inertia, Euler angles, rotating frames of reference).
** The Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics is derived from the Lagrangian formulation. (For solving practical problems, the Hamiltonian formalism is less useful than the Lagrangian one, although it is somewhat more elegant mathematically. However, the Hamiltonian formalism is of such extraordinary importance in theoretical physics that it is usually studied early on, within the course of theoretical mechanics.)
** Special relativity is usually introduced at this point using the formalism of four-dimensional vectors. In the Lagrangian formulation, this is a perfectly ordinary mechanical theory with a somewhat unusual Lagrangian. You need to develop some physical intuition for the various relativistic effects and also become familiar with the four-dimensional description of the world as a '''spacetime'''. Without special relativity and the four-dimensional view of the world, the road to much of theoretical physics is essentially closed.
* Study of the mathematical methods needed to actually solve practical problems.
** You need to learn how to solve various differential equations and systems of such equations. The typical equation is that of the harmonic oscillator with a driving force, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}+\omega^2 x=f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, you need to be able to find general solutions as well as particular solutions for given initial conditions. At this point we study only equations that can be solved exactly.
** You need to gain experience analyzing the behavior of solutions of various types of equations: linear systems, oscillations and resonance, and some simple kinds of solvable nonlinear equations such as the Kepler problem. These are very old problems that occur time and again in physics, so you should become very familiar with the qualitative features of their solutions.
** You need to learn some basic ideas of the calculus of variations. In particular, you need to understand the concept of a functional, and to learn to compute functional derivatives (i.e. &quot;variations&quot; of functionals). Otherwise you cannot really understand the use of the variational principle, which is ''very important'' in all of theoretical physics.

You usually need to solve several practice problems for each mathematical method, so that you can see how these methods work and gain experience.

=== Extra material ===

The above topics are considered standard because one cannot continue studying theoretical physics without having mastered them. There are also more advanced topics that build upon the standard ones and lead to other areas of physics:

* Methods of perturbation theory, nonlinear oscillations, parametric resonance, adiabatic invariants (useful for celestial mechanics, chaos, and other things).
* Use of quaternions instead of Euler angles to describe the position of rigid bodies (useful for numerical simulations of missile motion).
* Elements of scattering theory: elastic/inelastic scattering; cross-sections in central potentials (preparation for particle physics).
* A general definition of &quot;symmetry&quot; and the derivation of conservation laws (Noether's theorem). This is essentially a preparation for gauge field theory, which is the basis for particle physics.
* Symmetries and oscillations in multi-dimensional systems (e.g. oscillations of molecules).
* The action-angle variables and questions of integrability (preparation for chaos theory).
* Canonical transformations, Hamilton-Jacobi equation -- tools to discover integrable systems. (Needed mostly for mathematical physics.)
* Integral invariants, symplectic structures (tools to discover conservation laws and to explain the structure of the theory more deeply; useful in field theory).
* Dealing with constrained degenerate systems (preparation for gauge theories).
* Elements of continuous mechanics; continuity equations, stress-energy tensor, Euler equation. (Useful in hydrodynamics, electrodynamics of media, kinetics, etc.)

Some of these topics are usually included in a theoretical mechanics course at the lecturer's preference. History of theoretical mechanics is usually not studied; rather, students learn the contemporary, very much streamlined and simplified formulation of mechanics.

== Suggested books to study ==

There is an extraordinarily large number of textbooks in theoretical mechanics, because it is a fairly old and well-studied subject. You need any textbook on classical mechanics that you can understand and that talks about &quot;Lagrangians&quot; early on. (Books that only talk about accelerations, forces, and torques may be quite advanced but they do not cover the subject of ''theoretical mechanics''.)

* H. Goldstein. ''Classical mechanics''. - Has everything standard in it and quite a few advanced topics. An old classic.
* L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch. ''Analytical mechanics'' (Cambridge, 1998). - A fresher, more didactic exposition of mechanics. Standard material.
* V.I. Arnold. ''Mathematical methods of classical mechanics''. -- Has almost nothing standard in it but is excellent for a more mathematically minded student.

== Mechanics considered using forces ==

In Newtonian mechanics, a mechanical system is always made up of point masses or rigid bodies, and these are subject to known forces. One must therefore specify the composition of the system and the nature of forces that act on the various bodies. Then one writes the equations of motion for the system. Here are some examples of how one describes mechanical systems in Newtonian mechanics (these examples are surely known to you from school-level physics).

* Example: a free mass point.

This is the most trivial of all mechanical systems: a mass point that does not interact with any other bodies and is subject to no forces. Introduce the coordinates &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; to describe the position of the mass point. Since the force is always equal to zero, the equations of motion are &lt;math&gt;\ddot x=0, \ddot y=0, \ddot z=0&lt;/math&gt;. The general solution of these equations describes a linear motion with constant velocity: &lt;math&gt;x=x_0 + v_x t&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

* Example: two point masses with springs attached to a motionless wall.
[[File:Lagrangian ex01.png|noframe|none|Physics spring example]]

Two masses can move along a line (the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis) without friction. The mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is attached to the wall by a spring, and the mass &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; is attached to the mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; by a spring. Both springs have spring constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the unstretched length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

To write the equations of motion, we first introduce the two coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2&lt;/math&gt; and then consider the forces acting on the two masses. The force on the mass  &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the leftward-pointing force &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; from the left spring and the rightward-pointing force &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; from the right spring. The force on &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; is a leftward-pointing &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;. By definition of a &quot;spring&quot; we have &lt;math&gt;F_1 = k (x_1-L)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;F_2 = k (x_2 - x_1 - L)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we write the equations for the accelerations &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2&lt;/math&gt; of the two masses:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \ddot {x_1} = \frac{F_2 - F_1}{m_1} = \frac{k}{m_1} (x_2 -x_1 -L) - \frac{k}{m_1} (x_1 -L),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \ddot {x_2} = - \frac{F_2}{m_2} = - \frac{k}{m_2} (x_2 -x_1 -L).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
At this point we are finished describing the system; we now need to solve these equations for particular initial conditions and determine the actual motion of this system.

== Introducing the action principle ==

The '''Lagrangian description''' of a mechanical system is rather different: First, we do not ask for the evolution of the system given some initial conditions, but instead assume that the position of the system at two different time moments &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; is known and fixed. For convenience, let us collect all coordinates (such as &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2&lt;/math&gt; above) into one array of &quot;generalized coordinates&quot; and denote them by &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;. So the &quot;boundary conditions&quot; that we impose on the system are &lt;math&gt;q_i(t_1)=A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i(t_2)=B_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_i,B_i&lt;/math&gt; are fixed numbers. We now ask: how does the system move ''between'' the time moments &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;. The Lagrangian description answers: during that time, the system ''must move in such a way'' as to give the minimum value to the integral &lt;math&gt;\int _{t_1}^{t_2} L(q_i,\dot q_i) dt&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L(q_i, \dot q_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a known function called the '''Lagrange function''' or  '''Lagrangian'''. For example, the Lagrangian for a free mass point is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;L(x,y,z,\dot x, \dot y, \dot z) = \frac{m}{2} [\dot x^2 +\dot y^2 +\dot z^2].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
The Lagrangian for the above example with two masses attached to the wall is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;L(x_1,x_2,\dot x_1, \dot x_2) = \frac{m}{2} [\dot x_1^2 +\dot x_2^2] - \frac{k}{2} (x_1-L)^2 - \frac{k}{2}(x_2-x_1-L)^2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

For instance, according to the Lagrangian description, the free point mass moves in such a way that the functions &lt;math&gt;x(t),y(t),z(t)&lt;/math&gt; give the minimum value to the integral &lt;math&gt;\int _{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{m}{2}[\dot x^2 +\dot y^2 +\dot z^2]dt&lt;/math&gt;, where the values of &lt;math&gt;x(t),y(t),z(t)&lt;/math&gt; at times &lt;math&gt;t_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; are fixed.

In principle, to find the minimum value of the integral &lt;math&gt;\int _{t_1}^{t_2} L(q_i,\dot q_i) dt&lt;/math&gt; one would have to evaluate that integral for each possible trajectory &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and then choose the &quot;optimal&quot; trajectory &lt;math&gt;q_i^{*}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for which this integral has the smallest value. (Of course, we shall learn and use a much more efficient mathematical approach to determine this &quot;optimal&quot; trajectory instead of trying every possible set of functions &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;.) The value of the mentioned integral is called the '''action''' corresponding to a particular trajectory &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the requirement that the integral should have the smallest value is often called &quot;the principle of least action&quot; or just '''action principle'''.

At this point, we need to answer the pressing question:
* How can it be that the correct trajectory &lt;math&gt;q_i^{*}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is found not by considering the forces but by requiring that some integral should have the minimum value? How does each point mass &quot;know&quot; that it needs to minimize some integral when it moves around?
The short answer is that the least action requirement is ''mathematically equivalent'' to the consideration of forces if the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen correctly.  The condition that some integral has the minimum value (when the integral is correctly chosen) is mathematically the same as the Newtonian equations for the acceleration. The point masses perhaps &quot;know&quot; nothing about this integral. It is simply mathematically convenient to formulate the mechanical laws in one sentence rather than in many sentences. (We shall see another, more intuitive explanation [[Classical Mechanics/Lagrange Theory|below]].)

Suppose that we understand how the requirement that an integral has the minimum value can be translated into equations for the acceleration. Obviously the form of the integral needs to be different for each mechanical system since the equations of motion are different. Then the second question presents itself:
* How can we find the Lagrange function &lt;math&gt;L(q_i, \dot q_i)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to each mechanical system?
This is a more complicated problem and one needs to study many examples to gain a command of this approach. (In brief: the Lagrange function is the kinetic energy minus the potential energy.)

Before considering Lagrange functions, we shall look at how the mathematical requirement of &quot;least action&quot; can be equivalent to equations of motion such as given in the examples above.

== Variation of a functional ==

A function is a map from numbers into numbers; a '''functional''' is a map from functions into numbers. An application of a functional to a function is usually denoted by square brackets, e.g. &lt;math&gt;S[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;.

Random examples of functionals, just to illustrate the concept: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S[f(x)] = \int _0 ^\infty \sqrt{f(3x)}dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S[f(x)] = \int _{-1} ^1 \frac{f(x)}{1-x^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S[f(x)] = f(15) - 8 f'(3) - \int _0 ^1 \sin\left[(f(x-2)+\sqrt{x}e^{-x})^3\right] dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In principle, a functional can be anything that assigns a number to any function. In practice, only some functionals are interesting and have applications in physics.

Since the action integral maps trajectories into numbers, we can call it the '''action functional'''. The action principle is formulated as follows: the trajectory &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; must be such that the action functional evaluated on this trajectory has the minimum value among all trajectories.

This may appear to be similar to the familiar condition for the mechanical equilibrium: the coordinates &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are such that the potential energy has the minimum value. However, there is a crucial difference: when we minimize the potential energy, we vary the three numbers &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; until we find the minimum value; but when we minimize a ''functional'', we have to vary the ''whole function'' &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; until we find the minimum value of the functional.

The branch of mathematics known as '''calculus of variations''' studies the problem of minimizing (maximizing, extremizing) functionals. One needs to learn a little bit of variational calculus at this point. Let us begin by solving some easy minimization problems involving functions of many variables; this will prepare us for dealing with functionals which can be thought of as functions of infinitely many variables. You should try the examples yourself before looking at the solutions.

''Example 1'': Minimize the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2+xy+y^2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt;.

''Solution:'' Compute the partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt;. These derivatives must both be equal to zero. This can only happen if &lt;math&gt;x=0, y=0&lt;/math&gt;.


''Example 2'': Minimize the function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,...,x_n) = x_1^2+x_1 x_2+x_2^2+x_2 x_3+...+x_n^2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to all &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;.

''Solution:'' Compute the partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to all &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt;. These derivatives must all be equal to zero. This can only happen if all &lt;math&gt;x_j=0&lt;/math&gt;.

''Example 3'': Minimize the function &lt;math&gt;f(x_0,...,x_n) = (x_1-x_0)^2+(x_2-x_1)^2+...+(x_n-x_{n-1})^2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to all &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; subject to the restrictions &lt;math&gt;x_0=0, x_n=A&lt;/math&gt;.

''Solution:'' Compute the partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j=2,...,n-1&lt;/math&gt;. These derivatives must all be equal to zero. This can only happen if &lt;math&gt;x_j-x_{j-1}=x_{j+1}-x_j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,...,n-1&lt;/math&gt;. The values &lt;math&gt;x_0, x_n&lt;/math&gt; are known, therefore we find &lt;math&gt;x_j=jA/n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Intuitive calculation ===

Let us now consider the problem of minimizing the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]=\int _0 ^1 {\dot x(t)}^2 dt&lt;/math&gt; with respect to all functions &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; subject to the restrictions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=0, x(1)=L&lt;/math&gt;. We shall first perform the minimization in a more intuitive but approximate way, and then we shall see how the same task is handled more elegantly by the variational calculus.

Let us imagine that we are trying to minimize the integral &lt;math&gt;L[x]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to all functions &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; using a digital computer. The first problem is that we cannot represent &quot;all functions&quot; &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; on a computer because we can only store ''finitely many'' values &lt;math&gt;x(t_0), x(t_1), ..., x(t_N)&lt;/math&gt; in an array within the computer memory. So we split the time interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; into a large number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of discrete steps &lt;math&gt;[0,t_1], [t_1, t_2], ..., [t_{N-1}, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, where the step size &lt;math&gt;t_j-t_{j-1}\equiv \Delta t = 1/N&lt;/math&gt; is small; in other words, &lt;math&gt;t_j = j/N, j=1, ..., N-1&lt;/math&gt;. We can describe the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; by its values &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; at the points &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a ''straight line'' between these points. The time moments &lt;math&gt;t_1, ..., t_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; will be kept fixed, and then the various values &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; will correspond to various possible functions &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  (In this way we definitely will not describe ''all'' possible functions &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, but the class of functions we ''do'' describe is broad enough so that we get the correct results in the limit &lt;math&gt;N\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Basically, any function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be sufficiently well approximated by one of these &quot;piecewise-linear&quot; functions when the step size &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is small enough.)

Since we have discretized the time and reduced our attention to piecewise-linear functions, we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot x = \frac{x_j-x_{j-1}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
within each interval &lt;math&gt;t\in[t_{j-1}, t_j]&lt;/math&gt;.
So we can express the integral &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; as the finite sum,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; S[x] =\int _0^1 {\dot x(t)}^2 dt = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{{(x_j-x_{j-1})}^2}{\Delta t^2} \Delta t,  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we have defined for convenience &lt;math&gt;t_0 =0, t_N = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

At this point we can perform the minimization of &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; quite easily. The functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; is now a ''function'' of &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;S[x]=S(x_1,...,x_{N-1})&lt;/math&gt;, so the minimum is achieved at the values &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; where the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;S(x_1,...,x_{N-1})&lt;/math&gt; with respect to each &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; are zero. This problem is now quite similar to the Example 3 above, so the solution is &lt;math&gt;x_j = jL/N, j=0,...,N&lt;/math&gt;. Now we recall that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the unknown function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;t_j=j/N&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the minimum of the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; is found at the values &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; such that would correspond to the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Lt&lt;/math&gt;. As we increase the number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of intervals, we still obtain the same function &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Lt&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the same function is obtained in the limit &lt;math&gt;N\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. We conclude that the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Lt&lt;/math&gt; minimizes the functional &lt;math&gt;L[x]&lt;/math&gt; with the restrictions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=0, x(1)=L&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Variational calculation ===

The above calculation has the advantage of being more intuitive and visual: it makes clear that minimization of a functional &lt;math&gt;S[x(t)]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is quite similar to the minimization of a function &lt;math&gt;S(x_1, ..., x_N)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a large number of variables &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; in the limit of infinitely many such variables. However, the formalism of variational calculus provides a much more efficient computational procedure. Here is how one calculates the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us consider a very small change &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and see how the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; changes:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x(t), \epsilon(t)] \equiv S[x(t)+\epsilon(t)]-S[x(t)].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
(In many textbooks, the change in &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and generally the change of any quantity &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt;. We chose to write &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt; for clarity.)

The functional &lt;math&gt;\delta S[x, \epsilon] &lt;/math&gt; is called the '''variation''' of the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt;  with respect to the change  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The variation is itself a functional depending on two functions, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;  is very small, we expect that the variation will be ''linear'' in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;, just like the variation in the value of a normal function is linear in the amount of change in the argument, e.g. &lt;math&gt;f(t+\alpha)-f(t)=f'(t) \alpha&lt;/math&gt; for small &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. So we expect that the variation &lt;math&gt;\delta S[x, \epsilon] &lt;/math&gt; of the functional  &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; will be a ''linear functional'' of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;. To understand what a linear functional looks like, consider a linear function &lt;math&gt;f(\epsilon_j)&lt;/math&gt; depending on several variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,...&lt;/math&gt;. This function can always be written as &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(\epsilon_j) = \sum_{j}^{} A_j \epsilon_j&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_j&lt;/math&gt; are suitable constants. Since a functional is like a function of infinitely many variables, the index &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; becomes a continuous variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the variables &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_j&lt;/math&gt; and the constants &lt;math&gt;A_j&lt;/math&gt; become functions &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t),A(t)&lt;/math&gt;, while the sum over &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; becomes an integral over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, a linear functional of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as an integral,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x, \epsilon]=\int _0^1 A(t) \epsilon(t) dt,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a suitable function. In the case of the usual function &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the &quot;suitable constant &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is the derivative &lt;math&gt;A=df(t)/dt&lt;/math&gt;. By analogy we call &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; above the '''variational derivative''' of the functional and denote it by &lt;math&gt;\delta S[x]/\delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

A function has a minimum (or maximum, or extremum) at a point where its derivative vanishes. So a functional &lt;math&gt;S[x(t)]&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum (or maximum, or extremum) at the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; where the functional derivative vanishes. We shall justify this statement below, and for now let us now compute the functional derivative of the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x(t)]=\int_0^1 \dot x^2 dt&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting &lt;math&gt;x(t)+\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; into the functional, we get
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x,\epsilon]=\int _0^1 [(\dot x+\dot \epsilon)^2-\dot x^2]dt=2\int_0^1\dot x \dot \epsilon dt +O(\epsilon^2),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we are going to neglect terms quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; and so we didn't write them out. We now need to rewrite this integral so that no derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; appear there; so we integrate by parts and find
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x(t),\epsilon(t)]= \left. \epsilon(t)\dot x(t)\right| _0^1 - 2\int _0^1 \ddot x(t) \epsilon(t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since in our case the values &lt;math&gt;x(0),x(1)&lt;/math&gt; are fixed, the function &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; must be such that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(0)=\epsilon(1)=0&lt;/math&gt;, so the boundary terms vanish. The variational derivative is therefore
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S/\delta x(t) = -2\ddot x(t).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; has an extremum when its variation under an ''arbitrary'' change &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; is second-order in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;. However, above we have obtained the variation as a first-order quantity, linear in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;; so this first-order quantity must vanish for &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; where the functional has an extremum. An integral such as &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 A(t) \epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; can vanish for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt; only if the function &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; vanishes for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. In our case, the &quot;function &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt;,&quot; i.e. the variational derivative &lt;math&gt;\delta S/\delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to &lt;math&gt;-2\ddot x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; on which the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; has an extremum must satisfy &lt;math&gt;-2\ddot x(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; or more simply &lt;math&gt;\ddot x=0&lt;/math&gt;. This differential equation has the general solution &lt;math&gt;x(t)=a+bt&lt;/math&gt;, and with the additional restrictions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=0,x(1)=L&lt;/math&gt; we immediately get the solution &lt;math&gt;x(t)=Lt&lt;/math&gt;.

=== General formulation ===

To summarize: the requirement that the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x(t)]&lt;/math&gt; must have an extremum at the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; leads to a differential equation on the unknown function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This differential equation is found as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x]/\delta x(t) =0. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The procedure is quite similar to finding on extremum of a function &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where the point &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of the extremum is found from the equation &lt;math&gt;df(t)/dt=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that we are now asked to minimize the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x(t)]=\int _0^1 (x^2+\dot x^2-x^4\sin t)dt&lt;/math&gt; subject to the restrictions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=0,x(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;; in mechanics we shall mostly be dealing with functionals of this kind. We might try to discretize the function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as we did above, but this is difficult. Moreover, for a different functional &lt;math&gt;S[x]&lt;/math&gt; everything will have to be computed anew. Rather than go through the above procedure again and again, let us now derive the formula for the functional derivative for all functionals of this form, namely
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S[x_i(t)]=\int_a^b L(x_i,\dot x_i,t)dt,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L(x_i,v_i,t)dt&lt;/math&gt; is a given function of the coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and velocities &lt;math&gt;v_i\equiv \dot x_i&lt;/math&gt; (assuming that there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; coordinates, so &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt;). This function &lt;math&gt;L(x_i,v_i,t)dt&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Lagrange function''' or simply the '''Lagrangian'''.

We introduce the infinitesimal changes &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; into the functions &lt;math&gt;x_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and express the variation of the functional first through &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot\epsilon_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x_i(t),\epsilon_i(t)]=\int_a^b \sum _{i=1}^n\left[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}\epsilon_i(t)+\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i}\dot \epsilon_i(t) \right] dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Then we integrate by parts, discard the boundary terms and obtain
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta S[x_i(t),\epsilon_i(t)]=\int_a^b \sum _{i=1}^n\left[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i} \right] \epsilon_i(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Thus the variational derivatives can be written as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta S[x]}{\delta x_i(t)}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Euler-Lagrange equations ===

Consider again the condition for a functional to have an extremum at &lt;math&gt;x_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;: the first-order variation must vanish. We have derived the above formula for the variation &lt;math&gt;\delta S[x_i, \epsilon_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Since all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; are completely arbitrary (subject only to the boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i(a)=\epsilon_i(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;), the first-order variation vanishes only if the functions in square brackets all vanish at all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we obtain the '''Euler-Lagrange equations'''
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
These are the differential equations that express the mathematical requirement that the functional &lt;math&gt;S[x_i(t),\dot x_i(t),t]&lt;/math&gt; has an extremum at the set of functions &lt;math&gt;x_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;. There are as many equations as unknown functions &lt;math&gt;x_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, one equation for each &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the Euler-Lagrange equations involve partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to coordinates and velocities.
The derivatives with respect to velocities &lt;math&gt;v=\dot x&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes written as &lt;math&gt;\partial L/\partial \dot x&lt;/math&gt; which might at first sight appear confusing.
However, all that is meant by this notation is the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;L(x,v,t)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to its second argument.

The Euler-Lagrange equations also involve the derivative &lt;math&gt;d/dt&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the time. This is ''not'' a partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; but a '''total derivative'''. In other words, to compute &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x_i}&lt;/math&gt;, we need to substitute the functions &lt;math&gt;x_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot x_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; into the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x_i}&lt;/math&gt;, thus obtain a function of time only, and then take the derivative of this function with respect to time.

'''Remark:''' If the Lagrangian contains higher derivatives (e.g. the second derivative), the Euler-Lagrange formula is different. For example, if the Lagrangian is &lt;math&gt;L=L(x,\dot x, \ddot x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the Euler-Lagrange equation is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x} + \frac {d^2}{dt^2}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \ddot x}= 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that this equation may be up to fourth-order in time derivatives! Usually, one does not encounter such Lagrangians in studies of classical mechanics because ordinary systems are described by Lagrangians containing only first-order derivatives.

'''Summary:''' In mechanics, one specifies a system by writing a Lagrangian and pointing out the unknown functions in it. From that, one derives the equations of motion using the Euler-Lagrange formula. You need to know that formula really well and to understand how to apply it. This comes only with practice.

== How to choose the Lagrangian ==

The basic rule is that the Lagrangian is equal to the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. (Both should be measured in an inertial system of reference! In a non-inertial system, this rule may fail.)

It can be shown that this rule works for an arbitrary mechanical system made up of point masses, springs, ropes, frictionless rails, etc., regardless of how one introduces the generalized coordinates. We shall not study the proof of this statement, but instead go directly to the examples of Lagrangians for various systems.

=== Examples of Lagrangians ===

* The Lagrangian for a free point mass moving along a straight line with coordinate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;L=\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
:{| class=&quot;toccolours collapsible collapsed&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
!Solution
|-
|
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot x}=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial\dot x}\left(\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2\right)=m\dot x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial\dot x}\left(\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2\right)=m\ddot x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Euler-Lagrange equation reduces to,
&lt;math&gt; 0 - m\ddot x=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ddot x=0&lt;/math&gt;, which states that a particle experiencing no forces will have no acceleration.

* A point mass moving along a straight line with coordinate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, in a force field with potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;L=\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2 - V(x).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
:{| class=&quot;toccolours collapsible collapsed&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
!Solution
|-
|
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot x}=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2 - V(x)\right)=-V'(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial\dot x}\left(\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2 - V(x)\right)=m\dot x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial}{\partial\dot x}\left(\frac{1}{2} m {\dot x}^2 - V(x)\right)=m\ddot x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Euler-Lagrange equation reduces to,&lt;math&gt; -V'(x) - m\ddot x=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m\ddot x=-V'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  
If &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;V(x) = mgx&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V'(x) = -mg&lt;/math&gt; and the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes &lt;math&gt;\ddot x=-g&lt;/math&gt;.  This aligns with the Newtonian result that the acceleration of an object in a gravitational field is &lt;math&gt;-g&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
* A point mass moving in three-dimensional space with coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_i\equiv (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;, in a force field with potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;L=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^3 \left(  m {\dot x_i}^2\right) - V(x,y,z)=\frac{m}{2}|\dot\vec x|^2-V(\vec x).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

* A point mass constrained to move along the circle &lt;math&gt;x^2+z^2=R^2&lt;/math&gt; in the gravitational field near the Earth (the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis is vertical). It is convenient to introduce the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; as the coordinate, with &lt;math&gt;z=R\cos\theta, x=R\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then the potential energy is &lt;math&gt;U=mgz=mgR\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;, while the kinetic energy is &lt;math&gt;K=mv^2/2=mR^2\omega^2/2=mR^2\dot\theta^2/2&lt;/math&gt;. So the Lagrangian is
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;L=K-U=\frac{m}{2}R^2\dot\theta^2-mgR\cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
Note that we have written the Lagrangian (and therefore we can derive the equations of motion) without knowing the force needed to keep the mass moving along the circle. This shows the great conceptual advantage of the Lagrangian approach; in the traditional Newtonian approach, the first step would be to determine this force, which is initially unknown, from a system of equations involving an unknown acceleration of the point mass.

* Two (equal) point masses connected by a spring with length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2}(\dot x_1^2 + \dot x_2^2)-\frac{k}{2}(x_1-x_2-l)^2.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

* A ''mathematical pendulum'', i.e. a massless rigid stick of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; with a point mass attached at the end, that can move only in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; plane in the gravitational field near the Earth (vertical &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis). As the coordinate, we choose the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; between the stick and the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis. The Lagrangian is
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;L=\frac{m}{2} l^2 \dot \theta^2 +mgl\cos\theta .&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

* A point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; sliding without friction along an inclined plane that makes an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with the horizontal, in the gravitational field of the Earth. As the coordinate, we choose &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the incline. The height &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is then &lt;math&gt;z=x\tan\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so the potential energy is &lt;math&gt;U=mgz=mgx\tan\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The kinetic energy is computed as 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{m}{2} (\dot x^2 + \dot y^2 + \dot z^2)=\frac{m}{2} (\dot x^2/\cos^2\alpha + \dot y^2).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Hence, the Lagrangian is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;L=K-U=\frac{m}{2} (\dot x^2/\cos^2\alpha + \dot y^2) -mgx\tan\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Further work ==

'''Exercise:''' You should now determine the Euler-Lagrange equations that follow from each the above Lagrangians and verify that these equations are the same as would be obtained from school-level Newtonian considerations for the respective physical systems. This should occupy you for at most an hour or two. Only then you will begin to appreciate the power of the Lagrangian approach.

[[Classical Mechanics/Lagrangian Exercises|Some more Lagrangian exercises here.]]

For more examples of setting up Lagrangians for mechanical systems and for deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations, ask your physics teacher or look up in any theoretical mechanics problem book. Much of the time, the Euler-Lagrange equations for some complicated system (say, a pendulum attached to the endpoint of another pendulum) would be too difficult to solve, but the point is to gain experience deriving them. Their derivation would be much less straightforward in the old Newtonian approach using forces.

[[Classical Mechanics/Differential Equations|See here for a very brief primer on differential equations.]]

If this is your first time looking at Lagrangians, you might be still asking yourself: how could the motion of a system be described by saying that some integral has the minimal value? Is it a purely formal mathematical trick, and if not, how can one get a more visually intuitive understanding? A partial answer is [[Classical Mechanics/Lagrange Theory|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you've got some skill and control over the guitar, you want to start writing and performing your own songs. But all your famous artists have such amazing, complicated songs, it's hard to know where to begin.

This page is a general guide to writing songs on the guitar. Although it won't necessarily teach you to write a Top 40 hit, it will give you some general ideas on how to write an effective song. If you haven't already, please read the [[Guitar/Singing and Playing|Singing and Playing]] section.

==General Tips==

* '''Keep it simple.''' The most popular, catchy tune on the radio is probably the simplest, most oft reproduced melody in the world. But that doesn't stop you from humming it all day, does it? Never forget that when some people hear &quot;a complex, thought-provoking piece&quot;, others hear &quot;an over complicated mess.&quot;
* '''Have confidence.''' Your song may not be the best in the world, but a gutsy, less talented performer is always more admired than an amazing performer that is too shy to get a single note out.
* '''Keep trying.''' If you don't &quot;figure it out&quot; immediately, that doesn't mean that you never will. If something sounds terrible, try the opposite, or only use the second half of whatever your work on. The key is to keep trying different things until something clicks.
* '''Don't get frustrated.''' If absolutely nothing is clicking, then just come back to it later. Record whatever you have, take a break, and play it again later. The song isn't going anywhere you aren't going, and it'll still be there the next day.
* '''&quot;Borrow&quot; someone else's melody.''' Often the best melody is the one that already exists. The history of music (and any art, really) is checkered with people taking bits and pieces from other artists and adding their own spin to it. However, this doesn't mean you should just copy some famous song and call it your own, because chances are someone else will notice. Other songs should be used as a source of ideas, not something you can photocopy.
* '''Ask someone else.''' You might be stuck in the same rut, but that doesn't mean anyone else is. Ask another musician (or even a regular person) what they think might fit well. Sometimes the advice will be surprising. With this method you have to be careful of copyright issues, especially if you make it big.

==Turning Chords into Songs==

Often players come up with a catchy riff or two, and they're not sure how to develop it into more. Songs typically are built up in layers; for example, in a band, one guitarists creates a riff, and another adds a catchy lick over top, the bass player brings in something to support it and the drummer keeps time and adds some interesting rhythms. Even though the first guitar part might still be the same, it is ultimately the contribution of the other parts that turns a few chords into a song.

The most important thing to remember when writing a song is that very little sounds good completely on its own, and generally it requires at least more than one part to make things interesting. There are many ways to add a second part to a song. For instance, some players (especially those that can [[Guitar/Picking and Plucking|finger pick]]) can simultaneously play a bass line on the thicker strings and a melody on the thin strings. Really complicated riffs can also sound good on their own, however these tend to be difficult to write and you may not have enough technical skill for complicated writing.

Another player can also add depth to a riff. For example, a bass player can add another sound texture, and having two players allow them to bounce melodies off one another. The song Dueling Banjos from the movie Deliverance is a good example of how two players can create an interesting, purely instrumental song.

But if none of these options are available to you, or perhaps you only like to compose songs alone, there is always one other layer you can add to any progression; your voice. Amazing singing can turn even the simplest progression into a groundbreaking song

==Creating Melodies and Hooks== 

The main melody, often called the &quot;hook&quot; in popular, radio friendly music, is the catchy, often repeated words and melody that makes the song most memorable. In most songs, especially modern music, the hook is contained somewhere in the chorus. However, this is not always true, as some songs use hooks in the verses, or put hooks in both the verse and chorus.

In general, it is much easier to put words to a melody, rather than a melody to some words. Words tend to have their own syncopation,  and this can make it tough to make them fit with an irregular strumming pattern. Already having words is also tough because generally the author does not want to change them.

There are certain cases where putting music to words is a better option. For instance, a rhyming poem or free verse with a regular meter can easily be made a song. Simple [[Guitar/Chord Progressions|chord progressions]] lend themselves well to these sorts , especially the I - IV - V and IV - V - I.

Often when you are creating a song, a chord progression comes easily, but it is tough to figure out what goes over top. Even if it seems difficult, there are many ways to make things easier for yourself.

* Record a chord progression, then play it back and try to hum or whistle a melody over top. Often this is enough to get things started and get you unstuck. You can accomplish the same thing by just playing the progression over and over again, but it takes a surprising amount of coordination to play a new riff and spontaneously invent a melody.

* Record a chord progression, and then try to solo on top of it. This is similar to the first method, but actually using the fretboard can help you figure out what notes work best.

* Isolate a particular part of the progression and repeat it over and over until you come up with some sort of start. it is best to use at least two chord changes, because just strumming the same chord all the time is uninteresting, and it tends to make coming up with a melody even more difficult.

Another approach is to begin with a melody form, and then put chords behind it to turn it into a song. This may be more challenging, especially if you already have a chord progression you really enjoy, but sometimes approaching a problem from a different angle can make things easier overall.

For instance, in the well known 'Danny Boy' or 'Derry Air' as it is sometimes called, the 'hook' is found where the melody appears to try to surge forward into the chorus and the words &quot;But come ye back&quot; accompany that surge in chord progression.

==Use a Method==

It is recommended that you work following some simple procedures instead of just trying to come up with something remarkable from scratch. Here are some guidelines on how to work step by step in order to be more efficient.

* '''Choose or come up with a scale for the song before you start working on it.''' Although experienced guitarists might be able to follow a scale subconsciously, thus skipping this step, it is better for beginners to use a scale so as to avoid inconsistencies and to set a mood for the piece. Keep experimenting with scales until you find one that suits the tone you want to give and then start working on the song. Note that you can change scales for different parts of the song, what you shouldn't do is change scale in the middle of a single riff or melody. Also keep in mind that when you are more confident with your guitar you can break away from the scale and use notes not included in it, but the best way to work is to play along the predefined scale and play an odd note only when you want to add a different tone. This usually results in a more original melody, but is hard and might result in sounding like random notes if not used properly.

* '''Keep in mind the desired result.''' You won't get a very good result by simply coming up with random riffs. You must always focus on what you want to create. For example, you might want to create a complicated, original riff for the intro to attract the listener's attention or you might prefer a more melodic but less memorable intro. Either way, you must always have the goal in mind instead of composing aimlessly and keeping the riffs that sound good. This way you won't end up with a style you didn't intend to create.

* '''Start simple.''' If, for example you want a complex riff you should start with a very simple melody and then modify it gradually, by expanding it, for example, or altering the rhythm, until you get the desired result. This will not always give better results, but it's easy for beginners.

Here is a single JavaScript statement, which creates a pop-up dialog saying &quot;Hello World!&quot;:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

For the browser to execute the statement, it must be placed inside a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. This element describes which section of the HTML code contains executable code, and will be described in further detail later.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element should then be nested inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element of an HTML document. Assuming the page is viewed in a browser that has JavaScript enabled, the browser will execute (carry out) the statement as the page is loading.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Some Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The content of the web page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This basic hello World program can then be used as a starting point for any new programs that you need to create.

== Exercises ==
&lt;!--{{javascript-exercise 1}} --&gt;
=== Exercise 1-1 ===
Copy and paste the basic program in a file, save it on your hard disk as &quot;exercise 1-1.html&quot;. You can run it in two ways:
# By going to the file with a [[w:File manager|file manager]], and opening it using a web browser (e.g. in [[w:Windows Explorer|Windows Explorer]] it is done with a double click)
# By starting your browser, and then opening the file from the menu. For Firefox, that would be: Choose File in the menu, then Open File, then select the file.
What happens?

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
A dialog appears with the text: Hello World!
{{Hidden end}}

=== Exercise 1-2 ===
&lt;!--{{javascript-exercise 2}}--&gt;
Save the file above as &quot;exercise 1-2.html&quot;. Replace the double quotes in the line ''alert(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);'' with single quotes, so it reads ''alert('Hello World!');'' and save the result. If you open this file in the browser, what happens?

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
Nothing changes. A dialog appears with the text: Hello World! The double quotes and the single quotes are equivalent.

== Introduction ==
(translated from french)
Talking about child psychologie or genetic psychology embrasses the same subject studied.


Il arrive que l'on parle indifféremment de psychologie de l'enfant (même si l'adolescence en fait parde) ou de psychologie génétique. Maù l'angle du point de vue n'est pas tout a fait le même: lorsque l'on parle de psychologie de l'enfant on souligne son objet d'étude qui est l'enfance; en parlant de psychologie génétique nous privilégions la genèse des fonctions chez l'enfant (intelligence, affectivité, développement psychomoteur, etc.), ce n'est nullement une référence à la génétique biologique.

Si la psychologie générale s'est progressivement détachée de la philosophie au cours du XVRle[?] siècle il ne s'agissait au début que de spéculations métaphysiques; il était encore moins question de l'enfant.

La psychologie s'est émancipée comme science au cours du x~xe[?] siècle par la méthode dite expérimentale, methode qui consiste a observer les réactions précises d'une fonction donnée (attention, mémoire, sens de l'observation pour ne citer que quelques exemples) d'un individu précis dans une situation dite standardisée, et a[accent grave] observer les variations de la fonction de l'individu en fonction d'une variation de la situation standardisée.

Cette naissance de la psychologie scientifique se faisait avec les adultes (nous évoquerons plus loin la place particulière de la psychologie de l'enfant dans l'histoire~ 1 de la psychologie et notamment des théses de Freud considérant que le I développement de l'enfant était dominé par la sexual~té infantile). Malgré les résistances rencontrées par la psychanalyse et le scandale qu'elles provoquèrent dans une époque puritaine (début du xx~ siècle), elles firent de nombreux adeptes.

En y regardant de plus près nous nous rendons compte que le concept de «l'enfance~ n'est pas propre à la psychologie. Une mulatude de sciences s'intéressent à l'enfance et à son évolution. Citons d'abord la médecine qui a apporté de nombreuses connaissances sur la croissance somahique (corporelle) et neurologique de l'enfant, sur les varinaions physiologiques de tel ou tel organe du

I corps au cours de la croissance. La psychologie de l'enfant étudie la na~ssance et le foncaonnement de la vie psychique de l'enfant sous son double aspect affecaf et intellectuel. Nous y reviendrons tout au long de ce avre. Mais d'autres disciplines ont commencé à s'intéresser à l'enfance dès le xïx' siècle; par exemple au milieu du x~x siècle le législateur a commencé d réglementer puis interdire le travail des enfants; I'enfant devenait un sujet de droit intéressant cette discipline. Puis des histonens ont établi que la nenon de « I'enfance » n'existait pas dans l'Antiquité et s'était lentement consatuée à travers les siècles depuis le Moyen Age. La sociologie, qui étudiait la transformanon de la famille avec l'arrivée de l'industrialisahon et la migrahon des campagnes vers les villes, s'intéressait aussi à la place de l'enfant dans cene fami11e changeante. Il y a l'ethnologie qui étudie, entre autres, les modes d'éducahon et la place de l'enfant dans d'autres sociétés que celle du mod21e occiden~.

Nous pouvons parfois relever une certaine cacophonie lorsque l'on parle de l'enfance et il convient de préciser de quel point de vue on la considére et avec quels ouals de

I que11e discipline on l'étud~e.

| Ci-après nous donnerons quelques exemples (non exhausuifs) de «I'enfance~ comme sujet d'autres disàplines.

1- L'ENFANCE ET L'HISTOIRE

| Les historiens se sont intéressés au concept del'enfance surtout depuis la publication d'un livre devenu célètre, L'Enfant et la Vie famitale sous

I I'Ancien Régime de Philippe Ariès; on notera aussi les travaux de Michelle Perrot sur la famille et la vie privée et d'Elisabeth Badinter sur l'amour

I maternel. Ariès étudie la représentation de l'enfant dans l'art à travers les

| siècles et il a noté qu'avant les x~~e et xe siècles l'enfant était représenté comme un petit adulte c'est à dire reconnaissable uniquement par sa petite taille. Ce n'est qu'à partir du xe siècle que l'art (la peinture et la sculpture) accorde une morphologie propre à l'enfant représenté.

En partant de ce constat et en étudiant les modes de vie des populations (en France) à travers l'histoire, Ariès distingue deux périodes:

1 1'epériode:

• La société traditionnelle se représentait mal l'enfant et encore moins I'adolescent. La durée de l'enfance était réduite à sa période la plus fragile

quand l'enfant n'arrivait pas à se sufflre. L'enfant à peine débrouillé physiquement était mêlé aux adultes, partageant leurs travaux et leurs jeux. De trés petit enfant il devenait un homme jeune, sans passer par les étapes de la jeunesse devenues des aspects essentiels des sociétés évoluées d'aujourd'hui. La socialisation et la transmission des valeurs et savoirs n'étaient donc pas assurées par la famille, I'enfant s'éloignait vite de ses parents. L'éducation se faisait par l'apprentissage, grâce à la coexistence des enfants et des adultes. L'enfant tirait ses connaissances en aidant les adultes. Les échanges affectifs et les communications sociales avaient lieu en dehors de la famille, dans un milieu très dense et chaleureux composé de voisins, d'amis, de mâ~tres et serviteurs, d'enfants et de vieillards, de femmes et d'hommes.

2e période:

~ La 2e période commence à partir de la fin du xvlle siècle, lorsque progressivement l'école s'est substituée à l'apprentissage comme moyen d'éducation. L'enfant a cessé d'être mélangé aux adultes et d'apprendre la vie directement à leur contact. Il a été séparé des adultes et maintenu à l'écart (la scolarisation) avant d'être lâché dans le monde. Cette séparation des enfants et des adultes était due en très grande partie à la tentative de moralisation des hommes voulue par l'Eglise. Les parents s'intéressèrent aux études de leurs enfants et la famille devint ainsi un lieu d'affection. Pour Ariès le sentiment de famille est né avec la scolarisation intense de la jeunesse.

D'autres historiens ont affiné cette étude de l'enfance à travers les époques. Il semble donc maintenant assuré que la place accordée à l'enfant est variable suivant les sociétés et qu'elle s'est considérablement modiÉée à partir du xlxe siècle, sous l'effet du culte de la matemité. C'est à cette époque que l'enfant devient l'objet d'un attachement spécifique qui ne fera que cro^~tre avec les progrès de la médecine, puis la généralisation de la contraception dans les sociétés industrielles. Il semble aller de soi que plus le taux de mortalité diminue, plus la perte d'un enfant est douloureuse. De même, plus l'enfant est désiré consciemment, plus sa place est censée devenir importante dans l'affect parental. Cest dans ce contexte et dans la crise de la famille bourgeoise que sont nées la psychologie de l'enfant et la psychanalyse.

JavaScript is a loosely typed language. This means that you can use the same variable for different types of information, but you may also have to check what type a variable is yourself, if the differences matter. For example, if you wanted to add two numbers, but one variable turned out to be a string, the result wouldn't necessarily be what you expected.

== Variable declaration ==

Variables are commonly explicitly declared by the &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; statement, as shown below:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var c;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above variable is created, but has the default value of &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. To be of value, the variable needs to be initialized:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var c = 0;
&lt;/source&gt;

After being declared, a variable may be assigned a new value that will replace the old one:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
c = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

But make sure to declare a variable with &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; before (or while) assigning to it; otherwise you will create a &quot;[[JavaScript/Variables and Types#Scope|scope]] bug.&quot;

== Primitive types ==

Primitive types are types provided by the system, in this case by JavaScript. Primitive type for JavaScript are Booleans, numbers and text. In addition to the primitive types, users may define their own classes.

The primitive types are treated by JavaScript as value types and when you pass them around they go as values. Some types, such as string, allow method calls.

=== Boolean type ===

Boolean variables can only have 2 possible values, true or false.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var mayday = false;
var birthday = true;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Numeric types ===

You can use integer and double types on your variables, but they are treated as a numeric type.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var sal = 20;
var pal = 12.1;
&lt;/source&gt;

In ECMA JavaScript your number literals can go from 0 to -+1.79769e+308. And because 5e-324 is the smallest infinitesimal you can get, anything smaller is rounded to 0.

=== String types ===

The String and char types are all strings, so you can build any string literal that you wished for.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myName = &quot;Some Name&quot;;
var myChar = 'f';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Complex types ==

A complex type is an object, be it either standard or custom made. Its home is the heap and goes everywhere by reference.

=== Array type ===
{{main|JavaScript/Arrays}}

In JavaScript, all Arrays are untyped, so you can put everything you want in an Array and worry about that later.
Arrays are objects, they have methods and properties you can invoke at will. For example, the &lt;code&gt;.length&lt;/code&gt; property indicates how many items are currently in the array. If you add more items to the array, the value of the &lt;code&gt;.length&lt;/code&gt; gets larger. You can build yourself an array by using the statement &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, as shown below.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myArray = new Array(0, 2, 4);
var myOtherArray = new Array();
&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays can also be created with the array notation, which uses square brackets:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myArray = [0, 2, 4];
var myOtherArray = [];
&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays are accessed using the square brackets:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
myArray[2] = &quot;Hello&quot;;
var text = myArray[2];
&lt;/source&gt;

There is no limit to the number of items that can be stored in an array.

=== Object types ===

An object within JavaScript is created using the new operator:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myObject = new Object();
&lt;/source&gt;

Objects can also be created with the object notation, which uses curly braces:
&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var myObject = {};
&lt;/source&gt;

JavaScript objects can be built using inheritance and overriding, and you can use polymorphism. There are no scope modifiers, with all properties and methods having public access. More information on creating objects can be found in [[JavaScript/Object Oriented Programming|Object Oriented Programming]].

You can access browser built-in objects and objects provided through browser JavaScript extensions.

== Scope ==
In JavaScript, the scope is the current context of the code. It refers to the accessability of functions and variables, and  their context. There exists a ''global'' and a ''local'' scope. The understanding of scope is crucial to writing good code. Whenever the code accesses &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;, it accesses the object that &quot;owns&quot; the current scope.

===Global scope===
An entity like a function or a variable has '''global scope''' if it is accessible from everywhere in the code.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var a = 99;

function hello() {
    alert(&quot;Hello, &quot; + a + &quot;!&quot;);
}
hello();    // prints the string &quot;Hello, 99!&quot;
alert(a);    // prints the number 99
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is in global scope and accessible both in the main code part and the function &lt;code&gt;hello()&lt;/code&gt; itself.

===Local scope===
A '''local scope''' exists when an entity is defined in a certain code part, like a function.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var a = 99;

function hello() {
    var x = 5;
    alert(&quot;Hello, &quot; + (a + x) + &quot;!&quot;);
}
hello();    // prints the string &quot;Hello, 104!&quot;
alert(a);    // prints the number 99
alert(x);    // throws an exception
&lt;/source&gt;

If you watch the code on a browser (on Google Chrome, this is achieved by pressing F12), you will see an '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#colors&quot;&gt;Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' for the last line above. This is because &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is defined in the local scope of the function hello and is not accessible from the outer part of the code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rats ==
Rattus Norvegicus, the Norway rat, is also known as the Asian Brown Rat, the Brown Rat and the Barn Rat, and is the species of domesticated pet and laboratory rats as well as the common city &quot;sewer&quot; rat.  These animals are not nocturnal but semi-nocturnal, or crepuscular, like cats.  While they are &quot;up and down&quot; all the time, they are generally dozy during the day, becoming active at dusk.   Their close relative, Rattus Rattus -- the Asian Black Rat, Ship Rat or Roof Rat -- is more truly nocturnal: nearly comatose during the day and has developed an automatic bite reflex if disturbed in the nest during sleep cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Comparative Anatomy''' means to describe anatomy by comparing different species or individuals. Concerning the mammals, much of the anatomy is very similar. Despite totally different outer apearance of the legs, the muscles present there are roughly the same, each tagged by a name from human anatomy.
The inner organs tend to be a lot more different. While all animals have a digestive aparatus in the form of a long pipe, only the ruminants (cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat) have four rooms (compartments) in the stomach,viz., rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Create the header and footer files:

Create a file called &quot;header.php&quot; and enter the html code that you'd like at the top of each page as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;?php echo $title; ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Our Web Site&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- end header --&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a file called &quot;footer.php&quot; and enter the html code that you'd like at the bottom of each page as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!-- begin footer --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Site last changed on 1/1/2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we will create a web page that uses these headers and footers. 
Create a file called &quot;page.html&quot; and enter the following html code.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php
$title = &quot;Welcome&quot;;                   // (1) Set the title
include &quot;header.php&quot;;                 // (2) Include the header
?&gt;

&lt;!-- begin page content --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to our web site.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align: center;'&gt;
We're using PHP to provide you with dynamic content
for a better web experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end page content --&gt;

&lt;?php
include &quot;footer.php&quot;;                 // (3) Include the footer
?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


We set the title for the page using '''(1)'''&lt;br /&gt;
We then include the header page using '''(2)'''&lt;br /&gt;
And we include the footer page using '''(3)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The final page should look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Our Web Site&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- end header --&gt;

&lt;!-- begin page content --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to our web site.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align: center;'&gt;
We're using PHP to provide you with dynamic content
for a better web experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end page content --&gt;

&lt;!-- begin footer --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Site last changed on 1/1/2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Files included in this way act as if their text was inserted into the main document right at the include() call. PHP then continues to process the inserted file, allowing the inserted file to access all previously defined variables and functions (so $title in header.php was replaced with the value set in page.html: &quot;Welcome&quot;). This can have unintended consequences if a file is included more than once. To learn how to correctly include files containing functions and classes, see [[PHP Programming/PHP Include Files|PHP Include Files]].

'''Radioactivity''' is the conversion of one nuclear state to another. It is accompanied by the emission of particles or electromagnetic radiation. The nuclear state change can often involve a change in the atomic number of the atoms involved. The most well known forms of radiation emiited are ''alpha particles'' (helium nuclei - two protons bound with two neutrons), ''beta particles'' (energetic electrons) and ''gamma radiation'' (very high energy electromagnetic radiation). Another form of radioactivity is ''fission'' in which a nucleus splits into two smaller components.

== Natural Sources of Radiation ==

Most sources of natural, predictable radiation come from the decay of atomic nuclei, resulting in either alpha - &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or beta - &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; particles.  In general, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; decay is more common among the heavier elements, as it reduces the proton:neutron ratio, while &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay is much more prominent among lighter elements, as it converts a neutron into a proton.

Two prominent examples of radioactive decay are:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; decay:

&lt;math&gt;
U^{238} \longrightarrow Th^{234} + He^{4}(\alpha)
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the first decay in the famous Uranium decay.  U-238 is essentially non-radioactive (especially compared to hyper-active U-235), and has a half-life of over four billion years.

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; decay:

&lt;math&gt;
C^{14} \longrightarrow N^{14} + e(\beta)
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the decay that allows for carbon dating, and has a half-life of over 5000 years.


Gamma radiation is much more difficult to come by, as emitting a gamma ray does not allow an atomic nuclei to decay.  The most famous source of high-energy gamma rays is what happens when an electron and a positron annihilate:

&lt;math&gt;
e^{+} + e^{-} \longrightarrow \gamma + \gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

Since positrons are relatively rare, this is an interaction that is relatively hard to find.  However there are fairly reliable sources of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; radiation, including Cesium-137 and Cobalt-60.  Both are useful for a wide variety of technical purposes, as well as for their utility in cancer treatment.

== Lexical Analysis ==
Lexical analysis is the process of analyzing a stream of individual characters (normally arranged as lines), into a sequence of lexical tokens (tokenization. for instance of &quot;words&quot; and punctuation symbols that make up source code) to feed into the parser. Roughly the equivalent of splitting ordinary text written in a natural language (e.g. English) into a sequence of words and punctuation symbols. Lexical analysis is often done with tools such as lex, flex and jflex.

Strictly speaking, tokenization may be handled by the parser. The reason why we tend to bother with tokenising in practice is that it makes the parser simpler, and decouples it from the character encoding used for the source code.

For example given the input string:
      integer aardvark := 2, b;

A tokeniser might output the following tokens:
 keyword integer
 word aardvark
 assignment operator
 integer 2
 comma
 word b
 semi_colon

=== What is a token ===
In computing, a token is a categorized block of text, usually consisting of indivisible characters known as lexemes. A lexical analyzer initially reads in lexemes and categorizes them according to function, giving them meaning. This assignment of meaning is known as tokenization. A token can look like anything: English, gibberish symbols, anything; it just needs to be a useful part of the structured text.

Consider the following table:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; halign=&quot;center&quot;
! lexeme
! token
|-
| sum
| IDENT
|-
| =
| ASSIGN_OP
|-
| 3
| NUMBER
|-
| +
| ADD_OP
|-
| 2
| NUMBER
|-
|;
| SEMICOLON
|}

Tokens are frequently defined by regular expressions, which are understood by a lexical analyzer such as lex. The lexical analyzer reads in a stream of lexemes and categorizes them into tokens. This is called &quot;tokenizing.&quot; If the lexer finds an invalid token, it will report an error.

Following tokenizing is parsing. From there, the interpreted data may be loaded into data structures, for general use, interpretation, or compiling.

Consider a text describing a calculation : &quot;&lt;tt&gt;46 - number_of(cows);&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The lexemes here might be: &quot;46&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;number_of&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;cows&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, and &quot;;&quot;. The lexical analyzer will denote lexemes 4 and 6 as 'number' and - as character, and 'number_of ' as a separate token. Even the lexeme ';' in some languages (such as C) has some special meaning.

The whitespace lexemes are sometimes ignored later by the syntax analyzer. A token doesn't need to be valid, in order to be recognized as a token. &quot;cows&quot; may be nonsense to the language, &quot;number_of&quot; may be nonsense. But they are tokens nonetheless, in this example.

=== Finite State Automaton ===
We first study what is called a ''finite state automaton'', or FSA for short. An FSA is usually used to do lexical analysis.

An FSA consists of states, starting state, accept state and transition table. The automaton reads an input symbol and moves the state accordingly. If the FSA reaches the accept state after the input string is read until its end, the string is said to be ''accepted'' or ''recognized''. A set of recognized strings is said to be a language recognized by the FSA.

Suppose this language in which each string starts with 'ab' and ends with one or more 'c'. With [[../State.java|state]] class, this can be written like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
State
  s0 = new State (),
  s1 = new State (),
  s2 = new State (),
  s3 = new State ();
		
s0.setTransition ('a', s1);
s1.setTransition ('b', s2);
s2.setTransition ('c', s3);
s3.setTransition ('c', s3);

State r[] = s0.move (inputString);
if (Arrays.asList (r).contains (s3))
  System.out.println (&quot;the input string is accepted.&quot;);
else
  System.out.println (&quot;the input string is not accepted.&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Suppose an input string &quot;abccc&quot;. Then the automaton moves like: s0 -&gt; s1 -&gt; s2 -&gt; s3 -&gt; s3 -&gt; s3.

=== Simple Hand-Written Scanning ===
In this section, we'll create a simple, object-oriented scanner / lexer for a simple language implemented in Object Pascal. Consider the following EBNF:
 program     ::= { instruction }
 instruction ::= &quot;print&quot; expr | &quot;var&quot; IDENTIFIER &quot;:=&quot; expr
 expr        ::= simple-expr [ (&quot;&lt;&quot; | &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; ) simple-expr ]
 simple-expr ::= factor { ( &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot; ) factor }
 factor      ::= INTEGER | IDENTIFIER
where
 INTEGER    = [0-9]+
 IDENTIFIER = [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*
From the above EBNF, The tokens we're about to recognize are: IDENTIFIER, INTEGER, keyword &quot;print&quot;, keyword &quot;var&quot;, :=, +, -, &lt;, &lt;&gt;, EOF and unknown token. The chosen tokens are intended for both brevity and the ability to recognize all types of token's lexeme: exact single character (+, -, &lt;, EOF and unknown), exact multiple character (print, var, := and &lt;&gt;), infinitely many (IDENTIFIER, INTEGER and unknown), overlapping prefix (&lt; and &lt;&gt;) and overlapping as a whole (IDENTIFIER and keywords). Identifier and keywords here are case-insensitive. Note that some lexemes are classified to more than one type of lexeme.
==== The Token Class ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
TToken = class
protected
  FLine, FCol: LongWord;
public
  constructor Create(const ALine, ACol: LongWord);
  destructor Destroy; override;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
The base class of a token is simply an object containing line and column number where it's declared. From this base class, tokens with exact lexeme (either single or multiple characters) could be implemented as direct descendants.
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
TEOFToken = class(TToken)
end;

TPlusToken = class(TToken)
end;

TMinusToken = class(TToken)
end;

TAssignToken = class(TToken)
end;

TLessToken = class(TToken)
end;

TNotEqualToken = class(TToken)
end;

TPrintToken = class(TToken)
end;

TVarToken = class(TToken)
end;

TEOFToken = class(TToken)
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
Next, we need to create descendant for token with variadic lexeme:
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
TVariadicToken = class(TToken)
protected
  FLexeme: String;
public
  constructor Create(const ALine, ACol: LongWord; const ALexeme: String);
  destructor Destroy; override;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
The only difference from the base token class is the lexeme property, since it possibly has infinitely many forms. From here, we create descendant classes for tokens whose lexeme is infinitely many:
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
TUnknownToken = class(TVariadicToken)
end;

TIdentifierToken = class(TVariadicToken)
end;

TIntegerToken = class(TVariadicToken)
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
That's all for the token, on to the lexer.

==== The Lexer Class ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
TLexer = class
private
  FLine: LongWord;
  FCol: LongWord;
  FStream: TStream;
  FCurrentToken: TToken;
  FLastChar: Char;
  function GetChar: Char;
public
  constructor Create(AStream: TStream);
  destructor Destroy; override;
  procedure NextToken;
  property CurrentToken: TToken read FCurrentToken;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
A lexer consists of its position in the source code (line and column), the stream representing the source code, current (or last recognized / formed) token and last character read. To encapsulate the movement in the source code, reading character from the stream is implemented in GetChar method. Despite its ''maybe simple'' look, the implementation could be complicated as we'll see soon. GetChar is used by public method NextToken, whose job is to advance lexer movement by 1 token ahead. On to GetChar implementation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
function TLexer.GetChar: Char;
begin
  try
    FLastChar := Chr(FStream.ReadByte);
    Inc(FCol);
    // Handles 3 types of line endings
    if FLastChar in [#13, #10] then begin
      FCol := 0;
      Inc(FLine);
      // CR met, probably CRLF
      if FLastChar = #13 then begin
        FLastChar := Chr(FStream.ReadByte);
        // Not CRLF, but CR only, move backward 1 position
        if FLastChar &lt;&gt; #10 then
          FStream.Seek(-1,soFromCurrent);
      end;
      // Always returns as LF for consistency
      FLastChar := #10;
    end;
  except // Exception? Returns EOF
    FLastChar := #26;
  end;
  GetChar := FLastChar;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
As stated earlier, GetChar's job is not as simple as its name. First, it has to read one character from the input stream and increment the lexer's column position. Then it has to check whether this character is one of the possible line endings (our lexer is capable of handling CR-, LF- and CRLF-style line ending). Next is the core of our lexer, NextToken:
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
procedure TLexer.NextToken;
var
  StartLine,StartCol: LongWord;

  function GetNumber: TIntegerToken;
  var
    NumLex: String;
  begin
    NumLex := '';
    repeat
      NumLex := NumLex + FLastChar;
      FLastChar := GetChar;
    until not (FLastChar in ['0' .. '9']);
    Result := TIntegerToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol, NumLex);
  end;
  
  function GetIdentifierOrKeyword: TVariadicToken;
  var
    IdLex: String;
  begin
    IdLex := '';
    repeat
      IdLex := IdLex + FLastChar;
      // This is how we handle case-insensitiveness
      FLastChar := LowerCase(GetChar);
    until not (FLastChar in ['a' .. 'z','0' .. '9','_']);
    // Need to check for keywords
    case IdLex of
      'print' : Result := TPrintToken.Create(StartLine,StartCol);
      'var'   : Result := TVarToken.Create(StartLine,StartCol);
      otherwise Result := TIdentifier.Create(StartLine,StartCol,IdLex);
    end;
  end;

begin
  // Eat whitespaces
  while FLastChar in [#32,#9,#13,#10] do
    FLastChar := GetChar;
  // Save first token position, since GetChar would change FLine and FCol
  StartLine := FLine;
  StartCol := FCol;
  if FLastChar = #26 then
    FCurrentToken := TEOFToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol)
  else
    case LowerCase(FLastChar) of
      // Exact single character
      '+': begin
        FCurrentToken := TPlusToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol);
        FLastChar := GetChar;
      end;
      '-': begin
        FCurrentToken := TMinusToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol);
        FLastChar := GetChar;
      end;
      // Exact multiple character
      ':': begin
        FLastChar := GetChar;
        if FLastChar = '=' then
          FCurrentToken := TAssignToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol)
        // ':' alone has no meaning in this language, therefore it's invalid
        else
          FCurrentToken := TUnknownToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol);
      end;
      // Overlapping prefix
      '&lt;': begin
        FLastChar := GetChar;
        // '&lt;&gt;'
        if FLastChar = '&gt;' then
          FCurrentToken := TNotEqualToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol)
        // '&lt;'
        else
          FCurrentToken := TLessToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol);
      end;
      // Infinitely many is handled in its own function to cut down line length here
      '0' .. '9': begin
        FCurrentToken := GetNumber;
      end;
      'a' .. 'z','_': begin
        FCurrentToken := GetIdentifierOrKeyword;
      end;
      else begin
        FCurrentToken := TUnknownToken.Create(StartLine, StartCol, FLastChar);
        FLastChar := GetChar;
      end;
    end;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can see, the core is a (probably big) case statement. The other parts is quite self documenting and well commented. Last but not least, the constructor:
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
constructor TLexer.Create(AStream: TStream; AErrorList: TErrorList);
begin
  FStream := AStream;
  FLine := 1;
  FCol := 0;
  FLastChar := GetChar;
  NextToken;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
It sets up the initial line and column position (guess why it's 1 for line but 0 for column :)), and also sets up the first token available so CurrentToken would be available after calling the constructor, no need to explicitly call NextToken after that.
==== Test Program ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;delphi&quot;&gt;
uses
  Classes,SysUtils,lexer,tokens;
var
  Stream: TStream;
  lex: TLexer;
begin
  Stream := THandleStream.Create(StdInputHandle);
  lex := TLexer.Create(Stream,nil);
  while not(lex.CurrentToken is TEOFToken) do begin
    WriteLn(lex.CurrentToken.ToString);
    lex.NextToken;
  end;
  lex.Free;
  Stream.Free;
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
As an exercise, you could try extending the lexer with floating point numbers, strings, numbers with base other than 10, scientific notation, comments, etc.

=== Table-Driven Hand-Written Scanning ===
=== Compiling Channel Constant ===
Lexical Analysis Tool

=== Scanning via a Tool - lex/flex ===
{{TODO|Mine [[Wikipedia:en:Flex lexical analyser]] article.}}

=== Scanning via a Tool - JavaCC ===
JavaCC is the standard Java compiler-compiler. Unlike the other tools presented in this chapter, JavaCC is a parser and a scanner (lexer) generator in one.  JavaCC takes just one input file (called the grammar file), which is then used to create both classes for lexical analysis, as well as for the parser.

In JavaCC's terminology the scanner/lexical analyser is called the ''token manager''. And in fact the generated class that contains the token manager is called ''ParserName'''''TokenManager'''. Of course, following the usual Java file name requirements, the class is stored in a file called ''ParserName'''''TokenManager.java'''. The ''ParserName'' part is taken from the input file. In addition, JavaCC creates a second class, called ''ParserName'''''Constants'''. That second class, as the name implies, contains definitions of constants, especially token constants. JavaCC also generates a boilerplate class called '''Token'''. That one is always the same, and contains the class used to represent tokens. One also gets a class called '''ParseError'''. This is an exception which is thrown if something went wrong.

It is possible to instruct JavaCC not to generate the ''ParserName'''''TokenManger''', and instead provide your own, hand-written, token manager. Usually - this holds for all the tools presented in this chapter - a hand-written scanner/lexical analyser/token manager is much more efficient. So, if you figure out that your generated compiler gets too large, give the generated scanner/lexical analyzer/token manager a good look.  Rolling your own token manager is also handy if you need to parse binary data and feed it to the parsing layer.

Since, however, this section is about using JavaCC to generate a token manager, and not about writing one by hand, this is not discussed any further here.

==== Defining Tokens in the JavaCC Grammar File ====
A JavaCC grammar file usually starts with code which is relevant for the parser, and not the scanner. For simple grammars files it looks similar to:

 options { LOOKAHEAD=1; }&lt;br /&gt;
 PARSER_BEGIN(''ParserName'')
 public class ''ParserName'' {
    // code to enter the parser goes here
 }
 PARSER_END(''ParserName'')

This is usually followed by the definitions for tokens. These definitions are the information we are interested in in this chapter. Four different kinds, indicated by four different keywords are understood by JavaCC when it comes to the definition of tokens:

; TOKEN
: Regular expressions which specify the tokens the token manager should be able to recognize.

; SPECIAL_TOKEN
: SPECIAL_TOKENs are similar to TOKENS. Only, that the parser ignores them. This is useful to e.g. specify comments, which are supposed to be understood, but have no significance to the parser.

; SKIP
: Tokens (input data) which is supposed to be completely ignored by the token manager. This is commonly used to ignore whitespace. A SKIP token still breaks up other tokens. E.g. if one skips white space, has a token &quot;else&quot; defined, and if the input is &quot;el se&quot;, then the token is not matched. 

; MORE
: This is used for an advanced technique, where a token is gradually built. MORE tokens are put in a buffer until the next TOKEN or SPECIAL_TOKEN matches. Then all data, the accumulated token in the buffer, as well as the last TOKEN or SPECIAL_TOKEN is returned.

: One example, where the usage of ''MORE'' tokens is useful are constructs where one would like to match for some start string, arbitrary data, and some end string. Comments or string literals in many programming languages match this form. E.g. to match string literals, delimited by ''&quot;'', one would not return the first found ''&quot;'' as a token. Instead, one would accumulate more tokens, until the closing ''&quot;'' of the string literal is found. Then the complete literal would be returned. See [[#Comment Example|Comment Example]] for an example where this is used to scan comments.

Each of the above mentioned keywords can be used as often as desired. This makes it possible to group the tokens, e.g. in a list for operators and another list for keywords. All sections of the same kind are merged together as if just one section had been specified.

Every specification of a token consists of the token's symbolic name, and a regular expression. If the regular expression matches, the symbol is returned by the token manager.

==== Simple Example ====
Lets see an example:

 //
 // Skip whitespace in input
 // if the input matches space, carriage return, new line or a tab,
 // it is just ignored
 //
 SKIP: { &quot; &quot; | &quot;\r&quot; | &quot;\n&quot; | &quot;\t&quot; }&lt;br /&gt;
 // Define the tokens representing our operators
 //
 TOKEN: {
     &lt; PLUS:  &quot;+&quot; &gt;
   | &lt; MINUS: &quot;-&quot; &gt;
   | &lt; MUL:   &quot;*&quot; &gt;
   | &lt; DIV:   &quot;/&quot; &gt;
 }&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // Define the tokens representing our keywords
 //
 TOKEN: {
     &lt; IF:    &quot;if&quot; &gt;
   | &lt; THEN:  &quot;then&quot; &gt;
   | &lt; ELSE:  &quot;else&quot; &gt;
 }

All the above token definitions use simple regular expressions, where just constants are matched. It is recommended to study the [https://javacc.dev.java.net/doc/docindex.html JavaCC documentation] for the full set of possible regular expressions.

When the above file is run through JavaCC, a token manager is generated which understands the above declared tokens.

Eliminating (ignoring) comments in a programming language is a common task for a lexical analyzer. Of course, when JavaCC is used, this task is usually given to the token manager, by specifying special tokens.

Basically, a standard idiom for JavaCC has evolved on how to ignore comments. It combines tokens of kind ''SPECIAL_TOKEN'' and ''MORE'' with a ''lexical state''. Lets assume we e.g. have a programming language where comments start with a ''--'', and either end with another ''--'' or the end of the line (this is the comment schema of ASN.1 and several other languages). Then a way to construct a scanner for this would be:

 //
 // Start of comment. Don't return as token, instead
 // shift to special lexical state.
 //
 SPECIAL_TOKEN: {  &lt;&quot;--&quot;&gt; : WithinComment }&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // While inside the comment lexicals state, look for end
 // of comment (either another '--' or EOL). Don't return
 // the (accumulated data). Instead switch back to normal
 // lexical state
 //
 &lt;WithinComment&gt; SPECIAL_TOKEN:
 {
     &lt;(&quot;--&quot; | &quot;\n&quot; )&gt; : DEFAULT
 }&lt;br /&gt;
 //
 // While inside the comment state, accumulate all contents
 //
 &lt;WithinComment&gt; MORE: { &lt;~[]&gt; }

Once you've found a place to live and filled enough paperwork to avoid being deported, you can relax a bit and enjoy your surroundings. You'll suffer through periodic intervals of ''démarches administratives'', but remember that you only work 12 hours a week and have ample vacation time.

==Teaching==
===Responsibilities===
Your teaching responsibilities will depend on your school level you work and where you work. (The assistantship program is not well standardized across the country or even across ''académies''). 

In any case, the work will almost certainly be better described as “teaching” than “assisting:” you will make lessons on your own, teach class on your own, and often discipline students on your own. This may come as a surprise, since everything about the assistantship program implies the opposite (the name, the salary…).

===The first classes===

You will have a week to two of &quot;observation&quot; before you actually begin teaching.  Take advantage of this time to see how teachers interact with their students — it can be quite different than in the US.  Attend as many classes as you can, especially with the teachers you'll be working with (but you could even attend ones in other subjects — it's interesting), and insist on observing before you jump into teaching.  It helps a lot.

Your first few classes will probably be the most difficult to prepare for since you won't know what to expect. Fortunately, you can take advantage of your “new, interesting foreigner” status to entrance the students for at least the first few lessons without really teaching very much.

When you first appear in front of the class, introduce yourself in English with detail appropriate for the students’ English knowledge (name, age, home country, etc…). Before everyone's eyes glaze over completely, stop and ask “''Qu'est-ce que vous avez compris?''” Through comprehension and guesswork, they should eventually recite most of what you said. 

Continuing your introduction, ask the students if they have any questions about your home country. They should have a lot of questions, more than you'll likely want to answer. When this becomes tedious, you can move on to a lesson about the anglophone countries of the world — the only required material is the classroom's world map — and before you know it your three quarters of an hour will be up.

One way or another, you’ll need a copy of the class roll to learn the students’ names. That is, unless you remember names like ''Anaïs'' the first time you hear them. Get a roll from the teacher or administration office, or make your own.

It's also a good idea to let the kids introduce themselves — it gets them to talk instead of talking about yourself.  Give them a model, then when they tell you something, ask open ended (not yes or no) questions about it — what kind of movies do you like?  Where do you play basketball?  etc.

If you are teaching high school, expect the first few lessons to be more demanding. The kids will likely understand nearly everything you say in English, so you will need to have a lesson or an activity for every class.

*******
One important piece of advice from the assistant from the UK to anyone going to a collège or lycée: Don't ever, ever speak French in class. Your aim is to get them speaking English, not French, and if you start by speaking French, they'll know you can, and won't bother making the effort to communicate in English. Your perfect English is going to be way better for them than slightly flawed French! It might be harder at first, but they'll get used to it. If they don't understand, repeat, rephrase until they do. Give them the benefit of assuming they CAN understand English, and that if they don't get something at first, they will after a bit of explanation - remember to be patient. Insist on an English-only classroom as one of your rules from the beginning, along with giving you as much respect as their normal teacher - tell them you'll exclude them and never teach them again if they disrespect you - usually works as they often see the classes with you as more fun than normal class! You do need to set down rules from the beginning - no good doing it three months when you're having a few problems getting them to speak or to behave!

*******
A different opinion on speaking French in the classroom from a French and English teacher having a stint as an assistant: Sometimes it's just much easier, quicker and more effective to quickly translate into French. The students understand, feel comfortable and speak LOTS of English in my classes :)
And the empty threat of &quot;tell them you'll exclude them and never teach them again if they disrespect you&quot; is just ridiculous. You have absolutely no say in who you teach. And most students wouldn't disrespect you anyway, so don't worry!

===Lessons you can live with===
Since you're only paid to work twelve hours a week, and you’re assigned twelve hours in front of students, you’ll probably be reluctant to do much class preparation work. But out of charity for your students and your own self esteem, you should probably devote some time to it.

You will feel better about your job if you teach your students something new with every lesson. Don't get too caught up the official vocabulary lists and ''séance'' guidelines. The best way for you, a native language speaker, to contribute is to pass on useful, popular vocabulary.

Work in language units (family, animals, food…) and come up with games. There are a lot of things you can do with a minimum of preparation, and a lot of things you can reuse. Just don't repeat the same exercises too much or you’ll bore the students into misbehaving.

You may also bore yourself. One thing that helps is to keep a detailed record of everything you do with every class in every session. This will help you make sure that you can repeat your lessons for all of your students. Depending on your school and teachers, you may have one group of kids twice a week or just once a month. You might have one student at a time; you might have 30.

It's not easy to teach English to French kids of any age. If you're not a natural teacher, you may get frustrated. Don't expect too much help from the teachers. Either they'll be eager to help you, or you'll just be a way for them to get an hour off. Remember that it's a part-time job, and that you're in France to learn French, travel and drink wine. Class time passes and, every couple of months, you get two weeks off.

===Too little work?===

You will discover that you have a lot of free time on your hands.  This can be a good thing, but this can also be very depressing.  Twelve hours a week is already very little, and many assistants never even work this much (especially in a lycée situation).  This is because your classes depend on the teachers you work with, and if they don't work, you don't work.  Whether there's a strike (which happens often), they're sick, they can't organize the lessons to fit you in because they're behind, the students have to have a test, it's the day right before or right after vacations... And then they forget to let you know you aren't needed so you go to work and voilà, no students.  

You could travel with all your free time, but the €750 salary doesn't really permit much of that.  Trains are expensive in France (check out the SNCF website for prices), though certainly not as expensive as in the UK. A Carte 12-25 will help cut costs too.  Do whatever you can to find extra things to do.  Do not depend on your assistant job as your life, because it's not much of a life.  It's not an engaging job.  If you're lucky and extremely outgoing, you'll make friends with teachers at your school.  Some of the teachers will see you as a way to get some time off, others may possibly even see you as a nuisance.  Some assistants have found that &quot;French people aren't very friendly in general, and you're a foreigner who's only there temporarily - DON'T expect a warm welcome&quot;.  Many other assistants, however, experience quite the opposite and you may be pleasantly surprised at the warm welcome you receive!  Probably there will be other assistants around to hang out with.  The feeling of having very little to do and having very few obligations can be a shock after the rigorous university life which typically precedes the assistant experience.  However, it's worth bearing in mind that the assistantship is what you make of it.  Depending on your school and the work you are expected to do, putting in a bit of extra effort during the week can be rewarding and fantastic CV fodder!    

If you're in large town or a city, give private English lessons.  This work will be fairly easy to obtain if you live in a sizable town or city and if you advertise yourself as soon as you arrive as &quot;Anglais Langue Maternelle&quot;.  Set yourself up from the beginning.  Schedule as many students as possible, and don't worry if it seems like a lot, because every week a few of them will cancel for one reason or another.  Look for places you can leave &quot;petites annonces&quot; - university billboards, the local newspaper, bookstores or even the laundromat.  If your French needs work, say you want to do conversation exchanges.  If there's a university, you'll have even better luck as students will call you for translations or to do their homework for them.  Asking about €10 an hour is normal.

==French business==
You are probably used to handling much of your personal business over the phone. The idea of going to a local office to talk about a billing issue seems quaint. Why not just call the free customer service number, wait on hold for a few minutes, and settle things from the comfort of your living room?

This is not the way things are done in France. First of all, free numbers are rare. Most customer service numbers in France are toll numbers that cost much more than calling a standard number in France, or even calling the United States! With the discount phone company [http://www.tele2.fr/ TELE2], calls to the U.S. cost 0.06 € a minute; calling the SNCF for information on the latest train strike will run you 0.34 € per minute.

Even if you are willing to pay the high price of the call, you will find you can't accomplish very much as the minutes are ticking away. You'll be working in a foreign language without the aid of gestures and aren't likely to get much empathy from your interlocutor. 

The better alternative is to use services over the Internet or, if so equipped, over the [[w:Minitel|Minitel]].

If necessary, show up in person. If it's possible to make an appointment somewhere, make one. Otherwise, wait in line. That way you won't waste any money, and your chances of resolving the problem are better. As a teaching assistant with more free time than disposable income, it's the sensible choice.

Before launching into your problem, it is extremely important that the French person you are dealing with perceives you as polite. You should ALWAYS start the conversation with &quot;bonjour&quot; and a smile, which will cause them to overlook all your grammatical mistakes and then some! If you omit this, the French person will often tell you very coldly that there is nothing to be done. Again, thank them at the end of the interview whether they were able to help you or not. You may have to deal with them again. And don't say anything unkind in English--even if they don't speak English, a colleague might.

==Travel==
Language assistants have all of the vacations that students have. That means you have about a week off at the end of October, two weeks off at the end of December, a week off in February, and two weeks off in April. Don't go home unless you have to. Instead, take advantage of France's central location and travel as much as you can.     
===Trains===
[[Image:TGV.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[w:TGV |TGV ]]]]
As mentioned elsewhere in this survival guide, the Carte 12-25 is essential for young assistants, saving you 25 – 50% on every trip. If you're over 25, you can still benefit from [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/dynamic/_SvHomePage?_CMD=cmdLowFare&amp;WB=HP_A Prem's] fares (which must be reserved on the Web from two weeks to two months in advance, with no possibility of changing or cancelling the ticket). Take a Prem's to Paris and then a night Prem's to [[w:Rome|Rome]], for example.

For complicated SNCF reservations (excepting Prem's), find out if your town has a [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/info_resa/guide_du_voyageur/Adresses.htm ''Boutique SNCF''] separate from the train station. There, you can sit down with a usually capable employee and work out a complicated itinerary of which the [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/ Web site] is incapable.

Don't be afraid of night trains. Traveling in a sleeper car is an effective way to get somewhere far away without wasting too much time. Usually it costs a bit more to travel in a ''couchette'' (sometimes you can opt instead for a ''siège inclinable''), but with a Prem's fare it's the same price. Furthermore, in many night trains, special compartments have been created for women travelling alone (''compartiment pour femmes voyageant seules''). When you travel overnight on some international trains (to Italy, for instance), the ticket controller will usually hang onto your ticket and your passport all night. This is nerve-wracking, but you can't do anything about it. Remember to put your belongings somewhere safe while you're sleeping.

It is possible to buy Eurail passes before you leave the USA (or for your parents or friends to buy them in the USA and send them to you). You can get a train pass good for 30 days with unlimited travel for much less than you would pay purchasing tickets on a case-by-case basis. Depending on whether your city has a TGV, it's possible to get away even for an afternoon. With a day off, and a TGV available, it's possible to go from anywhere in France to Paris, spend the day, and be back for tomorrow morning's class.

Depending on how close you are to another country, you might also benefit from that country's or that region's train service. If you're in the Southwest and want to go into Spanish [[w:Basque Country|Basque Country]], look into [http://www.euskotren.es/ Euskotren] which extends all the way to the SNCF station at Hendaye. Within other countries there are whole train and bus networks, just as in France. In Spain, there is [http://www.renfe.es/index1.html Renfe], [http://www.auto-res.net/index.html?a Autores], and [http://www.alsa.es/Alsaindex.asp Alsa]. Spanish trains aren't great, and the Spanish seem to get around mainly in buses, which are cheaper and faster.

In Italy, there's [http://www.trenitalia.com/ Trenitalia]. The Italian version of their website is much more useful, and even if you don't speak Italian you can probably navigate it with your knowledge of French. Italian trains are cheap and frequent. They tend to move slowly and sometimes off-schedule, but their ticket machines make it seem easy to get anywhere. Prices of Italian trains depend on the distance you're traveling and what kind of train you are in. Look at a few different fares on the machine before you decide. Prices from Naples to Rome, for example, vary from 10 € to 30 €.

Resist the temptation to buy a [http://www.eurail.com Eurail pass]. Unless you can determine that it will save you money, it probably won't. Furthermore, many Eurail pass-holders have to pay supplements on certain trains (like the TGV and night trains).

Don't forget to validate your train ticket when necessary. Most countries require it.

===Planes===
Apart from trains, you might be able to take advantage of cheap European airlines, like [http://www.ryanair.com RyanAir], [http://www.easyjet.com Easyjet], and [http://buy.volareweb.com/jsp/web/index.jsp Volare]. Sometimes you have to fly through London, but if you're near another hub airport (such as in Nice or Lyon), you might not. Keep in mind that these airlines have extremely rigid luggage limits and arrival times. You might forfeit your ticket by arriving less than an hour in advance. Also keep in mind when using these discount airlines that the planes often land in small airports outside of the destination city named (planes heading for Brussels land in Charleroi, a town nearby.) Usually these airports don't have close connections to train stations, so you will probably have to buy a ticket for the shuttle bus the airlines provide in order to get into town.

===Cars===
[[Image:Rented_car.jpg|thumb|250px|A rental car on its way to Spain]]
Americans are allowed to rent cars in France, and sometimes this is the best option if you're traveling with three or four other people. Rates vary, and there is usually a surcharge for those under 25. 1088006266314&amp; Expedia]


For driving directions, the best site is [http://www.mappy.fr/ Mappy]. On their site you can select directions for toll roads or free roads, and unlike [http://www.mapquest.fr Mapquest], they give you toll and gas costs. This is useful when making a budget.

On that note, you should know that there are two ways to drive around France. One is on the modern and expensive [[w:Autoroute|Autoroutes]], the other is on the free, but slower, ''routes nationales.'' If you're not in a hurry, the free option is nice. But remember that your kilometers are probably limited in a rental car, and that free roads use more of them. Plan accordingly.

Make sure you don't surpass your ''kilometrage,'' because it gets expensive per kilometer once you're over. Also, make sure the gas tank is full when you return the car or you'll be charged ''la peau des fesses.''

===Lodging===
Similarly, if you're traveling with a bunch of friends, consider renting an apartment for a long weekend in foreign city. [http://www.flatsbydays.com Flatsbydays] has great rates in [[w:Barcelona |Barcelona ]]. That way, you can buy your food in a grocery store and not have to go out for every meal and cup of coffee. If you must stay in a hotel, shop around before reserving. [http://www.eurocheapo.com Eurocheapo] has good, cheap suggestions for numerous European capitals. You might also benefit from last-minute hotel sites, like [http://ratestogo.com Rates to Go]. Even if you're staying in a hotel, you can drop by the local market and stock up on foods you don't have to cook, such as pastries, fresh fruit, and cured meats, and save yourself quite a bit of money.

Most European cities have an abundance of pension hotels, which are in between a hotel and a hostel. You have your own room but share a bathroom with other people. Many of these establishments do not take reservations. They ask you to just show up in the morning and see what's available. This may seem totally illogical, but if you get to a city in the morning you're sure to find something quickly.

If you're driving a long distance and need to stay somewhere on the road, look into [http://www.hotelformule1.com/formule1/index.html Formule1 hotels]. Rooms are in between 20€ and 30€ per night for up to three people (but the entire system is automated, so no one will notice if you walk in with four or even eight people). 

Another good option, whether for short or longer stays, is a youth hostel. You don't even have to be young. Merely buy a hostel card (either at the hostel or even before you leave the USA). They are sparse (you'll usually have to share a room with up to 20 other people), but they include breakfast and the best have lockers and safes for valuables. Some hostels have more private rooms, and if they're not full, it's easy to get one of these. Be warned, you will have to share a bathroom, and the hostels are notorious for particularly virulent strains of athlete's foot, so wear flip-flops in the shower! Some hostels will take reservations; if you arrive without a reservation and they are full, most will call around to the next hostel down the road. Most hostels close between 9 am and 3 pm, so make sure you take what you need with you for the day if you're planning to stay longer than one night. 

The rumors about thieves are true. Be unreasonably cautious with your belongings at all times, especially on trains and at beaches. Don't fall asleep in a public place, and don't carry anything important in your back pocket.

==Circuit Models for Amplifiers==

Amplifier are generally put in four categories
# voltage amplifier, 
# current amplifier, 
# transresistance amplifier and 
# transconductance amplifier.  
These models apply irrespective of the complexity of the internal circuit of the amplifier. The values of the model parameters can be found either by analyzing the amplifier circuit or by performing measurements at the amplifier temlinals.

The model for a voltage amplifier is shown in figure 1.  Real amplifiers have input and output resistance.  This is reflected in the model.

[[Image:Amplifier_model.svg]]
: Figure 1: A Voltage Amplifier.

==Gain==
Gain is the increase in the strength of a signal and is often expressed in [[wikipedia:decibel|decibel]]s (dB).  An increase of 3 dB is about equal to doubling in a linear scale. A gain of more than 1 is called amplification, while a gain of less than 1 is called Attenuation.

Gain is given different symbols depending of the type. For No load gains
: Voltage gain is A&lt;sub&gt;vo&lt;/sub&gt;, 
: Current gain A&lt;sub&gt;io&lt;/sub&gt;, 
: Transconductance G&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; 
: Transresistance R&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;!-- This last one I'm not certain about.--&gt;

Using the model, the gain with a load can be calculated.

== Biased Voltage Class ==
Transistors may be biased in a variety of classes.  A trade off of linearity and power consumption is usually made where a Class A

==== Class A ====
The transistor is &quot;on&quot; all the time.  We say 360 degrees of conduction, representing an entire period of the sine waveform.  Ideally, this class produces very little distortion, however consumes a lot of power and is also least preferred.

This is the most linear of the classes, meaning the output signal is a truer representation of what was imputed. Here are the characteristics of the class: 
1.The output device (transistor) conducts electricity for the entire cycle of input signal. In other words, they reproduce the entire waveform in its entirety.
2.These amps run hot, as the transistors in the power amp are on and running at full power all the time.
3.There is no condition where the transistor(s) is/are turned off. That doesn't mean that the amplifier is never or can never be turned off; it means the transistors doing the work inside the amplifier have a constant flow of electricity through them. This constant signal is called &quot;bias&quot;.
4.Class A is the most inefficient of all power amplifier designs, averaging only around 20%.

Because of the way they are usually designed, Class A amplifiers are very inefficient. They do not need to be built in this way, but for every watt of output power, they can typically waste 4-5 watts as heat. They are usually very large, heavy and because of the 4-5 watts of heat energy released per watt of output, they run very hot, needing lots of ventilation (not at all ideal for a car, and rarely acceptable in a home). This is not due to the amplifier type, but the fact that even many design engineers do not fully understand how they work and often copy their designs from previous ones. The upside is that these amps are the most enjoyed of all amplifiers. When properly designed, the Class A amp gives the best representation of musical detail, with no clipping of the waveform. As a result the sound is cleaner and more linear; that is, it contains much lower levels of distortion. 

They are the most accurate of all amps available, but at greater cost to manufacture, calling for tight tolerances and additional components for cooling and heat regulation.



==== Class AB ====
The transistor is &quot;on&quot; for slightly more than half the cycle (&gt;180 degrees) of a sine wave and is the most common configuration used in push-pull audio power amplifiers. In push-pull amplifiers, Class AB produces mostly odd order distortion, however it is far more power efficient than Class A. Odd order distortion is not considered pleasing to hear in audio power amplifiers.  This distortion can easily be removed with the addition of a simple negative feedback loop into the system as shown by the diagram below:

[[Image:classab.png|300px|Class AB Amp]]

This type of amplifier is extremely easy to build and is the industry standard for audio amplifiers.

Issues with this type of amplifier include poor efficiency, size and cost.  A typical class ab amplifier will have a power efficiency of 40-80%.  Because of this they require large heat sinks to cool the transistors, this also increases the cost of the amplifier due to the extra material to create these heat sinks.

This is the compromise of the bunch. Class AB operation has some of the best advantages of both Class A and Class B built-in. Its main benefits are sound quality comparable to that of Class A and efficiency similar to that of Class B. Most modern amp designs employ this topology. 

Its main characteristics are: 
In fact, many Class AB amps operate in Class A at lower output levels, again giving the best of both worlds
The output bias is set so that current flows in a specific output device for more than a half the signal cycle but less than the entire cycle.
There is enough current flowing through each device to keep it operating so they respond instantly to input voltage demands.
In the push-pull output stage, there is some overlap as each output device assists the other during the short transition, or crossover period from the positive to the negative half of the signal.

There are many implementations of the Class AB design. A benefit is that the inherent non-linearity of Class B designs is almost totally eliminated, while avoiding the heat-generating and wasteful inefficiencies of the Class A design. And as stated before, at some output levels, Class AB amps operate in Class A. It is this combination of good efficiency (around 50) with excellent linearity that makes class AB the most popular audio amplifier design. 

There are quite a few excellent Class AB amps available. This is the design I recommended for most general-use applications in home and car. Usually, parts choice rivals that of Class A amps, and dollar for dollar these are some of the best values in stereo amplification. There can be some variation in design principle, but generally these are well-designed amps since their function is very well-understood by audio designers.

==== Class B ====
The transistor is &quot;on&quot; for only half the cycle (exactly 180 degrees) of a sine wave and is also very typically used in push-pull amplifier circuits. Ideally this class produces mostly odd order distortion.  In audio applications it is believed that odd order distortion is not pleasing to hear. It is difficult to build a low distortion Class B amplifier and hence Class AB is almost universal.

In this amp, the positive and negative halves of the signal are dealt with by different parts of the circuit. The output devices continually switch on and off. Class B operation has the following characteristics: 
The input signal has to be a lot larger in order to drive the transistor appropriately.
This is almost the opposite of Class A operation
There have to be at least two output devices with this type of amp. This output stage employs two output devices so that each side amplifies each half of the waveform. [li Either both output devices are never allowed to be on at the same time, or the bias (remember, that trickle of electricity?) for each device is set so that current flow in one output device is zero when not presented with an input signal.
Each output device is on for exactly one half of a complete signal cycle.

These amps run cooler than Class A amps, but the sound quality is not as pure, as there is a lot of &quot;crossover&quot; distortion, as one output device turns off and the other turns on over each signal cycle.

This type of amplifier design, or topology, gives us the term &quot;push-pull,&quot; as this describes the tandem of output devices that deliver the audio signal to your speakers: one device pushes the signal, the other pulls the signal. They can be less expensive, because one can use two cheap output devices instead of one high-quality one in the design. 

As I mentioned before, the input signal has to be lot larger, meaning that from the amplifier input, it needs to be &quot;stepped up&quot; in a gain stage, so that the signal will allow the output transistors to operate more efficiently within their designed specifications. This means more circuitry in the path of your signal, degrading sound even before it gets to the output stage

==== Class C ====
The transistor is &quot;on&quot; less than half the cycle of a sine wave.  We say &lt;180 of conduction.  This class produces both even and odd order distortion, however is very efficient.

==== Class D ====

The class D amp has been developed after the short-comings of past generations, including classes A, B, AB, and C.  Many people mistake the D as standing for digital.  Although it is a “switching” amp, meaning it turns “on” and “off” at a specific frequency, it is a wrong assumption.  D was simply the next letter in the alphabet. Consuming the least power out of its previous generations, the class D amps are generally smaller, making them ideal for mobile devices.  It is because of their power efficiency, small size, and cheaper costs that the class D amps are quickly becoming the new industry standard for audio electronic.  Companies such as [http://www.analogictech.com Advanced Analog], [http://www.ti.com Texas Instruments] as well as other companies have released 50W stereo class d amplifiers that are the size of a penny and did not require any sort of heat sinking, something that was not possible with other types of amplifiers. 

[[Image:classd.png|300px|class d amplifier]]

The basic design includes two [[Semiconductors/MOSFET_Transistors|MOSFET transistors]] in series, one pFET and one nFET being driven by a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal.  Because of the properties of MOSFET transistors they are either fully on or fully off.  When the transistor is off and the current is zero (so the amount of power wasted heating up the transistor is zero), or the transistor is fully on and the voltage across it is very close to zero (so the amount of power wasted heating up the transistor is again, very close to zero).

Because an analog signal needs to be transformed into a PWM signal a certain amount of distortion can occur, but the amount of distortion can be minimized.  Because a PWM signal is very much like a digital signal, the [[Analog_and_Digital_Conversion/Sampling_Theorem|sampling theorem]] states that if the sampling frequency is more than half the maximum frequency of the source it can be reproduced exactly.  For audio signals the maximum frequency heard by humans is roughly 20kHz, so a PWM generator would only need to provide a minimum switching frequency of 40kHz.  Because of the availability of faster components many class d amplifier designers will use switching frequencies closer to 400kHz to further reduce the distortion.

Issues of concern with a class d amplifier include electromagnetic emissions.  Due to the presence of a [[Electronics/Frequency_Spectrum|medium frequency signal]] in the circuit, steps must be taken to reduce the emission of these signals that could interfere with other electronic devices.

==== Class E ==== (oops, class D again?)
Switching amplifier
These amplifiers are erroneously called &quot;digital&quot; amplifiers by the press and many audio &quot;experts.&quot; Here's the skinny on Class D: 
While some Class D amps do run in true digital mode, using coherent binary data, most do not.
They are better termed &quot;switching&quot; amplifiers, because here the output devices are rapidly switched on and off at least twice for each cycle.
Depending on their switching frequency, they may be &quot;switched on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; millions of times a second.
Class D operation is theoretically 100% efficient, but in practice, they are closer to 80-90% efficiency.
This efficiency gain is at the cost of high-fidelity.

Think of Class D amps as being similar to a switchable power supply, but with audio signals controlling, or modulating, the switching action. To do this, you use a technology called Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM, a technology found in many CD players). 

According to experts, audio signals can be used to modulate a PWM system to create a high power audio amplifier at fairly low voltages using very small components. Class D audio uses a fixed, high frequency signal having pulses that vary in width based on input signal amplitude. So, for example, a deep bass note creates a large pulse in the carrier signal. This can be translated into a musical signal by the on/off nature of the output devices. 

Class D amplifiers are generally used for non-high-fidelity, or subwoofer applications.

There is a fifth (and, nominally, a sixth) class of amplifier, but they are rarely seen in practice in the consumer market. One is the Class G and the other Class H. These are similar in design to Class AB topologies, but both feature two power supplies that switch on or off, depending on the musical signal imputed. Using two power supplies improves efficiency enough to allow significantly more power for a given size and weight. Class G is becoming common for pro audio designs. Class H amps are designed to use the same topology as Class G, but it provides just enough voltage for optimum operation of the output devices. Again, its an attempt to increase efficiency, but at the expense of fidelity ultimately.

==== Class F ====

==== Class S ====

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Many texts written about programming languages show you a sample program at the beginning of the lesson to help get your feet wet. That is, to become familiar with the syntax and layout of that language. This book is no exception. This sample program will display the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to your screen.  

== Program Examples ==
'''Example One (FreeBASIC)'''

&lt;SOURCE lang=&quot;FreeBASIC&quot;&gt;
10 Cls
20 Print &quot;Hello, world! I'm ready to learn&quot; 
30 Sleep 
40 End
&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

== Explanation ==
# ''Cls'' stands for 'Clear Screen' and erases everything in the Command Prompt.
#''Print'' displays everything in between the quotations.
#''Sleep'' makes the program wait until the user presses Enter (Return).
#''End'' marks the end of the program (explained later in functions.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[BASIC Programming]] &gt; Beginning BASIC &gt; '''Your First Program'''&lt;br /&gt;
----
= Introduction =
In the previous code example, we wrote your first BASIC program. In it, you saw examples of '''PRINT''', '''CLS''', and '''END''' commands. Their roles in the program may or may not have been apparent at the time, but, as they're so vital to the BASIC language, they will be discussed here.

= Program Example =
&lt;SOURCE lang=&quot;qbasic&quot;&gt;
10 CLS
20 PRINT &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
30 PRINT &quot;I'm learning about commands in BASIC.&quot;
40 PRINT &quot;This text is being printed via the PRINT command.&quot;
50 PRINT &quot;On the next line, I'll use CLS.&quot;
60 CLS   &quot;Now the next word would be PRINT.&quot;
70 PRINT &quot;Finally, on line 80, I'll use END.&quot;
80 END   &quot;And return to PRINT&quot;
90 PRINT &quot;Now my program is over.&quot;&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

= Output =
 Finally, on line 80, I'll use END.

= Discussion =
From that example, it's fairly easy to deduce what each command does.

; CLS : An abbreviation that stands for the words '''CL'''ear '''S'''creen. In the above program, when you used CLS on line 60, all of the words that were printed to the screen were wiped away.

; PRINT : Writes to the screen. There are commands for printing to other things, like a printer, but that's to be discussed later. Each new PRINT command will start printing on a new line. To insert a blank line, don't specify a string to print. The syntax for &quot;PRINT&quot; is: PRINT &quot;[whatever you want to be printed here]&quot;

; END : It stops the program at that line; that is, anything that's added after that won't show. That's why the PRINT command on line 90 didn't print anything. The END command can be included in control structures to end the program if a condition is met. This will be discussed with control structures.

&lt;BR&gt;
What is happening?
 Line 10 the display is cleared.
 Lines 20 through 50 shows first paragraph displayed.
 Line 60 again clears the display.
 Line 70 shows the message you should see after you run this program.
 Line 80 Ends the program.
 Line 90 This line helps to show that a END statement stops the program at that point.

Given the state of computer speed today you should not see the paragraph displayed by lines 20 through 50, it should be cleared by the CLS statement on Line 60 before you have a chance to see it.  If you slow the program down you can see the program write the message to the screen.  Line 70 is then written to the screen/display then Line 80 stops everything.  Line 90 never, ever runs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== English Usage ==

A couple of web dictionary searches show that '''falsify''' as a synonym for ''disprove'' is valid, but it is not a common current usage in my experience. I know the use of &quot;disprove&quot; in the context of the module is especially unwanted (defining ''proof'' in terms of a derivate word would be a mistake!), so can someone suggest a better word of phrase. [[User:Mark Hurd|Mark Hurd]] 02:58, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:I probably wrote falsify as it is the word usally used in this context in Swedish and since I knew the word existed in English. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 21:19, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::I hear &quot;falsifiable&quot; used in the context of scientific hypotheses all the time.  Nothing wrong with &quot;falsify&quot; here.  [[User:160.36.157.234|160.36.157.234]] 05:31, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC) ([[User:Tormod]])

:Personally I like it. Maybe it would be a good thing to make it an easier read. I think it's important that even those who aren't already familar with the concepts can read the chapter. I hope many people involved in new age cosmic foo foo will come across this book and increase their demand for ''proof''. Maybe there is a way to include both styles (humorous half-crazy style and, possibly for some people, boring thorough approach naming the concepts with adequate names etc). --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 20:45, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

::I'll try to work on making it more readable if I can find the time.  What do you think about the section on inductive reasoning?</text>

== Properties of Pure Substances  ==
A cursory review of properties will introduce the variables of thermodynamics to the student. Properties of substances are things such as mass, temperature, volume, and pressure. Properties are used to define the current state of a substance. Several more properties exist to describe substances in thermodynamics, but a stronger understanding of theory is required for their definition and application.

Properties can be ''intensive'', if they are point properties (properties that make sense for a point) or ''extensive'', if they depend on the amount of matter in the system. Examples of extensive properties of systems are mass of system, number of moles of a substance in a system, and overall or total volume of a system.  These properties depend on how much matter of the system you measure. Examples of intensive properties are pressure, temperature, density, volume per mass, molar volume (which is volume per mole), and average molecular weight (or molecular mass). These properties are the same regardless of how you vary the amount of mass of the substance. 

Properties are like the variables for substances in that their values are all related by an equation. The relationship between properties is expressed in the form of an equation which is called an ''equation of state''. Perhaps the most famous state equation is the Ideal Gas Law. The ideal gas law relates the pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas to one another.

=== Volume ===

'''The SI unit for volume is ''m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''.
Volume is an extensive property, but both volume per mass and molar volume are intensive properties since they do not depend on the measured mass of the system.
A process during which the volume of the system remains constant is called an ''isochoric'' (or ''isometric'') process.

=== Pressure ===

The SI unit for pressure is Pa (Pascal), which is equivalent to a &lt;math&gt; N/(m^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Pressure is an intensive property. A process in which pressure remains constant is called ''isobaric'' process.

=== Temperature ===

Temperature, the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.Defined based on the zeroth law of thermodynamics, is a fundamental concept of thermodynamics.
We know that a body at high temperature will transfer energy to one at lower temperature.
Consider two bodies with different temperatures in contact with each other.
Net energy  transfer will be from  the hotter body to the colder body.
At some point, the net energy transfer will be zero, and the bodies are said to be in ''thermal equilibrium''.
Bodies in thermal equilibrium are defined to have the same temperature.

== Thermodynamic Systems ==

[[Image:system_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Thermodynamic System]]

In general, a system is a collection of objects, and there is a lot of subtlety in the way it is defined, as in set theory.
However, in thermodynamics, it is a much more straightforward concept.
A ''thermodynamic system'' is defined as a volume in space or a well defined set of materials (matter).
The imaginary outer edge of the system is called its ''boundary''.

As can be seen from the definition, the boundary can be fixed or moving.
A system in which matter crosses the boundary is called an ''open system''. In simple terms, a system which can exchange matter as well as energy with the surroundings is a open system.
Whereas a system which can exchange only energy with the surroundings is a ''closed system'', e.g.: liquid in sealed tube.  
The image above &lt;!-- There is no &quot;above&quot; image here. The image below doesn't even refer to this example as it's a closed system --&gt;shows a piston cylinder arrangement, where a gas is compressed by the piston.
The dotted lines represent the system boundary.
As can be seen, due to an opening in the cylinder, gas can escape outside as the piston moves inwards, and gas enters the system when the piston moves outwards.
Thus, it is an open system.

[[Image:closed_system_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Closed System]]

Now consider a similar system, but one in which gas cannot escape.
In practice, there might be some space between the piston and the cylinder, but we can ignore it for modeling purposes.
Thus the model of this configuration is a closed system.

The region outside the system is called the ''surroundings''.
The system and the surroundings together are called  the ''Universe''.
A system which does not exchange matter or energy with the surroundings is called an ''isolated system''.

Another term sometimes used instead of system is ''control volume''. In the case of a closed system, in which the mass of matter inside the system remains constant, the control volume is referred to as ''control mass''. A control volume is said to be enclosed by a ''control surface''.

=== Systems ===

Classical thermodynamics deals with systems in ''equilibrium''.
The equilibrium state is defined by the values of observable quantities in the system.
These are called ''system properties''.

The minimum number of variables required to describe the system depends on the complexity or ''degrees of freedom'' of the system.
Degrees of freedom refer to the number of properties that can be varied independently of each other in a system.
Some of the common system variables are pressure, temperature, and density, though any other physical properties may be used.

Consistent with the axiomatic nature of subject development, many of the relationships between physical properties cannot be completely specified without further development of theory.
What is good about classical thermodynamics is that many of the axioms stated here can be derived using techniques of statistical thermodynamics.
And statistical thermodynamics gives results in many cases where classical thermodynamics fails, such as in the specific heats of gases with many degrees of freedom.
In some sense, the relationship between classical and statistical thermodynamics is similar to the one between classical and quantum mechanics, ''i.e.'', classical thermodynamics approximates  statistical thermodynamics in the macroscopic limit.

=== Processes ===

A change in the system state is called a ''process''.
When the initial and final states of a process are the same, the process is called a ''cycle''.
If a process can be run in reverse with no change in the system + surroundings, then the process is called a ''reversible process''.
If a process is not reversible it is called an ''irreversible process''.

=== Isothermal Process ===

An ''isothermal process'' is one in which the temperature remains constant.
Please note that a process being isothermal does not imply anything about the heat  transferred or work done, ''i.e.'' heat transfer may take place during an isothermal process.
An isothermal process implies that the product of the volume and the pressure is constant for an ideal gas. i.e. PV = Constant

== Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics ==

If a system ''A'' is in thermal equilibrium with another system ''B'' and also with a third system ''C'', then all of the systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
This is called the ''zeroth law of thermodynamics''. 
This is how a thermometer works. If a thermometer is placed in a substance for temperature measurement, the thermometer's glass comes into thermal equilibrium with the substance. The glass then comes into thermal equilibrium with the liquid (mercury, alcohol, etc. . . .) inside the thermometer. Because the substance is in thermal equilibrium with the glass and the glass is in thermal equilibrium with the inner liquid, the substance and liquid must be in thermal equilibrium by the zeroth law. And because they are thermally equivalent, they must have the same temperature.

== Temperature Measurement ==

Temperature is measured by observing some property of the system which varies with temperature.
Such a property is called ''thermometric property'', e.g.:
    - The volumes of most liquids increase with temperature.
    - The length of a metal rod increases as the temperature increases. 
    - The pressure of a constant volume of gas increases with temperature

It is useful to establish a temperature scale so that a cardinal relationship can be established between various systems at different temperatures.
This is done by ''defining'' the temperature ''t'' as a function of a thermometric property ''X'', such that the temperature is a linear function of ''X'', ''i.e.'', equal changes in the property ''X'' give rise to equal changes in the temperature.  Such a linear function is ''t'' = ''a'' + ''b'' ''X'', for which one needs to assign arbitrary temperatures to two  values of ''X'' to find the values of the constants ''a'' and ''b''.

For example, in the case of the ''Celsius'' scale, the measurements are based on properties of water at the boiling point and melting point.
Suppose the value of the thermometric property is ''X&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the normal boiling point and ''X&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the normal melting point.
Then the temperature is given by ''t'' = 100 (''X'' - ''X&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'')/(''X&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''X&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''), where ''X'' is the thermometric property at temperature ''t'', and we have chosen ''t&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0&amp;deg;C and ''t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 100&amp;deg;C.  The ''normal'' melting and boiling points are the temperatures of melting and boiling at 1 ''atmosphere'' pressure.

The major temperature scales are the Celsius (&amp;deg;C), the Fahrenheit (&amp;deg;F) and the Kelvin (K) scales.
Note the absence of the &amp;deg; sign for kelvin--it is not degrees Kelvin, but kelvins, not capitalized when spelled out, and with the normal English plural which was added to the degree when Kelvin was an adjective modifying that unit.

Different thermometers are used for different temperature ranges.
As the reader might have guessed by now, this means that the different thermometers will only agree on the fixed points.
However, a set of thermometers have been carefully selected and calibrated so that this is not a big issue in practice.

The standard in this case is the ''International Temperature Scale'', which was introduced in 1927, and revised in 1948, 1968, and 1990.
The latest scale is denoted by ''T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the Kelvin scale and is defined from 0.65 ''K'' upwards.
For instance, between 0.65 K and 5.0 ''K'' ''T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined in terms of the vapor-pressure temperature relations of ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He'' and ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He''.
The ranges for different materials overlap and any of the valid materials can be used as a standard in the overlapping region.

== The Ideal Gas ==

Recall that a thermodynamic system may have a certain substance or material whose quantity can be expressed in mass or moles in an overall volume.  These are extensive properties of the system.  If  the substance is evenly distributed throughout the volume in question, then a value of volume per amount of substance may be used as an intensive property.  For an example, for an amount called a [[wikipedia:Mole_(unit) | mole]], volume per mole is typically called ''molar volume''. Also, a volume per mass for a specific substance may be called specific volume. In such cases, an equation of state may relate the three intensive properties, temperature, pressure, and molar or specific volume.

A simple but very useful equation of state is for an ideal gas.  The ideal gas is a useful notion in thermodynamics, as it is a simple system that depends on two independent properties. An ideal gas is one that has no intermolecular interactions except for completely elastic collisions with other molecules.
For a closed system containing an ideal gas, the state can be specified by giving the values of any two of pressure, temperature, and molar volume.

Consider a system, an ideal gas enclosed in a container.
Starting from an initial state 1, where the temperature is ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', its temperature is changed to ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' through a constant pressure process and then a constant molar volume process, then the ratio of pressures is found to be the same as the ratio of molar volumes.
Suppose the initial value of the pressure and molar volume are ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively, and final value of pressure and molar volume are  ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.
Note that we haven't chosen a specific scale for the temperature (like say, the Celsius scale).
Now, suppose we were to choose a scale such that ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''/''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''/''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can show that the value of ''pV/T'' is constant for an ideal gas, so that it obeys the gas equation ''pV = RT'', where ''p'' is the absolute pressure, ''V'' is the molar volume,  and ''R'' is a constant known as the [[wikipedia:gas constant | universal gas constant]].
The temperature ''T'' is the absolute temperature in the ideal gas scale, and the scale is found to be the same as the thermodynamic temperature scale.
The thermodynamic temperature scale will be defined after the statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

This equation  ''pV = RT'' is called the equation of state for an ideal gas, and is known as the ideal gas equation.  Most common gases obey the ideal gas equation unless they are compressed or cooled to extreme states, so this is a very useful relation.  A similar equation may be written where, for the specific type of gas, specific volume is used instead of molar volume and a specific gas constant is used instead of the universal gas constant. This then writes as pv = mrT.

[[Image:idealtemp_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Ideal Gas Temperature]]

In the above image, the volume of an ideal gas at two different pressures ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is plotted against the temperature in Celsius.
If we extrapolate the two straight line graphs, they intersect the temperature axis at a point ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &amp;minus;273.15&amp;deg;C.

From experiment, it is easy to show that the thermodynamic temperature ''T'' is related to the Celsius temperature ''t'' by the equation: ''T'' = ''t'' + 273.15.
The zero of thermodynamic temperature scale is 0 K, and its significance will be clear when we discuss the second law of thermodynamics.

----
I can see how a lot of the article needs to stay the same (preparation, etc.) but I think that each special installer needs a different page (Fedora, Debian, Mandrake, etc.) as they're all very different. &lt;small&gt;[ [[User:Alerante|alerante]] | [[User_talk:Alerante|&amp;#x201c;&amp;#x201d;]] 13:56, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC) ]&lt;/small&gt;

:It occurs to me that the best option may be to have only the easiest install (I think that an install of Debian from Knoppix is the best choice) on this page.  I haven't done that yet, but as far as I can tell, it's the easiest way for anyone running an i386 to get Linux.  Too many options can get confusing, so I think that the best thing to do would be to present a single course of action.  (Of course, if one doesn't like choices, Debian might not be the best bet...)  [[User:Paullusmagnus|Paullusmagnus]] 16:24, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:: Knoppix is marked as ''fair compatibility'' with Debian. It's true that is easy to install, but how it work when it is installed is another question... I think that is Ubuntu better for this purpose. Where are other Linux distributions in this WikiBook anyway? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 18:18, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

----
Is it just me or does this page, &quot;Installing Linux&quot; say very little about actually installing linux - [[User:Dhuss|Dhuss]] 19:53, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:It does say very little about installing Linux.  When dealing with Linux installs, most distributions are to the point where, they're seperate beasts getting things accomplished.  Since it's a wiki-book perhaps it'd be best to cover the major distro's in individual sections?  Or the book should be renamed, &quot;Installing $DISTRO Linux&quot;.  Either way, it's almost too broad of a subject, to cover everything in just one page or section for the install process.</text>

JavaScript has the arithmetic operators &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. These operators function as the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operators, and operate very similarly to other languages.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var a = 12 + 5;    // 17
var b = 12 - 5;    // 7
var c = 12*5;      // 60
var d = 12/5;      // 2.4 - division results in floating point numbers.
var e = 12%5;      // 2 - the remainder of 12/5 in integer math is 2.
&lt;/source&gt;

Some mathematical operations, such as dividing by zero, cause the returned variable to be one of the error values - for example, infinity, or &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt;.

The return value of the modulus operator maintains the sign of the first operand.

The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; operators also have unary versions, where they operate only on one variable. When used in this fashion, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; returns the number representation of the object, while &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; returns its negative counterpart.
&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var a = &quot;1&quot;;
var b = a;     // b = &quot;1&quot;: a string
var c = +a;    // c = 1: a number
var d = -a;    // d = -1: a number
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is also used as the string concatenation operator: If any of its arguments is a string or is otherwise ''not'' a number, any non-string arguments are converted to strings, and the 2 strings are concatenated. For example, &lt;code&gt;5 + [1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;51, 2, 3&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. More usefully, &lt;code&gt;str1 + &quot; &quot; + str2&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;str1&lt;/code&gt; concatenated with &lt;code&gt;str2&lt;/code&gt;, with a space between.

All other arithmetic operators will attempt to convert their arguments into numbers before evaluating. Note that unlike C or Java, the numbers and their operation results are not guaranteed to be integers.

== Bitwise operators ==
There are seven bitwise operators: &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

These operators convert their operands to integers (truncating any floating point towards 0), and perform the specified bitwise operation on them. The logical bitwise operators, &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, perform the ''and'', ''or'', and ''xor'' on each individual bit and provides the return value. The &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; (''not'' operator) inverts all bits within an integer, and usually appears in combination with the logical bitwise operators.

Two bit shift operators, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, move the bits in one direction that has a similar effect to multiplying or dividing by a power of two. The final bit-shift operator, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, operates the same way, but does not preserve the sign bit when shifting.

These operators are kept for parity with the related programming languages, but are unlikely to be used in most JavaScript programs.

== Assignment operators ==
The assignment operator &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; assigns a value to a variable. Primitive types, such as strings and numbers are assigned directly, however function and object names are just pointers to the respective function or object. In this case, the assignment operator only changes the reference to the object rather than the object itself.
For example, after the following code is executed, &quot;0, 1, 0&quot; will be alerted, even though &lt;tt&gt;setA&lt;/tt&gt; was passed to the alert, and &lt;tt&gt;setB&lt;/tt&gt; was changed. This is, because they are two references to the same object.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
setA = [ 0, 1, 2 ];
setB = setA;
setB[2] = 0;
alert(setA);
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, after the next bit of code is executed, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is a pointer to an empty array.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
z = [5];
x = z;
z.pop();
&lt;/source&gt;

All the above operators have corresponding assignment operators of the form ''operator''=. For all of them, x ''operator''= y is just a convenient abbreviation for x = x ''operator'' y.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Arithmetic !! Logical !! Shift
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;&amp;=&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;tt&gt;-=&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;tt&gt;*=&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;^=&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt; ||  || 
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;tt&gt;%=&lt;/tt&gt; ||  || 
|} 

For example, a common usage for &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt; is in a for loop

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var element = document.getElementsByTagName('h2');
var i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; element .length; i += 1) {
  // do something with element [i]
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Increment operators ==
There are also the increment and decrement operators, &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;a++&lt;/code&gt; increments &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and returns the old value of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;++a&lt;/code&gt; increments &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and returns the new value of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. The decrement operator functions similarly, but reduces the variable instead.

As an example, the last four lines all perform the same task:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var a = 1;
a = a + 1;
a += 1;
a++;
++a;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Pre and post-increment operators ===
Increment operators may be applied before or after a variable. When they are applied before or after a variable, they are pre-increment or post-increment operators, respectively. The choice of which to use changes how they affect operations.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
// increment occurs before a is assigned to b
var a = 1;
var b = ++a; // a = 2, b = 2;

// increment occurs to c after c is assigned to d
var c = 1;
var d = c++; // c = 2, d = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Due to the possibly confusing nature of pre and post-increment behaviour, code can be easier to read, if the increment operators are avoided.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
// increment occurs before a is assigned to b
var a = 1;
a += 1;
var b = a; // a = 2, b = 2;

// increment occurs to c after c is assigned to d
var c = 1;
var d = c;
c += 1; // c = 2, d = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Comparison operators ==
The comparison operators determine, if the two operands meet the given condition.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator !! Returns !! Notes
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the two operands are equal || May ignore operand's type&lt;br&gt;(e.g. a string as an integer)
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the two operands are identical || Does not ignore operands' types, and only&lt;br&gt;returns true if they are the same type and value
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the two operands are not equal || May ignore an operand's type&lt;br&gt;(e.g. a string as an integer)
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;!==&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the two operands are not identical || Does not ignore the operands' types, and only&lt;br&gt;returns false if they are the same type and value.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the first operand is greater than the second one || 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second one || 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the first operand is less than the second one || 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt; || true, if the first operand is less than or equal to the second one || 
|}

Be careful when using &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;, as they may ignore the type of one of the terms being compared. This can lead to strange and non-intuitive situations, such as:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
0 == '' // true
0 == '0' // true
false == 'false' // false; (''Boolean to string'')
false == '0' // true (''Boolean to string'')
false == undefined // false
false == null // false (''Boolean to null'')
null == undefined // true
&lt;/source&gt;

For stricter compares use &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!==&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
0 === '' // false
0 === '0' // false
false === 'false' // false
false === '0' // false
false === undefined // false
false === null // false
null === undefined // false
&lt;/source&gt;

== Logical operators ==
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; - and
* &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; - or
* &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; - not

The logical operators are ''and'', ''or'', and ''not''. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operators accept two operands and provides their associated logical result, while the third accepts one, and returns its logical negation. &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; are short circuit operators. If the result is guaranteed after evaluation of the first operand, it skips evaluation of the second operand.

Technically, the exact return value of these two operators is also equal to the final operand that it evaluated. Due to this, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator is also known as the guard operator, and the &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator is also known as the default operator.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
function handleEvent(event) {
    event = event || window.event;
    var target = event.target || event.srcElement;
    if (target &amp;&amp; target.nodeType === 1 &amp;&amp; target.nodeName === 'A') {
        // ...
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; operator determines the inverse of the given value, and returns the boolean: true values become false, or false values become true.

'''Note''': JavaScript represents false by either a Boolean false, the number 0, an empty string, or the built in undefined or null type. Any other value is treated as true.

== Other operators ==
=== &lt;code&gt;? :&lt;/code&gt; ===
The &lt;code&gt;? :&lt;/code&gt; operator (also called the &quot;ternary&quot; operator).
&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
var target = (a == b) ? c : d;
&lt;/source&gt;

Be cautious though in its use. Even though you can replace verbose and complex if/then/else chains with ternary operators, it may not be a good idea to do so. You can replace

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
if (p &amp;&amp; q) {
    return a;
} else {
    if (r != s) {
        return b;
    } else {
        if (t || !v) {
            return c;
        } else {
            return d;
        }
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

with

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
return (p &amp;&amp; q) ? a
  : (r != s) ? b
  : (t || !v) ? c
  : d
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is a poor coding style/practice. When other people edit or maintain your code, (which could very possibly be you,) it becomes much more difficult to understand and work with the code.

Instead, it is better to make the code more understandable. Some of the excessive conditional nesting can be removed from the above example.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
if (p &amp;&amp; q) {
    return a;
}
if (r != s) {
    return b;
}
if (t || !v) {
    return c;
} else {
    return d;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;delete x&lt;/code&gt; unbinds &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.

=== &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;new cl&lt;/code&gt; creates a new object of type ''cl''. The ''cl'' operand must be a constructor function.

=== &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;o instanceof c&lt;/code&gt; tests whether &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; is an object created by the constructor &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.

=== &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;typeof x&lt;/code&gt; returns a string describing the type of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Following values may be returned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://developer.mozilla.org/ | title = typeof | language = English | format = HTML | publisher = Mozilla Corporation | date = 2014-11-18 | archiveurl = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof | archivedate = 2014-11-18 | accessdate = 2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Installation of Fedora Core is through the Red Hat installer, &lt;tt&gt;anaconda&lt;/tt&gt;. There are two modes of installation, text and graphical. We will walk you through the graphical mode ''[is text similar?]'' in this guide.

Before installing, you should read the [http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/ release notes] for your version to ensure that there are no known issues with your system and components.

At this point, we will assume that you have the ISO images burned to a CD or DVD, and that there is sufficient room hard disk for what you plan to do. If you need help with the  As the process involves rebooting (several times), it is highly recommended at this point that you make a printed copy of this page for your reference.

If your BIOS does not support booting from a CD-ROM drive, you will need to make a copy of the boot disk.
:''[instructions for boot disk]''

While your computer is on, insert Fedora Core disc 1. If you are prompted to &quot;autorun&quot; the disc, choose not to. Then reboot your system.

After the initial boot sequence, the machine will read the CD drive and display a &lt;tt&gt;boot:&lt;/tt&gt; prompt. Simply press [Enter] to begin the installation.

:''The &lt;tt&gt;anaconda&lt;/tt&gt; text section is from memory, and is probably incorrect.''

The &lt;tt&gt;anaconda&lt;/tt&gt; software will start in text mode before switching to graphical, and will ask you if you would like to check the media that you are using to install Fedora Core. It is generally preferred that you choose &quot;OK&quot; and have it examine all four CDs or the DVD.

You will be presented with a list of keyboard layouts before proceeding to the graphical portion of the installation. Select the appropriate layout, and then press Enter.

At this time, the X server will start up and present you with a splash screen, and then an introduction to the installer. Off to the left is a help screen that will give you information on each screen as it is presented to you. Click &quot;Next&quot; at this point.</text>
