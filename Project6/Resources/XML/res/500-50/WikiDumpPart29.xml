== Usage ==

This template takes two variables:
* &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, can be any of &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;inherit&lt;/code&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-float]
* &lt;code&gt;limit&lt;/code&gt;, must be an integer. This limits how deep the TOC goes.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Active and Passive Participles&lt;/font&gt;===

The active participle is formed by adding '''-nt''' to the simple stem if it ends in '''-a''' or '''-e'''. If the stem ends in '''-u''' or '''-i''' '''-ent''' is added to the stem:

*'''brula – brulant''' (''(to) burn – burning'')
*'''rupte – ruptent''' (''(to) break – breaking'')

*'''seku - sekuent''' (''(to) follow – following'')
*'''mori - morient''' (''(to) die – dying'')

These are pronounced with the stress on the '''-ant''' or the '''-ent'''.

The endings '''-i''', '''-e''' '''-o''' or '''-a''' can be added to these forms with their usual meanings:

*'''brulanti okules''' –  ''burning eyes''
*'''amanti fema''' – ''a loving woman''
*'''amanta''' – ''a lover'' (female)
*'''amanto''' – ''a lover'' (male)
*'''amante''' – ''a lover'' (male or female)

The passive participle is formed by adding '''-t''' to the simple stem.

*'''brula – brulat''' (''(to) burn – burnt'')
*'''rupte – ruptet''' (''(to) break – broken'')

*'''seku - sekut''' (''(to) follow – followed'')
*'''mori - morit''' (''(to) die – dead'')


Notice that '''li kaptate''' in the title of lesson 4 literally means ''the captured (person)'', i.e. ''the captive.''


{{Novial/Exercise|Participles
|Complete the following sentences by translating the English word in brackets. 

#  Li (dead) homo proximeskad sur (galopping) kavale.
#  Me vud voli (interesting) libre.
#  Me ama men (loving) amikes.
#  Li (burnt) kadavre did lia in li agre.
#  Li (standing) stones es tre oldi.
#  Que ha plasa les sub (shining) lume?
#  Prega por li (departed people).
#  Li (captive) did fuga sur (unsaddled) kavale.

#  Bonim (told) rakontes interesa me.
|
#  Li '''morit''' homo proximeskad sur '''galopanti''' kavale.
#  Me vud voli '''interesanti''' libre.
#  Me ama men '''amanti''' amikes.
#  Li '''brulat''' cadavre did lia in li agre.
#  Li '''steanti''' stones es tre oldi.
#  Que ha plasa les sub '''lumanti''' lume?
#  Prega por li '''departates'''.
#  Li '''kaptate''' did fuga sur '''non-sadlat''' kavale.
#  Vu deved lerna bonim '''lernat''' lektione.
#  Bonim '''rakontat''' rakontes interesa me.
}}

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Conjunctions from Prepositions plus KE&lt;/font&gt;===

Several conjunctions are formed by placing the simple conjunction '''ke''' (''that'') after a preposition:

*'''after ke''' – ''after which''
*'''durant ke''' – ''while''
*'''pro ke''' – ''because, on account of the fact that''
*'''til ke ''' – ''until''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Reciprocal Pronoun MUTU&lt;/font&gt;===

The phrase ''one another'', ''each other'' is translated with the pronoun '''mutu'''. Adding the adjectival ending  '''-al''' forms the adjective '''mutual''' (''mutual'').

*'''li amantes ama mutu''' – ''the lovers love one another''
*'''les rakonta rakontes a mutu''' – ''they tell stories to each other''
*'''les tima mutu''' – ''they fear each other''
or
*'''les tima mutualim''' – ''they fear each other (mutually)''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Anaphoric Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

As we have seen in Lesson 1 adjectives are made into corresponding nouns with the endings '''-e, -a, -o''' and '''-u'''. However, if an adjective is used alone referring to a noun just mentioned (anaphorically) it retains the '''-i''' ending and if plural an '''-s''' is added to the '''-i'''. For example:

*'''tri ek li homes, li maxim kurajosis o forsan li maxim ebris''' - ''three of the men, the bravest or perhaps the drunkest''
*''' un ek les morid e li du altris esed ruptet homes ''' - ''one of them died and the two others were broken men''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Prefix DES-&lt;/font&gt;===

The prefix '''des-''' forms the direct opposite of the root word.

*'''felisi – desfelisi''' (''happy – unhappy'')
*'''honorabli – deshonorabli''' (''honourable – dishonourable'')
*'''espera – desespera''' (''(to) hope – (to) despair'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Adjectival Suffix -OSI&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-osi''' forms adjectives which mean having or possessing, especially in great quantity.

*'''otie – otiosi''' (''leisure – idle, unoccupied'')
*'''timo – timosi''' (''fear – fearful'')
*'''kuraje – kurajosi''' (''courage – courageous, brave'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The General Suffix -ET-&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-et-''' forms diminutives:

*'''kastele – kastelete''' (''castle – chateau, small castle'')
*'''plora – ploreta''' (''weep – whimper'')
*'''drinka – drinketa''' (''(to) drink – (to) sip'')

It also forms terms of affection:

*'''patro – patreto''' (''father – daddy'')
*'''matra – matreta''' (''mother – mummy'')

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Seacrete ==
By using a low current and a metal mesh you can cause minerals to be deposited on the mesh.  Rate of deposition is limited by current used, flow rate of water and many other variables. This is a fairly environmentally-friendly technique as the only resources it requires that are not easy to provide from a renewable source is the mesh although, perhaps, it is feasible to recycle scrap metal.
Of course, the energy to produce the electricity must also be considered and this will require resources.

== Concrete ==
Concrete is not a particularly 'green' material.  Every ton of concrete releases two tons of carbon dioxide 

== Pikecrete/Pykrete ==
Pikecrete is a compound invented by a British scientist named Geoffrey Pyke working under Lord Mountbatten during the Second World War.  It consists of ice with 14% sawdust or wood pulp and 86% water mixed into a slurry and frozen.  The resulting compound is not only roughly as strong as concrete, but also resists melting and is able to float, being less dense.  It also does not suffer from concrete's carbon dioxide output issues.

'''History'''
Lord Mountbatten threw a small block into Churchill's bath water as he rushed into his house and gave him the idea of building an aircraft carrier (HMS Habakkuk and sister ships) out of pikecrete.  The ship would have been larger than anything before or since, and it could resist (unlike normal ships) torpedoes and bullets.

Supposedly, Lord Mountbatten demonstrated this by firing two rounds from his revolver--one at ice which was shattered, and then at the pikecrete which actually bounced off and nicked Admiral Ernest King in the leg, making his point. 

Pikecrete theoretically only needs cooling pipes to keep it afloat in tropical waters.  Aircraft carriers made of it would therefore have been able to stay afloat, only needing to go to the Arctic every few years for a complete re-freezing.

'''Currently'''
As of today pikecrete/pykerete is not considered relevant by most scientists.  Pykrete is generally only used for glacial reconstruction.

== Steel and other metals ==
Steel hulls have some great benefits. It's readily available all over the globe, it's not prone to marine borers, it is quite cheap once you come up to a certain scale (some where around 7 meters in diameter for a circular island).

But it certainly has some backsides as well. Since sea water is inherently eroding on almost all metals, the steel has to be protected in some way. The obvious solution to the layman is of course different kinds of paints and varnishes. As one intuitively understands, this not an ecological way, and since it usually demands some re-applying every now and then you might have to see to that your island is capable of being dry docked. Another alternative of conservation, or more correct, for delaying the erosion, is using anodes. The two methods can be combined.

== Plastics and ceramics ==
Making plastics is considered non eco-friendly as it requires fossil fuel to produce it. However, on the up side, plastic does not decay and deteriorate. We could make islands using recycled plastic bottles which would contribute to recycling our already existing water bottles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Signals in the real world tend to be analog. For example the water level in a tank or the speed of car as measured by a tacho-generator. In order to process them with a digital circuit, we need to convert them to digital signals.  Conversely, once the digital signals are processed, they must often be converted back to an analog signal.  An example would be processing an audio signal digitally and sending it to a speaker.  The speaker requires an analog signal.

==Analog-to-Digital Conversion==

An Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) takes an analog input signal and converts the input, through a mathematical function, into a digital output signal.  While there are many ways of implementing an ADC, there are three conceptual steps that occur.  
#The signal is sampled.
#The sampled signal is quantized.
#The quantized signal is digitally coded.


===Sampling===
By sampling we turn a continuous-time function which may take on infinitely many values at different times into a discretised function that may take on infinitely many values at different discrete indices.

Sampling generally is done with a Sample-And-Hold circuit (simple experiments can be done using a capacitor and switch). To be able to reconstruct the signal we must consider the [[Electronics/Sampling Theorem|Sampling Theorem]] which says that a sampling frequency twice the highest frequency we're expecting is needed.

===Quantization===

Quantization is the process of taking a continuous voltage signal and mapping it to a discrete number of voltage levels.  The number of voltage levels affects the quantization noise that occurs.  Since digital computers are binary in nature, the number of quantization levels is usually a power  of 2, i.e., 

&lt;math&gt;N = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;

where n is the number of quantization bits.

The signal may be amplified or attenuated before going into the ADC, so that the maximum and minimum voltage levels give the best compromise between resolution of the signal levels and minimization of clipping.

===Coding===

Coding is the process of converting the quantized signals into a digital representation.  This coding is performed by giving each quantization level a unique label.  For instance, if four bits are used, the lowest level may be (in binary) 0000, and the next highest level 0001, etc.

==Digital-to-Analog Conversion==

An Digital to Analog converter (DAC) takes a digital signal and converts it, through a mathematical function, into an analog signal.  Again, the DAC may be implemented in a number of ways, but conceptually it contains two steps.
#Convert each time step of the digital signal into an &quot;impulse&quot; with the appropriate energy.  In a real system, this could be accomplished by creating short pulses that have the same voltage, but whose total power is modified by changing the pulse length.  This pulse train produces a signal whose frequency response is periodic (and theoretically extends to infinity).
#Apply a low-pass filter to the time sequence of impulses.  This removes all of the high-frequency periodicities, leaving only the original signal.
In fact along with the counters we are using digital to analog convertor while converting analog signal to digital signals also.
Here we can use counter along with the shift register to store the digital data.

==Epidemiology==
* More common in blacks than whites
* More common in males than females (1.6:1)
* Median age at presentation is 55-60

==Presentation==
* Generally presents in patients with long history of skin plaques, rash, plaques, pruritis, erythroderma
* 5% present as Sezary Syndrome (defined historically by the triad of erythroderma, generalized lymphadenopathy, and presence of Sezary cells in skin, nodes, and peripheral blood)

==Histology==
* Typical cells are lymphocytes with cerebriform and sometimes hyperchromatic nuclei, and mostly confined to the epidermis.
* Sezary cells are enlarged atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei

==Pathogenesis==
* PMID 15128898, 2004 &amp;mdash; &quot;The pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides.&quot;  Girardi M, Heald PW, Wilson LD.  2004 May 6;350:1978-88.

==WHO-EORTC Classification==
During recent consensus meetings, the WHO and EORTC agreed upon a new classification system for cutaneous lymphomas which is now called the WHO-EORTC Classification. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15692063&amp;dopt=Citation PMID: 15692063]
* '''Indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphomas''' - includes mycosis fungoides, lymphomatoid papulosis, primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. These entities have 5-year disease specific survival of approximately 80-100%
* '''Aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphomas''' - includes Sezary syndrome, primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma.  These entities have 5-year disease specific survival of &lt;25%

==Prognosis==
* 97% 10-year disease specific survival with limited patch/plaque disease
* 83% 10-year disease specific survival with generalized patch/plaque disease
* 42% 10-year disease specific survival with tumor stage disease
* 20% 10-year disease specific survival with lymph node involvement

==Staging==
'''2009 AJCC Staging (7th edition)'''


'''T Stage'''
* T1 - Limited patch/plaque (&lt;10% total skin surface)
**T1a - Patch only
**T1b - Plaque +/- patch
* T2 - Generalized patch/plaque (&gt;10% total skin surface)
**T2a - Patch only
**T2b - Plaque +/- patch
* T3 - One or more tumors (&amp;ge; 1cm diameter)
* T4 - Confluence of erythema covering 80% or more of body surface area

'''N Stage'''
* N0 - Nodes clinically uninvolved
* N1 - Nodes clinicall abnormal, histopathology Dutch grade 1 or NCI LN0-2
**N1a - Clone negative
**N1b - Clone positive
* N2 - Nodes clinically abnormal, histopathology Dutch grade 2 or NCI LN3
**N2a - Clone negative
**N2b - Clone positive
* N3 - Nodes clinically abnormal, histopathology Dutch grade 3-4 or NCI LN4

'''M Stage'''
* M0 - No visceral involvement
* M1 - Visceral involvement (must have pathology or imaging confirmation)

'''B Stage (Blood)'''
* B0 - No circulating Sezary cells (&lt;5% of lymphocytes)
**B0a - Clone negative
**B0b - Clone positive
* B1 - Circulating Sezary cells (≥5% of lymphocytes)
**B1a - Clone negative
**B1b - Clone positive
*B2 - High blood tumor burden (&amp;ge; 1000/uL Sezary cells with positive clone)


''Notes'':
*Patch indicates any size skin lesion without significant elevation or induration. Presence/absence of hypo- or hyperpigmentation, scale, crusting, and/or poikiloderma should be noted
*Plaque indicates any size skin lesion that is elevated or indurated. Presence/absence of scale, crusting, and/or poikiloderma should be noted
*Tumor indicates at least one 1-cm diameter solid or nodular lesion with evidence of depth and/or vertical growth. Note total number of lesions, total volume of lesions, largest size lesion, and region of body involved
*Abnormal node indicates any palpable peripheral node that on physical examination is firm, irregular, clustered, fixed or 1.5 cm or larger in diameter. Node groups examined on physical examination include cervical, supraclavicular, epitrochlear, axillary, and inguinal. Central nodes are not currently considered in the nodal classification, unless used to establish N3 histopathologically
*T-cell clone is defined by PCR or Southern blot analysis of the T-cell receptor gene

{{Wikipedia|Pro-form}}
Japanese has demonstratives (words for pointing to the subject of discussion) much in the same way that many other languages do. Japanese demonstratives are highly regular and take four standard prefixes:
* こ〜, for objects close to the speaker;
* そ〜, for objects closer to the listener;
* あ〜, for objects far from either; and
* ど〜, for question forms.

{{Japanese example|
: '''ど'''れがあなたのものですか？ — Which is yours?
: '''こ'''れです。 — (It) is this.
: '''そ'''れです。 — (It) is this.
: '''あ'''れです。 — That over there (yonder).}}

These are suffixed with various pronoun indicators that are listed in the table below.

Japanese also makes a destinction between a ''prenominal'' form and regular form, meaning that the prenominal form must describe a noun that follows. For example, in the sentence &quot;This cat&quot; the word &quot;''this''&quot; describes the cat.  The prenominal form replaces the れ with a の. In that way, &quot;あの&quot;, &quot;その&quot; and &quot;この&quot; are the ''prenominal'' forms of &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;.

{{Japanese example|
: '''あの'''ねこはわかいです。 - That (distant) cat is young.}}

which
! [〜れ]
| '''Objects (normal)'''; a demonstrative pronoun to replace naming objects. For example, you can name a thing that the listener is holding in his hands, or a house that the listener is standing by just &quot;それ sore&quot;.

|-
|この&lt;br /&gt;
this ~
|その&lt;br /&gt;
that ~ by you
|あの&lt;br /&gt;
that ~
|どの&lt;br /&gt;
which ~
! [〜の]
| '''Objects  (prenominal)'''; indicates objects located somewhere. Must be followed by a noun. For example, &quot;あの　ひと ano hito&quot; means &quot;some person&quot; or &quot;a certain person&quot; distant (but known) from both speaker and listener. The [〜の] suffix is used not only with the こ, そ, あ and ど stems, but also with other pronouns and nouns to indicate genitive.
|-
|ここ&lt;br /&gt;
here
|そこ&lt;br /&gt;
there by you
|あそこ&lt;br /&gt;
there
|どこ&lt;br /&gt;
where
! [〜こ]
| '''Location'''. Refers to a place. Note that &quot;あそこ asoko&quot; is the correct way of saying &quot;that place over there&quot;, not &quot;あこ ako&quot;.
|-
|こちら&lt;br /&gt;
this way
|そちら&lt;br /&gt;
that way by you
|あちら&lt;br /&gt;
that way
|どちら&lt;br /&gt;
which way
! [〜ちら]
| '''Direction''' Direction or point of origin. There is also a shortened form of &quot;〜ちら chira&quot; - &quot;〜っち tchi&quot;, which is almost as polite as the full form and is rather widely used, although should be avoided when speaking at formal events. In some translations. it may seem rather similar to the 〜う u group, but in reality it is different, as the 〜ちら chira group means direction, way to go somewhere, or sometimes place, but the 〜う u group means ways or methods to do something. Words belonging to the 〜ちら group are also a formal replacement for the 〜こ group.
|-
|こんな&lt;br /&gt;
this kind of
|そんな&lt;br /&gt;
that kind of
|あんな&lt;br /&gt;
that kind of
|どんな&lt;br /&gt;
what kind of
! [〜んな]
| '''A kind of'''. Indicates a class of things, and is usually translated as &quot;such a&quot; or &quot;kind of&quot;. For example, &quot;どんな　いろ&quot; means &quot;what kind of color&quot;. &quot;〜ういう&quot; may be used instead of &quot;〜んな nna&quot;. Note that the あ a-form of the &quot;〜ういう uiu&quot; is &quot;ああいう aaiu&quot;.
|-
|こう&lt;br /&gt;
in this way
|そう&lt;br /&gt;
in that way
|ああ&lt;br /&gt;
in that way
|どう&lt;br /&gt;
in which way
! [〜う]
| '''A way'''. Expresses a way of doing something (method). For example &quot;どう dou&quot; can be translated as &quot;how&quot;, and &quot;そう sou&quot; can be translated as &quot;that way&quot; or &quot;so&quot;. Note that the あ a-form is &quot;ああ aa&quot;, not &quot;あう au&quot;.
|-
|こいつ&lt;br /&gt;
this person
|そいつ&lt;br /&gt;
that person by you
|あいつ&lt;br /&gt;
that person
|どいつ&lt;br /&gt;
which person
! [〜いつ]
| '''A person.''' Nowadays this is a rather rude way to name persons. For example, speaking of a person you do not respect and/or who is lower than you in social hierarchy, who is not there when you are speaking of him, you may use &quot;あいつ aitsu&quot; meaning &quot;that guy&quot;. This is only to be used informally. An acceptable way to express the same meaning is using a word from the 〜の group followed by ひと (人), e.g.  &quot;あの ひと&quot;, meaning &quot;that person&quot;.
|-
| こなた&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;
| そなた&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;
| あなた&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;that person&lt;/span&gt;, you
| どなた&lt;br /&gt;
who
! [〜なた]
| '''A person'''.  While 〜いつ itsu is just rude, this one is trickier. Originally, あなた anata was rather honorific, but now it is either neutrally formal when addressing strangers (it is a standard way of telling &quot;you&quot; taught in most Japanese language courses), or intimate (this is what a wife uses when talking to her husband to address him). Like all pronouns, you should avoid using あなた if possible. A more common way to refer to someone is by their name with the appropriate suffix (さん, くん, ちゃん) and not to use other pronouns of this group unless you know what you are doing.  こなた konata and そなた sonata are rare nowadays, although you may still encounter them in classic literature or in movies about historical events.  どなた donata is a polite word for &quot;who?&quot;.
|}

Note that the 〜ちら chira group may be used instead of the 〜こ ko group and also may be appended with の no instead of the 〜の no group in some cases in more official (formal) expressions. For example, &quot;こちらの kochira no&quot; can also mean &quot;this (object/thing)&quot;.

== Which which ==

There are several ways to say which depending on the number and item being asked about.

While these are by no means hard rules, &quot;どちら&quot; is more used particularly for two objects while &quot;どれ&quot; is mainly used for three or more items. For a particular item one can use &quot;どの〜&quot; (for whatever number) though &quot;どちらの〜&quot; is also common.

{| {{Japanese example}}
| '''どちら''' の {{furi|道|みち}} を {{furi|行|い|きます}} か 。
| Which way will you take?
|-
| {{furi|鉛|なまり}} と {{furi|金|きん}} と で は 、 '''どちら''' が {{furi|重|おも|い}} か 。
| Which is heavier, lead or gold?
|-
| '''どっち''' が {{furi|勝|か|って}} も {{furi|嬉|うれ|しい}} 。
| Which ever wins, I'll be happy.
|-
| '''どの''' {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}} に {{furi|乗|の|る}} の です か 。
| Which train are you catching?
|-
| '''どの''' {{furi|犬|いぬ}} が あなた の もの です か 。
| Which dog is yours?
|-
| '''どの''' {{furi|靴|くつ}} を はく つもり です か 。
| Which shoes are you going to put on?
|-
| '''どの''' チーム が {{furi|勝|か|つ}} だろ う か 。
| Which team will win?
|-
| {{furi|大中小|だいちゅうしょう}} あります が '''どれ''' に します か 。
| We have large, medium, and small, what size do you want?
|}

== Also... ==

どのくらい
どれぐらい
どれほど
どれだけ

== None, all, some ==

どれも、どれか
どれでも

== A note on kanji ==

The prefixes have kanji, but these are written in kana in modern Japanese. They are:
* こ〜: 此
* そ〜: 其
* あ〜: 彼
* ど〜: 何
Some of the suffixes similarly have kanji:
* 〜こ: 処
* 〜ちら: 方
* 〜いつ: 奴

The main interrogative pronouns in Dutch are:
:Wie? - Who?
:Wat? - What?

As in English ''wie'' also has possessive form:
:Wiens? - Whose?

More properly said this is the form for the masculine and neuter singular. There is also a form ''wier'' for the feminine singular and the plural. As this division of labor does not chime well with the disappearance of feminine gender, this form is fast becoming obsolete. ''Wiens'' gets used in all cases nowadays, or it gets supplanted by
:Van wie is die tekening?

Or even, though, this is frowned upon in official grammar:
:Wie z'n tekening is dat?

The latter construction is the official form in Afrikaans, but in Dutch is considered colloquial if not dialect.

The interrogative adjective is:
:Welk  - which

It is inflected like an adjective, and it has an ending -e in most cases:
:De tekening - Welke tekening?
:De tekeningen - Welke tekeningen?

But not with a neuter noun:
:Het paard - Welk paard? 

The pronoun ''wat'' cannot be used as adjective, but there is a construction:
:Wat voor (een)? - What kind of?

''Wat'' is also used as an indefinite pronoun with the meaning of ''some'' 
:Er gingen ''wat'' vingers omhoog
:&quot;~There were ''some'' fingers that were stuck in the air.&quot;
:Some fingers went up

Notice that its indefinite character triggers an impersonal construction with ''er''.

There is also an interrogative adverb:
:Hoe?  - How?
:Hoe komt dat op de grond?
:How did that land on the floor?
:Hoe maakt u het?
:How do you do?

==Relative pronouns==
Relative pronouns in Dutch are in some case similar to the interrogative ones:
*Ik weet niet '''wie''' er komt - I don't know '''who''' is coming.
*Ik weet niet '''welke''' tekening ik moest maken - I don't know '''which''' drawing to make.

Other relative pronouns resemble the demonstrative ones:
*Dat is de tekening '''die''' op de grond ligt - That is the drawing '''that''' lies on the ground.
For a singular neuter word it becomes '''dat'''
*Dat is het krijt '''dat''' op de grond ligt. - That is the crayon '''that''' lies on the floor.

In the above example the part ''het krijt'' is called the ''antecedent'' in both Dutch and English grammar. In Dutch when the antecedent is included into the relative pronoun, the intial '''d-''' of dat changes into a '''w-'''

:'''Wat''' op de grond ligt is de tekening - '''That which''' lies on the floor, is the drawing.

For persons '''wie''' is also used this way:
:'''Wie''' zijn tekening af heeft, moet het zeggen - '''Whoever''' is finished with his drawing should say so.

It is possible to make the antecedent explicit with the demonstrative pronouns '''datgene''' and '''diegene''':
:'''Diegene die''' zijn tekening af heeft ... or in plural: Diegene'''n''' die hun tekening
:'''Datgene wat''' op de vloer ligt

Notice that after ''datgene'' it is '''wat''' that follows.
'''Wat''' is also used when the reference points back to an entire phrase
:De tekening ligt op de vloer, '''wat''' erg vervelend is - The drawing lies on the floor; '''which''' is really annoying.

Lastly there are a few antecedents are always followed by '''wat'''
:het eerste wat  - the first thing that
:alles wat  - everything that
:iets wat  - something that
:veel wat  - much that
:weinig wat - little that

Admittedly, there is considerable confusion under Dutch speakers about when to use ''dat'' and when to use ''wat''. So do not be surprised so see and especially hear deviations from the above official grammar rules. In Afrikaans e.g. the pronoun of choice is ''wat'' in all cases and some Dutch speakers are not far from that usage.

In English relative pronouns are often omitted, in Dutch this is '''not''' the case:

:This is something &lt;s&gt;''that''&lt;/s&gt; I saw yesterday -&gt; Dit is iets '''wat''' ik gisteren zag.

As we have seen before the word order in Dutch is peculiar in such sentences: look at the positions of ''saw'' and its Dutch cousin ''zag''. Below we will start to deal with this issue.

==Word order==
Many English speakers who set out to learn the Dutch language succeed in their effort to a considerable extent. Some of them become quite fluent. They do encounter a few problems. One is that Dutch speakers consider it polite to reply in English when detecting an English accent and it takes some insisting to break through that barrier. Another major stumbling block is the fact that Dutch has retained West-Germanic word order and English has abandoned it in favor of one that resembled that of the French-speaking nobility that ruled the land after 1066. We'll examine a number of aspects.

===Inversion===
We have already seen a number of examples of inversion. For example, that of the of verb and subject in '''questions''':

:Jij hebt een mooi huis.
:Heb je een mooi huis?


Apart from the fact that the final '''''-t''''' is lost for the jij-form of the verb, this is not unfamiliar, as inversion also occurs in some English phrases like:

:Hi, how goes it?
:What say you?

Although often English resorts to the auxiliary verb ''to do'', where Dutch uses only inversion:

:Maar wat zie ik daar?
:But what do I see there?

Another example of inversion occurs when the order is changed for the sake of '''emphasis''' by putting an item at the beginning of the sentence.

:Een mooi huis heb je!
::That's a fine house you've got!

:Morgen ga ik naar huis.
::Tomorrow I'm going home.

: Je gooit je andere tekening toch niet zomaar op de grond!
:: Maar dan gooi je je andere tekening toch niet zomaar op de grond!

Sometimes this is not so much a question of emphasis. It is more a way to stuff a few more items in the same sentence, particularly adverbs or adverbial expressions.

:Zonder twijfel gaat hij morgen naar huis.
::Undoubtedly he will go home tomorrow.

Notice that the adverb of time (morgen) precedes the indication of place here, because ''naar huis gaan'' is felt as a verbal expression and verbs tend to end up at the end of the sentence.

===Verbs in final position===
Another feature we have already encountered is that in tenses that use an auxiliary the  participle or infinitive is put at the end of the sentence:

:Ik ''heb gezien''
:Gisteren ''heb'' ik vanaf de [[:wikt:nl:dijk|dijk]] een aantal [[:wikt:nl:kluut|kluten]] ''gezien''
:Morgen ''zal'' ik nog eens op de dijk ''gaan [[:wikt:nl:kijken|kijken]]''.

Notice that in this case the inversion is applied on the auxiliary (heb ik..., zal ik...) and that in compounds with more that one infinitive as ''gaan kijken'' (go have a look) they both end up at the end. Whether ''gaan'' or ''kijken'' goes first varies a little from region to region; one can also hear—particularly in the south:

:Morgen ''zal'' ik nog eens op de dijk ''kijken gaan''.

===Indirect clauses and conjunctions===
In Dutch, word order is used to mark what role a clause plays with respect to the rest of the sentence. The indirect clause has a different order, particularly in the position of the verb.

:jij '''hebt''' een mooi huis
:ik zie dat je een mooi huis '''hebt'''

In this case it is the ''persoonsvorm'', i.e. the conjugated part of the verb (that carries the ''-t'' ending) that moves to the end of the clause to indicate that it has become the direct object of the main clause ''ik zie...''.

This is also true if the persoonsvorm is an auxiliary:

:jij '''bent''' [[:wikt:nl:gisteren|gisteren]] met de [[:wikt:nl:trein|trein]] naar huis gegaan
:ik betwijfel dat je gisteren met de trein naar huis gegaan '''bent'''

Again there is some variation possible:

:ik betwijfel dat je gisteren met de trein naar huis '''bent''' gegaan.

The same principle applies after a conjunction like ''omdat'' (because).

:Je hebt gelijk omdat ik met de auto gegaan '''ben'''.

And also when interrogatives are used as relative pronouns:

:Eerst wist ik niet ''welke'' tekening ik '''moest maken'''

The order:

:Eerst wist ik niet ''welke'' tekening ik '''maken moest'''

is not wrong, but rather uncommon in this case.

===Onderschikkend and nevenschikkend===
Not all conjunctions produce a hierarchical relationship. Conjunctions (''voegwoorden'') like ''want'' (for) ''of'' (or) and ''en'' (and) ''maar'' (but) simply link two equivalent phrases. Compare:

:Je hebt ongelijk ''want'' ik '''ben''' gisteren wel degelijk met de trein naar huis gegaan
:Je hebt ongelijk ''omdat'' ik gisteren wel degelijk met de trein naar huis gegaan '''ben'''

In the case of ''want'' (for) the two clauses are on equal footing, in the case of ''omdat'' (because) the first part ''je hebt gelijk'' (you are right) is the master program and the rest a subroutine initiated with ''omdat'' (because).

Conjunctions that produce a subordinate clause are known as ''onderschikkend'', in English, they are known as ''subordinating conjunctions''; the ones that link two phrases in equality are called ''nevenschikkend'', in English, ''co-ordinating conjunctions''.

(Sometimes the ''onderschikkend'' kind is called '''''sub'''''junctions rather than conjunctions (see e.g. the German wiktionary), but in English where the distinction is of no consequence for the syntax this is unusual.)

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Nevenschikkend (co-ordinating)
| [[:wikt:nl:en|en]]
| [[:wikt:nl:maar|maar]]
| [[:wikt:nl:want|want]]
| [[:wikt:nl:of|of]] (or)
| [[:wikt:nl:dus|dus]]
| ---
|-
!Onderschikkend (subordinating)
|[[:wikt:nl:omdat|omdat]]
|[[:wikt:nl:hoewel|hoewel]] 
|[[:wikt:nl:zodat|zodat]]
|[[:wikt:nl:of|of]] (if,whether)
|[[:wikt:nl:wanneer|wanneer]]
|most other conjuctions
|}

Because the relative role of the clauses is more clearly marked by their word order, it is  possible to make longer sentences in Dutch without generating ambiguity. In English compound sentences become confusing and ambivalent more easily. When writing English, a speaker of Dutch needs to fight the tendency to produce convoluted sentences. Conversely Dutch may look somewhat long-winded to an English speaker. 

{{Dutch/Exercise|Conjunctions
|
Use the conjunction in brackets to unify into one sentence:

:Het is niet mogelijk. Dit is niet op deze manier gebeurd. ([[:wikt:nl:omdat|omdat]])
:Het is niet mogelijk. Het is wel op deze manier gebeurd. ([[:wikt:nl:hoewel|hoewel]])
:Het is heel erg. Het is wel op deze manier gebeurd. ([[:wikt:nl:maar|maar]])
:Jan is met de trein gekomen. Hij is met de auto gekomen. ([[:wikt:nl:of|of]])
:Jan is met de trein gekomen. Hij blijft hier een paar dagen. ([[:wikt:nl:en|en]])
:Jan is met de trein gekomen. Hij blijft hier een paar dagen. ([[:wikt:nl:zodat|zodat]])
|

:Het is niet mogelijk omdat dit niet op deze manier gebeurd '''is'''
:Het is niet mogelijk, hoewel het wel op deze manier gebeurd '''is'''. 
:Het is heel erg, maar het '''is''' wel op deze manier gebeurd.
:Jan is met de trein gekomen of hij '''is''' met de auto gekomen. 
:Jan is met de trein gekomen en hij '''blijft''' hier een paar dagen. ([[:wikt:nl:en|en]])
:Jan is met de trein gekomen zodat hij hier een paar dagen '''blijft'''. ([[:wikt:nl:zodat|zodat]])
}}

==Copulas==
As in English the verb ''zijn'' (to be) is the most important copula, or ''koppelwerkwoord'' lit. ''coupling verb''. As the name indicates these verbs couple a subject to a ''predicate'' of subject ''complement'' as opposed to having one or more objects.

The complement can be a '''noun''':
:Jan is bakker  - John is a baker by profession

But is can also be an '''adjective''':
:Jan is dik - John is fat.

Sometimes '''prepositional adverbs''' are also used as predicates

:Het licht is uit  - the light is off

Some words in Dutch are only used as predicates like ''beu'' (sick and tired):
:Ik ben het gezeur beu. - I am fed up with the nagging.

The ''het gezeur'' part is usually called an ''oorzakelijk voorwerp'' in Dutch grammar which translates into ''causative object''. In the past it would have taken a genitive case, but that no longer is the case.


There a number of other verbs besides ''zijn'' that can act as copulas:
===worden===
Primitive tenses: worden - werd - geworden.

In English it translates into ''to become''.
:Jan wil bakker worden. - John wants to become a baker
===lijken===
Primitive tenses: lijken - leek - geleken.

In English it translates into: ''to seem'', ''to appear''
:Het leek groter dan het was - It seemed larger than it was.
===blijken===
Primitive tenses: blijken - bleek - gebleken.

In English it translates into: ''to prove to be, to turn out''
:Het bleek groter dan we dachten - It turned out to be larger than we thought.
===blijven===
Primitive tenses: blijven - bleef - gebleven.

In English it translates into: ''to remain, to stay''
:De lucht bleef  donker - The sky remained dark.
===heten===
Primitive tenses: heten - heette - geheten.

In English it translates into: ''to be called, to be alleged to be''
:Hij heette Jan. - His name was John.
:Het heet goed te zijn voor je gezondheid - Allegedly it is good for your health
===dunken===
Primitive tenses: dunken - docht - gedocht.

This is an impersonal verb. In English it is represented in the expression ''methinks''. Its meaning is ''to give cause to think''. It is becoming obsolete in Dutch as wel
:Mij docht dit niet verantwoord - It appeared to me not to be responsible.
===schijnen===
Primitive tenses: schijnen - scheen - geschenen.

In English it translates into: ''to be said to be'', ''to be alleged to be''
:Het schijnt goed te zijn voor je gezondheid - Allegedly it is good for your health

==Grammatica 12-1. Worden and the Passive Voice==

In most languages transitive verbs can be put in the '''passive voice'''. In English for example:

:Active: The cook prepares ''dinner''.
:Passive: ''Dinner'' is prepared by the cook.

The object ''dinner'' of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive one. It is this 'transition' that makes the verb to prepare a transitive one.

The passive voice is formed by means of its own auxiliary ''worden'' in Dutch. It is a regular strong verb:

:worden – werd – geworden

===Use as a copula===
As we have seen the verb ''worden'' can also be used as a verb (copula) in its own right rather than as an auxiliary and then it translates into ''to become'' or ''to get''. Compare:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
|{{knp2|worden}}||{{knp2|werd}}||{{knp2|geworden}}||to become
|-
|||||de {{knp2|piloot}}||pilot
|-
|||||de {{knp2|kroot}}||red beet
|-
|||||{{knp2|kwaad}}||angry
|}
:Ik '''word''' piloot
::I (will) '''become''' a pilot

:Hij '''werd''' zo rood als een kroot!
::He '''became''' as red as a beet (He blushed for shame).

:Je schilderij '''wordt''' erg mooi!
::Your painting '''is turning out''' very well!

:Niet kwaad '''worden'''!
::Don't '''get''' mad!

===The perfect of ''worden''===
As ''worden'' describes a ''process'' rather than an action, it is itself an '''''ergative''''' verb. (More about those below). In Dutch that means that it takes the verb '''zijn''' in the perfect and not ''to have'' as in English.

:Hij '''is''' piloot geworden
:He '''has''' become a pilot.

===Use of ''worden'' as an auxiliary===
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
|{{knp2|verslaan}}||{{knp2|versloeg}}||{{knp2|verslagen}}||to beat, defeat
|}
As an auxiliary + past participle ''worden'' expresses the passive voice:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Hij&lt;/font&gt; '''verslaat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt; ==&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt; '''word''' door &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;hem&lt;/font&gt; '''verslagen'''
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;He&lt;/font&gt; '''beats''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt; ==&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;I&lt;/font&gt; '''am beaten''' by &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;him&lt;/font&gt;

Notice the change in word order: 
#As in the case of the perfect tenses the past participle moves to the very end of the sentence.
#As in English &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;the subject (he)&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the object (me)&lt;/font&gt; swap places.
#The old subject becomes an expression with ''door'' (English: ''by'')

{{Dutch/Exercise|Use of worden|

:He got very mad.
:We have become merchants.
:This is seen as something good
:You are getting very red in the sun.

:He got very mad.
:::Hij werd erg kwaad
:We have become merchants.
:::We zijn handelaars geworden
:This is seen as something good
:::Dit wordt als iets goeds gezien
:You are getting very red in the sun.
:::Je wordt erg rood in de zon

:Word je niet {{C|bang|scared}}?
:::Aren't you getting scared? 
:Zij waren vrienden geworden.
:::They had become friends
:Dat wordt hier niet gegeten.
:::That is not eaten here.
}}

===The perfect tense of the passive===
The perfect tense of the passive can cause some confusion because of the ergative conjugation with ''zijn'' and the fact that the participle ''geworden'' is usually omitted:

:Ik ben door hem geslagen &lt;s&gt;(geworden)&lt;/s&gt;
:Ik '''ben''' door hem geslagen
:I '''have been''' beaten by him.

Thus, in such cases ''ik ben'' '''does not''' translate into ''I am'', but into ''I have been''!.

Notice that this imparts to the verb ''zijn'' and its forms (ben, bent, is, was, waren etc.) three rather different roles:

#copula (the verbal equal sign =)
#active perfect auxiliary for ergative verbs, i.e.  those of ''motion'' or those describing a ''process'' instead of an action.
#passive perfect auxiliary for transitive verbs.

Compare:

:Ik '''ben''' piloot. (copula)
:Ik '''ben''' naar huis gelopen (ergative perfect of directed motion)
:Dit ongeluk '''is''' gisteren gebeurd (ergative perfect of a process)
:Ik '''ben''' door hem geslagen (passive perfect)

The latter sentense is a transipostion of:

:Hij '''heeft''' mij geslagen  (active perfect)

Notice that the agent of the action (&quot;hij&quot;) reappears as a prepositional object with ''door'': &quot;door hem&quot; in the passive. The ergative perfects do not have such an agent. They also generally take &quot;to have&quot; in English.

===Usage===
Particularly in the imperfect tenses, the passive voice is quite common in Dutch,  probably more so than in English because  the auxiliary ''worden'' makes it easily recognizable. It often occurs without a clear subject in conjunction with the adverb ''er'' ([[../Lesson 8|8]]) to describe circumstance.

:Er wordt veel van je verwacht.   (''veel'' is subject)
::Much is expected from you. 
:Er wordt van je verwacht dat je meedoet (''dat je meedoet'' is subject)
::It is expected of you that you partake. 
:Er wordt vaak om gelachen  (no subject)
::It is often laughed at.
:Er is veel om die grap gelachen
::That joke has been much laughed at.

The active version of such expressions requires the use of the indefinite personal pronoun ''men'' that translates into ''one'' or an impersonal ''they'' (analogous to the French ''on'' or the Spanish ''se'').

:men verwacht dat je meedoet
::lit. one expects that you participate – they expect you to participate
:men lacht erom / ze lachen erom
::they laugh at it

===Definite versus indefinite objects===

When transposing a sentence from an active to a passive voice it matters whether the object of the active sentence is indefinite or definite. Compare:

:Deze bakker bakt dat lekkere brood  --&gt; Dat lekkere brood wordt door deze bakker gebakken
:Deze bakker bakt een brood  --&gt; '''Er''' wordt een brood gebakken door deze bakker
:Deze bakker bakt brood  --&gt; '''Er''' wordt brood gebakken door deze bakker.

In other words: in passive sentences with an indefinite subject like 'een brood' or 'brood' the presence of the adverb '''er''' is required.

===Indirect objects and ditransitive verbs===
The transition to the passive construction normally involves the '''direct''' object. However for some verbs it is also possible to make the '''indirect''' object the new subject. Such verbs are usually called '''ditransitive'''.

In English the same auxiliary &quot;be&quot; or &quot;have been&quot; is used to construct the new sentence. In Dutch that is '''not''' the case: a different auxiliary is used '''krijgen''' instead of ''worden''. Such a construction is usually called a ''pseudopassive'' construction. Compare the following sentence where &quot;him&quot; is the indirect and &quot;house&quot; the direct object:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!construction!!English!!Dutch
|-
|active||I give/donate a house to him||Ik schenk hem een huis.
|-
|passive||A house '''is''' given to him by me||Een huis '''wordt''' ''door'' mij aan hem geschonken.
|-
|pseudopassive||He '''is''' given a house by me||Hij '''krijgt''' ''van'' mij een huis geschonken.
|-
!construction!!English!!Dutch
|-
|active perfect||I '''have''' given him a house||Ik '''heb''' hem een huis geschonken.
|-
|passive perfect||A house '''has been''' given to him by me||Een huis '''is''' door mij aan hem geschonken.
|-
|pseudopassive perfect||He '''has been''' given a house by me||Hij '''heeft''' van mij een huis geschonken '''gekregen'''.
|}

The pseudopassive construction with ''krijgen'' is relatively rare in Dutch. Notice that the agent usually gets ''van'' rather than ''door'' in the pseudopassive.

==Ergatives (+''zijn'') and inergatives (+''hebben'')==

A verb that carries a direct object is called a ''transitive'' verb. In Dutch these verbs can usually form passive voice constructions, much like in English:

:De politieman ziet een inbreker ==&gt; De inbreker wordt door de politieman gezien.
:The cop sees a burglar ==&gt; The burglar is seen by the cop.

Verbs that do not have a direct object are often called ''intransitive'' in English, but there are really two kinds in Dutch.

===Ergative verbs===
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
!colspan=&quot;4&quot;|Vocabulary
|-
|{{knop|gaan}} gaan||{{knop|ging}} ging||{{knop|gegaan}} gegaan||to go
|-
|{{knop|komen}} komen||{{knop|kwam}} kwam||{{knop|gekomen}} gekomen||to come
|-
|{{knop|smelten}} smelten||{{knop|smolt}} smolt||{{knop|gesmolten}} gesmolten||to melt
|-
|{{knop|gebeuren}} gebeuren||{{knop|gebeurde}} gebeurde||{{knop|gebeurd}} gebeurd||to happen
|-
|{{knop|ontploffen}} ontploffen||{{knop|ontplofte}} ontplofte||{{knop|ontploft}} ontploft||to explode
|}
There are the '''ergative''' verbs like ''gaan'', ''komen'', ''smelten'', ''gebeuren'', ''ontploffen'' and quite a few others. They take ''zijn'' as their auxiliary in the perfect and they have no passive voice at all.

:Ik '''ben''' gisteren gekomen - I have come yesterday.
:Dit '''is''' gisteren gebeurd - This has happened yesterday

Actually Shakespeare would have used '''is''' in English as well and fans of the books of J.R.R. Martin may still run into phrases like &quot;it '''is''' come to this&quot; etc. When Nancy Pelosi announced the passing of the Affordable Care Act she said &quot;The bill '''is''' passed&quot;. In other words, English ''used to'' have the same and there are some faint echoes left.

Ergative verbs describe '''processes''' rather than actions.

===Inergative verbs===
A different group is called '''inergative''' (or 'unaccusative'). These verbs do take ''hebben'' in the active perfect, as English does. Take smoking:

:Hij rookt. - He smokes.
:Hij '''heeft''' vele jaren gerookt - He '''has''' smoked for many years.

These sentences -indicating that someone is a smoker- do not have a direct object. However, the verb does express an '''action''' much like in the case of most transitive verbs.

===Impersonal passive voice: another use of &quot;er&quot;===
In contrast to English intransitive verbs, Dutch inergatives such as &quot;roken&quot; ''can'' undergo the transition to a passive of sorts, but it is an ''impersonal passive'' usually initiated with ''er''.

:Hij rookt -&gt; Er wordt door hem gerookt.

Unfortunately, there is not really much of an English equivalent for this. Something like &quot;smoking is done by him&quot; is a clumsy rendering of the meaning of the impersonal passive sentence. In Dutch however such constructions are very common. Actually, the most common usage is to leave the actor out altogether:

:Er wordt hier gerookt -- People smoke here. (&quot;smoking is being done here&quot;)
:Er wordt gebeld! -- Someone is calling.  (&quot;ringing is happening&quot;)

Neither sentence possesses a subject in Dutch. Some grammarians might call &quot;er&quot; a dummy subject, but most maintain that it is simply an adverb.  A real direct translation does not really exist. English typically resorts to an active sentence using ''someone'' or uses an entirely different construction like:

:I hear the bell.

In Dutch, such impersonal passives are a very common way to indicate that it is not clear who the actor is or that the focus is not on the actor, but on the action. Impersonal passives emphasize that something is being done by parties unknown.

Impersonal passives are not limited to inergative verbs. Transitive verbs also form them:

:Er werd door de politieagent een inbreker gezien. - (&quot;There was sighted a burglar by the cop&quot;)

In this case ''een inbreker'' is the subject, but there still is an element of generality: the identity of the burglar is not known. Notice that this sentence has the indefinite article ''een'' rather than definite ''de'' in the sentence above. A sentence like:

:&lt;s&gt;Er werd door de politieagent '''de''' inbreker gezien&lt;/s&gt;.

is not possible, because the impersonal passive expresses the idea that the identity of the burglar is either not known or not of interest. English would often use a word like ''some'' to emphasize the indefinite nature.

:Some burglar was seen by the cop.

In the definite case Dutch would use a personal passive:

:'''De''' inbreker werd door de politieagent gezien. - '''The''' burglar was seen by the cop.

===When is a verb ergative?===

Ergative verbs do '''not''' form passives at all, not even impersonal ones.

As we saw above ergatives take ''zijn'' (to be) in their perfect tense, where English takes ''to have'':

:ik ''ben'' gekomen - I ''have'' come.
:het ''is'' gebeurd - it ''has'' happened.

The use of ''zijn''  presents a problem for native English speakers. (Germans have no problem, their language has a very similar situation.) 

How do you know what to use? There are two main groups of verbs that are ergative:
#One is the verbs that express '''motion''' like coming, going, driving, floating etc. 
#The other is verbs that express a '''process''' or event that happens autonomously (not: a deliberate action), without a clear party who is to blame for it like happening, melting, flowing, solidifying, sinking. 

Obviously the examples floating and sinking show that the two groups overlap.

===Verbs describing processes===
Such verbs often ''only'' occur as ergatives:

::Stollen - to solidify

:''ergative present'':  Het vet stolt- The grease solidifies.
:''ergative perfect'':  Het vet '''is''' gestold - The grease '''has''' solidified.

Because this verb involves a '''process''', not an action, Dutch uses &quot;to be&quot; to form the perfect, not &quot;to have&quot; as English does.

Sometimes however &quot;process&quot; verbs occur both in an ergative and in an active transitive form. 

::Smelten - to melt

:''active'': Ik smelt '''het ijs''' - I melt '''the ice'''
:''ergative'': '''Het ijs''' smelt  - '''The ice''' melts

Notice that in this case English has the same active - ergative switch. The subject of the latter (ijs/ice) is the object of the former. Ergativity itself is not the problem: English has that too. The problem only arises when putting the verb in the perfect, because Dutch opts for a different auxiliary:

:''active'': Ik '''heb''' het ijs gesmolten - I '''have''' melted the ice
:''ergative'': Het ijs '''is''' gesmolten  - The ice '''has''' melted

Notice that the active can also be switched into a passive using &quot;worden&quot;

:''passive'': Het ijs '''wordt''' door mij gesmolten
:''passive perfect'': Het ijs '''is''' door mij gesmolten &lt;s&gt;geworden&lt;/s&gt;

As &quot;geworden&quot; is typically omitted in Dutch (in contrast to German &quot;worden&quot;) the perfects of the ergative and the passive are very similar. The difference is the presence of an agent (&quot;door mij&quot;).

Ergatives sometimes do have an expression that denotes the ''cause'' of the process (rather than ''agent''). Such an expression often uses the preposition ''van'', although ''door'' can also be used:

:De chocola is ''van'' de hitte van de zon gesmolten. - The chocolate has melted from the heat of the sun.

===Verbs of motion===
Verbs of motion are often more complicated, because can be used both as ergatives and as inergatives. 

::Lopen - to walk

:''ergative'': Ik '''ben''' naar huis gelopen. - I walked home
:''inergative'': Ik '''heb''' vandaag veel gelopen - I have walked a lot today

:In general one can say that if the sentence focuses on a '''''process''' of directional movement'' (e.g. &quot;home&quot;) the verb of motion is ergative and takes ''zijn''. 
:If the focus is on the '''''action''''' (exercising in the park or so) the verb is inergative and takes ''hebben''.

Of course, walking is both and an action and a process of transportation, but in a sense Dutch views &quot;walking home&quot; as a process (that 'just happens'), but &quot;walking a lot&quot; as an action (that the agent chooses to 'do').

The ergative version does not possess a passive, but the inergative version can have an impersonal passive, usually with &quot;er&quot;:

:''impersonal passive'': Er '''wordt''' hier veel gelopen. - there is lot of walking here

Besides the ergative and inergative version there can also be a transitive variant as well for some verbs, in which case a personal passive can at times be formed:

::Rijden - to drive has all three varieties:

:''ergative'': Ik '''ben''' naar huis gereden - I drove home
:''inergative'': Ik '''heb''' vandaag veel gereden - I have done a lot of driving today
:''transitive active'': Ik '''heb''' hem naar huis '''gereden''' - I took him home in my car
:''transitive passive'': Hij '''is''' door mij naar huis '''gereden''' - He was taken home by me (in my car)

===Ergatives and &quot;er&quot;===

Ergative verbs can also be combined with &quot;er&quot; to convey an indefinite connotation:

:Een trein ontspoorde in Rotterdam - A train derailed in Rotterdam.
:Er is in Rotterdam een trein ontspoord. - There was a derailment in Rotterdam.

==Synopsis==
The use of the auxiliaries &quot;hebben&quot;, &quot;worden&quot; and &quot;zijn&quot; can be summarized in the following table. 

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|auxiliary !!transitive!!inergative!!ergative
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|type !!action!!action!!process/motion
|-

|-
|impersonal||worden||worden
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|passive perfect||personal||zijn||-||rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|-
|-
|impersonal||zijn||zijn
|}

Notice that inergatives actually have more in common with transitives than with ergatives, even though in traditional grammars ergatives and inergatives are typically lumped together as 'intransitive verbs'.  This obscures the fact that both transitive and inergative verbs are verbs of '''''action''''', whereas ergatives are verbs of '''''process''''' or '''''motion'''''.

Notice also that all three groups ''can'' take the auxiliary &quot;zijn&quot;. For ergatives it is mandatory.

A few small groups of verbs do exist in Dutch that cannot take &quot;zijn&quot;, but only take &quot;hebben&quot;. 
#reflexive verbs (using &quot;zich&quot;)
#impersonal verbs 
#a few verbs that lack all passive forms either carrying a direct object or not

}}

There are many ways to address people in Japanese. The choice of words will depend on the ''social status'', ''age'', and ''sex'' of both ''speaker and listener'', as well as the ''level of familiarity'' and ''respect''. As with all features of language, these aren't completely consistent and evolve over time so.

It's worth mentioning that personal pronouns are used much less than in English. Addressing others with the second person pronoun (you, あなた) is uncommon and may seem odd, even rude. Usually, the person is identified by the context but otherwise one may indicate the person by addressing people with their names with an appropriate suffix (such as &quot;〜さん&quot; or &quot;〜くん&quot;, see below). Note also that female speech is generally more polite than male speech.

The most popular personal pronouns are given in the following table. Each row is combined of the pronouns of similar level of politeness. The rows are written starting with the most polite to the least.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! 1st person
! 2nd person
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | 3rd person
! question
|-
| わたくし
| あなたさま
| このかた || そのかた || あのかた
| どのかた
|-
| わたし
| あなた
| このひと || そのひと || あのひと
| どなた
|-
| ぼく
| きみ
| かれ
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | かのじょ
| だれ
|-
| おれ
| おまえ
| こいつ || そいつ || あいつ
| どいつ
|}

== Widely used personal pronouns ==

Listed from the most polite to the least.

=== First person pronouns ===
* わたくし（私） - the most polite modern 1st person pronoun.
* われ（我） - quite humble and polite but old-fashioned (plural &quot;われわれ&quot; is used as humble way to talk about one's organization).
* わたし（私） - contraction of わたくし, a universal word that may be used in any situation. Most language courses advise to use only this pronoun.
* あたし - further contraction of わたし, used ONLY by women to sound cute/innocent.
* ぼく（僕） - mostly used by men (sometimes by women who want to sound tough), especially by boys and young males. This is the commonly polite word to use at semi-formal events and general conversations by young men. ぼく is also used as a poetic &quot;I&quot;.
* じぶん（自分） - neutral pronoun that means &quot;self&quot; (not only &quot;myself&quot;, this also can be used as a 2nd and 3rd person pronoun), used by military people and officials to indicate that they are part of a huge organization. May also mean &quot;a person&quot;.
* おれ（俺） - informal. Used with a very casual group and/or to sound masculine.
* うち（家）- feminine and not polite
* あたい - another contraction of わたくし, quite informal
* せっしゃ（拙者）- literally means &quot;clumsy person,&quot; used by samurai
* わがはい（我輩）- a personal pronoun popularized by Natsume Souseki's &quot;Wagahai Ha Neko de Aru&quot;

=== Second person pronouns ===
* あなたさま（あなた様） - the most polite modern 2nd person pronoun. Used when the politeness level demands using person's name, but you do not know it (still you must apologize for using this and ask for the name)
* あなた - a usual and polite word for addressing strangers. This is actually a kosoado pronoun. Better avoid this word in cases other than addressing strangers, or at all. 
* あんた - informal version of &quot;あなた&quot;. Used mostly by women to address inferiors.
* きみ（君） - informal &quot;You&quot; used mostly by men, although starting to gain popularity among women. A person that uses &quot;きみ&quot;, most likely uses &quot;ぼく&quot; as a 1st person pronoun. きみ is also used as a poetic &quot;You&quot;.
* おまえ（お前） - quite rude and vulgar, sometimes used by older people. Literally means &quot;front&quot; (&quot;you, in front of me&quot;). A person that uses &quot;おまえ&quot;, most likely uses &quot;おれ&quot; as a 1st person pronoun.

=== Third person pronouns ===

* あのかた（あの方） - the most polite way of telling &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;.
* あのひと（あの人） - quite polite.
* かれ（彼） - neutral and usual &quot;He&quot;. Note: use with caution as this may also mean &quot;boyfriend&quot;.
* かのじょ（彼女） - neutral and usual &quot;She&quot;. Note: use with caution as this may also mean &quot;girlfriend&quot;.
* やつ（奴） - rude, implies hatred.

== Plural ==

In case of &quot;われ&quot;, plural may be formed by doubling the pronoun, but most commonly plural is formed with suffixes, which by themselves also have a level of politeness. Consequently, the level of politeness of both pronoun and suffix must match (although there are usually two different suffixes may be applied in any particular case, so you may slightly vary the politeness level of the resulting pronoun). Here are the common suffixes from the most polite to the less polite:

* ~とも (for example, わたくしども; note that it is rather common for words in Japanese to change accent when used as affix, like in this example &quot;と&quot; is pronounced (and written) as &quot;ど&quot;)
* ~かた (for example, あなたがた; the previous note applies here too)
* ~たち - quite polite and most commonly used plural maker (for example, わたしたち)
* ~ら (for example, ぼくら)

== Additional personal pronouns ==

These are less common ones that one won't hear in common use but are included for those interested.

=== First person pronouns ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| せっしゃ || humble and polite, used by samurai (rarely used as considered archaic).
|-
| わし || mostly used by older people (perhaps, to indicate that they have grown old and wise).
|-
| わ(が) || literary word derived from &quot;わたくし&quot;. Used in the meaning of &quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; (example: わがくに- my country).
|-
| ちん || &quot;I&quot; or &quot;We&quot; used by kings.
|-
| おのれ || humble, used by men (rarely used as considered archaic). Also means &quot;you&quot;, but sounds arrogant and impolite when used that way.
|-
| うち || used mostly by women, or when referring to &quot;us&quot; (family, company, etc.) or &quot;I&quot; that is a part of &quot;us&quot;.
|-
|ちん（朕）|| only used by the emperor
|}

=== Second person pronoun ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| てまえ, or&lt;br /&gt;てめえ || rude and aggressive. Implies that you are ready to beat up that person.
|-
| きさま || extremely rude and offensive. The most insulting way of saying &quot;You&quot; in Japanese. The actual kanji (貴様) meaning is &quot;a valued and esteemed person&quot;. If you deeply hate a person (you want to kill him/her), you may say this.
|-
| おぬし, or&lt;br /&gt;おのし || humble and polite way to address people of equal or lower social status, although rather archaic (used by samurai).
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will cover how to map tiles to the SNES background.

In order to render background, program has to set few things for each background, remember to set this for every background you want to render:
* BG Mode (affects number of planes, bitdepth), set in register 0x2105
* Size of tile (8x8 or 16x16), set in register 0x2105
* Set background map
* Set background tileset

== Tile Map ==
The map is a 2 dimensional array (32x32, 64x32, 32x64 or 64x64) of tile indexes. The SNES goes through the array and for each index in the map renders a tile specified in the array. Since tiles can be either 8x8 or 16x16 pixels, we can end up with background image dimensions ranging from 256 to 1024 pixels (size_of_map * size_of_tile). 

A member of an array is a two bytes long structure(two bytes long = 16 bits):

High byte Low byte

vhopppcc  cccccccc               

* c is the index of a tile in the tileset (tileset is specified per BG), SNES will get the address of a tile as (base_tileset_bits &lt;&lt; 13) + (8 * color_depth * tile_number)
* h: horizontal flip  
* v: vertical flip
* p: palette number   
* o: priority bit

Use registers $2107-$210A to set map for your background. 

Structure of registers $2107-$210A 

aaaaaass

a: address of the map in VRAM. Multiply the number by 2048 (or shift 11 bits) in order to get the byte location of the map.

s: size of the map
 * 00=32x32 
 * 01=64x32
 * 10=32x64 
 * 11=64x64


If the map has a dimension greater than 32 (e.g. 64x32), array doesn't have 64 tile indexes per row, instead it will store two 32x32 maps right after each other in VRAM. The first map (32x32 tiles = 2*32*32 bytes) will represent the left part of the map and the second one (same size as the first one) will represent the right side of the map.

== Tileset == 
Tile is a small 8x8 or 16x16 image that is used to construct larger images. 

{{TODO|In the meantime, read From: [http://web.archive.org/web/20071111200111/http://www.geocities.com/Qwertie256/attic/snesemu/qsnesdoc.html http://www.geocities.com/Qwertie256/attic/snesemu/qsnesdoc.html] }}

==Technical info==
To employ the SNES's PPU, one must understand exactly how it processes graphic data.
===Bit Depths===
*Mode 0: 4 colors, 2 bit per pixel(bpp)
*Mode 1: 8 colors, 3 bpp (you may see this in some tile editors but the SNES doesn't display 3bpp graphics. They have to be expanded to the 4bpp format before being used.)
*Mode 2: 16 colors, 4 bpp
*Mode 3: 128/256 colors, 8bpp (only in Mode 7)

===Tile format===
The SNES uses an odd interleaved format for its tile data.
Consider this &quot;x&quot; pattern with the palette [[File:SNEStilepalette.png]]

The tile data itself will consist of these bytes:
 .db $00, $81, $81, $42, $C3, $24, $E7, $18, $E7, $18, $C3, $24, $81, $42, $00, $81
&quot;How exactly does this correspond to that tile?&quot; I hear you wonder.

Each row of pixels is represented by two bytes.
Take the first row ($00, $81).  It consists of the colors 2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.  In binary form:
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 

Each of the bits in byte 0 are equivalent to '''bit''' 0 in it's corresponding pixel.
Take the next row ($81, $42):
 12000021        colors,
 10000001	$81, 
 01000010	$42,
You may hear people refer to '''bitplanes'''.  Those mean sets of bytes corresponding to bit '''?''''s of all the pixels, where ? is from 0 to the number of bits per pixel minus 1.  Thus, in this case, bitplane 0 would refer to the odd bytes in the tile data($00,$81,$C3,etc.).

Does this make sense?  I'm not so sure myself..

* [http://mrclick.zophar.net/TilEd/download/consolegfx.txt common console graphic formats]

===Palette format===
Colors for the SNES are 15 bits each, and stored in bgr format.
 ?bbbbbgg gggrrrrr

The color full green &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #0F0; color: #0F0&quot; title=&quot;This is full green&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/span&gt; would be stored as:

 %00000011, %11100000

In HEX:

 $03, $E0

Palettes are simply arrays of colors.  The palette shown above would be stored in the ROM as (one color being &quot;$xx, $xx&quot;):

 .db $EE, $00, $10, $02, $4A, $01, $00, $00

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Welcome!
*Wikibooks textbooks, including this Radiation Oncology textbook, are open source works
*Anyone is welcomed and encouraged to contribute anytime and anything related to Radiation Oncology :)
*We appreciate both small contributions (correcting typos etc.) as well as larger content contributions
*Feel free to add yourself to the [[Radiation_Oncology/Authors|Author List]]; the more the merrier :)

==General==
This list of standards is meant to provide a uniform look and conformity for this book but is not meant to be inflexible or immutable.  Please feel free to make suggestions on the talk page about how you think this book could be improved.  This is a work in progress.

*'''Do not plagiarize!!!''' This includes cutting and pasting an abstract.  Abstracts are copyrighted material.

*Keep it simple and easy to read.  The fewer details the better.

*Subpages shall use the &quot;/&quot; directory-style hierarchy, e.g. '''Radiation Oncology/Prostate'''.
*:Note: the book started off using &quot;:&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot; and most pages haven't been changed to this format as of yet.
*:All new pages should be made to use the &quot;/&quot; format.

*Cite your sources!
**Use the automatic PMID link to link to articles references in PubMed.  Just type the PubMed ID (PMID) like this '''&lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 11697327&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and it will be formatted like this: PMID 11697327.  This is recommended because it makes the source code much easier to read than if external links to pubmed were used.  
**In addition to PubMed (www.pubmed.org), another very helpful search tool is [http://scholar.google.com/ Google Scholar]. In particular, it shows (somewhat comprehensively?) other future papers that have cited the &quot;Googled&quot; paper.

*You are highly encouraged to create your own user account and log in before making any edits.  See [[WB:LOGIN|how to login]] for information.

*At the top of each page in the book, attach the template for the Table of Contents header -- type &lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Radiation Oncology:TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  This allows for easy jumping back to the main page and other important pages (such as RTOG studies).
**Certain complex topics that are divided into several pages may have their own sub-Table of Contents for  -- e.g. see the subpages of [[Radiation Oncology/Breast]] and [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate]].

*It is great to link to the full text version / PDF of an article, but try to do this only if there is free access for everyone and it doesn't require an institutional subscription. 

*Ordering of articles within a section: it makes logical sense for the studies to be ordered chronologically (earliest studies listed first), since in general, the results of one study influence the results of subsequent studies.  
**An exception is the page listing all RTOG studies, which is in descending order.  The reason for that is that it's just more convenient to have the newer studies listed at the top so you don't have to scroll all the way to the bottom to get to the current studies.

*P-values: don't say p&lt;0.000000001.  Just say &quot;S.S.&quot; or &quot;SS&quot; for statistically significant.  If it's not statistically significant, say &quot;N.S.&quot;  An exception is if there's a trend toward significance, then you can put the p value.  On a similar note, there's no need for confidence intervals.


==Editing==
*Here is a link to [[Help:Editing]]
*To start, click the ''edit this page'' button on top of the page
*When done with changes, click the ''Save Page'' button underneath
*In general, there are only a few symbols that are used


==Page entry==
Try to give the pages a consistent look.  If in doubt, look at other pages within the wiki.

As a guide, use the following example:
*'''Name of study''', Date (Date range of study) - PMID 12345 &amp;mdash; &quot;Title of publication.&quot; Author's name. Publication citation.

e.g.
*'''INT 0123 / RTOG 94-05''', 2002 (1995-99) - PMID 11870157 &amp;mdash; &quot;INT 0123 (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 94-05) phase III trial of combined-modality therapy for esophageal cancer: high-dose versus standard-dose radiation therapy.&quot; Minsky BD et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Mar 1;20(5):1167-74.

For a study that has several publications stemming from it:
*'''Name of study''' (date range)
**10-year update (2000): PMID 12345 &amp;mdash; &quot;Title of publication.&quot; Author's name. Publication citation.
***Results
**5-year results (1995): PMID 123456 &amp;mdash; &quot;Title of publication.&quot; Author's name. Publication citation.
***Results
**Original publication (1993): PMID 1234567 &amp;mdash; &quot;Title of publication.&quot; Author's name. Publication citation.
***Results
**Etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition of least squares==

The comparison method called '''Least squares''' is based on the fact that differences can be positive or negative, but that the square of a real negative number is always positive. Therefore, if there are several differences, the sum of all the squares of these differences is an indication of how close items are, and the best &quot;fit&quot; is the one with the least sum of the squares of the differences, with this method of comparison being called '''Least squares'''.

== Least Squares Estimation ==

For example an experiment resulted in values 2,5,4 at times 0, 1, 2. Let x be the time, and y be the actual results obtained. First we will compare the y with the values, at the times x, of a straight line; call these values y1 given by y1=2+x, being 2,3 and 4

   &lt;U&gt;x   y | y1   y2   y3&lt;/u&gt;
   0   2 |  2   2.7   2
   1   5 |  3   3.7   5
   2   4 |  4   4.7   4

At time x=0 the difference d=y-y1=0, its square d2=0, and the sum of the d2 so far is 0
At time x=1 the difference d=y-y1=2, its square d2=4, and the sum of the d2 so far is 4
At time x=2 the difference  d=y-y1=0, its square is 0, and the sum of all the d2 is 4.

Trying another straight line, y2=2.7+x gives differences 2-2.7=-0.7, squared 0.49; next is 5-3.7=1.3, squared 1.69, and 4-4.7=-0.7, squared 0.49. The total of the squares is 0.49+1.69+0.49=2.67, being less than 4 it is the '''least squares''' so far.

Now let us try a quadratic equation, y3=2+5x-2x(squared), with its values shown above. The sum of the squares of the differences here is 0, being the least of the squares, and therefore the best fit.

==Ordinary Least Squares==

==Generalized Least Squares==

==Non-Linear Least Squares==

==Asymptotic Convergence==
===Modes of Convergence===
====Convergence in Probability====
Convergence in probability is going to be a very useful tool for deriving asymptotic distributions later on in this book. Alongside convergence in distribution it will be the most commonly seen mode of convergence.

=====Definition=====
A sequence of random variables &lt;math&gt;\{ X_n ; n=1,2, \cdots \} &lt;/math&gt; converges in probability to &lt;math&gt;X_{ }&lt;/math&gt; if:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon, \delta &gt;0, &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \exists N \; \operatorname{s.t.} \; \forall n \geq N, &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \Pr \{ |X_n - X| &gt; \delta \}&lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
|}

an equivalent statement is:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\forall \delta &gt;0, &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr \{ |X_n - X| &gt; \delta \}=0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This will be written as either &lt;math&gt;X_n \begin{matrix} \begin{matrix} { }_p \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} \end{matrix} X&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{plim} X_n = X&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Example=====
 
&lt;math&gt;X_n = \begin{cases} \eta &amp; 1- \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix} \\ \theta &amp; \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 

We'll make an intelligent guess that this series converges in probability to the degenerate random variable &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. So we have that:

&lt;math&gt;\forall \delta &gt;0,\; \Pr \{ |X_n - \eta| &gt; \delta \} \leq \Pr \{ |X_n - \eta| &gt; 0 \}= \Pr \{ X_n= \theta \}= \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore our definition for convergence in probability in this case is:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon , \delta &gt;0, &lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\exists N \quad \operatorname{s.t.} \forall n \geq N, &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Pr \{ |X_n - \eta | &gt; \delta \} \leq \Pr \{ |X_n - \eta | &gt; 0 \}=\Pr \{ X_n= \theta \}= \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix} &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
|}

So for any positive values of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; we can always find an &lt;math&gt;N \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; large enough so that our definition is satisfied. Therefore we have proved that &lt;math&gt;X_n \begin{matrix} { }_p \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} \eta&lt;/math&gt;.

====Convergence Almost Sure====
Almost-sure convergence has a marked similarity to convergence in probability, however the conditions for this mode of convergence are stronger; as we will see later, convergence almost surely actually implies that the sequence also converges in probability.   
=====Definition=====   
A sequence of random variables &lt;math&gt;\{ X_n ; n=1,2, \cdots \} &lt;/math&gt; converges almost surely to the random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if:       
{|   
|-   
|&lt;math&gt;\forall \delta &gt;0, &lt;/math&gt;   
|-   
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr \{ \bigcup_{m \geq n} |X_m - X| &gt; \delta, \}=0&lt;/math&gt;   
|}   
    
equivalently   
   
{|   
|-   
|&lt;math&gt;\Pr \{ \lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = X \}=1&lt;/math&gt;   
|}   
   
Under these conditions we use the notation &lt;math&gt;X_n \begin{matrix} \begin{matrix} { }_{a.s.} \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} \end{matrix} X&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = X \operatorname{a.s.}&lt;/math&gt;.   
   
=====Example=====   
{{disputed}}
Let's see if our example from the convergence in probability section also converges almost surely. Defining:   
    
&lt;math&gt;X_n = \begin{cases} \eta &amp; 1- \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix} \\ \theta &amp; \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;   
    
we again guess that the convergence is to &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. Inspecting the resulting expression we see that:   
   
{|   
|-   
|&lt;math&gt;\Pr \{ \lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = \eta \}=1- \Pr \{ \lim_{n \to \infty} X_n \ne \eta \}=1- \Pr \{ \lim_{n \to \infty} X_n= \theta \} \geq 1-\lim_{n \to \infty}\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{n} \end{matrix}=1&lt;/math&gt;   
|}   
    
Thereby satisfying our definition of almost-sure convergence.

====Convergence in Distribution====
Convergence in distribution will appear very frequently in our econometric models through the use of the Central Limit Theorem. So let's define this type of convergence.
=====Definition=====
A sequence of random variables &lt;math&gt;\{ X_n ; n=1,2, \cdots \} &lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converges in distribution to the random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;F_{X_n}(\zeta ) \rightarrow F_{X}(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt; for all continuity points. &lt;math&gt;F_{X_n}(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{X_{}}(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt; are the cumulative density functions of &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

It is the distribution of the random variable that we are concerned with here. Think of a students-T distribution: as the degrees of freedom, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, increases our distribution becomes closer and closer to that of a gaussian distribution. Therefore the random variable &lt;math&gt;Y_n \sim t(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges in distribution to the random variable &lt;math&gt;Y \sim N(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; (n.b. we say that the random variable &lt;math&gt;Y_n  \begin{matrix} { }_{d} \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} Y&lt;/math&gt; as a notational crutch, what we really should use is &lt;math&gt;f_{Y_n} (\zeta )\begin{matrix} { }_{d} \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} f_Y(\zeta )&lt;/math&gt;/

=====Example=====
Let's consider the distribution ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose sample space consists of two points, 1/''n'' and 1, with equal probability (1/2). Let ''X'' be the binomial distribution with ''p = 1/2''. Then ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges in distribution to ''X''.

The proof is simple: we ignore 0 and 1 (where the distribution of ''X'' is discontinuous) and prove that, for all other points ''a'', &lt;math&gt;\lim F_{X_n}(a) = F_X(a)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Since for ''a &lt; 0'' all ''Fs'' are 0, and for ''a &gt; 1'' all ''Fs'' are 1, it remains to prove the convergence for ''0 &lt; a &lt; 1''. But &lt;math&gt;F_{X_n}(a) = \frac{1}{2} ([a \ge \frac{1}{n}] + [a \ge 1])&lt;/math&gt; (using Iverson brackets), so for any ''a'' chose ''N &gt; 1/a'', and for ''n &gt; N'' we have:
: &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1/a \rightarrow a &gt; 1/n \rightarrow [a \ge \frac{1}{n}] = 1 \land [a \ge 1] = 0 \rightarrow F_{X_n}(a) = \frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

So the sequence &lt;math&gt;F_{X_n}(a)\,&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;F_X(a)\,&lt;/math&gt; for all points where ''F&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is continuous.

====Convergence in R-mean Square====
Convergence in R-mean square is not going to be used in this book, however for completeness the definition is provided below.
=====Definition=====
A sequence of random variables &lt;math&gt;\{ X_n ; n=1,2, \cdots \} &lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converges in r-th mean (or in the &lt;math&gt;L^r&lt;/math&gt; norm) to the random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if, for any real number &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and provided that &lt;math&gt;E(|X_n|^r) &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;  for all n and  &lt;math&gt;r\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n\to \infty }E\left( \left\vert X_n-X\right\vert ^r\right) =0.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Cramer-Wold Device====
The Cramer-Wold device will allow us to extend our convergence techniques for random variables from scalars to vectors. 
=====Definition=====
A random vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}_n \begin{matrix} { }_{d} \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} \mathbf{X} \; \iff \; {\mathbf{\lambda}}^{\operatorname{T}}\mathbf{X}_n \begin{matrix} { }_{d} \\ \longrightarrow \\{ } \end{matrix} {\mathbf{\lambda}}^{\operatorname{T}}\mathbf{X} \quad \forall \lVert \mathbf{\lambda} \rVert \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.

 
====Relationships Between Modes of Convergence====

===Law of Large Numbers===
===Central Limit Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;\ X_1, X_2, X_3, ... &lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of random variables which are defined on the same probability space, share the same probability distribution D and are independent. Assume that both the expected value μ and the standard deviation σ of D exist and are finite.

Consider the sum &lt;math&gt;\ S_n = X_1 + ... + X_n &lt;/math&gt;. Then the expected value of &lt;math&gt;\ S_n &lt;/math&gt; is nμ and its standard error is σ n1/2. Furthermore, informally speaking, the distribution of Sn approaches the normal distribution N(nμ,σ2n) as n approaches ∞.

===Continuous Mapping Theorem===
===Slutsky's Theorem===

I don't know how to use the AMS math packages to get the \xrightarrow{p} symbol for convergence in probability, as such the formatting is slightly off... Also, as is obvious, my formatting of the definition of Convergence in probability is rather clumsy.--[[User:Ajwilson|Alistair]] 12:23, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

== Is the example of almost-sure convergence correct? ==

&lt;table width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure that the example of almost-sure convergence is correct.  See, for example, Problem 3 on [http://web.mit.edu/6.041/www/QUIZ_REVIEW/final_6431_fall06.pdf this quiz] and the [http://web.mit.edu/6.041/www/QUIZ_REVIEW/final_6431_fall06_sol.pdf answer from the answer key].  (Both are PDF files.)  In the quiz, the sequence &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt; seems equivalent to the sequence provided in the example on this page.  But the answer-key argument is that this sequence does not almost-surely converge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument here is more straightforward than the one in the quiz, and it seems right to me.  But I am inexpert and would like to know what others think.  [[User:John G Bullock|John G Bullock]] 18:14, 3 July 2007 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The example is not right. See http://books.google.de/books?id=irKSXZ7kKFgC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false.

I’m hoping the following can give a little intuitive understanding of why the example is wrong, and it may help clarify the difference between convergences almost surely and convergence in probability.  I apologize if I’m not 100% technically correct.  

For fn(x) to converge to η almost surely, the probability that fn(x) = θ has to be zero for all fm(x) for m&gt;n.  In the example, the probability of f(x) = θ equals 1/n; therefore, for any n, the probability sequence of fm(x) = θ, for m &gt; n, starting with n, is 1/(n+1), 1/(n+2), 1/(n+3), etc.  We need the probability of the union of these events.  

The harmonic series, though, diverges.  No matter where you start, that is, for any n in mathematics lingo, the sum of the subsequent terms goes to infinity. I hope it is intuitive that if the sum of probabilities is infinite, the union of these probabilities is 1 – this logic can be seen up by referring to the Borel-Cantelli theorem.  So not only is the probability that fm(x) =  θ not equal to 0, it is equal to 1! 

For me, the easy way to remember the difference between convergence in probability and convergence almost surely, is that for convergence in probability, we simply need that the probability approaches the limit as n gets large.  But to get convergence almost surely, it has to equal the limit for an infinite number of trials beyond n! Almost sure convergence is similar to having the sequence of probabilites converge in a classical calculus convergence sense.
````
Can someone remove this example? It is plain wrong.
Why would P(\lim_{n\rightarrow} X_n \in A) &lt;=\lim_{n\rightarrow} P( X_n \in A) hold in general?
It does not. And &quot;proof&quot; uses this. Also, the definition of X_n here and earlier is incomplete, or, if you want syntactically wrong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charon''' is one of the three moons of Pluto.

==How big is Charon?==
Charon measures about 1,200 km across, about half the diameter of Pluto. Because the size difference between Pluto and Charon is so small, they are sometimes considered to be '''double planets'''. They are also sometimes thought of as the first two '''trans-Neptunian objects'''.

==What is its surface like?==
[[File:Pluto and charon.jpg|thumb|left|This picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows Pluto and Charon. The small moon on the right is Charon. We can't see it in detail because it is too far away.]]
The surface of Charon is covered in water ice.

==How long is a day on Charon?==
One day on Charon is equal to 6 days, 9 hours, and 18 minutes on Earth.

==How long is its orbit with Pluto?==
Charon and Pluto share an orbit around a point that is directly between them, this orbit takes roughly six and a half days

==Who is it named after?==
Charon is named after a figure in Greek mythology.  Charon ferried the dead across the river Acheron to Hades if they could pay him.

==How was it discovered?==
Charon was discovered by James Christy on June 22, 1978. He was examining highly magnified images of Pluto and noticed a small bulge sometimes appeared in the pictures. The bulge was later confirmed in older images and was given the temporary name of ''S/1978 P 1''.

What is econometric theory?
Since I don't know, I probably don't have much to contribute here, but I am in an economics class and I'm trying to find where what I am learning can go. So, for me and future confused editors-- what is econometric theory, and what in the field of study economics is decidedly not encompassed in econometric theory?

Completion of this book?
My aim is to finish this book by Christmas 2007. I will see how I get along. Nevertheless, I have written my own (extensive) addition to the contents page. I would like this book to be very much in-depth analysis, have some examples and use matrix algebra, since it is more thorough than using regular one-line notation

What are my aims:
1. Use as many links as possible to avoid duplication of data that can be found in other Wikibooks or Wikipedia articles.
2. Be thorough and cover everything in-depth
3. Use easy-going language to avoid too much bureaucratic-style language and avoid too lengthy passages.
4. I am not sure where to get pictures and graphs, but I am good with the mathematics. I would like some complementation from other &quot;Wikibookians&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word ''econometrics'' means &quot;economic measurement&quot;. The purpose of econometrics is to quantify and verify predictions from economic theory. It is a mixture of economic theory, mathematical economics, and statistics.

Apart from econometrics, there are two subjects closely related to econometrics. Firstly, mathematical economics is concerned with expressing economic theory in equations. It is algebra of the kind where variables can be subtracted, added, multiplied and divided in an equation. But it is not concerned with measurability or empirical verification. Secondly, we have economic statistics whose concern is to collect, process and present economic data. Many developed countries have government agencies whose job it is to collect and distribute economic data, such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes data on unemployment, inflation, productivity, etc.  The Bureau releases this information to the public and it is often used by other levels of government, social scientists, and interested laymen.  

Lastly, it is important for econometricians to distinguish between '''observational''' data and '''experimental''' data.  The use of observational data has three implications: firstly, the econometrician often uses data without knowledge of how the data were sampled; secondly, since the econometrician has no knowledge of how the data were generated, i.e. how people and companies behaved, there is uncertainty as to which economic or statistical model best represents these data; and thirdly, in order to obtain a suitable model that can be used for inference, econometrics is concerned with avoiding misspecification, or else the results of the model may be wrongly interpreted. &lt;ref&gt; This is the somewhat the view expressed by Judge et al. (1988, p. 5-6) and Gujarati (2003, p.5) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Preferences==
To access the Preferences window, navigate to ''Tools'' &amp;rarr; ''Options'' on Windows, ''Edit'' &amp;rarr; ''Preferences'' on Linux, or ''Firefox'' &amp;rarr; ''Preferences'' on OS X.
===General===
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_General.png|right|thumb|200px|The General tab]]
The General Tab of the Preferences window allows you to change a few things:
*Home Page
*Default Browser
*How Firefox connects to the Internet

The Home Page setting will most likely be the most used from this window, as the other two only need to be set once (if at all). There are four ways to set a home page from this window:
*Type an address into the ''Location(s):'' box (e.g., http://www.google.com)
*Select the ''Use Current Page(s)'' button, which will set the current page as the home page if only one is showing, or set all tabs as [[Using Firefox/Browsing with Tabs#Multiple_home_pages | multiple home pages]]
*Select the ''Use Bookmark...'' button to open a dialog that will allow you to select a site currently bookmarked as the home page
*Select ''Use Blank Page'' to have ''about:blank'' set as the home page.

The first time Firefox is launched, it will check if it is set as the default browser. The option ''Firefox should check to see if it is the default browser when starting'', when checked, will make sure that Firefox remains the default browser (or, if Firefox is ''not'' the default browser, it will ask you each time if you'd like it to be). Also, pressing ''Check now'' will do the check after the browser has already been started.

The Connection Settings button only needs to be used if you use a proxy to connect to the Internet. If so, you can have Firefox auto-detect the settings, manually enter them, or use an automatic proxy configuration URL.
{{subject|Using_Firefox/Preferences}}

===Privacy===
The Privacy tab is described as follows: ''As you browse the web, Firefox keeps information about where you have been, what you have done etc. in the following areas:'' Each area has its own settings. As you select tabs inside the Privacy Tab, the main content area will change. However, there is one setting at the bottom of the window that is accessible from each tab. It says ''The Clear Private Data tool can be used to erase your private data using a keyboard shortcut or when Firefox closes.'' along with a ''Settings...'' button. Selecting that button will bring up a list of information that Firefox stores. Each can be set or unset individually. In addition to selecting which data you'd like cleared, there is an option to ''Clear private data when closing Firefox'' and another to ''Ask me before clearing private data''. All private data that you have selected can be cleared at any time during a browsing session by hitting [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Del].

Clearing private data is a public act that may, if your purpose was to keep some activity secret, expose that very secret.  For a significant historical example see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project#Beginnings_of_the_program.  Further, if &quot;Clear Private Data&quot; does not overwrite that data (and the prior paragraph does not so state) then that data may remain on your computer for some time and can possibly be accessed.


====History====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-history.png|right|thumb|200px|The Privacy Tab with History selected]]
The History tab has only two items:
*Remember visited pages for the last __ day(s).
*A button to ''Clear Browsing History Now''

These options are pretty self explanatory. Set the number of days you'd like Firefox to remember pages you have visited. Setting the value to '''0''' will cause Firefox to not use History. Pressing the ''Clear Browsing History Now'' button will erase all of the History.

The History is available from the ''Go'' &amp;rarr; ''History'' menu item, by pressing [Ctrl]+[H], or by going to ''View'' &amp;rarr; ''Sidebar'' &amp;rarr; ''History''. The ''Go'' menu itself also shows History.

History is an option for &quot;Clear Private Data&quot;, and is selected by default.




====Saved Forms====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-saved_forms.png|right|thumb|200px|The Privacy Tab with Saved Forms selected]]
This tab, like the History tab, has only two items of interest:
*Save information I enter in forms and the Search Bar.
*Clear Saved Form Data Now

Checking the box (which is the default setting) will have Firefox save any data that is entered in a form. This includes things like the Google search box, any contact information (Name, Address, Email, etc) and other search boxes. Also, the Search Box included on the default Firefox toolbar (accessible by pressing [Ctrl]+[K]) Unchecking this box will stop Firefox from saving this information. Pressing the ''Clear Saved Form Data Now'' button will remove all the data currently stored by Firefox. 

Saved Form Data is an option for &quot;Clear Private Data&quot;, and is selected by default.

Note that you can clear out individual items ''(such as an erroneous or mis-typed entry)'' without having to clear all saved data.  When the list of saved items shows up, navigate to the item you want to remove ''(don't click on it)'', then use the Shift-Delete key combination.

====Passwords====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-passwords.png|right|thumb|200px|The Privacy Tab with Passwords selected]]
When ''Remember Passwords'' is checked (default), Firefox will present you with an option to save a password on any site where one is entered. After entering a password and hitting the submit button, Firefox will present a dialog with three options, ''Remember'', ''Never for This Site'', and ''Not Now''. Selecting ''Remember'' will have Firefox store the password for that page, and will automatically enter it on each successive visit. Selecting ''Never for This Site'' will prevent Firefox from remembering the password for that page, '''and''' it will not ask to save a password on that page again. Selecting ''Not Now'' will prevent Firefox from saving the password on that visit, but the dialog will be presented again the next time you visit that site.

Firefox also has the option to set a Master Password. Without one, Firefox will automatically enter any password that is stored--regardless of who is using the browser at that time. A Master Password will cause Firefox to prompt the user for a password  before it will enter any saved passwords. However, it will only prompt once ''per session'', meaning as long as the browser remains open. To prevent unauthorized use of passwords, be sure to close the browser when you are finished using it (if you entered a Master Password). The Master Password can also be unset from this window.

Pressing the ''View Saved Passwords'' button will open a new dialog. This window shows every site that Firefox has a username/password saved for. At first, the address of the site and the username are displayed. Press the ''Show Passwords'' button to display the saved passwords. Individual entries can be removed by selecting them, and pressing ''Remove''. All entries can be removed with the ''Remove All'' button.

Also on the ''View Saved Passwords'' dialog is a tab that displays ''Passwords Never Saved''. This window is very similar to the ''Passwords Saved'' window. Removing an entry from this list, however, will cause Firefox to ask to save a password the next time you visit that site.

Saved Passwords are an option for &quot;Clear Private Data&quot;, but are not selected by default.

====Download History====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-download_history.png|right|thumb|200px|The Privacy Tab with Download History selected]]
Any time you download an item from the Internet, Firefox opens the Download Manager to track it. After the download is finished, Firefox will keep that item visible. Each item can be removed individually, or the entire history can be cleared at once. Also, Firefox can be set to never save a history (or clear the download history on its own, after each download). The Download Manager can be accessed by going to ''Tools'' &amp;rarr; ''Downloads'', or by pressing [Ctrl]+[J]. It can also be accessed by pressing the ''View Download History'' button on this pane of the Preferences window.

The only setting here affects how Firefox clears the Download Manager.
''Remove files from the Download Manager:''
*Upon successful download
*When Firefox exits
*Manually (default)

''Upon successful download'' will erase entries from the Download Manager as they finish downloading, ''When Firefox exits'' will clear the Download Manager history each time Firefox is closed, and ''Manually'' will leave all entries in the Download Manager until they are removed by the user.

'''Note''': Removing files from the Download Manager '''does not''' delete the files from your computer. It only removes the history of you downloading it from Firefox.

Download History is an option for &quot;Clear Private Data&quot;, and is selected by default.



====Cookies====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-cookies.png|right|thumb|200px|The Privacy Tab with Cookies selected]]
[[w:HTTP_cookie | Cookies]] are &quot;''pieces of information stored by sites on your computer. They are used to remember login information and other data.''&quot; This window can be a little more confusing than the others.

The first option, which is enabled by default, is ''Allow sites to set Cookies''. Next to that option is a button named ''Exceptions''. Setting exceptions will allow cookies from every site ''except'' for sites on the list.

Under that are two more options: 
*''for the originating site only''
*''unless I have removed cookies set by the site''

Checking the first box will only allow cookies that are from the site you are currently on. For other sites to give you cookies, you will have to navigate to that site (with the option enabled; it is disabled by default). The second option will except all cookies, as long as you have not removed a cookie from that site. For instance, if you remove a cookie set by google.com, then google.com will no longer be able to send you cookies.

Beneath those options is a dropdown box. ''Keep Cookies:''
*''until they expire'' (default)
*''until I close Firefox''
*''ask me every time''

Each cookie has an expiration date. By selecting the first option, Firefox will keep each cookie until it expires, and then discard it. Selecting the second option will keep all cookies only until Firefox is closed. The third option will make Firefox ask you each time a site tries to set a cookie, or modify an existing one.

Pressing the ''View Cookies'' button will bring up a new window, listing all cookies by site. From this window, it is possible to remove one, a few, or all cookies. Also, it is possible to view the contents of each cookie (though they are usually nonsensical).

Finally, the ''Clear Cookies Now'' button will clear all cookies.

Cookies are an option for &quot;Clear Private Data&quot;, but are not selected by default.



====Cache====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-cache.png|right|thumb|200px|The Privacy Tab with Cache selected]]
''Pages you view are stored in the cache for faster viewing later on''. As you visit pages, Firefox will automatically save copies of them. If you navigate to the same page later, Firefox will use the page saved rather than downloading it again. With this setting, you can set the size of the cache.

''Use up to __ MB of disk space for the cache.'' The default value is 50.

Press the ''Clear Cache Now&quot; button to remove all pages from the cache.

Cache is an option for &quot;Clear Private Data&quot;, and is selected by default.

===Content===
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_Content.png|right|thumb|200px|The Content Tab]]
The first setting on this pane is for blocking popups. Firefox is set to automatically enable all unwanted popups. The setting is ''Block Popup Windows'', and is enabled by default. To the right is an ''Allowed Sites'' button, that lets you set sites to accept popup windows from. When a popup is blocked, the yellow &quot;information bar&quot; appears at the top of the window. From there, you can allow the popup that was blocked, or allow access for the site to open popups. Sites can be removed from the ''Allowed Sites'' list, which will cause Firefox to block popups from that site again.

Next is the ''Warn me when web sites try to install extensions or themes''. This is also enabled by default. To the right of that is an ''Exceptions'' button. Any site that is not on the Exceptions list (which contains only ''addons.mozilla.org'' and ''update.mozilla.org'' by default) will be blocked from installing extensions or themes. A yellow information bar will appear at the top of the window, very similar to the one that appears when a popup is blocked. If you want to install an extension or theme from the current site, you can add it to the exceptions list, and then retry the install. If the install was unwanted (e.g., a web site tried to install a malicious extension), you don't need to take any further action, as the install was already blocked. Do not add the site to your exceptions list unless you want to install an extension/theme.

''Load images'' is the next preference. It is enabled by default. This preference also has an ''Exceptions'' list, though it works slightly different from the extensions/themes exceptions list. From this list, you can both allow '''and''' deny permission for sites to load images. For instance, if the ''Load images'' preference is enabled, you can use the Exceptions list to deny specific sites the ability to load images. If, for example, you did not want wikibooks.org to load images, you would type &quot;wikibooks.org&quot; in the ''Address of the web site'' box, and hit ''Deny''. All other sites would be allowed to load images as normal.

If the ''Load images'' preference was disabled, then no images would be downloaded. However, if (again for example) you wanted wikibooks.org to be '''allowed''' to load images, then you would type &quot;wikibooks.org&quot; in the ''Address of the web site'' box, this time hitting ''Allow''. All images would be blocked '''except''' images from wikibooks.org. Both types (allowed sites and denied sites) can be set at the same time, but would depend on the state of the ''Load images'' preference.

Below ''Load images'' is a preference (disabled by default) ''for the originating web site only''. When enabled, images will only load if they come from the same site as the current page. However, this will not display images for such large sites as Yahoo! and Wikipedia, as images on those sites are stored on separate servers.

The preference ''Enable Java'' (enabled by default), controls whether or not Java applets are loaded in Firefox.

''Enable JavaScript'' (enabled by default) controls whether or not [[w:JavaScript | JavaScript]] is executed by the browser. Pressing the ''Advanced...'' button will bring up a new window with the following options:
''Allow scripts to:''
*Move or resize existing windows
*Raise or lower windows
*Disable or replace context menus
*Hide the status bar
*Change status bar text

The first three are enabled (meaning JavaScripts on a page will be able to do those actions) while the last two are disabled by default.

Finally, the Content tab contains Fonts &amp; Colors settings. From this dialog, you can set the default font, and the default font size. The ''Advanced...'' dialog will allow you to select which specific fonts display which font type, and their sizes. The ''Colors...'' button allows you to set Link, Background, and Text colors.


===Tabs===
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_Tabs.png|right|thumb|200px|The Tabs tab]]
The first Tab-related preference is &quot;Open links from other applications in:&quot;
*A new window
*A new tab in the most recent window
*The most recent tab/window

These options are mostly self explanatory. When another application (AOL Instant Messenger, for instance) tries to open a link, this preference will tell Firefox where to do it. The first two are easy enough to figure out, while the third will simply reuse the window that was most recently focused (replacing its contents).

The next preference is &quot;Force links that open new windows to open in:&quot;
*The same tab/window as the link
*A new tab

This preference is sometimes referred to as &quot;Single Window Mode&quot;, as it prevents the &quot;target:_blank&quot; and &quot;target:_new&quot; attributes on links from opening new windows, always forcing Firefox to use one window. However, it has been disabled by default, as a few crashes have been reported with it enabled. There is little danger in enabling it, as it can be easily disabled again if a problem arises.

Three other preferences are on this window:
*Hide the tab bar when only one web site is open
*Select new tabs opened from links
*Warn when closing multiple tabs

The tab bar is hidden by default when only one website is opened. To have it always visible, uncheck the box next to the preference. &quot;Select new tabs opened from links&quot; can be described as &quot;open a tab in the foreground&quot;. In other words, with this preference enabled (it's disabled by default), a new tab opened by middle clicking a link will automatically be selected and visible. The default behavior is to have the new tab open in the background, where you have to manually select it to view it.
The final preference is visible by opening more than one tab and trying to close the window. A warning will be displayed to make sure all of the tabs can be closed.

It is also possible to extend tabbed browsing functionality through Firefox's extension system. See [[Using_Firefox/Extensions | Chapter 6]] for more details on extensions.
If Firefox split windows in taskbar  when group tabs
&quot;browser.taskbar.previews.enable&quot; to &quot;FALSE&quot; in about:config

===Downloads===
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_Downloads.png|right|thumb|200px|The Downloads tab]]
The Downloads tab has several preferences. First, there is the option of setting a &quot;Download Folder&quot;. If ''Ask me where to save every file'' is selected, then Firefox will prompt you for a location to save every file you download. Selecting ''Save all files to this folder:'' will make it so every download goes to the same location. The Desktop is the default location for downloads on Windows.

Next, ''Show Download Manager when a download begins'', which is enabled by default. This brings up the download manager for each file that is downloaded. You will manually have to close the Download Manager unless the preference ''Close the Download Manager when all downloads are complete'' is selected.

The final preference states ''Firefox can automatically download or open files of certain types.'' Pressing the ''View &amp; Edit Actions...'' button will bring up a new window. It contains a list of file extensions, and default actions for files of that type. Each file type can be set to automatically open with its default application, automatically open with a non-default application, saved to the computer, or opened with a plugin (assuming the correct plugin is installed). At this time, there appears to be no &quot;Add&quot; button, so you're out of luck if the type you want to handle is missing from the list.
Additionally, some users may have a blank dialog box (as of 8-8-2006), in which case none of the extensions are listed. The issue is mentioned at http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2400536&amp;sid=d02c030728278592cbeb3aee9805b14b but the fixes described may not work for all users. Those users should locate their profiles folder (%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default on WinXP where x is a random character), and delete the appropriate files there.

===Advanced===
This pane offers some advanced settings. There is a third tab offered under &quot;Advanced&quot;, &quot;Security&quot;. However, most users should not need to change any preferences on this tab.
====General====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_advanced-general.png|right|thumb|200px|The Advanced Tab with General selected]]
The setting ''Allow text to be selected with the keyboard'' controls '''caret browsing'''. When using caret browsing, a cursor is placed in the browser, and it can be moved with the arrow keys and used to select text. Pressing [F7] will also enable and disable this feature.

''Begin finding when you begin typing'' is a setting for Find As You Type (FAYT). Normally, FAYT is activated only after pressing the ''/'' or '' ' '' keys, or by pressing [F3]. With this setting enabled, FAYT will begin when any key is pressed (as long as the cursor is not in a form, or other text entry area).

''Resize large images to fit in the browser window'' will automatically resize any image that is larger than the current browser window so that it fits in the window without causing scrollbars. Clicking on the image will display it at its full size, and clicking on it again will resize it to fit the window.

''Use autoscrolling'' toggles the ability to autoscroll. With autoscroll enabled, click the middle mouse button to enter autoscroll mode. While in autoscroll mode, simply move the mouse up to scroll up, and move the mouse down to scroll down. Clicking the middle mouse button again will exit autoscroll.

''Use smooth scrolling'' toggles the ability to make scrolling with the mouse wheel &quot;smoother&quot; than normal.

Finally, click the ''Edit Languages...'' button to change the order of preference of languages for pages that offer more than one language.


====Update====
[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_advanced-update.png|right|thumb|200px|The Advanced Tab with Update selected]]
The Update tab changes the way Firefox checks for updates for itself, extensions and themes, and search engines. All three should remain checked, as critical security updates will use the Update system.

The final preference determines how to install updates. If ''Ask me what I want to do'' is selected, then Firefox will alert you when new updates are found and wait for instructions. If ''Automatically download and install the update'' is selected, Firefox will apply updates without asking. However, if ''Warn me if this will disable extensions or themes'' is checked, and a new update may break a currently installed extension or theme, Firefox will display a warning.

Finally, select the ''Show Update History'' button to see a list of previously installed updates, and what they contained.

===Multiple Users===
With Firefox, it is possible to create many different ''profiles'' each with its own settings. This has several advantages, because it allows you to install the extensions you need for web development, while not slowing down your browser for normal surfing. The disadvantage is that only one profile can be running a the same time. To switch profiles, or add new profiles, you need to run &lt;tt&gt;firefox -profilemanager&lt;/tt&gt;. On Windows, this can be achieved by typing the command into the &quot;Run&quot; dialog on the start menu, on most other systems this can be run wherever a command may be run, usually a Terminal or Command Line.

This command must be run when firefox is not running on your computer, if it is running,you will just get a new window with the preferences for the currently active profile. The dialog box that opens when the command is run successfully allows you to select from a list of profiles. With each profile you have the option to either &quot;Rename&quot; or &quot;Delete&quot; it, or just to &quot;Start Firefox&quot; by using it. 

When you delete a profile from the profile manager, it asks you whether you want to delete or keep the files that contain the information associated with it. If you select the delete files option, then all private data associated with that profile, including history, saved passwords, and cookies, are deleted from the hard drive. There is no reason to keep these files as creating a new profile under the same name as the deleted one will not restore the profile.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rmky87. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rmky87~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

AutoCAD is a high end CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) Program.  It has a multitude of features which this book will try to address.

AutoCAD is a vector based drawing application intended for engineering purposes. Commands can be entered at a command line or through toolbars and menus. 

===DWG Files===
AutoCAD drawings are saved using the DWG extension, and over the years this has become a standard format for exchanging technical drawings, to the extent that even programs such as Adobe Illustrator will recognise DWG files. AutoCAD also supports an even more widely recognised format called DXF which was specifically designed as an interchange format. Unfortunately, as AutoCAD has passed through numerous editions, the DWG format has upgraded to keep pace with newer features. The most recent format was released with AutoCAD 2012 and any files saved using this format cannot be opened by AutoCAD 2011, 2010, 2009 etc.

==Basic drawing tools==

===Point===
Creates a symbol on the drawing that is tied to a specific point. It is defined by coordinates (x,y,z).  It is not necessary to create points when you want to draw other geometric entities.

===Construction line tools===

Ray = A line with a defined starting point with infinte length at a specified slope.

Xline = An infinite line with no start or end point at a specified slope. Base point can be snapped with middle point snap mode. Shortcut &quot;xl&quot;

===Polyline===

Polylines are the main business of most drawings. A polyline is made of numerous lines/arcs/or both segmented together into one selectable object. Polylines are quite versatile and the PEDIT(Polyline Edit) command can be used to access &amp; edit many of the features associated with them.
Shortcut &quot;pl&quot;

===Polygon===

Polygons are regular, multisided shapes such as pentagons, hexagons etc. When this tool is employed, AutoCAD requests the number of sides desired and then asks whether the shape is to be defined as sitting on a circle of specified radius, or by the length of a side.
The objects created from this command become &quot;Closed Polylines&quot; and can be edited using PEDIT.

===Rectangle===

This is basically a quick way of drawing a four-segment poly line with four right angles.
Shortcut &quot;rec&quot;.

===Arc===

An arc is a circle segment. When using this tool the user can define the arc by selecting three points through which AutoCAD will generate an arc, or alternatively the user can define a center point, a radius and a range of degrees to fill.

===Circle===

The only variables here are radius and centre point.
Shortcut &quot;c&quot;

===Spline===

Splines are a particular form of curve generated by specific mathematical equations. The user can select as many vertices as they wish, and AutoCAD will generate a spline curve that incorporates all these points. Splines are generally used for cosmetic purposes, as their mathematical complexity makes them hard to define from a technical design perspective.
Shortcut &quot;spl&quot;

===Ellipse===

Basically an oval. Similar to a circle, except ellipses require a radius to be defined for both their vertical and horizontal components.
Shortcut &quot;el&quot;

===Hatch===

Hatches are area fills. They can be made up of a solid colour, a gradient (in later versions of AutoCAD) or more usually a specific pattern. Hatches can be applied to a particular object such as a looped polyline, or any enclosed area. They can be (and usually should be) defined as being &quot;associative&quot; which means that if the area in which they are contained is adjusted, the hatching will update automatically.

===Text===

Inserts a text string into the drawing. AutoCAD uses two forms of text entry, single line and multiline. These are known respectively as DTEXT and MTEXT. DTEXT is very much a leftover from AutoCAD's early years and there is no real justification for using it's very basic system when the MTEXT option has features similar to a conventional text editor.you may also select command TEXT for undefined area.

==Basic Modifying Tools==

===Erase===

Erases the selected object from the drawing. Can also be activated by pressing the delete key on the keyboard.
Shortcut &quot;e&quot; (not very helpful because there is delete key)

we also erases the objects by selected objects for example. select the objects which you want to erase and then select the erase tool and press key enter
New Method

===Copy===
Copies the selected object from one point on the drawing to one or more locations. The user defines two points and the object is copied using these two positions as base points. For example, the user could select 100,100 as the first point and 100,200 as the second point. This would place the copy 100 drawing units above the first. Points can either be entered using the keyboard or by clicking anywhere in the drawing.
Shortcut &quot;cp&quot;/&quot;co&quot;

===Mirror===
Creates a mirror image of the selected object. The user defines two points, along which autocad generates a &quot;line of reflection&quot; and the reflected object is generated across this line with all components reversed. The user is then asked if they want to keep or delete the original. One problem with the mirror command is that if any text is included in the mirroring operation, it too is reversed making it unreadable and ridiculous. To fix this, type &quot;MIRRTEXT&quot; at the command line and change the value to 0.
Shortcut &quot;mi&quot;

===Offset===
An offset is like a copy but is more precise and must be used for certain situations as the result is likely to be slightly bigger or smaller than the original. For example, consider a line that represents the edge of a road. This line contains several curved segments, and you would like to make a copy of this line to represent the opposite side of the road. A direct copy won't work, because the radius of the inside of a curve is much tighter than on the outside. The offset command allows you to simply define how far away and on which side you would like the copy to be made, and AutoCAD will take it from there.
Shortcut &quot;o&quot;

===Array===
An array is a quick way of doing a lot of copying, as long as all the copies are arranged in a simplistic way. There are two types of array; polar and grid. For a polar array, Autocad asks the user how many copies they want to make, and requests a centre point and a number of degrees to fill. Autocad then sweeps round this centre point making copies of the selected object in a circular pattern. For a grid array, the user selectes how many rows and columns they require, as well as the spacings between them and Autocad instantly duplicates the selected object(s) as many times as necessary.
Shortcut &quot;ar&quot;

===Move===
Works exactly the same as the copy command except the original is deleted.
Shortcut &quot;m&quot;

===Rotate===
The user selects the object(s) to be rotated, a centre point, and defines the number of degrees to revolve through. The original is deleted, so if a copy is desired the polar array tool should be used. (Though, since AutoCAD 2006, a &quot;Copy&quot; option is included in this command, making it possible to retain the original objects)
Shortcut &quot;ro&quot;

===Scale===
The object(s) are selected, and a base point and scaling factor are defined. An easy way of changing a drawing from metres to milimetres is to scale everything up by a factor of 1000.

==Drafting==

===Starting a drawing===
Upon running the program, the user will likely be prompted with an option to open an existing drawing or start afresh using a template. Templates are saved using a DWT extension and provide a quick way to get started. Having selected a template or having chosen to start from scratch, the user finds themselves at an empty drawing and is free to input information. The main area of the program window is taken up by the drawing area. This is surrounded by toolbars, a menu bar and a command line. The toolbars and the menu bar work the same way as other Windows programs, but the command line is a little more primitive. It is a throwback to the earlier versions of AutoCAD which existed in a time prior to Graphical User Interfaces and all editing had to be done by typing in commands and specifying coordinates. Even something like zooming into an area required the user to input the coordinates defining the window around the area to zoom into. Naturally enough, none of this functionality has been removed, with the result that AutoCAD now has both a modern graphical interface and a less pretty but far more flexible command line system. The advantages of using the command line to control the program will become clear later.

=== OSNAP Modes ===
Using object snap modes is crucial for accurate drawing. Drawing without them will result in misaligned entities and inaccurate lengths and positioning.

They can be accessed while using a command that asks the user to input a specific point, either directly at the command line, the OSNAP toolbox or by right clicking while holding the shift key.

==Layout Space/Model Space==

Layout Space is typically used as an area for drawing entities that are not real-world objects, but rather entities that are informational in nature (annotations, border and title block, notes, etc.) and therefore can always be drawn at the same size they will be printed at. It has been long-debated about the usefulness of Layout(Paper) Space, especially since AutoCAD introduced xRefs and the ability to clip them. Many users find working solely in Model Space an efficient method of working in CAD (ala Microstation), however both methods of working in AutoCAD have their pros and cons, and what method a user may choose will largely depend on personal preference and/or the preferred method of the company one works for.

===Model Space===
Model space is basically &quot;the real world&quot;. Everything is drawn at a scale of one to one (where meters, millimeters or inches are the preferred drawing units) and all drawing components are positioned at the correct distances from each other, regardless of what sheet of paper they may end up being printed on. The drawings may also be positioned on a specific coordinate system, such as a national mapping grid, in order to integrate accurately with other drawings.

===Layout (Paper) Space===
A typical Layout Space layout will consist of a standardized title block containing information about the drawing; drawing number, date completed etc. This title block will be drawn to accurately fit on a standardized sheet of paper. For example, a sheet of ISO A1 measures 841mm by 594mm. Thus, a title block for printing on such a sheet may measure 820 drawing units by 570. It can then be printed out at  a scale of 1 to 1, and will fit on the page nicely.

===Viewports===
All this is of course well and good, but how do we get the actual drawing information from model space into this titleblock? To do this, we utilize an item known as a viewport. A viewport is a shape (usually a rectangle but can be any shape) that is drawn into paper space. Think of them as a TV screen. Inserting a viewport into paper spaces &quot;places a camera&quot; into model space. You can change the angle of view, the scale factor and many other variables in the viewport settings. These changes only effect this one viewport. This lets you have, for example, one large viewport of a building site at a scale of 1:100, and right beside it another showing a detailed area at a scale of 1:10. It's the same building site, and it exists only once in model space, but it is represented twice in two different ways in the final drawing. The obvious advantage of this is any changes made in model space will instantly update in every viewport, keeping all your printable drawings up to date.

==Layers==

===Organizing Data===

An important thing to realize about AutoCAD is that it is not some kind of digital drawing board. A lot of inexperienced users approach the program as if it was MS Paint for engineers, and end up creating horribly thought out and disorganized drawings that can cause no end of strife and frustration for those who may later be required to work with the files. Not only can badly created drawings cause ulcers to other AutoCAD users, they make it a lot easier for design flaws to sneak into the process. A little bit of pre-planning and some attention to good drafting practice might be the difference between a painless efficient project and a messy expensive rebuild.

The most important thing to understand is that AutoCAD does not, strictly speaking, create &quot;drawings&quot; in the classic sense of the word. The user should not consider themself to be making pictures or creating images. A much more useful and accurate way of thinking about an AutoCAD drawing file is as being a database full of information. The AutoCAD program allows the user to view and edit this information through a graphical interface. Thus, when drawing a line between two points, realize that you are entering two coordinates into your database. So if you want a line that links the points 200,500 and 600, 1200, then those should be the values you use. Do not, under any circumstances, just scribble down a line in a place that &quot;looks&quot; right. What kind of database user are you, to be inserting 199.9813 when you mean 200? If you want one line to begin where a previous one ends, then ensure they contact at EXACTLY the same point. You can use the &quot;Object Snaps&quot; feature to make this work properly, and  there is no excuse for creating drawings that contain elements that look like they line up  until you zoom in to micrometer scales and discover why those polylines weren't joining correctly or those hatches weren't applying properly etc.

===The Layers Window===

The LAYERS window should be the hub around which any moderately well thought out drawing should revolve. It is through the layers window that all data is organised and controlled. A layer can be thought of as being a transparent sheet overlaying the drawing board. You can have as many as you wish. It is extremely useful to separate as much data as possible onto separate layers. It allows you to have numerous &quot;drawings&quot; all existing together in the one file. When a layer is &quot;turned off&quot; all the information that was on that layer becomes invisible.

The Layers window can be opened by either hitting the layers button on the toolbar or by typing LAYER or LA at the command line. For a new drawing, the only layer available is the layer 0. This is a special layer which is required in all drawings. It is bad drawing practice to create linework on this layer. It should be used only for creating the components of blocks and inserting xrefs. (More on these later). New layers can be created by hitting the &quot;New Layer&quot; button. By default, Autocad will name new layers &quot;Layer1&quot;, &quot;Layer2&quot; etc. It is advisable to rename the layer to match the content that will be drawn on it, e.g. BRICKWORK, STORMWATER_PIPES, STORMWATER_MANHOLES etc.

===ByLayer===

An extremely important aspect of the layers window are the columns for Color, Linetype and Lineweight. Suppose you create a new layer, and call it STORMWATER. Next you might select the color value of this layer and set it to Blue. Upon hitting OK and returning to the drawing, you might start constructing linework. You will notice that the layers toolbar has several dropdown boxes in it, again showing color, linetype and lineweight. If all is well in the world, the words ByLayer should be written in all these boxes. This means that if you have a line on the layer STORMWATER whose color is set to ByLayer, it will automatically be Blue. If you reenter the layers window and change the Color of STORMWATER to something else, everything on the layer whose color is set to ByLayer will automatically change. It is possible to set the color of an object to something other than ByLayer, by selecting the object and than opening the color dropdown box on the Layers toolbar. This is very rarely recommended though. Think about it. Suppose you are drawing lots of pipes all over your STORMWATER layer, and they are all showing up Blue. Now suppose that there is one particular pipe that you want to appear green, because it is made of steel instead of plastic or something. The cheap and lazy option is to just change that objects color to green, but this means that you have given up some control over that line, because now you can no longer edit its color through the layers window. A good rule to bear in mind is, if something is different enough to deserve its own color, then it certainly deserves its own layer. In this case you would make a separate layer (colored green) called STORMWATER_STEEL upon which you would draw this one line. You would probably then rename the original layer to STORMWATER_PLASTIC, in order to retain consistency and to make it easier for someone else to understand the drawing.

===Linetypes===

Linetypes are a method of defining the pattern in which a particular line will print out, whether it be dashed or dotted or numerous other styles. The default setting is called Continuous, which just means a standard uninterrupted line. However, cases will arise, in particular when printing in black and white, in which it will be necessary to differentiate between different pieces of linework. Defining linetype works exactly the same way as for color. It can be changed individually on an object by object basis, but it is almost always preferable to leave everything set to ByLayer and adjust the settings through the layers window. By default, the only linetype available when you start AutoCAD is Continuous. To make others available, double click on Continuous in the layers window. The box that opens will have an option to &quot;Load&quot;. The following window should provide a good list of extra linetypes which you can load as you need them. AutoCAD doesn't load them all by default to keep file size minimal. An important aspect of linetypes is scale. All lines have a property called linetype scale, which by default is set to 1. However, different linetypes may be defined in different ways. For example: a dashed line may have gaps that are 100 units apart and nearby dotted line may have been defined with gaps of only 10. It would be necessary to change the linetype scale of the dotted line to 10 to maintain a degree of consistency throughout the drawing. Just to confuse things, there is another variable called LTSCALE that effects linetype scale in the drawing at large. It is changed by typing LTSCALE at the command line. By default it is set to 1. Changes to this value are on top of changes to the object linetype scales, so if a line has its linetype scale set to 20 and LTSCALE is set to 10, the line will appear to have a scale of 200. The advantage of this is it allows you to have the same line appearing in different viewports at different scales without the linetype scale distorting.

What is 'it'? It applies to any disaster, large or small. From the strictly personal scale calamity to those of a more global nature, and everything in between. Regardless of the size of the problem, preparing beforehand will increase your chances of surviving.  

Hopefully this book will will attempt to provide help for you to prepare, survive whatever disaster or emergency awaits and thrive when civilization breaks down. We will discuss skills and tools and strategies you can use in a negative situation to help yourself and others.

What kind of disasters are we talking about?  Well, on a personal level, are you prepared to survive a blown engine or car crash in the middle of a desert?  Or in the middle of a blizzard?  What do you do if your house burns down?  That's what this book is for.  

Are you ready to deal with a global pandemic?  It may be the bird flu, swine flu or something we haven't even heard of yet.  Are you ready?  You may be asking yourself &quot;how do I even start answering that question?&quot;.  That's what this book is for.

If a hurricane strikes; what will you do, where will you go, and how will you cope?  If a tornado strikes your town or a rail road tank car releases a cloud of chlorine gas, now what?  That's what this book is for.

How about economic meltdown, short and long term power disruptions, food riots and zombies?  That's what this book is for.  Okay, maybe not the zombies.  

Especially in &quot;modern&quot; nations (economies based mostly in transformation and services), most citizens are utterly dependent on the steady availability of food, water, electricity, advanced medical care, and a million other goods and services and to the generally predictable state of things. Most of the time people can get away with that dependence, if things work in the expected parameters, but it is certain that there will be times that events be it natural disasters, political strife or any one of a multitude of possible and even unimaginable accidents that can and will interrupt the normal flow of life and leave people inconvenienced at best and at risk of dead at worst.

&lt;center&gt;&quot;''Any city is three days from starvation and one week from cannibalism.''&quot;&lt;/center&gt;


Start reading and contributing to the book, above all start preparing. Because you do not want to be that guy, standing there with the dumbfounded look on his face, when 'it' hits the fan.

This section will provide basic guides and approaches to problems, general needs and considerations to generalized procedures for surviving various personal emergencies. On how to take some steps that can help you in a survival situation, especially if you are low on material and must live from your environment.

These guides should only include information and strategies that will require only stone age materials or easily recyclable from today's environment and should focus on projects that ultimately are possible to be created and transported by a single person.

Applying the generalities of the previous chapter to specific major events. Some of this events can be predicted or even expected, while others have a very low chance of happening. This section will only cover events that can be survivable and possible to happen in a given person life time. Things like the end of the universe, the Sun collapsing, alien invasions or a zombie apocalypse as well as religious or premonitory situations for the end of the world should be avoided.

When &quot;it&quot; does hit the fan, it can be so severe than there will be no rescuers coming for you and your companions. You should not give up hope easily, but being realistic will push you to deal with the inevitable conclusion (in this situation) that you must become self sufficient. This section is kind of a how-to for restoring civilization from scratch.

There are many literary works that cover the subject of survival in general, even after large catastrophes. From [[Lord of the Flies]] by [[w:William Golding|William Golding]], [[w:Tunnel in the Sky|Tunnel in the Sky]] by [[w:Robert A. Heinlein|Robert A. Heinlein]], [[w:The Scarlet Plague|The Scarlet Plague]] by [[w:Jack London|Jack London]] ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21970 in the public domain]) or even [[w:Lucifer's Hammer|Lucifer's Hammer]] by [[w:Larry Niven|Larry Niven]] and [[w:Jerry Pournelle|Jerry Pournelle]] for a broader view on how these situations may evolve.

This is also a subject that is covered in movies with some realism (or lack of it):&lt;br&gt;
'''Deadly solar flare(s)''' - [[w:Where Have All The People Gone?|Where Have All The People Gone? (1974)]], [[w:Hell (2011 film)|Hell (2011)]].

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called MichTheWeird. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name MichTheWeird~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is a summary of ''The Descent of Man'' published by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1871.

==Introduction==

In his introduction to ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin states that he wrote this book because of the wide acceptance the concept of natural selection had received following the publication of ''The Origin of Species.'' He states a three-fold object for writing ''The Descent of Man'', first of all to consider whether man &quot;descended from a pre-existing form; secondly, the manner of his development; and thirdly, the value of the differences between the so-called races of man.&quot;

Darwin mentions three authors who had written about &quot;the high antiquity of man&quot;, i.e., Boucher de Perthes, Sir Charles Lyell, and Sir John Lubbock. He also states that he will not be making a detailed comparison between man and apes because of the work others had already done in that area, and he mentions the work of Prof. Thomas Henry Huxley who had &quot;conclusively shown that in every visible characteristic man differs less from the higher apes&quot; than the apes differ from other primates.

Furthermore, Darwin mentions others including Lamarck, Wallace, Vogt, Buchner, Rolle, and Haeckel in addition to the four already mentioned who had concluded that man had descended with other species from a common, ancient and extinct ancestor. He even mentions the titles of the works of the less well-known German authors, his point being that what he had to say in ''The Descent of Man'' was not entirely new.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semiconductors==

A '''semiconductor''' is a material that is neither a conductor nor an insulator - it is somewhere in between. This sounds like a resistor, and indeed it is possible to make resistors from semiconductor material. However, in electronics, semiconductor has a more specific meaning.

If we take a crystal of some pure material, such as silicon, we find that each silicon atom has four bonds (this is called the '''valency''' of the atom), and each bond links it to another silicon atom. This bonding forms a crystal lattice and occupies all of the electrons in the silicon atoms. Because there are no free electrons, this material cannot pass a current, and is an insulator.

If we carefully add an additional element to the material, the situation changes. If we add an atom with a valency of five instead of four, we find that wherever an atom of the introduced element is found, four of its bonds will attach to nearby silicon atoms, but the fifth bond will be unattached, leaving a free electron available, which will carry a current. Such a material is said to be '''doped''' with the donor material, but because only a small amount of donor material is added, the number of free electrons is quite small and so it will conduct, but rather poorly.

===N-type and P-type===

If we dope silicon with material having a valency of five, extra free electrons are created in the crystal. These electrons carry charge in the normal manner, and are called '''majority carriers'''. Material doped in this way is referred to as '''N-type''' or &quot;negative type&quot; semiconductor (because the charge is carried by electrons, and such charge is actually negative with respect to conventional current).

We can also dope silicon with a donor having a valency of only three instead of four. This also creates a semiconductor material because the shortage of bonds leaves '''holes''' in the lattice. These holes are the absence of an electron, but they still carry a charge, equivalent to the charge on an electron, but of the opposite sign. These are called '''minority carriers'''. Holes carry charge in the opposite direction to normal current, because their charge has the opposite sign. In fact what happens is that current is carried by electrons as usual, but wherever an electron meets a hole, it falls into the hole, opening up a new hole behind it. So while the current is still really caused by electrons, it appears as if the holes are migrating in the opposite direction. This is exactly equivalent to a positive charge moving the opposite way.

P and N type materials are in themselves not very interesting, but remarkable properties emerge when a sandwich is formed from the two kinds of materials. Such sandwiches are called '''junctions''' and are the basis for all kinds of semiconductor devices.

===Diodes===

A diode allows current to flow one way but not another. It is important to remember that when looking at a circuit diagram that conventional current flows in the direction of the arrow (positive to negative). The word &quot;di-ode&quot; means two-terminaled.

A diode is formed by bonding a single piece of N-type semiconductor to a single piece of P-type. This two-layer device consists of a single P-N junction, and is the simplest semiconductor device. When current is flowing through the device, it is said to be '''forward biased''' and has a fairly low resistance. If the voltage across the diode is reversed, the diode is said to be '''reverse biased''' and usually no current will flow; but see also [[Electronics/Diodes/Zener diode|Zener diode]]s.

How it works is as follows. When reverse biased, free electrons in the N-type material, being negative, are attracted to the positive potential applied to the diode. At the other side, positively charged holes are attracted to the negative terminal. The carriers (holes and electrons) are pulled away from the junction area, leaving it depleted of any charge carriers. This forms a '''depletion layer''' and it is an insulator, so no current can flow through the device, except in Zener diodes.

When the potential difference across the diode is reversed, the opposite happens - carriers are pushed away from the terminals towards the junction, until they reach the opposite type of material. Here, electrons are able to &quot;fall into&quot; holes, completing the circuit and allowing current to flow.

Diodes are used also to make DC out of AC. They are then called [[Electronics/Rectifier|rectifiers]].

Zener diodes are used as voltage sources.

See also [[Electronics/Diodes|more about Diodes]] and [[Electronics/Diodes/Zener diodes|Zener diode]]s

===Light-Emittting Diode===

A '''light-emitting diode''' or '''LED''' is a 2-layer semiconductor device just as any typical diode is, but it is doped using exotic materials to give it its light-emitting properties. When reverse-biased, an LED blocks the current just as any diode does, but when forward biased, each time an electron falls into a hole, it gives up its energy as a number of '''photons''', which we see as visible light.

The exact amount of energy given up dictates the colour of the LED, and this in turn is controlled by the exact proportions and types of doping material used. Low energy photons are seen as red light, while higher energies gives us orange, green and blue. White LEDs are made by producing a wide range of colours simultaneously.

Most LEDs need to have a carefully limited amount of current, since they are easy to burn out if too much flows. Thus a series resistor is necessary to make sure the current can't be too high. As long as the current is kept within the LED's design limits, they are extremely robust and have very long lifetimes - far greater than ordinary lightbulbs.


A simple experiment:

Take the a LED and the appropriate resistor and battery to make it work and simply switch the two connections of the diode to the resistor and battery. If done correctly it should light in one direction and not the other.

===Transistors===

A '''transistor''' is a [[w:Semiconductor|semiconductor]] device with three terminals. There are numerous types of transistors, but in general they all do the same job - they control a current under the influence of another, usually much smaller current or voltage. The most basic type of transistor is the '''field effect transistor''' (FET), and as these are what is used in most kinds of '''integrated circuit''', they are also the most common.

An FET consists of a rod of doped semiconductor material (say, N-type) which is surrounded by a metal plate. The metal plate is insulated from the semiconductor and there is no P-N junction here. The metal plate is connected to the control terminal of the device or '''gate'''. The two ends of the rod (called the '''channel''') are connected to the '''source''' and the '''drain'''. A circuit is so arranged so that a current flows through the device from source to drain. Because the material is semiconducting, some current will flow even if the gate terminal is not connected.

If we connect up the gate so that we can change the voltage on it, the metal plate can accumulate charge, just like a capacitor. The charges on this plate can attract or repel the carriers in the channel. If carriers are repelled away from the gate, the channel increases in resistance, because fewer carriers can get through in the region of the repulsion. By changing the design of the gate, it will attract carriers, making available more carriers to carry the current, which will thus increase. So by changing the voltage on the gate, the resistance or conductance of the channel can be varied at will.

When a current is changed by the influence of a voltage, this is called '''transconductance'''. The word &quot;transistor&quot; was originally coined to mean a &quot;'''trans'''conducting res'''istor'''&quot;.

The type of FET we have just described is sometimes called an &quot;insulated gate&quot; FET or '''IGFET'''. It is the simplest kind. There are others, such as the Metal-Oxide Semiconductor FET ('''MOSFET'''), or the Junction FET or '''JFET''', but all operate on similar principles.

Historically, the FET was not the first kind of transistor that was invented, though the FET as described above works in a very similar fashion to the much older '''thermionic valve''' or tube. When transistors were first invented, the type that was made is known as a '''bipolar junction transistor'''. This is the kind usually meant by the unqualified term &quot;transistor&quot;. Junction transistors are more complicated than FETs however, which is why we explained the FET first.

===Bipolar Junction Transistors===

A Bipolar Junction Transistor or BJT consists of a three-layer sandwich of semiconductor material, arranged N-P-N or P-N-P. The central section is usually much narrower than the other two and is connected to a terminal called the '''base'''. The outer areas are connected to terminals called the '''collector''' and the '''emitter'''.

At first glance a BJT looks a bit like two diodes placed back-to-back, and indeed if one tests a BJT using a multimeter it may be treated as one when testing between the base and either of the other two terminals. However, its physical behaviour is not the same as two diodes back-to-back, because of the very close physical proximity of the two junctions. This is an important point to note to understand the working of a BJT.

In a circuit, a current flows from the collector to the emitter through the device. If the base terminal is not connected, in fact no current will flow because at least one of the internal junctions is reverse biased, so just like the diode, carriers are repelled away from the junction join to form an insulating depletion layer. Unlike the diode, this depletion layer is not altered by reversing the voltage across the device, but by injecting extra carriers via the base terminal.

If a small current is arranged to flow into the base terminal, it adds carriers to the depletion layer, making it narrower. This reduces its resistance and allows more current to flow across the junction from collector to emitter. This current can be very much greater than the current flowing the in the base, yet is proportional to it, thus the base current acts as a control for the collector-emitter current.

The ratio between the base current and the collector current is called the '''gain''' of the device (also called its '''beta'''), and could be 100 times or even more. Thus in one sense a transistor '''amplifies''' the signal - the much larger current changes in sympathy with the smaller base current. However this relationship is not linear - overall it follows a '''square law''' - the collector current varies in proportion to the square of the base current. However over limited ranges the output is more or less linear, and usually for amplification purposes a transistor is operated on this part of the curve. The fact that it is a curve is where '''distortion''' arises when amplifying music or other small signals.

= '''Getting Your Private Pilot License''' =

====About====
This wiki is put together in order to aid all of those out there who may be interested in the aviation field.  More will come, but at the moment I am more concerned with putting the very basics out there to get people interested in aviation.  Sections about aerodynamics, flight maneuvers, and other resources will follow.  The idea is to eventually create a '''free''' resource for training that may reduce the great burden that falls on the shoulders of every emerging student pilot.
----

==What, Why?==
The two greatest questions that may dissuade or entice people into flying are the questions &quot;what?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot;.

===What===
A '''Private Pilot Licence''' (or, in the [[w:United States]], a ''certificate'') permits the holder to operate an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aircraft]] under [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visual flight rules]]. In most countries, a private pilot possessing an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrument rating]] may also conduct flights under [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrument flight rules]]. Passengers may be carried and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight]] in furtherance of a business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot and must pay at least the pro rata share of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight]]'s expenses. Neither passengers nor cargo may be carried for hire.

For more information see:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States#Private_Pilot]]

===Why?===
People become pilots for many reasons.  You may do it to have a goal to work at.  You may do it because you need a way to commute to work faster.  You may do it because it is your life long dream.  Whatever the reason, aviation will become a way of life for you if you do.  You will not regret a single penny of the money you spend, or a single second of the time you labor.  It is one of the most satisfying feelings in the world to know you are a pilot.  I recomend it to anyone.

== Getting Started ==
It's not just as easy as jumping into the cockpit and fire-walling the throttle, there is some work for you to do first.

== What You'll Need To Do==
According to the FARs (Federal Aviation Regulations) there are some things you'll need to do to become a pilot.

1.  First you will need to be at least 17 years old at the time of certification.  If you are younger this does not disqualify you, it simply means that you will have to wait to get your license proper.

2.  You must be able to read, speak, and write in English.  It makes it hard to read all of those books on flying you'll need to read (we'll get to that later).

3.  Pass two knowledge tests.  One of them is written (on which you must score at least 70%), the other is practical.

==  What to Start With ==
Before you even try to spend your money on flying, try to get an introductory lesson at a lower price, or a ride in an airplane from a neighbor.  You want to know from the beginning if this is something you want to do.  After that, get all the information in written form you can.  The ASA FAR/AIM book is an excellent resource for all the regs, though Jeppesen's Private Pilot Manual, is a more readable form.  Buy both of these books, and read as much of them as you can.  Go in to the whole situation with as much knowledge as you can, and use that knowledge to supplement the practical training you will receive as a student.

== Choosing a Flight School ==
In aviation, there are two types of schools: the larger more corporate flight schools like Sportys or Big Bend Community College, and the smaller, part 61 (a reference to the regulations) flight schools, that typically are nothing much more that an instructor that calls his flight school his home business as well.  For your Private Pilot Certificate, a part 61 school will suffice, but if you want to work your way all the way up to the big airlines, you might as well start at a part 141 school (the larger one).  A part 61 school may be more hands on, and more personal than a part 141 school, but often times, you will find a welcome atmosphere at both.  The choice is yours.  Talk to graduates from your local schools, and see who they'd recommend.  Remember, pilots want safe pilots flying with them, and if they don't think a certain instructor trains competant pilots, heed their warnings, you want to be the very safest pilot in the air.

== Flight School For Dummies==

=== Follow Through ===
Remember during your training this one thing: &quot;I CAN DO IT.&quot;  Regardless of how tough it may seem along the way, you will always regret it if you decide half-way through that you did not have what it takes.  Your own drive is probably the greatest of your allies.
===Cost===
Flight school can cost alot.  From what I've seen, the average flight training costs about $5,000 dollars, though I know people who have gotten it for less than $4000.  Again, the quality of the training, and your own commitment are going to play a roll in this.  If you cannot afford to fly every day for a month, your price is going to increase due to the extra time it will take you to get back in the habit every week when you do fly.  The best and cheapest way to get your certificate is to do it all at once.  That way, you can feel your progress, and have a more intuitive grasp on how the plane flies.  This is crucial to the training of a successful pilot.

=Background=
==Aerodynamics==
Aerodynamics is the study of fluids in motion.  To be a competant pilot, you will need to know and understand aerodynamics intuitively, and also scientifically.

=Systems and Aircraft Componants=
In this segment I will cover the systems for a 1967 Cessna 150.  I choose this aircraft because it is a fairly common training aircraft, and it has fairly simple systems.  More complex aircraft will require more study when it comes to systems.

==Electrical==
==Flight Control Surfaces==


=In The Cockpit Basics=
The basic thing to remember in the cockpit is this: &quot;THINK!&quot;  Being impulsive will get you nowhere-in fact, it will get you killed - know what and how to do what ever needs to be done.  If you don't, ask someone.  They will be certain to help. 

=Take Off=
The basic point behind take off is simple.  Get the airplane in the air without crashing into anything!  There are a couple of standard ways to do this:
==Standard==
The standard way to take off is fairly simple.  Advance the throttle to full, and start off down the runway.  Once your speed has sufficiently built (this should be your Vy speed) you pull back slightly on the stick, and raise the nose gear off of the runway.  The airplane should, at this point, fly itself off the runway and into the air.  Keep the airspeed at that Vy speed until you have finished climbing.

I see that you have changed the external link back to an internal link. Do you intend to expand the article that it links to, so that it is more than a sentence with an external link? If so, then I will undelete the target page. But, if you don't, then you must understand, that under Wikibook's policy, pages that are not intended to become full sized instructional modules will be deleted.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mubasher. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mubasher~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEGOs LEGO] has created the [http://mindstorms.lego.com Robotics Invention System], which is essentially a LEGO set which may be used to build and prototype robot designs.

The main components provided are,
* 2 Motors
* 2 Touch sensors
* Light detector
* RCX (Robotic Command Explorer) controller

These can be used with Technic Lego such as cogs, axles, gears and other components to build reasonably complex systems.

== Interface ==
The robot interfaces to a PC through the RCX controller using either an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232 RS-232] serial port and cable, or an infrared (IR) transceiver connected to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus USB] port. The program can be executed through the connection in real time or downloaded to and stored on the RCX controller. Downloading and storing the program allows the robot to run autonomously without the need to be tethered to the computer.

== Programming and Software ==
Lego provide their own [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI GUI] Software  [http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/products/ris/rissoft.asp] to program the RCX controller. The versatility of the LEGO system, and the added sophistication you get with scripting languages has meant other people have developed their own programming languages to control the RCX, namely,
* [http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/ NQC] - Not quite C: A C derived scripting language.
* [http://lejos.sourceforge.net lejos] - Robots control in Java.

'''Corsets''' have a curious history. Western women of the upper class wore them for centuries. Women have protested the use of corsets, saying their restrictive nature is un-feminist. Still, people wear corsets to this day. This wikibook aims to provide information about the history, making and cultural significance of corsets. New contributors welcome!

It is not easy to make a '''list of corset periods''' because many types were in use at the same time. All corset makers had their own style, but from about [[1860]], the corset industry of Paris was at the forefront of corset fashion. Below is a list of periods in the history of the [[corset]].

==Before 1500==
It is unclear whether corsets existed before [[1500]], as information on them is unreliable.

Many books say that [[Crete|Cretan]] women used the corset c. [[2000 BC]] because they made idols in the shape of a corset. These idols were originally two round pots bottom to bottom, the handle on the top pot being the nose on the idols and the edge line of bottom to bottom being the waist of the idols. The shape of the idols was traditional for idols, not the shape of Cretan women. The detail of the idols tell us that the old [[Crete|Cretan]] idols wore big loincloths, and the later idols have a [[tunic]] of open lace and a loincloth. The corset-shaped figure of the idols was a primitive [[Crete|Cretan]] style.

Virgins from [[15th century]] sometimes wore a long tight lace outfit, but it was only a dress, not a corset.

==1500-1970==
In this period many different corsets were in fashion.
&lt;!-- Fixme: This table appears to be taken from the following page: http://www.askfactmaster.com/Corset_in_fashion which dates to 2004.

==Iron corset covers, about 1500==

[[Image:Marie_de_Medicis.png|thumb|100px|left|Marie de' Medici, in an iron corset cover. Note the broad padding at the neck.]] 
'''Iron corsets''' are [[Victorian Era]] [[corset]]covers made of [[metal]]. There are several in [[museum]] collections.  

It is sometimes claimed that these were the everyday wear of women and girls throughout [[Europe]] in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. But they are more likely to be [[orthopedic]] instruments used by a very few women whose posture was not considered acceptable by the health and beauty standards of the time. 

*It is likely that the Iron Corset was originally a type of armour worn only by men.
*The fact is as the &quot;iron corset&quot; was used both of men and women, but only on dress occasions. The iron was heavy, but the dress was also heavy, and the iron was padded underneath like armour. The silk of that time was very expensive but of poor quality and stretched poorly. It looked beautiful on the shining metal. The iron corset also worked as a [[bulletproof]] [[waistcoat]], because assassination by knife in heart was a common risk.
*The padded &quot;iron corset&quot; and armour was known as a corset on women, and a [[waistcoat]] (vest) on men.

In these images, you can see a man and woman in corset with iron cover, covered by silk.

==Stays, 1550? to about 1890==
'''Stays''' are an old type of [[corset]]. It is worn over the dress or skirt and is laced to the waist, as opposed to a more conventional [[corset]] which extends below the hips.  Typically stays were made by hand in [[1860]] or earlier in some countries.  Over time, stays became shorter and shorter, eventually evolving into an early form of brassiere.

A set of '''stays''' has a shoulder strap opposed to a [[waist cincher]].

==Victorian Corsets, 1831 - 1901==
[[Image:Perfect Health Corset.png|right|thumb|An advertisement from the 1890s]]
Most people have an idea of a &quot;Victorian [[corset]]&quot;; however, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Victorian era]] comprised a long period of changes in culture and fashion from 1837 to 1901.&amp;nbsp; During that time many styles of corsets were in use.&amp;nbsp; The most ubiquitous feature was the &quot;horizontal waist&quot; which was common from about 1850 to 1899.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;'''Victorian corsets'''&quot; for sale today are most likely [[New Look corset]]s.

==The S-curve corset (1900 - ?) and the Straight-fronted corset 1903 - 1912?==
[[Image:Corset_straightfront_1911_Louis_XV_style.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|Straight-front corset from 1911]]



The '''straight-front corset''' (also known as the '''swan-bill corset''' and the '''s-curve corset''') was a type of [[corset]] worn from the start of the [[nineteenth century]] until around [[1907]].&amp;nbsp; Its name is derived from the very rigid, straight [[busk]] that was used down the center of the front. 

It was the most complex shape of corset ever made, with high-quality corsets consisting of up to 48 intricately curved and shaped pieces.&amp;nbsp; The straight-front corset was intended to be less injurious to wearers' health than other corsets; but, when worn too tight, these corsets were the most uncomfortable and harmful style of corset to ever have been widely popular.&amp;nbsp; The silhouette given by the straight-front corset is familiar from the [[Gibson Girl]] of the period.

The straight-front corset was popularised by [[Inez Gaches-Sarraute]], a [[corsetier|corsetiere]] with a degree in medicine.&amp;nbsp; The style was probably the result of several like-minded corsetieres and medical professionals.&amp;nbsp; It was intended to create fewer health problems and to be less constricting than previous types of corsets.&amp;nbsp; The [[hourglass corset]] &quot;suppress[ed] the bust,&quot; and the [[spoon busk]], which often curved inwards for part of its length, &quot;forced the organs downwards&quot; claimed Gaches-Sarraute in her [[1900]] study ''Le Corset: Etude physiologique and pratique'' (''The Corset: A Physiological and Practical Study'').

Gaches-Sarraute suggested a corset that:
*freed the bust by starting below the breasts;
*supported, rather than constricted, the abdomen with a very rigid, straight busk and inflexible [[bone (corsetry)|boning]].

The first element was not problematic, although in order to create the '[[monobosom]]' effect that was fashionable women started wearing [[bust supporter]]s, the design of which eventually lead to the [[brassiere]].

The second feature created more problems, though.&amp;nbsp; When the straight-front corset was worn laced moderately tight, very little pressure was placed on the abdomen and some of the compression was transferred to the sides of the waist, where boning was lighter and more flexible.&amp;nbsp; However, because of the extreme rigidity at the front of the corset, it was possible to achieve greater reductions on waist size than with the hourglass corset.&amp;nbsp; When [[tightlacing|tightlaced]], the straight-front corset put a great deal of pressure on the lower abdomen.&amp;nbsp; This caused the S-curve silhouette: the wearer's hips were thrust back, giving a deep curve to her lower back, and her chest was thrust forward.&amp;nbsp; In most cases, tightlacing in a straight-front corset caused lower back pain, breathing difficulties, and knee problems (through [[hyperextension]]).&amp;nbsp; It has also been claimed that the pressure placed on the lower abdomen caused a [[prolapse|prolapsed uterus]], although this has not been proved.

*'''External link''':-
&lt;br&gt;[http://www.waspcreations.com/torso.htm Wasp Creations' page on corset shapes] has a very good section on the straight-front corset, including good diagrams.

==The Pipe-shape corsets, 1912 - 1928?==
[[Image:Usratent1214467_1913.gif|thumb|120px|left|Pipe-shape corset, [[1913]].]]
[[Image:Corset_spring1916.gif|thumb|80px|right|Danish, [[1916]].]] 

'''Pipe-shape''' was a name sometimes given to a type of [[corset]] in fashion from [[1908]] to [[1920]]. It helped to give the slender, straight silhouette that was a reaction to the exaggerated curves of the [[S-shape corset]].

The pipe-shape corset should not be confused with the [[pipe-stem waist]], which is sometimes found on other corsets, particularly the [[hourglass corset]].

==Nursing corsets==

In the age before formulas and pre-made baby food, most Victorian mothers breastfed their babies, or the rich had wet nurses. Nowadays, nursing bras are available. But then, overbust corsets were in fashion, so nursing corsets were needed.

==Maternity corsets==
[[Image:155Le_Peri-Corset_pour_femmes_enceintes.png|thumb|left|80px|Maternity corset 1904]]
At that time women used [[corset]]s. They had a problem during pregnancy because they needed a corset to support the back and the sides, and because pressure from the tight lacing thinned the abdominal wall. The solution was a '''Maternity corset'''.

: [[/Introduction/]]
Kinematics is the branch of physics dealing with the motion of particles or bodies. It defines movement at the level of position, velocity and acceleration, without incorporating masses and forces.
: [[/Prerequisites/]]
A proper study of the subject requires an understanding of 2D and 3D vectors. Of course you also need to review basic algebra, trigonometry and calculus. A proper understanding of kinematics require an understanding of vector calculus too.

== Two Dimensional Kinematics==
===Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration===
''Displacement'' is the change in position with respect to the ''frame of reference''.  In the case of a car moving on a road, the displacement is the change in position with respect to the road.   This is important because the Earth itself is rotating and orbiting at considerable speed, which you do not notice due to [[inertia]].  Since omnipotence is not possible, all observations are made from a specific frame of reference.  Displacement is usually expressed as a length measurement.
''Velocity'' is the change in displacement with respect to a change in time.  The velocity of an object is again relative to the frame of reference.
''Acceleration'' is the change in velocity with respect to a change in time.  
Therefore, we know that, for functions for displacement, velocity, and acceleration, respectively d, v, t :
:&lt;math&gt;	d(t)=\int_0^t v(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;	v(t)=\frac{dd}{dt}=\int_0^t a(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;	a(t)=\frac{dv}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

===Kinematics Formulas===
Using the above can create the basic kinematics formulas(subject to acceleration being constant):
:&lt;math&gt;x=x_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v=v_0+at&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v^2=v_0^2+2ax&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications of Kinematics==
===Motion===
Motion is by far the simplest application of Kinematics, and uses the formulas with no adaptation.  
====Example 1====
===Gravity and Falling Objects===
Gravity affects most all earthly motion, and therefore is discussed first.  Gravity pulls all objects the same distance from the earth with equal acceleration, regardless of mass, as discovered by Galileo in his famous test on the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  In this section we will assume that friction and air resistance are negligible.  
The Gravitational constant, 'g', is the is equal to 9.8ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is the acceleration done by the earth's gravity at sea level.  Therefore, a falling object fall accelerating at rate g.  When using this with the Kinematics formulas, g replaces a.  
====Example 1====
Show that the force (F) of a body is directly proportional to its momentum

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cormoran and his wife Cormelian were a pair of said to have created St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. According to the legend, in ancient times St Michaels Mount was six miles inland and surrounded by woodland. The giant Comoran live in the area and decided to build himself a fortified home and raise it high above the trees so that he could see for miles around and in doing so created the mount.

He choose only the finest white granite from the local area which his wife would carry to the mount in her apron. One day, though, she decided to use the lighter, more abundant green stone instead. So whilst Cormoran was asleep she placed a boulder of greenstone in her apron, hoping to hide it beneath the rest. Unfortunately Cormoran awoke and seeing what she was doing kicked her so hard that he sent her flying through the air. The greenstone became buried deep into the sand and could not be moved. The stone became known as Chapel rock.

After years of terrosing the area, the local people decided to rid themselves of Cormoran. They offered a reward to anyone who could slay the giant. A farmer's son named Jack took up the challenge and deciced to trick the giant into a vulnerable position. He dug a huge pit and covered it with saplings, leaves and straw. When the pit was ready he called the giant down from the mount by blowing his horn. Cormoran rushed down and fell straight into the trap. Jack struck the giant a fatal blow to the head with his pick. The local people were delighted and awarded Jack with a sword engraved with his name. He hence became known as Jack the Giant Killer.

- '''Variables, Equations, Polynomials and Systems'''

  A &lt;b&gt;variable&lt;/b&gt; is a mathematical term represented by letters that can have varying values. If independent, the variable depends on no other variable(s). If dependent, the variable depends on other variable(s).


Imagine we are describing the location of a car.  We could use two variables, x and y,
to give its location in terms of longitude (x) and latitude (y).  If we want to see how
the car moves over the course of a day, we can include a variable for time, t.  Then,
measuring the longitude and latitude of the car over the day, we can express the position
at a given time, x(t) and y(t).  Here x and y depend on t, and thus are dependent variables.
Time continues on its merry way, independent of any other variable.


  An &lt;b&gt;equation&lt;/b&gt; is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions to be the same, equal, to each other.

  A &lt;b&gt;linear&lt;/b&gt; equation is one in which the only power of the variable(s) is 1.

  A &lt;b&gt;homogeneous&lt;/b&gt; equation is one in which all variables of the same type {dependent, independent} are on one side of the equation whereas the other side is 0.


For example, x = 3 would mean that x is equal to, or x is, 3.
x = y would mean that x is equal to y, or x is, y.
A re-arrangement, x - y = 0, is an equation that is both homogeneous and linear.
Whenever two expressions are equal, one may be directly substituted for the other in an equation.


  An equation may be solved for a certain variable by means of manipulations conforming to the following laws:
  Where k and c are constants,
  If x - k = c, x = c + k
  If x + k = c, k = c - k
  If kx = c, x = c/k
  If x/k = c, x = kc


The general rule to remember is that you perform the reverse operation on the other side of the equation.

An example is 5x + 3 = 96, you would first move 3 to the other side, using +'s reverse operator -:
5x = 96 - 3 = 93

And then divide by 5, using the reverse operator of multiplication, division:
x = 93/5

  A system is a set of equations containing 2 or more variables that have 1 solution, no solutions, or an infinite set of solutions.

The equations:
x + y = 5
2x + 3y = 2
form a system of linear equations; solving them is a matter of using a substitution. (Though this is not the only method of solving them, other methods are beyond the scope of this book)

For example, let's use the substitution that y = 5 - x (From the first equation), we can then do the following:
2x + 3y = 2
2x + 3(5 - x) = 2

Expanding the bracket, by multiplying everything inside it by 3, yields:
2x + 15 - 3x = 2
-x + 15 = 2
-x = -13
x = 13

You now have one variable's solution; finding y's solution is using the initial substitution:
y = 5 - x = 5 - 13 = -8
You now have the solution set (13, -8)

To be continued...

== Killing your Chickens Humanely by Dr. Hershel E. Grafton ==

=== Preparing the Chicken for Slaughter ===

Birds that are to be slaughtered should be taken off feed long enough before killing (about 12 hrs.) to allow the crop and intestinal tract time to empty. A full digestive system increases the chance of contamination of the carcass during removal of the viscera. Birds should be caught and placed in crates or coops during the night to avoid excitement and possible injury of the birds prior to slaughter.

=== Slaughter Procedure ===

In slaughtering, birds are positioned with their heads down to facilitate bleeding. This can be accomplished through the use of killing cones, shackles, or a rope around the feet.

After the bird is properly positioned the killing and bleeding step follows. Several important factors must be kept in mind; the bird must be killed in such a way to allow most of the blood to drain from the body and at the same time limit struggling to prevent damage to the corpse.

A widely used method that accomplishes these objectives is making a cut just behind the jaw. The cut should sever the jugular vein without cutting the esophagus or wind pipe. A weight can then be hung from the beak to limit the movement of the bird. This is a more 'humane' method of slaughter because the bird is unconscious due to loss of blood from the brain.

Any method which involves beheading or wringing the neck accomplishes the killing but fails to produce a properly bled carcass. The heart stops when the spinal cord is severed.

The optimal, most humane procedure is to &quot;debrain&quot; the chicken *before* beginning the bleeding. The procedure: 1) Put the bird into a &quot;killing cone&quot; - breast forward - to secure it so it won't panic; 2) locate the slit in the roof of the mouth and insert a small bladed knife (commercially available: called a &quot;chicken killing sticking knife&quot;) at a slight angle; 3) Push the knife point toward the back of the brain, with the handle approximately parallel to the upper beak; 4) Once inserted, twist the knife to destroy as much brain tissue as possible.  This procedure takes less than a second and once complete the bird is &quot;brain dead&quot; and unconscious but the heart is still beating.  When you cut the jugular the heart will pump the blood out of the bird killing it.

== Processing your dead chickens to be eaten ==

=== Plucking feathers ===
====Scalding====

Scalding involves submerging the carcass in hot water to relax the muscles holding the feathers. For small groups of birds a large bucket can work well. For larger numbers of birds a thermostatically controlled heated tank may be best. For birds that are difficult to scald (waterfowl, in particular) a wetting agent or detergent may need to be added to the water.

Scalding temperatures should be determined by the type of poultry and the difficulty of picking. For waterfowl and mature birds a higher temperature and longer submersion time should be used. For younger birds a lower temperature and shorter time is recommended.

Semi-scald or slack scald is the name given to scalding for 30-60 seconds in 125-130 degrees F. water. By using this time and temperature the epidermal layer is left intact. Birds that are being slaughtered for an exhibit should be scalded in this way to improve the appearance of the carcass. Water that is too hot will cause the outer layer of skin to loosen and be lost. Loss of that skin also results in loss of some yellow pigment on the skin.

Sub-scald is the use of water at 138-140 degrees F. for 30-75 seconds. The epidermal layer is broken down by this time-temperature combination but the feathers are usually much easier to remove. For home processing this method of scalding is recommended.

Hard-scald or full scald requires a water temperature of 140-150 degrees F. This method is faster and eliminates pinfeathers, but the birds tend to dry out and have a less desirable appearance. Waterfowl may be scalded at this temperature.

Whatever method is used the birds must be properly bled. No scalding should be done before all movement has stopped.

====Feather Removal====

Birds should be plucked immediately after scalding. If mechanical pickers are used they should be adjusted for the size birds being picked. Mechanical pickers make the job much faster. Birds that are to be exhibited should be plucked by hand being sure that all pinfeathers are removed, and that there is no damage to the skin. This procedure requires a good deal of time if done correctly. Rubbing the feathers from the skin is frequently more effective than a picking motion.

=== Evisceration ===

Evisceration involves the removal of the contents of the body cavity plus the feet and head. To remove the head, cut around the neck just behind the head, and twist. The neck skin should then be split down the back and a second cut made at the base of the neck. A twist will usually separate the neck from the body. Next the oesophagus, trachea and crop should be separated from the neck skin. They can be left attached and be pulled from the body with the viscera.

The body cavity can be opened by making a small cut near the vent, extending the cut around the vent, being careful not to cut the intestine or contaminate the carcass with faecal material. 

The abdominal opening should be as small as possible to improve the appearance of the finished product. After the abdomen is open the viscera can be removed through the opening. It is very important to remove all the viscera, including the lungs which are attached to the back. After all the contents of the cavity are removed the bird should be thoroughly washed inside and out.

After the viscera have been removed, the heart, liver and gizzard should be separated and saved. The ends of any parts of the vascular system that may be attached to the heart should be removed by trimming off the top to expose the chambers. The heart should be washed and squeezed to force out any remaining blood. The green gall bladder should be carefully trimmed away from the liver. Next the gizzard should be split lengthwise and the contents washed away. The lining should then be peeled away from the rest of the gizzard.

After the evisceration procedure has been completed, the carcass should be cooled as soon as possible. Ice water or a refrigerator can be used, however, the ice water will do the job a little faster. If birds are to be frozen the gizzard, heart and liver can be wrapped in waxed paper and placed inside the body cavity. Many people also include a small packet of nutmeg to improve taste during storage. The birds can then be placed in a moisture‑vapor proof bag and frozen.

== Cooking your Chickens ==
Preheat oven to {{#invoke:temperature|f|350}}.  Pluck all feathers (because they taste bad).  Place chicken and marinating sauce/condiments into an oven-safe container.  Place oven-safe container into oven.  Close oven.  Wait about an hour or until golden-brown.  Enjoy!

There are also lots of [[:Category:Chicken recipes| recipes]] for cooking chickens. There are also chicken recipes in the [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes#Chicken_and_Turkey|Wikibooks Cookbook ]].

Go ahead and experiment.  If you are looking for a method of preparing chicken for the table but can't find what you are looking for in Wikibooks there are lots of other websites on the Internet as well as traditional cookbooks.

== Recommend a Breed ==
What varieties of chickens work for you?
Production Reds.  They are related to the Rhode Island Red.  Mine were very tame and gave me lots of eggs every morning.

My chickens are a cross between Ida Red (Rhode Island red type) and Cornish Giant (big white meat bird).  They are very tame and very winter resistant.  They seen to prefer sub-zero temperatures (which is strange considering their jungle heritage)[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 05:05, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

Bantams are pretty and tough but can be flighty.  Hard to keep in a pen.  Not great layers and their eggs are tiny.  Two very good layer types are Silkies and Pekins. Come in a wide variety of types and colours.  

Purebred meat chickens are prone to heart attacks and choking on their own feed. 

Leghorns are good layers but flighty and scrawny. 

Some of the more unusual breeds are in need of people to keep them so that the breeds can survive.[[User:204.101.233.86|204.101.233.86]] 07:39, 14 January 2006 (UTC) 


I had a silkie/cochin bantam cross once. She was an absolutely wonderful bird who never clawed, bit, or hurt anyone. She also did well at the county fair's crossbred bantam class (reserve over all at only 4 months old) She died recently due to encephalomyelitis, and I now have a purebred blue cochin pullet who is just as sweet. She loves to sit on my head/shoulders and will fall asleep in my lap with her head resting on my arm. I have leghorns too, but they're high strung and rather ugly. I would recommend cochins or cochin crosses, as they have impeccable manners, are amazingly sweet, and will get you noticed in poultry exhibitions.



I have some Barred Plymouth Rocks, and they lay nearly every day in the summer, get to a good, healthy weight, are pretty, and not at all vicious. 
I also have a dozen Americauna's, and they are beautiful! Their feathers are colored in some ways like a falcon's; golden and dark feathers. Some of them also have a very curved beak that looks almost identical to a falcons, while others are not quite so curved and pointed. While they are beautiful chickens, and don't mind the cold(at least down to -20 F. here) they do not lay as well as our other chickens(In the summer it averages probably 3/4 egg/day). But also, the eggs they do lay are a nice light green/blue color. Quite pretty...

The leghorns Ive had usually are mean. Bantams seem to be much bettor. They have interesting feathers and tend to be very hardy. However they seem to hate being cooped up. Bantam/Leghorn cross seem to be good layers but only if totally domestic. However mine, as they aged, got mean and started pecking. However they were not as inclined to roam because they put on weight as they aged so i didn't need to worry about them going too far and meeting neighbors german shepard

I have had good experiences with orphingtons, (idk how to spell, correct it please) they are friendlt, chatty, and adorable and beautiful against a lush green lawn.


Am new to raising chickens but have read a lot, and seemed to have lucked into a good mix for my flock. I have a Barred Plymouth Rock (barred rock) Rooster who is friendly and very handsome. 2 Barred rock hens, 2 Golden Comet hens ( rhode island red / leghorn cross) who are very friendly and let you pet them, 4 rhode island red hens who are a little shy yet, as well as 4 Black Star hens (barred rock/rhode isle red cross). They will flock to you to see if you have any treats. All seem to be good egg layers as I am collecting 8-10 eggs a day. I bought all of mine as adults.

== Problem breeds ==
Have you had problems with a particular breed and want to warn others? 

I wouldn't recommend leghorns for first-time or timid owners. They're great layers, and mine do well at local shows, but they tend to try to eat me alive when I feed them. I sold my rooster about a year ago. Even though he had been handled his whole life, he was terribly vicious and once took a large chunk out of my face. His daughter was kept ONLY with people (no other chickens) for the first 2 weeks of her life before I bought her a companion. She was handled extensively, but still bites....like father, like daughter.

Same here. also they tend to not have very much sense and are extremely alpha bird-omega bird. And in my experiance do not allow domestic leghorns and half wild part bantams to mix. The alpha female bantam cross actually fought with the leghorn roosters every time they met and every time they one. Then the roosters would respond by taking it out on the hens which seriously affected their egg producing.</text>

'''Bookshelves''', which, like our category system, serves to organize wikibooks along topical lines.  

== Bookshelves and Categories ==
The bookshelf and category systems complement each other.  As a rule, bookshelves should not contain other bookshelves, unlike categories.  

== Adding Books ==
To add a book to a bookshelf, simply add a link to the book's title page to the appropriate bookshelf, along with [[Help:Development stages|an indicator of development]].  A book may be placed along more than one bookshelf.

== Removing Books ==
A book can only be removed from a bookshelf if it is deleted altogether, in accordance to the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|deletion policy]].  Once a book is deleted, its entry should be removed from the bookshelf in question.  However, books can be moved between bookshelves, in which case the entry should be moved to the appropriate destination bookshelf.

== Why shelve books? ==
Bookshelves encourage the development of existing books over adding new books, especially [[WB:FP|forks of existing books]].

== Bookshelf management ==
Bookshelves should only be created if existing bookshelves are in excess of material and a significant number of books can belong on the new bookshelf.  Likewise, bookshelves should only be removed if the bookshelf is on material that is considered too specific in scope and a very few number of books on the new bookshelf.  Proposals on adding or removing bookshelves should be made at {{bad link|Wikibooks:Bookshelf requests}}.

== List of bookshelves ==
See [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]]

== Sudden Death from Heart Attack ==
This is uncommon for chickens, but if it does happen, there is nothing you can do. it will not &quot;spread through the flock&quot;. There are a few rumors about it. But try to pull yourself together and move on.

== Predation ==
In the UK, and many other countries, foxes pose a major threat to chicken stocks. Also, many of the larger birds of prey have been known to attack live chickens.

Known Chicken/Egg Eaters

*Skunks (also eat eggs)
*Weasels and mink (can go into killing frenzy and devastate a flock in a single night)
*Hedgehogs
*Bobcats
*Coyotes
*Foxes (can take one bird at a time over a long period of time)
*Dogs 
*Cats (usually small chicks only)
*Hawks
*Peregrine Falcons
*Owls
*Magpies and crows (mostly eggs and young chicks)
*Humans
*In South America there is a type of spider that will prey on chickens
*Oppossum (will eat the head and guts)
*Raccoons

== Disposal of Bodies (legally) when your chickens die from &quot;unusual&quot; causes==
In the UK, there is a legal requirement that you have your birds incinerated by DEFRA. However, this law is usually ignored by small poultry producers. Birds may be buried, incinerated or thrown out with the rubbish. However, if your chicken died of disease then it is imperative that you do not feed it to any other animal, due to the risk of a disease being passed on.

== Other ==
If you want to butcher your own chickens then go to the [[Raising_Chickens/Death/Butchering|Butchering Chickens]] section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darwin begins by discussing how individual humans differ from each other in height, skull shape, teeth, artery courses, musculature, and internal organs. He also mentions that humans and monkeys alike differ in intelligence, and he touches on the work of Galton and the inheritance of genius.

He then discusses work that has been done to explain the causes for these differences within species. In the paragraphs on '''changed conditions''', Darwin quotes an ancient Greek poem decrying the fact that human marriage arrangements were not made with the same concern for the offspring that farmers had for the breeding of their livestock. He can think of only two historic instances of selective human breeding, the Prussian grenadiers and the Spartans.

'''External conditions''' like climate and terrain had inconclusive results except for diet. He says that even though diet obviously plays some part in determining the height or weight of an individual, that is not the whole story.

The paragraphs on the '''use and disuse of body parts''' as a reason for differences in arm lengths, hand size, etc. include some ideas modern people would see as strange. He describes microcephalics and attributes the cause of this condition to '''arrests of development'''.

Another paragraph discusses cases of women with additional mammaries and double uteruses which Darwin attributes to '''reversion''', inheriting traits from lower animals. He relates anecdotes of people with extra fingers and toes and mentions some sources, but finally concludes that this is not due to reversion. He then goes on to discuss various scientists who had noticed the similarity between human canine teeth and those of apes. He concludes that the connection is clear no matter how much some men might object even as they &quot;retract...'snarling muscles'...so as to expose them [canines] ready for action, like a dog prepared to fight.&quot; Darwin cites cases published by other scientists showing humans with muscles similar to apes and concludes there is a &quot;genetic connection&quot; between the species (although he didnt use the word genetic because the term 'genetic' was coined by William Bateson in 1905.

Under '''variations''' Darwin discusses questions about whether one feature like arm muscles is affected by another feature like leg muscles. He calls this correlated variation and mentions other possible examples like sight related to hearing. He also mentions spontaneous variation.

The events that affect a population's rate of increase like space, food, and disease are also mentioned as reasons for differences between species. He proposes that increase in fertility may be inherited and discusses Malthus's description of the &quot;checks&quot; to the &quot;savage&quot; populations.

Again this chapter is heavily footnoted showing that Darwin was well-aware of the science of his day.

== Comments ==
This page is somewhat misleading, since many, if not most, verbs in Japanese are punctual, and when combined with いる do not form the progressive tense.  For example, 行っている means &quot;to be in the state of having gone&quot; not &quot;to currently be going&quot;.'
: I've made note of this.  There are other things missing from the page, too.  However, your point is well noted. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 06:44, 11 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

Comments:

:Personally, I think that books on different languages that are comprehensive and can really help a person learn a new language should be top priority. This allows readers and contributors to read and contribute even more to Wikipedia. If we could have a truly comprehensive source of knowledge in not only English, but Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, etc. then this would make wikipedia a legendary source of knowledge. Wikibooks like this one could open that possibility to thousands more people.

:I am personally interested in learning a few languages, Chinese being one of them (it is the most commonly spoken language in the world, 1/5 of the world's population speaks it). I've looked at this wikibook, and it presents a model that other similar wikibooks should follow. This book gets my vote. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 02:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

Note that even Jimbo has [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2004-November/026406.html talked of] having policies disallowing forks within Wikibooks, which is one reason I'm hopeful of the two books getting merged some day. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:27, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

** While this argument could be offered in a number of ways (for not calling this strictly a Wikibook), the use of '''Programming''' in this instance is more indicating a bookshelf than a book.  I suport calling this a Book of the Month candidate as it is really a seperate Wikibook.  Naming conventions are something that needs to be dealt with elsewhere (like [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge|Staff Lounge]]). --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:10, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

'''Neuroscience''' (known archaically as psychobiology) is a relatively new scientific discipline.  It arose from the merging of biology and psychology.  As its name suggests, the discipline seeks to understand the biological bases of behaviour.

== Understanding the Central Nervous System ==

The central nervous system is composed of seven main parts.  1. the spinal cord; 2. the medulla oblongata; 3. the pons; 4. the cerebellum; 5. the midbrain; 6. the diencephalon ; and 7. the cerebral hemispheres

The nerve cells in the central nervous system are called neurons.  The neuron has four main parts.  
# the soma (or cell body)
# the dendrites
# the axon
# the terminal buttons 

The messages are received by the dendrites, processed in the cell body, then sent down the axon to the terminal buttons.  Messages may be excited or inhibited and are known as action potentials.

The [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]] for '''August''' is '''[[How To Build A Computer]]'''.

'''[[How To Build A Computer]]''' teaches you how to build your own computer, starting from choosing the right parts, assembling them, and choosing and installing the right software. You can learn more about computer hardware by building a computer than you can by reading every computer hardware textbook ever written. Aside from that, you get a totally personalized computer that no OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) could match, and the opportunity to save a lot of money in the process.

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

==Nominations==

=== [[Raising Chickens]] ===

This book is nearly done but could still use some work.  It also has sections that are intended as ongoing projects.

#[[User:jsymmetry|jsymmetry]]

Comments:

*This is a very good start, but having raised chickens before, I can say that this book is definitely ''not'' almost done. The format is well layed-out, but it needs a lot of additional information. I'll do my best to help out when I get a chance. [[User:Jsymmetry|Jsymmetry]] 23:42, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Biotechnology]] ===
Comments:
Could use some help on this project some images and formating.  So far I am the only person working on this and would like other to share knowledge too.
#[[User:tmaioli|tmaioli]]  [[User:Tmaioli|Tom Maioli]] 02:57, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] ===
This Wikibook needs some formatting work done to meet Wikijunior Solar Sytem Standards.  This is also the first Wikijunior book to be nominated for collaboration of the month.

Comments:

Unless someone else votes this is going to be a unique instance.  A book winning with less than three votes. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:06, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Art History]] (3, 05:18, 24. Mai 2005) ===
This Wikibook is nearly empty, and could easily be collaborated on with hundreds of online sources. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 10:25, August 1, 2005 (UTC)

=== [[German|German language]] (3, 01:32, 14. Okt 2003)  ===
This language-related Wikibook has got high potential, because it contains many very good lessons. It can be also used as a base for new language books. It needs some impovements and new lessons. [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 10:55, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sarken. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sarken~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Median Description:'''
The median is the value found in the middle of an ordered set of data.  

'''Median Formula:'''
&lt;math&gt;(n + 1) / 2&lt;/math&gt;
(remembering the data must be ordered)

'''Median Example:'''
Let's say we have the following numbers:
 Data Set: 1,5,3,9,8
 Ordered: 1,3,5,8,9
 Formula: (5 [n] + 1) / 2 = 3
Therefore, the third value in the sample, 5, is the median.

If there are an even number of values in our sample then we simply find the two values either side of the formula result and average them.  For example,
 Data set: 1,5,3,9,8,4
 Ordered: 1,3,4,5,8,9
 Formula: (6 [n] + 1) / 2 = 3.5
Therefore, the simple average of the third and fourth value, 4 &amp; 5, is our median = 4.5

The best thing about the median is it is unaffected by extreme outliers.  For example, using the Bill Gates example from the previous section, the median will ignore Bill's earnings giving a 'truer' indication of the central value within a dataset.

'''Additional Notes:'''
Values in the dataset can be duplicated, they don't need to be unique - all calculated the same way.

[[Image:Egypte louvre 223 femme.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of the Egyptian use of frontalism.]]

As far as we know, civilization first began in the Mesopotamian river valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates in present day Iraq. Soon thereafter, it took root in the valley and delta of the Nile. The ancient Egyptian civilization was one of the longest lasting in the West. It began in approximately 3000 B.C and lasted until 300 B.C. When it came to their art, the Egyptians had a distinguished style known as '''frontalism'''.  

The features of frontalism are as follows:

* In reliefs and paintings, the head of the character is drawn in profile while the body faces frontward
* The eyes are drawn in full (even though the face is in profile)
* The legs are turned to the side with one foot in front of the other
* All of the figures, in all media, are rigid and stiff, yet the faces are calm or no expression

Although frontalism applies to the Egyptian art through thousands of years, there were slightly different rules for animals or slaves.  

=== The Timeline of Egyptian Art===

'''The Predynastic Period''' lasted from about 5000-3100 B.C. which was before Egypt became a kingdom.  Many of the characteristics of their culture and art as we know it did begin during this time period.  

* The pantheon of the gods was established during this time period
* The illustrations and proportions of their human figures was developed
* Egyptian imagery, symbolism, and basic hieroglyphic writing was developed


The '''Early Dynastic Period''' lasted from about 3100 - 2686 B.C., which is also known as the 1st and 2nd Dynasties.  During this time, the Egyptian government was strong and supported their arts.  

During the ''Old Kingdom'' - from 2686-2181 B.C., the Egyptian pyramids were built.  Sculptures that appeared more natural were built.  The first known portraits were done.  It is at the end of the Old Kingdom when the Egyptian style made a shift toward formalized nude figures with long bodies and large eyes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Tools =
In this section we will describe the tools that will be needed both to create forge and anvil and for the initial projects. More tools and more specific tools may be required for later projects. This section will concern itself with the basics to get up and running.

This list is not exhaustive or exclusive. If you have additional tools or the means to acquire them by all means use them.

If you would like more information on the tools listed check out [[w:Metalworking|Metalworking]] for links to descriptions of metal working tools.

== Digging Tools ==
This is minimal and can be satisfied with a trowel, shovel, garden pick -- basically enough of a tool to dig a hole roughly 8&quot; in diameter and 8&quot; deep.

== Hammers ==
This is the one tool that you will likely want to buy, new if you can't find used. We recommend a two- to three-pound (roughly 1kg) cross peen or ball peen &quot;blacksmith's&quot; hammer. If you have a choice between going lighter or heavier go lighter, but keep it over 1.5 pounds. Some works claim that the &quot;standard&quot; blacksmith's hammer was 4 lbs.In the 9th century. Maybe so, but you will find, especially if you are new to this kind of work, that a 2 or 3 pound hammer will feel quite heavy enough after about 20 minutes of work.

There are four hammer styles typically found in the U.S. --  ''cross-peen'', ''ball-peen'', ''&quot;engineers&quot;'' and ''&quot;claw&quot;'' -- the first three will be most useful for our purposes. To get started you only need one.[[File:Peen hammers.png|Peen hammers]]
* [[w: cross-peen hammer|cross-peen hammer]] (C) -- this style is most commonly associated with the blacksmith's trade. It has a fairly large diameter face, opposite the face is the peen which will look like a narrow face running perpendicular to the axis of the hammer handle. The face and peen are, typically, hardened.  The straight-peen (B) and diagonal-peen variants are less common, but equally suitable for our purposes.
* [[w: ball-peen hammer|ball-peen hammer]] (A)-- typically the faces of these have a slightly smaller diameter and they are quickly recognized by the relatively ball shaped peen opposite the face. Generally these are easier to come by and come in lighter weights than cross peen hammers. Some refer to these as &quot;engineer's hammers&quot;. We aren't here to argue jargon. If it's got the right shape it doesn't matter what it's called.[[File:Ball-peen hammer 380mm.JPG|Ball-peen hammer 380mm]]
* engineer's hammer -- these will look a bit like a cross peen hammer but with two faces (or the cross peen looks like an engineer's hammer with one face and a peen, depending on how you choose to look at it) and generally they come a bit heavier than cross-peens or ball-peens if acquired commercially. Again, some call a ball-peen hammer an &quot;engineer's hammer&quot;, and again we won't argue the jargon. Others may call them &quot;hand sledges&quot;. Engineer's hammers tend to have softer faces, because these hand sledges are designed for striking cold metal. What this means for us is that you can do forge work with an engineer's hammer but the face will deform more easily. If you have a choice between an engineer's hammer and a ball or cross peen we recommend that you start with the ball or cross peen if it's in good condition ... by the time you know enough to argue with us you'll probably understand why we suggest this. Eventually you will want one specifically either for the greater weight, to spare the face of the &quot;good&quot; blacksmith's hammer when striking  tools like cold chisels or simply because you like the heft of it for some work. 
* claw hammer -- this is the typical &quot;carpenter's&quot; or &quot;framing&quot; hammer. We don't recommend using one of these unless it is all that is available. A claw hammer will work, but the face tends to be smaller and the weight lighter and both combine to make more work out of the task. Again, if it's what you have, go for it with a claw hammer.

Sources for hammers:
* If you have the cash it might be worth the time savings to go to a blacksmith supply store like Pieh Tool Company or Blacksmith Supply to buy your first hammer. Hardware or automotive supply stores do carry lesser grade hammers, depending on how much forging you'll be doing. Look for a hammer in the 2-3 lb range. It is more important that the hammer have a smooth, slightly domed face than whether it is ball or cross peen. Ball-peens tend to have flatter faces.
* flea markets and rummage sales -- we prefer the latter simply because it's usually a better bargain. If you've got some facility with tools already this can be a great source. Often there seems to be the odd box of metal junk in the corner that can be had for a few dollars. In the junk are usually a hammer head or two and often with a decent handle intact.

== Locking Pliers ==
[[Image:Smith-gripper hg.jpg|left|thumb|Real tongs]]&quot;Vice grips&quot; is the brand name. There are other brands available. While these might not be absolutely necessary, they come in very handy, especially until you have developed the skills to make your own tongs. 

Get at least one pair of heavy locking pliers. They'll serve a number of uses around your forge in the various projects we'll be taking on.

Also, some blacksmith's tongs are available if you don't want to make your own.  Scout garage sales and the like for tools that can be used as tongs; nippers, pliers, shears, etc. can often be adapted, even when rusty or worn down past the point of utility in their original role.  You'll learn to bend these to your will, adapting them for the particular job at hand.

== Anvil ==
[[Image:Amboß klein.jpg|left|thumb|A real anvil]]
Our &quot;standard&quot; anvil for this book is a 6&quot; x 6&quot; x 36&quot; section of mild steel found as scrap or purchased from a steel yard.

This can be used either lying on the ground or set upright in a bucket of concrete to give it a base.

This will likely be your most expensive purchase if you have to buy it. Scrap steel prices vary, but the last time one of the authors bought such a piece of stock, scrap steel was selling at $1.50/pound. The &quot;anvil&quot; cost about $80.

There are alternatives. In an industrialized country pieces of metal like that or similar can be &quot;scrounged&quot;. 

Additionally other pieces, smaller, of different shapes can be found and cost less. Do some checking and looking before you call up the local steel yard and ask them to cut three feet off the end of a steel beam. 

It is worth it too to look around and price real anvils. If you have no luck scrounging and can afford it a small, decent anvil is well worth the investment, esp. if you find you have a new hobby. A 25 to 50 lb. anvil is more than adequate for a great deal of work and can be found for under $200.

There are available inexpensive imported &quot;anvil shaped objects&quot;, which can be useful, provided one doesn't mistake them for an actual anvil.  They are prone to numerous defects, including being too soft, too brittle, peculiar shapes, and painted or rough surfaces.  If you can afford a decent anvil, don't even think about these.  They do have potential as accessories or alternatives to homemade anvils.

Steel plate also works. One author has used a 2&quot; by 12&quot; x 12&quot; steel plate. It isn't as lively as his anvil, but it works adequately.

A section of railroad rail makes a good, if smallish, anvil.  If you can find someone to make cuts, you can put a horn on one end and undercut the other to make a table.  Avoid grinding off the top surface; it's probably already smooth and work-hardened for you.

Others may prefer to use a flat sided dumbbell weight.  The advantage is that its flat sides are good for flattening and tapering, while the round portion in the middle is a suitable horn.  

Machine parts can be found as well that will serve the purpose.

[[Image:Amboss und Werkzeuge Schmied.JPG|left|thumb|A better anvil]]Not only is it larger, but it has a hardy hole and a pritchel hole; it's even mounted at a good height to use without bending over.

== Vacuum Cleaner ==
[[Image:Blacksmith's_bellows.JPG|left|thumb|A real bellows]]The vacuum cleaner will serve as the bellows for our Down'n'dirty forge.

Get one that has a &quot;blower&quot; hole that the hose can be connected too. Ideally one with a metal end on the hose. 

Truthfully, this will provide much more air flow than you really need. It's almost overkill and this is one of the first things you will probably want to find an alternative for if you elect to pursue blacksmithing beyond the basics we outline here.

Despite the problems with vacuum cleaners one of the authors has done a lot of good work with an old Hoover vacuum cleaner that was acquired at a rummage sale for $2. He tends to &quot;blip&quot; the vacuum cleaner. Which is to say that he has the vacuum cleaner positioned so that the switch is in easy reach while he is at the forge and will run it for just a second or two and shut it off, repeating as necessary to bring the fire and the metal in it to heat. Periodically he'll run it for longer without metal in the fire to get the fire to a point where it is burning well and then will let the metal soak in the now hot fire without any air flow.

Another possibility for controlling the airflow with a vacuum is to put a galvanized valve between your forge and vacuum thus giving you the ability to decrease or increase air flow as needed.

Alternatives to a vacuum cleaner:

The &quot;gun&quot; style hair dryers also work for this purpose. If the one you find doesn't have switch settings that allow the dryer to run without heat, get creative and disable the heating element yourself: the heat is unnecessary.

Small fans might work as well with some kind of funnel fastened to the &quot;blow&quot; side to direct the air flow into the pipe.

Finally, if you have access to the &quot;real thing&quot; there are mechanical blowers that are available new and used from different sources. Additionally if you're a woodworker and up to the project it is possible to build a bellows: http://www.celticknot.com/the-elektric-anvil/blacksmithing-101/61-building-a-bellows-fed-portable-forge.html

How to deal with plastic hoses:

More and more both hair dryers and vacuum cleaners are coming with all plastic components. If these get too close to the fire they will, of course melt. 

Keep in mind that the tuyer -- the metal pipe that will feed the air into the bottom of the fire pit -- is part of the fire, effectively. Metal is a good conductor of heat and heat rises. The tuyer pipe will be at about a 45 degree angle passing into the bottom of the fire hole. So the longer the forge is worked the more the pipe will heat and that heat will pass up the pipe to where the vacuum cleaner hose or hair dryer is connected.

Removing the hose periodically from the tuyer is one solution. Also letting the fire &quot;rest&quot; in combination with removing the hose will combine to keep things &quot;cool enough&quot;. A longer piece of pipe may also help. 

If you are using a plastic hose or hair dryer we suggest that you periodically wet the  part of the tuyer pipe that projects from the ground to cool it. Additionally use a 36&quot; piece of pipe the greater length will mean it takes more time for the heat to pass up the full length.

Your situation will vary and you'll have to experiment, watch and learn.

== Safety Glasses ==
Another item there is no substitute for buying. And we recommend that you buy the best that you can afford. Safety glasses that don't fit or are uncomfortable or difficult to see through are almost worse than none at all. Get them. Get the best you can. Use them.  Looking at a hot fire can irritate the eye, find safety glasses that filter infrared light if you can.

== Gloves ==
For a lot of the work of a blacksmith we actually suggest that you not use gloves. Not only can gloves make handling a hammer more difficult and more work, but if you have a pair of close fitting gloves on by the time you feel the heat through the leather it's almost too late to avoid a burn. And the time it will take you to strip off a sweaty, tight fitting leather glove will be more time for the burn to get worse.

Gloves do have their uses for things like hot rasping where you might bump red hot metal with your hand. In a situation like that they are worth having on. 

We suggest loose fitting welding or linesman's gloves or mittens. A good fit is loose enough that if you &quot;flick&quot; your arm you can throw the glove off your hand. This might sound crazy but you only have to imagine holding red hot metal in vice grips in one hand and feeling the glove on your left hand get hot for some reason. You can't drop what's in your right hand and you need to get the left glove off &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;i&gt;. A shake of the left arm and the too hot glove is on the ground. OK ... you'll look ridiculous shaking gloves off your hand in the hardware store: you'll be more ridiculous with your hand wrapped in gauze Monday morning at the day job because you had a glove on you couldn't get off in time to save your hand.

Leather or suede are the best glove materials, since they're durable; cotton will do, but you're going to wear them out quickly.  Avoid synthetic, plastic, or rubber gloves, as they're apt to melt, stick to skin, then ignite.  The sole exception is for oven mitts and similar items designed for handling hot materials; they may not stand up well to gripping rough steel, but should cope with the heat.

== Bucket ==

Several buckets are handy things to have. You'll need one metal bucket of at least 5 gallons (20 liters) capacity for a slack tub or &quot;quench bucket&quot;. This you'll keep close to the fire as a source of water for controlling the forge fire and to quench metal either to control the heat or for heat treating.

It's handy to have one or two other buckets around. The plastic 5 gallon paint bucket is pretty common and if you can't scrounge them they can usually be found for a few dollars. They find a number of uses around the forge (but keep the plastic ones away from the fire!). I keep some extra water in one, they're an inexpensive tool tote, they also hold scrap so it isn't scattered all over the ground.

Metal buckets are preferred but are getting harder to come by. If you can find more hang onto a couple. Beyond the uses mentioned filling one with Perlite makes a fireproof container for annealling and normalizing metal.

Tin cans, especially the large #10 size, are available cheap or free.  Befriend someone who works in a restaurant or volunteer at the local soup kitchen.

== Hose ==
If you have access to an outdoor spigot, having a length of garden hose and a nozzle that can reach your work area is handy. It's a bit of fire prevention insurance and it saves having to carry five gallon buckets of water around.

== Fire Extinguisher ==
Another item for which there is no substitute for buying. And really you need to consider getting the largest and best that you can manage. We recommend one that will work on a range of fires. Don't just rely on the garden hose. While water is enough to control a small coal or charcoal fire, if your interest in blacksmithing develops you will likely have quantities of oil and other flammable materials about your forge that water can make worse. (Oil floats on water, so if you spray an oil fire with water your fire might keep on burning and float away.)

== Rags == 
We recommend cotton shop rags. They have a number of uses. They're inexpensive. They're absorbent. They don't melt when they get hot.

== Drinking Water Jug ==

A jug of drinking water is good to have. Blacksmithing is hot work and heat stroke is no fun. Keep a jug handy and &quot;drink before you're thirsty&quot;.

One author keeps an insulated 1 gallon &quot;Coleman&quot; jug around with ice and water in it both for drinking and should you burn your hand you have ice handy to treat the burn.

== An ongoing process ==

You'll gradually add further to your collection, as you encounter &quot;targets of opportunity&quot;, build tools suited to the kind of work you undertake, and develop skill with techniques that call for specific tools.[[File:Blacksmith's tools - geograph.org.uk - 1483374.jpg|Blacksmith's tools - geograph.org.uk - 1483374]]

= Materials =

1. steel
* kinds of steel
There are many alloys of steel; for smithing, you'll want the basic, cheap grades with only carbon as the main alloying element, around 0.5% carbon is suitable for basic projects.  Higher carbon content, up to about 1.5% is needed to make tools that need a sharp edge.  Above 1.5% is cast iron, which is too brittle to forge without extraordinary measures.

* sources for steel
** hardware store
Most chain hardware stores will have a limited selection and high prices.  Don't expect that the staff will be able to tell you much about alloys or anything.  The main advantage will be that if you decide that they have what you need, there's a good chance they'll have the exact same stuff available 6 months from now, if you need a bit more.
** steel yard
These folks are apt to be able to supply steel in whatever shape and alloy you want, but are generally set up for large quantity orders.  This might be a bit of motivation to find a smithing club in your area.
** scrap
Scrap can be economical, but you generally won't know what alloy you're getting, so it'll be a bit of guesswork to figure out whether the piece you're making is too soft to keep its shape or so hard that it shatters in use.  Try to get a large enough lot of the same stuff that you can get some experience with it and decide what kinds of projects it's good for and what heat treatment it needs.

Avoid painted, plated, or galvanized items, since they give off toxic fumes when heated and removing the coating is usually more trouble than it's worth.

Don't be shy about rusty bits.  Most rust will flake off easily when it's heated to forge heat.  Just be careful with the first couple of strikes that the chips don't hit anything you'd rather they didn't.  I've heard rumors of small steam explosions from water trapped in or under the rust, but I've never encountered it.  It's probably best to heat stock with heavy rust gently at first, just in case.
** automotive parts
Springs are popular, since they must be of high-quality, hardenable alloys to work.  You'll want to anneal them before trying to cut them into convenient pieces.
** odds and ends
Rebar can be an inexpensive source, just remember that it's usually made from the lowest grade of recycled material, so it will be fairly soft, but not reliably so.  A stock of rebar to fit your pritchel hole can make some Quick'N'Dirty holddown tools.

** bedframes
** nails
Nails are made from a low-carbon alloy, to prevent chipping the hammer face.  You won't be able to harden them to any useful extent, unless you want to learn case-hardening.  They're handy for items where softness is desirable, such as rivets.

= Supplies =
[[image:Coal.jpg|thumb|right|A piece of coal]]
1. Fuel
* Coal
** Types of coal

There are basically two types of coal that can be found: bituminous and anthracite. 

For blacksmithing bituminous is what is needed. Any decent supplier should be able to help you identify a grade that will suit your purposes. 

If you have to hunt for a supplier some rural feed and farm supply stores will carry it as &quot;blacksmith's coal&quot; or &quot;farrier's coal&quot;.

** Sources
* Charcoal

Charcoal is wood with the impurities burned out of it: charcoal is to wood what coke is to coal. The most common commercially available charcoal is briquettes which are 'not' suitable for blacksmithing. 

** Natural lump
&quot;Natural&quot; or &quot;Natural Lump&quot; charcoal is the ideal charcoal for blacksmithing. It is made from any number of woods but unlike the processed, uniform bricks it is made the &quot;old way&quot; by charing the wood. It can be found commercially, usually as specialty charcoal for cooking and barbecue.

** &quot;Found&quot; charcoal
&quot;Found&quot; charcoal also works for smithing. This is &quot;natural lump&quot; and it's nothing more than the charred remains of a wood fire. Some smith's will make a special rake or sieve to separate the charcoal from ash. Check the charcoal and remove any uncharred wood before using in the forge.

** Making charcoal

There are several websites and books on how to make charcoal. The simplest is to build a fire and after it has burned enough to char all the wood in it, douse it or wait for it to go out and collect the charcoal that remains. This is not the most efficient method, but it does work.

More elaborate methods with higher yields can be researched on the web or in books.

2. Newspapers

Or some other kind of flammable paper. Newsprint has a number of uses from tinder to light the forge fire, to cheap, disposable rags.

3. Wax
*This is the simplest form of lubrication and rust prevention around. Traditionally beeswax, although that can be expensive unless you're committed to being traditional. Candle stubs are fine. Canning wax will work too and its pretty cheap to buy in bulk.

4. Machine oil
* a little can of 3 in 1 or some other brand of light weight machine oil will come in handy for a lot of little things.

== Chicken Breeds ==
For the book we need someone (or multiple people) who know about various chicken breeds. --[[User:klingoncowboy4|klingoncowboy4]] Saturday June 25, 2005 7:17 UTC

== Wording of Sections ==

I am beginning to edit the sections of the book that refer to myself as &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;My Chickens&quot; to a more approprate form for a Wikibook.  Any help is appretiated.
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 18:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

I think I fixed this problem for now
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:36, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

== Book of the month/Collaboration of the Month ==

Get your votes in and lets get some work done on this book because I have nominated this book for Book of the month August.  Lets try to get at least 3 votes in...

[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 17:48, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

I have manually re-nominated the book.  Get your vote in. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 05:08, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

All we need  is one more vote in [[Book of the month]] to autmatically get renominated for next month.  We still need two for [[Collaboration of the Month]] so get voting.  I doubt we will win Book of the month for September as [[Programming:Ada]] already has 9 votes.  But if we can carry on to the next month then we can try again (without manual renomination that is).

== minor complaint ==
From the main page:

''Since this is a Wikibook editing is allowed, however, for anything more than a minor edit, please see the discussion page for this book. You can also request things to be added to the book there.''

I don't think that this message is fair, for 2 reasons.  First, this is supposedly a collaborative project.  Even if you're the main contributor, that doesn't make you the dictator.  Second, this will definately turn off new contributors. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 05:30, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

All too true and I shall fix this
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 18:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

Ok the introduction is fixed for now

== [[Raising Chickens|Chicken Questions]] ==
=== Gender Ratio ===
What is a good ratio of rosters to hens? Personally I would be more interested in raising chickens for their eggs then for their meat. Please provide information on how to accomplish this. How to make nests for the birds, how many eggs to expect per hen, etc.

Thank you!

----

Sorry if I have kept you waiting for a reaponse but I havn't been online in awhile.  This is a good question and information on this should probably be included in the [[Raising Chickens]] book.  Althouhg my Chickens were bred for meat they are laying eggs.  One rooster to 10 hens or less is a good ratio.  Roosters can add a plasant sound to your pen however, too many roosters and they will get aggressive.  Also a roosters' crow can be heard for miles so you don't want to get a rooster if you want to keep the area quiet.  Hens will lay eggs without roosters but they won't be fertilized.

Just wnted to say it is a really good book[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 16:03, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

=== Crayfish ===
You are welcome on the vote. I found the information to be helpful so thanks for taking the time to prepare such a well written book. [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 06:55, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
i was sent this address by a friend who knows i am interested in keeping chickens, but i am afraid i do not understand the site - where is the book? only a few sketchy notes.  how about 'rearing crayfish for food' any contributors?

== Anything else ==

=== Resigning from the german book (voting) twice ===
Hello, I think you should just keep your vote for German, since you already voted for it, plus you did that for the march vote, and it caused the German book to lose, it is really annoying when you think you have a vote for a book, but then somebody takes there vote out. Thank you. [[User:Fitchguy20|Fitchguy20]] 05:05, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

Hi KC4 :)

Just writing to say thanks for your editions on the WebDesign book. You might want to checkout the Javascript section, as I've done quite a bit of work in there recently (Getting to know your window, document, and JavaScript Challenges). Would be glad to get your feedback :) [[User:Michaelnelson|Michaelnelson]] 05:51, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

I have started a discussion about not having a BOTM or COTM for december. I've outlined a number of reasons why I think we should do this.

In the article when describing the puma using all of the numbers it can get confusing. It it is difficult to picture just one puma let alone male and female. I think a picture of male and female pumas next to each other and maybe an adult human could be useful in comparing the sizes of the pumas and something that children would be farmiliar with.

The killing chickens bit you added was fairly accurate.  I just added a bit to the end. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 05:34, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

That's a relief.  We're actually thinking about geting some chickens here, as pets  Would a feral and/or rabid cat attack a chicken, I wonder? [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 05:56, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

A cat would attack chicks and eat them.  However, any bird that is 6 weeks old or older will be able to fend off a cat on its own. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 17:18, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== regarding The Wind Waker ==

I'd like you to hold off formatting this guide. I've just found it's a dump from [http://faqs.ign.com/articles/392/392709p1.html This FAQ hosted by IGN]. Until I hear back from the author as to whether this was his doing, I don't think you should spend time formatting what's likely going to have to be deleted.

I have seen that you reorganizes some of the book on the [[Wikibooks:Computer science bookshelf]].

However you have overlooked that books which do not exist are only &quot;suggested&quot; and do not belong to the main bookshelf. As part of the collaboration of the month project suggested books will all be moved off to [[Wikibooks:Requested books]] and any red link at all will be banned from the main bookshelfs.

See [[Wikibooks:Domain-specific languages bookshelf]] how this will look like.

:: Yes we know that there are lot's of red links on the shelfes. Is just they should not be there - and we are in the progress of cleaning things up - see [[Wikibooks_talk:All_bookshelves]].

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Snarius. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Snarius~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Some Simple Precautions ==

''&quot;There are two kinds of smiths: those who have been burned and those who have yet to be burned.&quot;''

Blacksmithing is captured for many people by a Norman Rockwell-esque painting of the bare chested village blacksmith working close to his fire with sparks flying. While that makes for a nice image it is probably not the safest way to go about blacksmith work.

If you are considering exploring blacksmith you need to accept that a certain number of minor burns, cuts and scrapes are part of the process. We do need to be concerned with limiting those injuries to ''minor'' injuries and protecting ourselves from major injuries.

The most common injuries in the forge are burns, eye injuries, and cuts and scrapes. This is not an exhaustive list. All smiths and potential smiths are encouraged to continually develop their knowledge of safe practises in the workshop.

At a minimum, before pursuing blacksmithing, we recommend the following:

1) An appropriate [[Down'n'dirty Blacksmithing/tools#Fire Extinguisher|fire extinguisher]] for the workplace

2) Some well fitting and comfortable eye protection

3) Close fitting work clothes of natural fiber without turned up cuffs or open topped boots -- nothing that could catch a coal or hot piece of metal and hold it near the body

4) A first aid kit with appropriate burn remedies -- many basic first aid kits don't have much in the way of burn treatment.  (In addition, it may be a good idea to keep one or two [[w:aloe|aloe vera]] plants - the gel the leaves contain is excellent for treating burns)

== What to Wear ==

Cotton work clothes, close fitting at neck and sleeves with no cuffs. Pants over boot tops. Clothing in good repair: no frayed edges that could catch a spark and ignite.

A leather apron is handy to spare the clothes (often clothing turns black in color).

Sturdy boots are recommended. Steel toed boots aren't a bad investment, especially if you find yourself getting into smithing more: they spare your toes some if you drop a heavy tool on them. (And a 3 lb. hammer feels plenty heavy dropped from 36&quot; when it hits your toe.)

A hat or other means of restraining hair will also be needed.  Hair is quite flammable and many grooming products will make it more so, so save the &quot;preddying up&quot; for after you've washed off the soot and grime.  Even those who are blessed with baldness may find that a hat will reduce the incidence of getting nipped by sparks or sunburn.

People with an interest of revived history (reenactors) may want to consider different materials than cotton, since cotton isn't &quot;period&quot; for most reenactors :
* Wool works as well. It is probably less flammable than cotton, but too warm for most people.

*Linen is dicey, especially if there are any unfinished edges to the clothing: an unfinished edge on a linen shirt seems to be a magnet for sparks and catches and smolders easily.

*Leather is also pretty good as it does not burn easily, but it is hot to wear, esp. if you are wearing enough of it to protect.
 
Do not wear synthetics, even if they are fire retardant. Even if they don't burn, nylon and other synthetic fibers tend to melt and hold enough heat to burn the wearer badly. Kevlar might be an exception to this. One author has seen kevlar shop gloves for metal workers that are designed for the purpose and do not burn or react much with fire.

Currently there are some packages tagged with '''Ada 83''' because they are &quot;''only for backwards compatibility with Ada 83''.&quot; They are packages like Ada.Integer_Text_IO or Ada.Long_Float_Wide_Text_IO, but as far as I known these preinstantations of the generic Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO and Ada.Wide_Text_IO.Float_IO with the predefined numeric types are not for compatibility with Ada 83, but for simplifying the usage of IO facilities (e.g. when teaching the language, to use IO without learning generics).  Did I missed something?
Also, In my opinion this page should be split in two sections: Standard Ada packages and implementation dependent packages (like the modules about pragmas and attributes), and those generic instantiations allowed in the RM (like Ada.Long_Long_Integer_Text_IO) should be tagged as '''Optional''', because although they are implementation dependent in the sense that not every compiler has the type Long_Long_Integer, these packages are not completely new like Ada.Wide_Text_IO.C_Streams. The package Ada.Command_Line is also optional, for instance. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 08:23, August 1, 2005 (UTC)

:Agree about Ada.Integer_Text_IO or Ada.Long_Float_Wide_Text_IO not compatibility. Agree about splitting in sections. Not sure about Optional packages, I don't know what the RM says about it. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 16:29, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

:: The RM says about the package Ada.Command_Line [{{Ada/RM2|A|15|(21)}}]: 
:::''Implementation Permissions: An alternative declaration is allowed for package Command_Line if different functionality is appropriate for the external execution environment.''
:: Also, the AI about package Ada.Directories states [({{Ada/95/AI|248|(!problem)}}]:
:::''Ada 95 has already opened the door to standard packages that are not necessarily applicable to all implementations with Ada.Command_Line.''
:: Maybe the term &quot;optional&quot; is not very exact, but I think that it reflects well the status of these packages. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 10:04, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is here to show you how to construct a simple, cheap blacksmithing forge.

= Objective =

Construct a simple forge that will heat steel to temperature for forging.

The forge will be a hole in the ground about 6 or 7&quot; deep with a narrow, angled trench leading to one side of it from about an inch below the bottom of the hole inclining upward to ground level at about a 30 degree angle.

A section of scrap steel pipe large enough in diameter to accommodate the blower/bellows outlet will be placed in the trench so that the lower end projects a little into the bottom of the hole.

With the bellows attached to the pipe and the hole filled with tinder and fuel, the pipe will then transmit the air flow into the base of the fire.

= Location of the Forge =

*Pick a place to dig where no one will get upset with you for putting a hole in the ground. If it's not your property: ask. If you have a partner or housemates, double check.

*You will want an area about 10' square to have room for the forge, the anvil and yourself and room to lay out tools and materials.

*Locate it far enough from existing buildings, brush, and trees so that you minimize the fire danger.

*Pick a spot where, if the ground isn't clear already, it will not hurt things to scrape the ground down to the dirt, and where it won't matter if you trample the grass.

*If you're inclined to put up an awning or lean-to as a wind break or screen from the sun, make sure you have room for that as well and set it up first. Erect it so that the forge will be out from under the tarp or so that the tarp is high enough that it will not be affected by the fire. Make sure that any ropes and stakes supporting the tarp are out of the way so that you won't trip or get hung up as you work.

*You will also want to consider where the nearest electrical outlet is to provide power for the vacuum cleaner (or substitute bellows). Remember that this outlet should be a GFI outlet as you are working outdoors.

*You may also want to consider how far you are from the nearest source of water or the end of the garden hose.

= Digging the Firepot =

1. Locate where the center of the hole will be on the ground. Mark it with a stake or something. Clear the ground around this hole down to the dirt for at least a 2' radius around the stake.

2. Using your digging tool, dig a hole 6 - 7&quot; in diameter and about the same depth.

3. Dig a trench perpendicular to the hole and wide enough to accommodate the tuyer pipe. The trench should slant upward starting from about an inch from the bottom of the hole to ground level at about a 30 degree angle.

4. Pack the bottom and sides of the hole and the trench.

= Setting up the Tuyere =

1. Place the tuyere pipe in the trench so that it projects about an inch into the hole with the base of the pipe about 1&quot; from the bottom of the hole. (This gives a little space below the air inlet for ash and clinker to drop into.

2. Fill in the trench and pack the dirt tight over the tuyere.

= Connecting the Blower/Bellows =

1. If you're using a [[Down'n'dirty Blacksmithing/tools#Vacuum Cleaner|vacuum cleaner]] or hair dryer and the pipe is a large enough diameter, it should be a simple matter to stick the outlet of the dryer or the vacuum cleaner hose into the pipe. 

2. Connect it to an outlet and try it out. You should feel a strong air flow from the pipe outlet in the bottom of the hole. It should be blowing into the hole, not sucking or drawing. Be sure that the hose is attached to the &quot;blower&quot; or &quot;exhaust&quot; of the vacuum cleaner. (If you don't, you can draw fire into the tuyer, and hot coals into the vacuum cleaner: it should go without saying that this is BAD.) 

Note: a fairly loose fit of the hose into the pipe is fine: vacuum cleaners usually create a much stronger draft than is needed for our purposes. Some even drill a few holes in the pipe above ground to reduce the air flow into the bottom of the hole.

= Conclusion =

There really isn't much to constructing a forge. If you completed everything correctly, you should have a 6&quot; diameter hole in the ground with the tuyer pipe coming up from the ground about 18&quot; from the hole. The vacuum cleaner bellows should be hooked up and connected to the tuyer pipe and when it's on there should be a strong draft at the bottom of the hole.

= Afterword = 
You may find it inconvenient to work directly on the ground. We describe the in-ground configuration because it is the simplest, but it does have the disadvantage of making you work a lot on your knees.

For your first forays into smithing this configuration will be more than adequate for many.

If that is not a configuration that works well for you, some alternatives are: 

* build a forge on legs
:there are a number of ways to do this some possibilities are:

:using an old brake drum connecting steel plumbing to the hub hole to create the tuyer and use a steel drain plate to keep the coal from falling down the air hole, the legs of pipe can be bolted on.

:building a 2' square by 12&quot; deep wooden box on legs at a comfortable height, fill the box with dirt and build the forge the same way as described in this section: basically you're bringing the ground up to a workable height.

:get an old tire rim. Place it on cinder blocks (pack dirt into the hollow of the blocks for heat insulation). Use a drain cover to keep coal out. Take a dryer vent pipe (it is flexible and doesn't conduct heat) to channel air from a leaf blower to the bottom of the rim. You add a butterfly valve to the pipe to better regulate air flow. 

* buy a commercially made forge used or new

      <text xml:space="preserve">This guide will show you how to construct a makeshift anvil out of nothing but scrap steel.

== Objective ==

Set up the [[w: Anvil| anvil]] for use.

== Setting up the anvil ==

If you are working with the guidelines of simplicity and have found a 6&quot; square by 2-3' piece of mild steel or an equivalent, the set up is fairly easy: lay it on the ground about 6' or so from the fire pot.

This will be adequate for the first several exercises.

This will give you a rectangular anvil with a face about 6&quot; x 2-3&quot; (15cm x 5-8cm). 

Alternatively you can dig another hole a foot or two in depth, depending on the length of your &quot;anvil&quot; and set it in the hole upright and pack the dirt around it leaving about a foot exposed. This will give you a smaller work surface but one that is more than adequate for our purposes.

If the ends of the &quot;anvil&quot; are rough cut you will want to lie it on the ground and use the longer face.

===Positioning===

Over time you will find a place for the anvil that ideally suits your work. And you may find that you need to move it to suit different kinds of work.

To start we recommend one of two positions. 

Many prefer the anvil &quot;in line&quot; with the forge. That is where as you're facing the forge the anvil is immediately behind you and a step or two back. The idea being that when the metal is at the right temperature the smith simply turns 180 degrees and takes a step and is at the anvil ready to work wasting no time and effort to get there and into the work at hand. 

If you are working on the ground as this guide suggests you may find that the anvil is better at about 90 degrees to the &quot;front&quot; of the forge. If you're working on your knees, it's difficult to turn about safely with hot metal. Therefore, place the anvil before you such that the forge is on the side of your non-dominant hand. This may not work well for larger work, but for most of the projects in this course it will be fine. 

Assuming a right handed smith, the forge would be roughly on the left and in reach, the anvil before. Hammer and tools to the right. The hot steel can be brought to the anvil quickly for work, the tools are ready to the dominant hand. 

Reverse everything for the left handed.

Why the concern for placement? Despite the fact that steel at an orange-yellow heat is very hot (over 1200 degrees fahrenheit) it will cool rapidly in the open air. There is little time to work the hot metal while it is at a malleable temperature. Smiths work hard to make the most of the time that the metal is at working temperature. So anvil and forge are placed such that the least amount of time is lost between the fire and the anvil, maximizing the working time.

Further an experienced smith makes certain that the tools that will be needed for the next operation are ready and immediately available. If a particular hammer is needed, for example, that hammer will be on or adjacent to the anvil, ready to grasp. If a hot cut is to be done, chisel or set, hammer, quench cup will all be laid out. 

The ideal is to accomplish the task in as few &quot;heats&quot; as necessary. A heat being the term for bringing the metal to working temperature. A rough gauge of skill and experience is how many heats a smith requires to finish a particular operation. For example a given smith might be making S hooks. To do this requires pointing either end of a rod, dressing the end and bending each end. An inexperienced smith might need many heats to accomplish this. A better smith might need four: one heat for dressing another to fashion the hook and two more for the other end of the S. A still better smith might accomplish all in two heats: one for each end. That smith is working efficiently enough that dressing and bending are accomplished in the same heat. 

While this particular project in our example is not immediately contemplated it should illustrate a couple of key points:

1) Visualization: before you have the hot metal in hand have a clear idea of what shape you want it to be when you're done. 
2) Planning: having visualized what is to be accomplished, plan the tools and arrangement of tools and yourself before you take the hot metal from the fire to work it.

This is one interpretation of the adage: &quot;Blacksmithing is 90% preparation and 10% persperation.&quot;

== Alternatives == 
As with the forge, you may have problems with working that close to the ground. If that is the case you have a few alternatives:

* Using scrap wood build a wooden frame that leaves a square in the middle to hold the steel upright and at a height were the uppermost face of the &quot;anvil&quot; is at the height your knuckles will brush when you're standing next to it. 

* If you prefer the larger work surface build a frame that will hold the &quot;anvil&quot; horizontally with the uppermost face at the same height as in the previous paragraph.

* If you have a spare 5 gallon paint bucket you can set the &quot;anvil&quot; upright in the bucket and fill the bucket with concrete. Once this has set up it will act as the &quot;stump&quot; for the anvil.

* If you have access to raw wood use a part of a tree trunk. If the diameter is large enough it will stand stable, if not you have to sink a part of it into the ground to keep it from toppling over.

== Improvements ==

The first improvement you might want to make is to flatten one of the narrow ends if the &quot;anvil&quot; has come to you with rough torch cut ends. The easiest way to accomplish this is at a steel yard where they might have a steel cutting band saw. You might have to grind and polish, but the end will be smoother than the rough surface torch cutting leaves.

Less easy but practical if you have access to a side grinder is to grind the end relatively flat.

Much more work, but doable with the tools at hand would be to hammer at the end until it's relatively flat.

Another improvement, especially if you have access to a side grinder is to make sure that one edge has a fairly sharp edge to it and the others are rounded. You'll do most of your work on or around the rounded edges. The sharp edge can be used as a cut off hardie for hot cutting.

An advanced improvement would be to add a square hole about 3/4&quot; across (a &quot;Hardy Hole) or a round hole about 1/2&quot; diameter (a Pritchel Hole) in whichever face you decide to use as the top.  These are useful when punching or dimpling.  You can also use them to attach [[w: Hardy_tool| accessories]] to your anvil.  If you are fortunate enough to acquire hardy tools or [[w: Pritchel| pritchel tools]] within your budget, size the holes to match whatever tools you have.  If not, choose sizes compatible with the size stock you'll have available when you want to make some accessory tools.  Hardy tools should fit a bit tight, so they don't wiggle around; pritchel tools are generally allowed to rotate, so should fit a bit loose.

Once you get your anvil cut, holed, and smoothed to your liking, consider hardening it, so it'll stay that way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook was started by [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] aka Timothy Park. I don't say that out of ego (OK a little bit) but more out of responsibility: &quot;I started this mess.&quot; 

And because sometimes folks like to know who wrote what and what their background is and why they think they could do something like write something like this.

Who am I? I live in the Midwest (Minnesota at this writing.) where I've had a career in Technical Education and Computer Systems for almost 20 years. Most of the later has been with a mix of graphic arts systems and high end networking.

I've liked working with my hands much longer.

I come by that honestly I think. I've got family on both sides going back a way who seem to do pretty good with their hands. My paternal Grandfather was always doing some crafty thing and had some kind of gaget or another catching his fancy. The other Grandfather actually was a blacksmith although I regret he never taught me the craft: we were busy doing other work. He did teach me how to work and gave me an appreciation for work.

I'll also give credit to Dan K. and Karen E. If Karen wouldn't have needed a carving tool and I hadn't said &quot;for what that costs I should set up a forge, figure out how to smith and make it for you&quot; and if she hadn't said &quot;Dan! He's a smith.&quot; and if Dan when she introduced us hadn't said &quot;sure I can make that but I'll want some help&quot; ... well I wouldn't have started this.

Credit also to the Minnesota Guild of Metalsmiths who fertilized the seeds planted by others. They're a great group and very supportive of anyone wanting to learn this wonderful craft. There was one fellow in particular who said to me while I was taking the basic workshop that since I seemed to be good at teaching I should consider teaching smithing because that's the best way to learn it. Which is part of why I'm writing this.

Another chunk of why I'm writing this is because of the years before I met Dan K. I had an itch to learn how to smith from sometime in high school back in the 70's. In the late 80s I started picking up books on the subject and trying to figure out a way to get started. 

There seemed this huge abyss between the pictures and words and actually doing it. I just couldn't figure out how to make it all work and to buy gear seemed prohibitive at the time.

I haunted antique shops and rummage sales and flea markets trying to find used equipment with no luck. The new gear I could find made it look like I needed about $2000 just to get started. So since I was finding a lot of cool woodworking tools I picked those up and started working with wood. The whole time there was this nagging feeling, wonderful as woodwork is, that I'd rather be smithing. But where to get an anvil? And how did a tuyer work? Putting a chimney in the garage and investing hundreds before I could get started in something I wasn't sure I'd be any good at seemed foolish.

Then I got to spend an afternoon with Dan. That was all it took. I've continued to smith with Dan over the years since. And with others. But it was that first Saturday afternoon that really told the tale. I *did it*. And that removed the mysteries. Sure there were still things I didn't know. But I had gotten up close with the tools and gear, I'd built a coal fire and made metal hot enough to move when I hit it. 

A few weeks later I ran into someone with an anvil ... *spare*. He was kind and I got a beat up 75 lb. Atwood for $20. The magic began. A few months later I found my forge in a scrap pile and Dan had a blower that would fit.

I've been smithing more and less for over five years now. It has not been lost on me that it was just a few things that kept me from doing it in the ten years previous.

Nothing replaces experience or a chance to get hands on. But if out of this can come some words and illustrations that will make it clear enough for someone to try this without someone else around to show them, then this book has succeeded.

My hope too is that this might spark some more craft related Wikibooks. If I can get this one off the ground more I wouldn't mind spending time expanding what's available in Wikipedia on tools and wood and metal work. I've also started thinking that it would be really great to get more books on smithing here and developing a repository of techniques and such.

We'll see what grows.

More to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Objective: Using the techniques you developed in exercises 1-5, make a simple &quot;S&quot; hook.

= Functional Description =

An &quot;S&quot; hook is called that because the stock is shaped to make a figure &quot;S&quot;. These handy hooks have been around for centuries. They were used a great deal in the home hearth to adjust the height of a pot over the fire. They find uses in the modern household as hangers for plants and other odds and ends.

Functionally the &quot;S&quot; hook will work with two bends in the stock in opposite directions to make the characteristic &quot;S&quot; shape. 

The challenge you will encounter in this project is that you will need to use locking pliers to hold the metal when you work the second hook into the other end. 

= Tools and Materials =

* Forge
* Anvil
* Hammer
* Locking Pliers
* 3/8&quot; round or square stock at least 14&quot; long

= Steps =

1) If the stock is longer than 14&quot; mark it 14&quot; back from one end.

2) Heat one end of the stock and work a curve into one end that is roughly 2&quot; in diameter leaving a 1&quot; gap between the end of the hook and the stem.

3) cut the stock at the 14&quot; mark if necessary

4) dress the cut end if necessary

5) work a second hook into the other end holding the metal with the locking pliers

That will function fine. And we suggest you make a plain one first to get the feel of it, but the next project will challenge you to &quot;make it pretty&quot; and use more of what you have just learned.

There are two challenges you will likely encounter in this project: 1) Working with the locking pliers and 2) Getting the right length of stock.

In the exercises we've had you work with longer pieces of stock and cut off the end when you're done with the exercise. With the &quot;S&quot; hook you will start with stock longer than necessary, work the first curve, then cut it off with enough stock to complete the second curve. Unless you make a very long &quot;S&quot; hook you will have to use the locking pliers as tongs to hold the stock while you work the other end. Working with pliers or tongs takes some getting used to. The stock handles differently, and you'll have to keep an eye on the grip so that the stock stays put in the pliers.

As for the second challenge, this will be your first exposure to determining how much stock you will need before you begin the project, and the double curve presents something of a challenge.

We're going to make a &quot;S&quot; that's about six inches from top to bottom. For some reason there seems to be a desire to start with 6&quot; of stock or maybe 12&quot;. And  then one starts thinking it through and realizes they need something else.

Let's refine what we're after: a 6&quot; overall &quot;S&quot; hook with 1&quot; radius curves at either end.

So 2 curves with a 1&quot; radius is about 2&quot; of overall length. 4&quot; of stem to make 6&quot;. Now the 4&quot; of stem is pretty straightforward, but how much more metal will be needed to make 2 curves with a 1&quot; radius?

Math to the rescue (and the fact that this is not an exact science). 

Remember pi? 3.14159, etc.?

Circumference of a circle is 2 x radius x pi. Or diameter x pi.

OK, you say, but we aren't making circles.

No but we're close.

Pi for blacksmiths can be simplified a bit to &quot;three times and a bit&quot;. 

If we were making 1&quot; radius circles we'd need 6&quot; of stock.
1&quot; radius = 2&quot; diameter
2&quot; X pi = 6+&quot; (a bit more than 6.25&quot; actually)

So 6&quot; or so to make a 2&quot; circle, but it's not a full circle, we'll want a gap of maybe 1&quot; so it will be an &quot;S&quot; instead of an &quot;8&quot;.

So call it 5&quot; to make a hook with a 1&quot; gap between the end of the hook and the stem. Two hooks = 10&quot;. Add a 4&quot; stem and it's 14&quot; of stock to make a 6&quot; &quot;S&quot;.

That's for a simple &quot;S&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How much if we taper the ends and put a little curl on the ends?

Since we're reducing the width and depth the length of the metal will increase. When we make the &quot;fancy&quot; &quot;S&quot; hook we might only need 12&quot; to make a six inch hook.

So let's try this:

''' Why “down’n’dirty”? '''

Because to learn any manual art there is no substitute for actually &quot;doing it&quot;.
Because one of the roadblocks to doing blacksmithing is a presumption that a number of fairly expensive and difficult to find items of equipment and materials are necessary to even begin. The time to acquire the equipment and materials and the cost involved appears to be a large investment for a pursuit that individuals may not be sure they have interest or aptitude enough to justify.

&quot;Down'n'dirty&quot; as a phrase is slang for &quot;getting to the task at hand as quickly, simply and effectively as possible&quot;.

What we want to accomplish in ''Down'n'Dirty Blacksmithing'' is to get someone with time, space, desire and as little cash as possible from having an interest to actually doing blacksmithing as quickly as possible.

If the exercises and projects presented here are completed successfully, the reader should be in a position to decide if they have the aptitude and interest enough to justify additional expenditures and effort to continue pursing this fascinating craft.

&quot;Down'n'dirty&quot; is also something of a philosophy of empowerment. There is value in the doing of craft work at any level of ability and sophistication. This philosophy encourages individuals to not wait for the &quot;right&quot; tools but to get involved &quot;hands on&quot; with the processes and work involved. &quot;Do what you can with what you have&quot; and &quot;better to have tried and failed than never tried at all&quot;.

It should be said that reason and common sense apply to blacksmithing as much if not more than in other crafts. The tools, materials and processes have an element of danger to them. And as there are exceptions to every rule there is one with regard to the &quot;Down'n'dirty&quot; philosophy: Safety must not be sacrificed for the sake of &quot;getting on with it&quot;.

The simple forge described here can generate heat enough to burn steel. Steel at or near that heat is hot enough to inflict burns in human flesh so rapidly that there will be no initial pain as the nerves have been destroyed before they could register the injury.

The core of this craft is working with fire and metal. There is potential for accident and injury. Prevention of accidents and injuries must be a high priority for anyone pursuing blacksmithing. If nothing else, if you hurt yourself you can't keep going very well.

More will be said in the section on ''Safety'' and the reader is encouraged to read and re-read that section. Further it is advised that none of the exercises and projects here described be undertaken without appropriate safety precautions.

= Assumptions =
In the craft of blacksmithing, more so than in other crafts, there are many ways to &quot;skin the cat&quot;. The challenge in writing this, as in teaching the craft, is that there are so many ways to accomplish the same task or objective, with no one right way to do it, that someone new to the craft can easily get lost trying to navigate the many possibilities. For this introduction a way is being chosen. 
The guiding ideal for that way will be &quot;keep it simple&quot;. With access to a few basic tools, some scrap, and fuel our goal is to have a functioning forge - in the broad, yet basic definition of forge, a place where smithing is done - in the span of 4-16 hours.
Projects will be simple as well. Something that is as discrete an operation as can be managed, with the understanding that it might be simple to do and not take much time, but much time and experience to perfect.
The &quot;standard&quot; will be what can easily be scrounged, recycled, found and otherwise acquired in the northern midwest of the United States of America in 2005. Where you live may vary. What is available may vary. But that is where we will start from.

== Primitive ==

What is meant by the term &quot;primitive&quot; in this document?

In this case we do not mean primitive in the sense of some kind of historical or ethnic reenactment. At least not directly. 

What we mean is “simple”, and “minimal”, and, often, “as is.” Our goal is to get to the basics of the craft with the simplest, and sometimes crudest tools.

We believe that it is more important to “get doing” than to have the perfect tools in the perfect shop. It has also been our experience that even for experienced and skilled craftspeople and artisans that there is a satisfaction and sense of re-creation in returning to simplest forms.


== What is Blacksmithing? ==

We recommend that you follow the links to [[w: Blacksmith| Blacksmithing]] and [[w: Forge|Forging]] for more detail.

Briefly, ''blacksmithing'' is the craft of heating iron and steel to a temperature where it is &quot;workable&quot; and then using various tools to work the metal into useful and decorative forms. &quot;Forging&quot; can be used, for the most part, interchangeably with &quot;blacksmithing&quot; although &quot;forging&quot; tends to focus on those activities within blacksmithing that specifically involve heating the metal before working.

A &quot;blacksmith&quot;, fairly obviously we hope, is a person who blacksmiths.

At its very simplest, blacksmithing requires three things: 1) metal -- typically steel anymore, 2) some means of bringing the metal to a working temperature, 3) tools to handle and shape the heated metal.

Or as another smith put it &quot;something to get the metal hot, something to hit the hot metal on, and something to hit the hot metal with&quot;.

The three requirements have been commonly met in Europe and North America with steel either from scrap or from the foundry; a forge using charcoal, coal, or gas as fuel; and with tongs, hammer, and anvil.

== What is our working definition of &quot;forge&quot;? ==
[[File:Forge.jpg|left|thumb|Forge]]
&quot;Forge&quot; has two primary definitions in this work. 1) a device or combination of devices which allow for a fire to be controlled to produce a reducing fire with sufficient heat to bring steel to its working temperature and 2) a location where blacksmithing is done. 

As the fire is so central to blacksmithing, the name of the fire place in English has come to represent the entire workshop as well.

== And after all that what are we going to do again? ==

Back to the objective, and more specific on that.

(In a future edit we will have a sketch here of the forge and anvil.)

# Keep a focus on working safely
# Collect the tools and materials needed to build the forge and [[Down'n'dirty Blacksmithing/tools#Anvil|anvil]] and begin the projects
# Build the forge. '''The forge, in a word will be as simple as dirt.''' For the forge we will clear an area of ground and dig a hole, packing the earth tight to form a fire pot. A piece of scrap pipe will act as the tuyere to get a blast of air into the fire so the fire will burn hotter. The bellows or blower can be provided by a used vacuum cleaner set up to blow rather than suck, with the hose put into the pipe. Alternatively a hair dryer might work.
# Build the anvil. The anvil will be a piece of scrap steel. For purposes of this book we're going to assume a 6&quot; x 6&quot; x 24&quot; block of mild steel salvaged. Alternatives abound.
# Do the projects. These will progress from basic exercises in hitting the metal and the simplest operations to making some things.

Hi, great to see people contributing! However according to [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]], [[Progress and poverty]] should instead go on Wikisource instead, as it's a completed work. I've moved it there as [[Wikisource:Progress and poverty|Progress and poverty]], so if you wish to make further contributions to it please do so there as the old Wikibooks copy will be deleted. Thank you for your time. :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:39, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mats.kirknes. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mats.kirknes~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[File:Kant5.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Welcome to the ''Political Theory'' wikibook]]
'''Political theory''' is the categorization of social thought by a group or by the persuasion or beliefs of a geo-political mass.  Many political theories are founded as critiques toward existing political, economic and social conditions of the theorist’s time.  Political theory can also be considered as a critical tradition of discourse that provides a reflection on collective life, the uses of collective power, and resources within a collectivity. The emphasis of political theory changes over time. As you will read, there are many different elements that create the foundation for theoretical analysis towards political science. From Thucydides to Chomsky, from the Hellenic to Australasian, from Hitler through to Che.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Close to the town of Longwitton there was a wood containing three wells famed for their healing powers. One day a local man went to the wells to collect some of the healing water but instead found a large dragon lapping from the wells with a long black tongue. The dragon suddenly disappeared but the man could still sense its presence nearby. From that day on, the dragon would let nobody approach the wells. Then one day a young knight in search of adventure heard of the dragon and rode into Longwitton intent on killing the beast.

Before setting off to do battle with the dragon, the young knight rubbed a magical ointment onto his eyes which would allow him to see the invisible. He charged into the woods and fought with the dragon all day. However the many wounds he inflicted on the beast seemed to heal almost instantly. Exhausted the knight returned to the village ashamed of his failure.

He rode out the next day determined to finish the dragon off, but the same thing happened again and the knight was forced to retire once more. On the third day the knight decided to change tactics. He attacked less frequently and watched the dragon's movements closely. Noticing that the dragon always kept its tail on the surface of the wells' water the knight decided that the best course of action was to lure it away from the wells.

He dismounted from his horse and feigned defeat. The dragon sensed victory and rushed forward to finish him off. The knight however, jumped back on his horse and rode past the dragon, blocking its path to the healing wells. The dragon was furious and attacked more ferociously than before, but the brave knight inflicted several mortal wounds and the dragon eventually succumbed to blood loss. With the dragon defeated, the wells returned to their former glory and the people of Longwitton rejoiced.

Hi, I'm Matt. I used to be an admin / bureaucrat but ran out of time and only stop in occasionally now.

I'm one of the original editors at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|Muggles' Guide]] and have gone on a quest to keep it organized. Don't confuse editor with contributor; most of my work is administrative and I'm usually removing poor content and replacing it with something more substantial and useful. I don't create that much new content and leave those duties to some of the other big contributors of the book. I try to move around Wikibooks and help out where I can with other projects but the Muggles' Guide usually consumes almost all of my book-writing edits here. Most recently [[Special:Recentchangeslinked/Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/All pages|this]] is my favorite page to watch Muggles' Guide edits.

I believe that Wikibooks and Wikipedia have many similarities but also many differences. A lot of Wikipedia content travels over here after Wikipedia deletes it and I think we need to work together to better establish how we edit and participate in each other's projects. I think a user should have some establishment of activity here in order to have their content and arguments treated with full respect and weight. I say this because I think it's important to show that you understand &quot;how it works&quot; here and we can all benefit from some editing on each project in order to better understand the community.

Some improvements: (I will come back and do them when I have time): I think it would be better to have the numbers in a table with Number, PK-translit, PK-hangul, SK-translit, SK-hangul and SK-hanja. We need to add: PK numbers 0, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90; SK numbers 0, 100, 1000, 10 000, 1 000 000, 10 000 000. Also, how to construct numbers... for PK: tens+units; for SK: (multiplier+powerOfTen)*. --[[User:Taejo|Taejo]] 15:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== Usage ==

Could it be possible for someone to write a little about when to use the native Korean system vs. the Chinese system? Any special cases etc... --[[User:213.186.251.74|213.186.251.74]] 20:21, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

:I wrote a little on the usage... I hope it's useful. Actually I don't think all this should be in one lesson. Perhaps this lesson should introduce SK numerals, and money, maybe titled '이것은 얼마예요?' Native Korean numerals are more complex and should be taught a little later. [[User:Chamdarae|Chamdarae]] 16:44, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

I am moving this lesson up to lesson 4, because numbers are a little more intricate than usual in korean, and I would like to introduce another concept that will help tie in with the conversations in order to learn things better.  Lesson 3 will be about connective forms and particles (and, or, but) and lesson 4 will be numbers with great detail on the differences between sino-korean and korean numbering.

lesson 3 - 


is it possible someone could elaborate on the final two sentances? i'm using google translate to figure out which vocab to take notes on and usage/tenses but  it's pretty confusing, and i understand doing the hard work yourself helps you to understand things better, but... i wouldn't be using this if i wanted to do all sorts of running around on the internet and leafing through books and skimming. 

also, with the &quot;to come&quot; verb, &quot;오다&quot;... simply explaining that &quot;왔-&quot; is a past tense conjugation of this verb would have saved 40 minutes of my life, searching internet resources and flipping through my notebook/lesson book. total curve ball. i stared at the sentence and read it twenty times going &quot;what?! where is this word?! it's not even in the dialogue!! these people are crazy!&quot; beginners do not know this sort of thing, so please treat us that way, we prefer it.

ex: in second last sentence, the verb &quot;to catch&quot; is in some strange tense. &quot;탑니까?&quot; is trans. as &quot;catch?&quot; while inputting &quot;탑&quot; gives me tower or pagoda... &quot;탑다&quot; gives me &quot;tapda&quot; in google trans, but it suggests &quot;잡다&quot; to me, which i select and it says means &quot;to catch&quot; ... what?? and why? none of this is explained. this lesson is causing me to ask  a lot more questions than are being answered. has this project been abandoned and  i just don't know..??? thats a pretty big oversight...

It's assumed that the reader understands basic [[Linear Algebra|linear algebra]]. Throughout this course it is expected that the reader has knowledge of matrix algebra as it will be important knowledge to follow what is called the '''matrix approach to the linear regression model'''. All that is covered in the link below.


== This is the previous content ==
(I want a book entirely written in matrix algebra so that it will be easier to write formulae and is shorter, despite the complexity. I will try to make some contributions to the book Linear Algebra - Whisky Brewer)

(Is it possible to put the Linear Algebra book at the final chapter of this book on econometric theory?)

It's assumed that the reader understands basic [[Linear Algebra|linear algebra]]. however it's of particular usefulness to know about the properties of a very common class of matrix called a Projection Matrix. These matrices are called projection matrices because they have a geometrical interpretation of projecting data from one plane to another.

Hi!

I see you've been doing some work on [[A-level Mathematics]]. Looks good but there is one change that I'd like to ask you about. You removed differentation from [[A-level Mathematics/C1]] stating that &quot;it's in c2, not c1&quot;. On the OCR specification that I've been working from (see the link on [[A-level Mathematics]]), it is in fact in C1. 

Which specification are you working from, and is there any reason for using it instead of the OCR one?

Thanks -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 20:07, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

==[[A-level Physics]]==
Noticed that you deleted my race winner example in Homogeneous Equations, but your comment for that change did not reflect it, and you had kept it through many earlier revisions.

Was this a mistake, or intentional?  Intentional is fine, I just thought that testing for homogeneity should have both  positive and negative examples for pedagogical reasons.  A different negative example would be fine too - this was just the first one that came into my head.

Keep up the good work! [[User:Wrolf|Wrolf]] 00:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:The change was intentional, sorry for not saying so in the comment box. Looking through the history, it appears that I made another change which I felt I had to explain, and completely forgot about the text that I deleted.

:I used your text as an idea to include the section about homogenous equations, but I thought it would be better to use equations that were related to the early modules of the course. I agree that there should be a negative example, and maybe a good way to show this is to incorrectly rearrange an equation (such as &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a=\frac {m}{F}&lt;/math&gt; to find acceleration), and have the units come out wrong-this is how most students make the mistake of not having the units equal.

:Thanks for your contributions! --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 11:36, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

You might want to review [[A-level Physics/Electrons and Photons/Quantum physics]]. An anon user has added some info that appears to be useful, but is quite opinionated and rude about normal physics instruction. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:30, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

:Just checked it, it looks like someones letting off steam or something! I'll probably edit a lot, though most of it seems to be information that is irrelevant to the course. Thanks for the heads up! --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 23:31, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
:Just saw the modules's talk page, he's a little crazy, i'm just going to revert it, especially since he thinks that whats being taught is wrong, which isn't open for debate since the specification wants students to learn &quot;dumbed down physics&quot;, and thats what really matters to the students at the end of the day. The tone also seems somewhat bitter about something...

==[[A-level Computing]]==

Hi Krackpipe,

Thanks for correcting some of my work on the ALevel Computing Book.  Nice to see someone else showing interest in it.  I've been meaning to put a lot of work into it as I've started teaching it and despise the Heatcoate book.  Sadly all i've managed to do so far is use the Maths book as a template, but watch that space!  Best of luck with the January Exam
--[[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 00:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

[[Image:Caracal.jpg|right|thumb|Slanted eyes and long black ear tufts give the caracal a distinctive look]]
The Caracal, also called Persian lynx or &quot;African lynx&quot;, is a medium-sized wild cat. The caracal resembles a lynx and is related. Caracals are labeled as small cats but are the heaviest of all small cats as well as the fastest.

== Where do caracals live? ==
[[Image:Caracal_distribution.png|left|200px]]
Caracals are distributed over Africa and West Asia. Their habitat is dry steppes and semi-deserts, but also woodlands, savanna, and scrub forest. They are solitary, or paired, territorial cats.

==What do caracals look like?==
[[File:Caracal National Zoo Washington.jpg|right|thumb|A caracal in profile]]
The length is 65 cm (about 2 ft), plus 30 cm tail (about 1 foot). It has longer legs and a slimmer appearance than a lynx. The color of the fur may be wine-red, gray or sand-colored. Young caracals bear reddish spots on the underside, while adults do not have markings except for black spots above the eyes. The caracal has long, tufted black ears, which also explain the origin of its name--&quot;karakulak&quot;, Turkish for &quot;black ear&quot;.

==What do caracals eat, and how do they catch their prey?==

[[Image:Lightmatter caracal.jpg|thumb|left|A quiet moment]]

A caracal may survive without drinking for a long period - the water demand is satisfied with the body fluids of the prey. It hunts at night (but in colder seasons also in the daytime) for rodents and hares; rarely it may even attack a gazelle, a small antelope or a young ostrich.

They are picky eaters, and discard the internal organs of the mammals they catch, partially pluck the fur off of hyraxes and larger kills, and avoid eating hair by shearing meat neatly from the skin. But they will eat the feathers of small birds and are tolerant of rotten meat. Caracal ears are controlled by 20 different muscles. Tufts of fur on their ears help them pinpoint their prey accurately.  

They are most well-known, however, for their skill with hunting birds; a caracal is able to snatch a bird in flight, sometimes more than one at a time. Caracals can jump and climb exceptionally well, which enables it to catch hyraxes better than probably any other carnivore.

==Fun facts==
* The caracal is the fastest cat in its size range.
* Sometimes called a ''desert lynx'' or ''African lynx'' because of its tufted ears, it is not a lynx at all.
* Tame caracals are sometimes used to assist hunters in Iran and India.
* Wild caracals in the Western Cape of South Africa are attacking and eating domesticated cats.  The cause of this is confusing to cat owners as there seems to be plenty of food in the wild for the caracal to eat.  One can assume that domestic cats are easier to catch than wild prey.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pronounciation==

&lt;div style='font-size: 15px;'&gt;To those concerned:

There is a glaring error on this page about the Hebrew alphabet. The Khataf-Kamatz does ''not'' make the sound of the ''a'' in '''father'''. Rather, it is a short ''o'' sound (like '''hope'''). In fact, representing the Kamatz as an ''a'' without qualification is not correct. There are two types of Kamatz: Kamatz Gadol (simple Kamatz), which sounds like the ''a'' in '''father''' and Kamatz Katan that sounds like the ''o'' in '''hope'''. This topic might be too technical to go into on this page, but they should at least be listed properly.

The best,
Yonah
&lt;/div&gt;
:I don't know, but isn't this one that changes with the different dialects?  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 02:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

An IPA pronunciation guide would be awesomely useful. And more accurate.  [[User:70.171.19.218|70.171.19.218]] 08:16, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
: See [[Template talk:IPA]] --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 09:20, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

-
:kamatz-katan / hataph-kamatz  (same thing), is not a so-called short o like in hope!!!. Hope is a long o like So Go.  kamatz katan is like (british not american accent) top, boris, hop(no e, not hope), dock , which is a short o. I don't know how you get that sound in american english.  Regarding The long o, like Go,So,Hope. I don't think it exists in sephardi hebrew. It is the ashkenazi cholem. A cholem is marked as a dot in the upper left hand corner of any letter. Note no other vowels use dots that go above a letter. But the letter(s) Shin and Sin, have dots that go above.   Shin has a dot on the top right corner. Sin on the top left corner. So, if you see the letter shin/sin with 2 dots, one on the top right, one on the top left. It is a Shin with a cholem.   

:In ashkenazi hebrew, kamatz is always like o in top, boris (british accent, not american accent).  

:In sephardi hebrew, it depends. It always looks the same - like a T. But according to a rule. Sometimes it is Ah like I thnk Thus, and books say Bar,Far. Other time it is o like top.  The ah like far is called a kamatz gadol. The o like top, is a kamatz katan a.k.a  kamatz hatuph(I may have misspelt this word hatuph. I would have to see it in hebrew).  The kamatz gadol in sound is really to be distinguished from the Patach. which as Ah as in cat. 

:In Modern Hebrew pronunciation - which is a mixture of sephardi,and  ashkenazi. There is one kamatz, pronounced like the sephardi kamatz gadol - far.

Another note to make shoudl be the variations on pronounciations (as a possible side note) such as alternate sounds, such as tet sounding like an &quot;S&quot; at times, etc.

One last request would be to change the font used in the examples given to show each character of the alephbet. That font, even to me, seems very akward. The Shin, for example looks practicially closed on the top and not like a shin, the Chet looks like a greek Pi, the dagesh marks are not even IN the letters that they should be but beside them, and don't even get me started on that crazy final nun.

Hope someone else sees my point and takes the needed steps to clarify. [[User:167.1.120.20|167.1.120.20]]deselect

The letter ה in hebrew is spelled הא = he (E like in help), not האי = hey. Even in Israel a lot of people doesn't says he, so let's stop this awful mistake right here. [[User:89.138.121.84|89.138.121.84]] 16:48, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

== Added IPA, needs revisions ==

Ok, so I added IPA to the page.  All I had to go on was the text as presented and a little help from my Ashkenazi friend (note resh).  It would be neat if differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardic pronunciation could be represented.  Someone correct my mistakes quick! [[User:Dancxjo|Dancxjo]] 01:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
: Thank you!  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 02:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== [X] versus [x] ==

The notes seemed to indicate that while chet is [X] (uvular), khaf should be velar [x], yet the transliteration seems to ignore this.  Can someone confirm this? [[User:Dancxjo|Dancxjo]] 01:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
:In modern &quot;Europenized&quot; Hebrew, both &quot;Chet&quot; and &quot;Khaf&quot; are uvular, i.e. [χ] in IPA. Nonetheless, if you pronounce it velarly, i.e. [x], no one would notice the difference. The &quot;classical&quot; Arabized Hebrew makes a distinction between &quot;Chet&quot; - [ħ] (pharyngeal), and &quot;Khaf&quot; - [x]/[χ] (either velar or uvular). [[User:88.155.194.120|88.155.194.120]] 21:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== A note on the funky dagesh misalignment ==

This seems to be a browser issue with the tables.  It works just fine in Firefox but not in Safari. [[User:Dancxjo|Dancxjo]] 01:16, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Teaching step-by-step ==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Hebrew step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Hebrew than in English), common personal names, Hebrew words that have entered English, English words that are used in Hebrew, words that both Hebrew and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Hebrew, I'd be glad to help you, even though I can't read Hebrew yet. I'd like to learn it though and I have learned to read quite a few scripts already. Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 17:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].

== Final Pe ==

The table shows &quot;Final Pe&quot; as the final form of Pe with a dagesh added. This is not correct. In Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew, no word ever ends with a &quot;P&quot; sound, so the final form of Fe is ''always'' without a dagesh (unlike final Khaf, which can take a dagesh, e.g. Numbers 6:25). In Modern Hebrew, words can end with a &quot;P&quot; sound ''if'' they are foreign in origin (''lo'aziot''). In such case, to emphasize the highly irregular pronunciation, ''the non-final form is used (with a dagesh) at the end of the word.'' A commonly encountered example is ''ketchup'', which is written {{Hebrew-Large| קטשופּ }} (copied off a bottle from my refrigerator). I don't know how much of this you want to go into in the first lesson, but you should take out the Final-Pe-with-a-dagesh, as there is ''no such usage''.

:In the expanded aleph-bet lessons ([[Hebrew/Aleph-Bet]]), pe is covered in one of the lessons that has not been created yet ([[Hebrew/Aleph-Bet9]]), should we put this there?  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 02:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Guidelines==
'''ASCO Practice Guideline: Initial Hormonal Management of Androgen-Sensitive Metastatic, Recurrent, or Progressive Prostate Cancer'''
*'''2006''' - PMID 17404365 &amp;mdash; &quot;Initial Hormonal Management of Androgen-Sensitive Metastatic, Recurrent, or Progressive Prostate Cancer: 2006 Update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology Practice Guideline.&quot; Loblaw DA et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 20;25(12):1596-605.
**1) Standard treatment options: bilateral orchiectomy or LHRH agonists
**2) Non-steroidal anti-androgens (NSAA) may be discussed as an alternative; steroidal anti-androgens should not be offered
**3) Combined androgen blockade should be offered
**4) Early androgen deprivation compared to symptomatic initiation shows moderate (17%) decrease in relative risk of PCA-specific mortality, but moderate (15%) increase in relative risk of non-PCA-specific mortality. There is no overall survival difference. Some prognostic factors (PSAdt, GS, PSA response to ADT, age) may be considered in treatment decisions
**5) There is insufficient data for intermittent androgen blockade, and it should not be used outside of clinical trials
*'''2004:''' - PMID 15184404, 2004 &amp;mdash; &quot;American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for the initial hormonal management of androgen-sensitive metastatic, recurrent, or progressive prostate cancer.&quot; Loblaw DA et al. J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jul 15;22(14):2927-41.


==Hormonal Therapy==
*''Also please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Hormones]] section


===Dose===
*'''CALGB 9181''' (1992-1994) -- low-dose vs. high-dose Megace
**Randomized. 149 ment with HRPC, with progressive metastatic or LN carcinoma; only 1 prior hormonal therapy allowed. Arm 1) oral megestrol acetate 160 mg/day (low dose) vs. Arm 2) oral megestrol acetate 640 mg/day (high dose). Primary endpoint tumor response
**'''2000''' PMID 10679652 -- &quot;A randomized study comparing standard versus moderately high dose megestrol acetate for patients with advanced prostate carcinoma: cancer and leukemia group B study 9181.&quot; (Dawson NA, Cancer. 2000 Feb 15;88(4):825-34.)
***Outcome: Tumor response comparable. Median OS low dose 11.2 months vs. high dose 12.1 months (NS). Most (91%) died of prostate cancer
***Toxicity: comparable, but 7% had acute pain flare
***Conclusion: Megestrol acetate has limited activity in HRPC; there is no apparent dose-response correlation


===Immediate vs delayed hormonal therapy===
:See also: [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Hormones/Primary_ADT#Primary ADT vs. Deferred ADT|Primary ADT vs. Deferred ADT]] in the hormonal therapy chapter (mostly patients with localized prostate cancer)

&lt;br&gt;
*'''EORTC 30846''' - Phase III
**302 pts with positive lymph nodes (N1-3, M0) without local treatment of the primary tumor. Of these, 234 were randomized.
**'''2004''' PMID 15310999 -- &quot;Early versus delayed endocrine treatment of pN1-3 M0 prostate cancer without local treatment of the primary tumor: results of European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 30846--a phase III study.&quot; (Schroder FH, J Urol. 2004 Sep;172(3):923-7.)
***Median f/u 9.6 yr, 190 pts (62.9%) died, including 76% from prostate ca. HR for survival for delayed vs immediate treatment was 1.23 (NS)
***Median time off treatment on the DET arm: 18 months [http://erc.endocrinology-journals.org/content/14/1/1.full]
***Conclusion: &quot;While this study suggests an advantage for early treatment, it is under powered to show equivalence or superiority for the early or delayed approach. When dealing with individual patients, the potential survival advantage on early treatment must be balanced against potential advantages in quality of life on delayed treatment.&quot;


*'''Medical Research Council''' (-1993)
**934 pts. Locally advanced or metastatic (and asymptomatic) prostate cancer. Randomized to immediate hormonal therapy (orchidectomy or LHRH agonist) or the same treatment delayed until the patient became symptomatic (from local progression or metastasis)
**'''2000''' (Abstract only) -- no PMID; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1464-410x.2000.0860s3218.x/pdf PDF] (appears as MP6.1.07 on page 3) -- &quot;Immediate vs. deferred hormone treatment for prostate cancer: How safe is androgen deprivation?&quot; (Kirk D, Br J Urol 86(suppl 3):S220, 2000) 
***815 pts (85%) have died (399 - immediate, 416 deferred). 
***Improved disease-specific survival with immediate treatment. Overall survival is less.
***277 died from other causes (147 immediate, 129 deferred)
***Cancer deaths (other than prostate cancer): 27 vs 15. Cardiovascular deaths: 77 vs 91. 
***TURPs performed: 74 vs 149. Ureteric obstruction: 43 vs 59. Spinal cord compression: 10 vs 23. 
***Conclusion: &quot;Immediate hormone treatment has an impact on advanced prostate cancer, reducing complications and improving disease specific survival.&quot; ... &quot;However, the reduction in an overall survival difference seen on long-term follow-up suggests an adverse effect of prolonged hormone treatment in increasing mortality from other causes. An excess of cardiovascular disease is not apparent in immediate patients, but more died from nonprostate cancer.&quot;
**'''1997''' - PMID 9052476 &amp;mdash; &quot;Immediate versus deferred treatment for advanced prostatic cancer: initial results of the Medical Research Council Trial. The Medical Research Council Prostate Cancer Working Party Investigators Group.&quot; Br J Urol. 1997 Feb;79(2):235-46.
***Immediate treatment resulted in fewer pts progressing to metastatic disease, fewer needed TURP, fewer pathologic fractures, spinal cord compressions, ureteral obstructions, and extra-skeletal metastases.  257 deaths from prostate cancer in deferred arm vs 203 in immediate arm (S.S.).
**Conclusion: Immediate treatment improves DSS but there is no impact on OS with long-term follow-up.

===Total Androgen Suppression===
*'''Scandinavian SPCG-5''' (1992-1997) -- parenteral estrogen vs. total androgen blockade
**Randomized. 910 patients, metastatic prostate cancer. Arm 1) parenteral estrogen 240 mg/month vs. Arm 2) flutamide 250 mg TID + triptorelin 3.75 mg or bilateral orchidectomy
**'''2008''' PMID 18432528 -- &quot;Parenteral estrogen versus combined androgen deprivation in the treatment of metastatic prostatic cancer: part 2. Final evaluation of the Scandinavian Prostatic Cancer Group (SPCG) Study No. 5.&quot; (Hedlund PO, Scand J Urol Nephrol. 2008;42(3):220-9.
***Outcome: No difference in bPFS, cPFS, DSS, or OS
***Toxicity: No difference in CV mortality, but increased cardiovascular events in parenteral estrogen arm. Increased skeletal events/osteoporosis in androgen arm
***Conclusion: No difference in outcome. Toxicity profiles different

*'''Scandinavian SPCG-2''' (1984-1989) -- bilateral orchiectomy +/- cyproterone
**Randomized. 294 patients, metastatic PCA, Grade 1-2. Arm 1) bilateral orchiectomy vs. Arm 2) bilateral orchiectomy + cyproterone
**'''1993''' PMID 8287887 -- &quot;Total androgen suppression: experience from the Scandinavian Prostatic Cancer Group Study No. 2.&quot; (Jorgensen T, Eur Urol. 1993;24(4):466-70.)
***Outcome: No difference in disease progression, or overall survival
***Conclusion: Total androgen blockade with cyproterone not superior to orchiectomy

**Retrospective. Of 4967 pts undergoing RP, 1352 had PSA-only recurrence (&gt; 0.2 ng/ml). Early HT group (n=355) = received HT before clinical metastases. Late HT group (n=997) = received no HT before clinical metastasis or by current follow-up. 
**Clinical metastases developed in 103 (7.6%). Early HT associated with delayed metastasis in pts with Gleason &gt; 7 or PSA-DT &lt;= 12 months.  
**Conclusion: &quot;The retrospective observational multicenter database analysis demonstrated that early HT administered for PSAR after prior RP was an independent predictor of delayed clinical metastases only for high-risk cases at the current followup. Further study with longer followup and randomized trials are needed to address this important issue.&quot;

==Chemotherapy==
*Historically, prostate cancer which became refractory to hormonal treatment was considered resistant to chemotherapy
*In 1996, mitoxantrone with prednisone was shown to have a role in palliation of pain (Canada trial); the study was not powered for survival. The benefit was confirmed in the CALGB 9182 study
*In 2004, two studies (TAX 327 and SWOG 9916) showed a survival benefit for docetaxel-based therapy compared with mitoxantrone
*In HRPC patients, docetaxel every 3 weeks with prednisone is currently the preferred treatment


*'''Atrasentan''' - endothelin-A receptor antagonist
**Randomized. 809 men with HRPC. Arm 1) atrasentan 10 mg vs. Arm 2) placebo. Endpoint TTP
**'''2007''' PMID 17886253 -- &quot;A phase 3 randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of atrasentan in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.&quot; (Carducci MA, Cancer. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):1959-66.)
***Outcome: No difference in time-to-progression; most progressed radiographically within 12 weeks; no difference in PSA progression
***Toxicity: Well tolerated 
***Conclusion: No difference in delay of disease progression

*'''TAX 327''' (2000-2002) -- Docetaxel + prednisone vs. mitoxantrone + prednisone
**Randomized. 1006 patients with HRPC. Arm 1) docetaxel q3 weeks + prednisone (D3P) vs. Arm 2) docetaxel q1 week + prednisone (D1P) vs. Arm 3) mitoxantrone + prednisone (MP).
**'''2004''' PMID 15470213 -- &quot;Docetaxel plus prednisone or mitoxantrone plus prednisone for advanced prostate cancer.&quot; (Tannock IF, N Engl J Med. 2004 Oct 7;351(15):1502-12.)
***Outcome: median OS D3P 18.9 months vs. D1P 17.4 months vs. MP 16.5 months (SS). Improved QoL: 23% vs. 22% vs. 13% (SS)
***Conclusion: Docetaxel q3 weeks + prednisone led to improved survival and quality of life
**'''2008''' PMID 18182665 -- &quot;Docetaxel plus prednisone or mitoxantrone plus prednisone for advanced prostate cancer: updated survival in the TAX 327 study.&quot; (Berthold DR, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):242-5.)
***Outcome: median OS: D3P 19.2 months vs. D1P 17.8 months vs. MP 16.3 months (SS); 3-year OS 18.6% vs. 16.6% vs. 13.5%. Similar outcome regardless of age, pain, or baseline PSA
***Conclusion: Survival longer after docetaxel q3 weeks with prednisone

*'''SWOG 9916''' (1999-2003) -- Docetaxel + estramustine + dexamethasone vs. mitoxantrone + prednisone
**Randomized. 674 men with HRPC. Arm 1) docetaxel + estramustine + dexamethasone q3 weeks vs. Arm 2) mitoxantrone + prednisone q3 weeks
**'''2004''' PMID 15470214 -- &quot;Docetaxel and estramustine compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone for advanced refractory prostate cancer.&quot; (Petrylak DP, N Engl J Med. 2004 Oct 7;351(15):1513-20.)
***Outcome: median OS DED 17.5 months vs. MP 15.6 months (SS). Median TTP 6.3 months vs. 3.2 months (SS). Pain relief comparable
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 neutropenic fever, N/V, and CV events more common in docetaxel group
***Outcome: Improved median survival with docetaxel + estramustine

*'''CALGB 9182''' -- Mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone vs. hydrocortisone alone
**Randomized. 242 patients with HRPC. Arm 1) mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone (MH) vs. Arm 2) hydrocortisone alone (H).
**'''1999''' PMID 10561316 -- &quot;Hydrocortisone with or without mitoxantrone in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer: results of the cancer and leukemia group B 9182 study.&quot; (Kantoff PW, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2506-13.)
***Outcome: MH better in TTTF, response rate, pain control, and QoL. No difference in survival (12.3 months vs. 12.6 months, NS)
***Conclusion: Mitoxantrone with hydrocortisone had more frequent response, delay to progression, and pain control than hydrocortisone alone

*'''Canada''' -- Mitoxantrone + prednisone vs. prednisone alone
**Randomized. 161 HRPC with pain. Arm 1) mitoxantrone + prednisone vs. Arm 2) prednisone alone. Primary end point palliative response (1/3 pain decrease)
**'''1996''' PMID 8656243 -- &quot;Chemotherapy with mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisone alone for symptomatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer: a Canadian randomized trial with palliative end points.&quot; (Tannock IF, J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jun;14(6):1756-64.)
***Outcome: Palliative response MP 29% vs. P 12% (SS). Duration of palliation MP 9.9 months vs. P 4.1 months (SS)
***Conclusion: Chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and prednisone provides palliation for some patients with symptomatic HRPC

*'''Scandinavian SPCG-1''' (1984-1989) -- diethylstilbestrol vs. estramustine
**Randomized. 197 patients with high grade metastatic PCA (M1, G2-3). Arm 1) estramustine 560 mg vs Arm 2) diethylstilbestrol (DES) 3 mg

***Outcome: DES better for time-to-progression (p=0.05), treatment failure (SS), CSS (p=0.07), and OS (SS)
***Conclusion: Treatment with DES had relatively good effect

*'''Orebro, Sweden''' -- medroxyprogesterone vs. estramustine
**Randomized. 105 patients, metastatic HRPC. Arm 1) medroxyprogesterone 1000 mg vs. Arm 2) estramustine 280 mg

***Outcome: Response rate better with MPA. No difference in PFS or OS 
***Conclusion: Response rate better with MPA, with fewer side effects

==Role of Prostate Biopsy?==
*'''SEER/U. Colorado''' - &quot;The prognostic significance of Gleason scores in metastatic prostate cancer&quot; (Rusthoven CG. Urol Oncol. 2014. Epub ahead of print. PMID 24629494)
**4,654 patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis or within 4 months of presentation
**For Gleason 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10:
***4-year OS rates 51%, 45%, 34%, 25%, and 15%
***4-year CSS rates 69%, 57%, 44%, 33%, and 21%
**Differences between Gleason 7 vs 8, 8 v 9, 9 vs 10 significant on univariate/multivariate analyses (all p&lt;.001)
**Gleason pattern 5 was an independent prognostic factor, both overall for patients with GS 6 to 10 and on primary-secondary Gleason pattern comparisons within the GS 8 (4+4 vs. 3+5 and 5+3) and GS 9 (4+5 vs. 5+4) subgroups
**Gleason was the strongest prognostic factor for CSS (more important than PSA and age)
**Conclusion: &quot;Stratified survival outcomes were observed for GS 6 to 10, with sequential comparisons of GS 7 to 10, and the presence and extent of Gleason pattern 5 representing independent prognostic factors in the metastatic setting&quot;</text>

Biscuits &amp; Gravy is a dish enjoyed nearly everywhere in the United States, though it is most commonly associated with the southern states.  It is a staple breakfast of most US [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner diners].

This recipe makes about 4 servings, and relies on this [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuit recipe]].
==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (500 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) Ground [[Cookbook:Sausage|Breakfast Sausage]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Table_spoon|T]] (15 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]] grease
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*3 c (720 mL) [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]](2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) Ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|Black Pepper]]
==Procedure==
'''Biscuits'''
#Make [[Cookbook:Biscuit|'cut' biscuit]] dough.
#Place the cut biscuits in the oven at the same time as step 3 of the gravy procedure.
#Remove from oven after 10 to 12 minutes; the  biscuits should be warm when served with the gravy.
'''Gravy'''
#Brown the sausage in a large skillet.
#Remove the browned sausage from the skillet and reserve in a bowl, be careful to leave as much of the drippings as possible in the pan.
#Add the bacon grease to the skillet, place the skillet on low to medium-low heat.
#Once the bacon grease is up to temperature mix the flour into the grease.
#Add the milk slowly, mixing as you pour.
#Bring to a gentle boil, stir constantly scraping the bottom and edges of the skillet.  Stirring keeps the gravy from becoming too lumpy or burnt.
#Continue stirring until the gravy has nearly reached the desired consistency, usually about 10 minutes.
#Add the browned sausage held in reserve.
#Remove from heat and allow to set for 1 minute.

==Serving==
Traditionally this breakfast is served on a plate.  A common serving is two biscuits, each halved, insides face up, covered in gravy.  Common side dishes are strips of bacon, hash browns, or grits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section  deals with the decisions you need to make before you take your first shots.

* The choice of compression and resolution
* the choice of manual or automatic mode

==Choice of Compression and Resolution==

The primary choice you must make when choosing resolution/compression is how often do you want to change memory cards.

You should always take photos at your camera's highest resolution and with minimum compression (normally known as superfine), even if you just want photos for the web, you never know when you might take the perfect photo you want to print for posterity. With some cameras, you can store the photos in raw format. While these allow for maximum flexibility, you're unlikely to need this level of flexibility unless you want to use advanced post-processing techniques.

Memory cards have very high amounts of storage and even at high resolution, they can hold hundreds or thousands of digital images.  On top of that, they are cheap and plentiful. Given that, there isn't much need to shoot photos at anything less than your highest resolution settings.  If for some reason you need low resolution photos for a particular circumstance (web, e-mail, etc.), it is best to crop and down-sample your images in post-production.  You will end up with much better results and have a lot more flexibility in how the final product will turn out.

All modern digital cameras are capable of saving photos in the JPEG format. This format is one of the standards for Internet bitmap graphics, the others being GIF and PNG. JPEG photos require some special considerations, however. JPEG files can suffer quality loss if re-saved multiple times in an image editor. Furthermore, JPEG photos are a highly processed format in which the user loses control over certain aspects of the photo, such as white balance. The main advantage to JPEG files is that they are highly compressed and you can store a lot of them in a given memory space.

Most DSLR cameras offer an additional mode: RAW. RAW mode requires additional post-processing by the user, often in proprietary software designed to read a given camera's RAW format. There is no one industry-standard file format for RAW pictures; each manufacturer generally has at least one proprietary format. RAW files are also extremely large compared to JPEG files; one RAW file might take up the space of five or six JPEGs. The main advantage of RAW is that the photographer or image processor has a greater degree of control over the photograph than is possible in the JPEG format. RAW pictures also don't suffer the same gradual loss of quality as JPEG pictures, unless they are re-saved into a lossy format.

Many newer DSLRs offer the option of saving pictures as both a JPEG and RAW file.

== Choice of Manual or Automatic Mode ==

The purpose of this guide is to help you understand what setting your camera handles when it is in automatic mode and how, by taking control of these settings, you can improve your photos.

The three most important items your camera's automatic mode controls are the [[wikipedia:Flash_photo|flash]], [[wikipedia:Aperture|aperture]] size and exposure time (usually called [[wikipedia:Shutter_speed|shutter speed]]). These three all affect the lighting of images.

* The flash affects the lighting in an obvious way, but in some situations a flash will be inappropriate (for example when there is something in the shot that will reflect the flash or if you are photographing animals that will be scared by the flash).
** Specific conditions under which you would want to use a flash are:
*** Indoor photographs not requiring natural light
*** Portraits
*** Night Photography where natural light is again not important.
*** Daylight Photography when shadows are not desired on the object or person.
** Conditions under which using a flash would spoil your photographs are:
*** photographs in which you want to capture the effect of dim lights on objects, portraits, landcapes, etc.
* The aperture can be thought of as the &quot;iris&quot; of the camera.  When the aperture is wide open lots of light gets through, so the image will be brighter. However, having a larger aperture will mean you get a narrower Depth of Field, which means a limited range of focus.

* The exposure time is the amount of time the aperture is &quot;held open&quot;. The longer the time, the more light can be received, so the image will be brighter. However having a long exposure time has one major disadvantage, a long exposure time means motion (either on the part of the subject or on the part of the person holding the camera) is more likely to cause problems (i.e. blurring).

Now to the meat of the matter. All modern digital cameras that are not marketed as children's toys have a variety of modes. The exact specifications of each mode vary from camera to camera, but all digital cameras have a &quot;full auto&quot; mode in which the camera selects everything: ISO sensitivity, flash, shutter speed, aperture, color balance, and the like. Most digital cameras offer other automatic modes as well based upon common consumer uses: a high shutter speed mode for photographing athletics, a mode for taking pictures of landscapes, one for night photography, one for photographs using incandescent light, et cetera.

DSLR cameras offer additional modes which would commonly be found on a film SLR: aperture priority mode for when depth of field is important, shutter speed priority for a variety of uses such as photographing sports or timed exposures, and full manual mode where the photographer must provide both the aperture and shutter speed. While these modes may seem intimidating to an inexperienced photographer, they can provide a much greater level of control and allow a wider variety of pictures to be taken of the exact same scene than a comparable automatic mode. Some DSLRs have additional manual modes such as the A-DEP (automatic depth of field) mode on a Canon 20D; for more information on those, consult the owner's manual.

Whether you use an automatic mode or a manual mode, and which specific mode, is ultimately up to you based upon your needs and the kind of photos you want to take.

== Dialogue 2==
'''Ricardo''': Bom dia. Como está?  &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Bem, obrigado. Agora estou a ler um livro. E você, o que está a fazer?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Estou a ouvir música. E a sua família?  &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': A minha esposa está a comer e as minhas crianças estão a jogar o futebol.&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Bom! O meu filho está a nadar. Adeus.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Here Ricardo and João are talking about what they and their families are doing.

'''Estou a ler um livro''' - I am reading a book.

In Portuguese, as in English, there are two ways to say what you do in the present. One is the simple present tense. 'I run', or 'They swim'. However, we can also say 'I am running' or 'They are swimming'. This is called the &quot;present progressive&quot; tense, and this is the tense that our two friends are using in this dialogue here.

Unfortunately there are two different forms of the present progressive. One is used in Portugal and one is used in Brazil. We have encountered the European Portuguese form. It can be formed as follows...

&lt;table style=&quot;height: 82px; width: 473px;&quot;
border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
 height=&quot;26&quot; width=&quot;107&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e3fbd0&quot;
 width=&quot;135&quot;&gt;'''EUROPEAN'''&lt;br&gt;
'''PORTUGUESE'''&lt;br&gt;
''present progressive''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#bae0b5&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; width=&quot;58&quot;&gt;'''estar'''&lt;br&gt;
''(conjugated)''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; height=&quot;62&quot;
 width=&quot;26&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#bae0b5&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; width=&quot;54&quot;&gt;'''a'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; height=&quot;62&quot;
 width=&quot;25&quot;&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#bae0b5&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;'''ler/nadar/comer (etc.)'''&lt;br&gt;
''(infinitive)''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Let's do some practice...

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

'''Who is doing what? Read the text and answer the questions in English'''.

O Jack está a comer uma maçã. Ele gosta da maçã. A Helen está a falar com a professora.

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt;

#Continue stirring until the gravy has nearly reached the desired consistency, usually about 10 minutes.
#Add the browned sausage held in reserve.
#Remove from heat and allow to set for 1 minute.

==Serving==
Traditionally this breakfast is served on a plate.  A common serving is two biscuits, each halved, insides face up, covered in gravy.  Common side dishes are strips of bacon, hash browns, or grits.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sjw. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sjw~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Formally, a cellular automaton is represented by the [[wikipedia:Tuple|4-tuple]]
&lt;math&gt; ( Z, S, N, f) &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the finite or infinite ''[[wikipedia:lattice (order)|lattice]]''
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of cell ''states'' or ''values''
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the finite ''neighborhood''
* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the ''local transition function'' defined by the transition table or the rule

The ''lattice'' is a finite or infinite discrete regular grid of cells on a finite number of dimensions. Each ''cell'' is defined by its discrete ''position'' (an integer number for each dimension) and by its discrete ''value'' (one of a finite set of integers). Time is also discrete. The future state of a cell (time &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;) is a function of the present state (time &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt;) of a finite number of cells surrounding the observed cell called the neighborhood.

== One dimensional first order cellular automata ==

For the sake of readability the next definitions focus on one dimensional first order cellular automata.

=== Lattice, cell and configuration ===

The infinite global state is a ''configuration'' &lt;math&gt;C \in S^Z&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the finite set &lt;math&gt;k=|S|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; of ''cell states'' &lt;math&gt;c \in S&lt;/math&gt;, for formalization purposes the states are enumerated &lt;math&gt;S=\{0,1,\dots,k-1\}&lt;/math&gt;. The lattice  &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the infinite [[wikipedia:Cyclic group|cyclic group]] of [[wikipedia:Integers|integers]] &lt;math&gt;\{...,-1,0,1,2,...\}&lt;/math&gt;. The position of each cell inside the lattice is described by the ''position index'' &lt;math&gt;x \in Z&lt;/math&gt;. Configurations are usually written as strings.

:&lt;math&gt; C = \dots c_{-1} c_0 c_1 c_2 \dots c_{x-1} c_x c_{x+1} \dots &lt;/math&gt;

The finite global state is a ''finite configuration'' &lt;math&gt;C \in S^Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a finite lattice, a finite set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2, ...,N-1\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; integers.

:&lt;math&gt; C = c_{0} c_{1} \dots c_{x-1} c_x c_{x+1} \dots c_{N-2} c_{N-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Finite configurations and their parts can be generally written as strings denominated by small Greek letters from the beginning of the alphabet (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, ...).

==== The number notation for strings ====

Strings can be compactly written as numbers. A string of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; characters &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; from a set of &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; symbols is translated into a &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-digit base &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; number. Usually strings are indexed from the left to the right but for the number notation indexing from right to left is more intuitive.

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} k^{N-1-i} c_i = k^{N-1} c_0 + \cdots + k^1 c_{N-2} + k^0 c_{N-1} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Neighborhood, local transition function and rule ===

[[Image:cellular automata neighborhood size.png|thumb|300px|right|The neighborhood size and position]]

==== Neighborhood ====

The neighborhood &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;m=|A|&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the set of relative positions inside the configuration.

:&lt;math&gt; A = \{a_0, a_1,\dots , a_{m-1}\} &lt;/math&gt;

By applying the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; onto an observed cell &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; the neighborhood of this cell is obtained.

:&lt;math&gt; n_x = c_{x+a_0} c_{x-a_1} \dots c_{x+a_{m-1}} &lt;/math&gt;

The name neighborhood can be used for booth the set of relative distances and for the actual substring of cells related to an observed cell.

A compact representation of the neighborhood value &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt; is a single integer defined as a number of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; digits base &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; n_x = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} {k^{m-1-i} c_{x+a_i}} = c_{x+a_0} k^{m-1} + c_{x+a_1} k^{m-2} + \dots + c_{x+a_{m-1}} k^0 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata neighborhood indexing.png|thumb|400px|right|The neighborhood cell indexing and the local transition function]]

For definitions of common neighborhoods see Neighborhoods.

==== Local transition function ====

The ''local transition function''

:&lt;math&gt; f: S^N \mapsto S &lt;/math&gt;

calculates the value of a single future cell &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; from the neighborhood of the observed cell in the present.

:&lt;math&gt; c_x^{t+1} = f(n_x^{t}) &lt;/math&gt;

The ''transition table'' defines the local transition function by listing the output value for each input value. 

  n  -&gt; f(n)
 -----------
 000 -&gt; 0
 001 -&gt; 0
 ........
 111 -&gt; 0

The ''rule'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a compact representation of the local transition function. It is a single integer defined as a number of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; digits base &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; f = \sum_{i=1}^{k^m-1}{f(i) k^i} = f(k^m-1) k^{k^m-1} + \dots + f(1) k^1 + f(0) k^0 &lt;/math&gt;

* [[Cellular Automata/Neighborhood]] for some frequently used neighborhoods
* [[Cellular Automata/Rule]] for some special rules

{{example|[[Cellular Automata/Examples on Rule 110#Formal definition|How to define rule 110 using the above formalization]]}}

=== Global transition function ===

The global dynamics of CA are described by the ''global transition function''

:&lt;math&gt; F: S^Z \mapsto S^Z &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; translates the current (present) configuration &lt;math&gt;C^t&lt;/math&gt; into the next (future) configuration &lt;math&gt;C^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C^{t+1} = F \left(C^t\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The global transition function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the local transition function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; F(\dots c_{x-1} c_{x} c_{x+1} \dots ) = \dots f(n_{x-1}) f(n_{x}) f(n_{x+1}) \dots &lt;/math&gt;

=== Finite lattices and lattice boundaries ===

[[Image:cellular automata boundary size.png|thumb|400px|right|The lattice boundary sizes (left and right)]]

Infinite cellular automata have no boundary, so its boundary description &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is omitted. But there is no way to simulate an infinite system using a finite system. The simulation must focus on a finite part of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

The neighborhood used in the local transition function oversteps the lattice boundary for &lt;math&gt;r_L&lt;/math&gt; cells at the left and &lt;math&gt;r_R&lt;/math&gt; cells at the right.

There are two common solutions to the overstepping problem:
# the lattice is wrapped into a circle (torus for 2D CA)
# the values of the overstepping parts of the neighborhood are defined explicitly as the boundary &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

==== Cyclic boundaries ====

''Cyclic boundaries'' are frequently used as there is no need to explicitly define the boundary value and no external information is introduced into the CA that could otherwise cause interference at the boundaries.

The state of a ''finite'' lattice cellular automata is a ''configuration'' in the lattice &lt;math&gt;S^Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a [[wikipedia:cyclic group|cyclic group]] of integers [[wikipedia:modular arithmetic|modulo]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\{ 0,1,...,N-1 \}&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt; C = c_0 c_1 \dots c_{x-1} c_i c_{x+1} \dots c_{N-1}  \qquad  c \in S &lt;/math&gt;

The cyclic position index is calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; x_{\circ} = x \mod N \qquad x \leq 0 \vee x&gt;N &lt;/math&gt;

==== Explicitly defined boundaries ====

[[Image:cellular automata boundary indexing.png|thumb|400px|right|The lattice boundary (left and right)]]

''Explicitly defined boundaries'' are less common as the simple constant values are useful only for CA where we observe events on a quiescent background with period 1. The boundary can be defined as a single set (the left and the right part combined) of cell values of length &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; (there is no boundary cell with index 0)

:&lt;math&gt; B = \{ b_{-k_0}, \dots b_{-2},b_{-1}, b_l, b_{N+1}, \dots, b_{k-k_0-1} \} \quad b \in S &lt;/math&gt;

For space and time periodic quiescent backgrounds time dependent boundaries can be used &lt;math&gt;B=B(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generalizations ==

=== Multidimensional cellular automata ===

[[Image:cellular automata 2d neighborhood size.png|thumb|300px|right|Neighborhood in a 2D lattice]]

The definition of ''n''-dimensional CA is similar to that of one dimensional CA, the lattice becomes ''n''-dimensional and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; become vectors of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== 2D cellular automata ====

The 2D lattice can be tiled with cells in different ways:
* square grid (4-fold [[wikipedia:Symmetry#Rotational_symmetry|rotational symmetry]])
* triangular grid (3-fold symmetry) or hexagonal grid (6-fold symmetry)
* quasi periodic grid ([[wikipedia:Penrose tiling|Penrose tiling]])

2D cellular automata are often used to simulate real dynamic systems (fluid and gas dynamics)

;See also:
* [[Cellular Automata/Neighborhood]] for some frequently used neighborhoods

==== Cellular automata on groups ====

One further generalization of the concept of a CA extends the ''n''-dimensional construct. Given a finitely generated group, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and a alphabet, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we may define the configuration space to be &lt;math&gt;C = A^G&lt;/math&gt;. That is, each configuration is a map from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is abelian, then the group is isomorphic to some quotient space of &lt;math&gt;Z^n&lt;/math&gt; and may be ragarded as a ''n''-dimensional lattice with possibly periodic boundary conditions. This space admits a group action, where &lt;math&gt;c^g(h) = c(g'h)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g'&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Any finitely generated group is a metric space, in which the distance between any two elements, &lt;math&gt;d(g,h)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined to be the minimum length of the set of paths connecting &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; on the groups Cayley graph. We define a metric on the configuration space, &lt;math&gt;d(c,c')&lt;/math&gt; to be 0 if the two configurations are identical, and the infimum of &lt;math&gt;1/(1+d(e,h))&lt;/math&gt; over the set of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt; disagree at &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; denotes the identity element of the group. We define a cellular automata to be a continuous mapping, &lt;math&gt;f:C \to C&lt;/math&gt;, that commutes with the group action and an initial configuration &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;. The evolution of the system is defined by &lt;math&gt;c_{n+1} = f(c_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Higher order cellular automata ===

The CA is of higher order if not only the present but past configurations too are used to calculate the future. A second order local transition function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; c_x^{t+1} = f(n_x^t, n_x^{t-1}) &lt;/math&gt;

Second order local transition functions are often used to construct reversible rules.

==Introduction==

World War I, or the Great War, was a military conflict that spanned the globe, but occurred mainly in Europe. It is estimated that the conflict killed some 40 million people from the years 1914 to 1918.

The Allied Powers, consisting primarily of the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Italy and the United States, were responsible for defeating the Central Powers, consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire.

The war caused three of Europe's great empires to dissolve (namely, the German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires), and brought independance to many states, such as Yugoslavia, Poland and Finland. It also led to the establishment of communism in Russia, the creation of the Soviet Union, and contibuted to the disrepair of the German economy, which in turn allowed for the Nazi party to take power in 1933.

==Causes of the First World War==
===Nationalism===
===Militarism===
All the Great Powers of the World began to increase their armies and navies after 1900. Each felt threatened by the increasing strength of historical enemies, and represented their own buildups as the only way to maintain peace. Thus, the Arms Race began. On the continent of Europe France, Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary built up more and more powerful armies.  At sea, Britain felt threatened by a German drive to create a stronger navy.

The armies of both France and Germany had doubled in strength since their last battle in 1870, when France lost Alsace-Lorraine to Germany, and France were hoping for an opportunity to get revenge. 

As the countries began to strengthen, Britain and Germany began to feel threatened by each other. Britain, controlling the seas, had not created an army comparable to those of the continental states, but when Germany began to construct a fleet of seagoing battleships which could threaten British control, tension soon built up. 

Since the time of [[Wikipedia:Bismarck|Bismarck]], Germany had been making staff battle plans for the cases of war with any other European country -- a standard military planning exercise, practiced by all armies.  A chief of the German General Staff, Count Alfred Von Schlieffen, had devised a plan of action for the case in which Germany was attacked by France and Russia in concert. To avoid a fight on two fronts (both Russia and France), the plan was to move German troops through Belgium to the North, and then move South into France, avoiding the Franch fortifications along the Franco-German border and encircling the French armies, as had been done in the Franco-Prussian War. One of the key points of the plan was to push forward into France with every available soldier, keeping none back in reserve, in order to crush the French at once by weight of numbers.  This, &quot;the Schlieffen plan&quot;, was that eventually put into practice when war actually broke out.

However, Belgium did not simply stand aside and watch. They fought back bravely against superior numbers and more modern weapons.  Though not strong enough to prevent the German armies from pushing into France, &quot;les braves Belgiques&quot; gained the admiration of the rest of the world.  The German success here thus began to cast them as the villains who would in the end be tgged with the &quot;war guilt&quot; imposed on them by the Versailles Treaty and which played a part in the rise of Hitler and World War II.

===Imperialism===
With the removal of Bismarck, [[Wikipedia:William_II_of_Germany|King Wilhelm II]] effectively took control of relatively new state of Germany. He was an imperialist who practiced Welt Politik, or World Politics. This is in contrast to Bismarck's Real Politik which Wilhelm disdained. The idea of Welt Politik was to add new colonies to the German empire to increase its strength and to be able to effectively challenge the British Empire.
===Romanticism===
Children were raised to believe in the glory of battles and armed conflicts, an idea that some compared to &quot;tilting at windmills&quot;. &quot;''Eros is dead! Long Live Mars''!&quot; they were taught.

==US Entry into the War==
For nearly three years, President Woodrow Wilson successfully maintained the neutrality of the United States in the “European War” raging across the Atlantic Ocean. A man of very high morals and an unwavering belief in American democracy, Wilson quickly became dismayed by the massive loss of life and the extreme devastation to Western Europe. Although Wilson wanted the United States to remain neutral in the European conflict, which he saw as European power politics at its worst, he saw America as the solution to the conflict. Wilson wanted to follow his predecessor Theodore Roosevelt’s role as objective mediator for peace in Europe. However, the European powers rejected Wilson’s offer as mediator and continued to pursue their course of destruction. Activities perpetrated by both the Triple Entente and the Central Powers drew the United States closer to war, until German naval policy finally forced America into the conflict in 1917. Wilson publicly wanted to maintain American neutrality; however, aggressive German naval policies aimed at quickly winning the war guided the United States to follow Wilson’s private desires for American entry.

As early as December 1914, Wilson’s position against Germany was established. Wilson believed that the German government had to be changed and Austria-Hungary divided to ensure lasting peace in Europe. Although he privately sided against Germany, Wilson maintained a neutral public view of the European situation, blaming both Germany and Great Britain for violating the neutrality of the United States. The government of the United States shared Wilson’s outward neutrality image, despite the fact that America was supplying Britain with goods and munitions. In February 1915, the United States government warned Germany against violating American neutrality on the high seas by destroying American vessels or injuring American citizens. The United States government also protested against British attempts to violate neutral trade to Germany and other continental nations through neutral ports with the British blockade of Germany.

By May 1915, however, the United States government relaxed its protestations against Great Britain, instead concentrating its angst against Germany. On 7 May 1915, a German U-Boat sank the British passenger liner Lusitania with the loss of over one hundred American lives. Although the Lusitania was conveying American munitions to Britain, the United States protested vehemently against the use of unlimited submarine warfare and demanded the immediate cessation of submarine warfare. The German High Command understood the position of the United States and its relation with Britain. As early as February 1916, Kaiser Wilhelm’s Minister of the Navy Grand Admiral von Tirpitz conveyed the logic that since America was economically and racially bound to England, the United States was interested in the defeat of Germany, thereby making the United States a direct enemy of Germany. 

In April 1916, German-American relations deteriorated further with the sinking of the Sussex and the loss of American lives. The United States government once again protested against Germany’s use of submarine warfare against British commercial vessels. However, the United States issued an ultimatum along with the protest that unless Germany immediately abandoned its methods of submarine warfare, the United States would sever diplomatic relations with Germany. Germany countered with their own ultimatum towards the United States. The German government complied with the United States’ demand to restrict submarine warfare within the bounds of international law, but demanded in return that the United States insist that Great Britain also comply with international law. If Great Britain continued their blockade against Germany, the German government would resort to complete freedom of action. The diplomatic ultimatums issued by the United States and Germany did nothing to improve relations between the two nations. Throughout these proceedings, the German government was debating the institution of unrestricted submarine warfare which had the potential to bring the United States into the European conflict.

In November 1916, the German Counselor in Washington D.C. warned against the resumption of unlimited submarine warfare. He stated that American attitude was “pro-Ally” and that the United States was prepared to enter the war if Germany refused to comply with the submarine concessions dictated by the Americans. Despite this warning, however, the German High Command believed that American entry into the war would amount to very little. The High Command believed American contributions to be solely economical and that the United States would support a swift peace if submarine warfare were resumed. The German commanders were dangerously underestimating the Untied States. The United States had a much larger population than the European nations, larger manufacturing capabilities, and after three years of war, a much stronger economy. The United States had the capability to send over one million soldiers to Europe if necessary, and did so after American entry into the war.

Germany declared the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917, a shattering blow against German-American relations. Despite this declaration, though, Wilson was determined to remain neutral in order to “save Europe” after the war was over. Wilson continued to see himself and the United States as the “savior” of Europe. However, the United States could no longer remain on the sidelines of the conflict waiting for its end. Germany’s blatant violation of neutrality rights had forced the United States government to take action against Germany. Wilson decided to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and expelled the German ambassador. Wilson met with his cabinet on 20 March 1917 to determine the cabinet members’ opinions regarding American entry into the war. Their unanimous opinion was that the United States would have to declare war on Germany to spread democracy throughout Europe, aid the Allies economically, destroy the Kaiser’s autocratic government, and end the German policy of inhumanity and lawlessness.

On 2 April 1917, following a long series of unfortunate events and disappointment, President Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. Congress voted to declare war on 6 April 1917, entering the United States into World War I. Was this an unavoidable conclusion? Based on the series of events leading to American entry into the war, entry was unavoidable. However, any number of slight changes could have prevented United States involvement in the European conflict. Had Germany not pursued a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, America would have remained neutral. Had Britain not blockaded the German coast prompting German retaliation, America would have remained neutral. Had the German High Command heeded warnings about American attitude and restrained from underestimating the United States’ potential contributions, America would have remained neutral. Wilson publicly wanted the United States to remain neutral, but the aggressive naval policies of Germany forced American entry into World War I.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For those who look for a [[w:Cellular automaton|short introduction into cellular automata]], see the [[wikipedia:main page|Wikipedia]] page.

== Scope of the book ==

Currently knowledge on cellular automata (CA) is sparse in some books, web pages and mostly scientific journals. Newcomers must read a collection of hard to find articles to get an overview of the current status of CA research. Another problem is formalization that is different in each text, forcing students to spend time on learning different formalizations instead of advancing in the subject. Finally every newcomer someday becomes a contributor or at least teacher and a common formalization could be useful for new texts.

This book aims to become a graduate to postgraduate level schoolbook on cellular automata. The book is divided into two parts
# ordered part (formalization, well known algorithms, accepted elegant proofs, ...)
# unordered part (FAQ, examples, web resources)
with texts from the unordered part migrating to the ordered when matured.

== How to edit ==

All contributions are welcome. 

There is a [[Cellular Automata/Sandbox|sandbox]] for material, yet to be placed into one of the sections or the creation of a new section would be needed.

=== Naming conventions ===

Most of the theory in the book is based on the automata theory and formal languages.

* &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,\dots&lt;/math&gt; lowercase letters from the beginning of the alphabet are used to describe single cells, cell values are integers
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\dots&lt;/math&gt; lowercase Greek letters from the beginning of the alphabet are used to describe strings of cells
* &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,\dots&lt;/math&gt; uppercase letters from the beginning of the alphabet are used to describe whole configurations as states in the basin of attraction field

=== References ===

There are references at the end of each section (comments on the content are welcome) and common [[Cellular Automata/References|references]] for the whole book.
* books
* scientific articles
* web pages with theory or examples
* software

      <text xml:space="preserve">== New Terminology ==

I have started converting the terms &quot;propositional calculus&quot; and &quot;predicate calculus&quot; to &quot;sentential logic&quot; and &quot;predicate logic&quot;.  First, I'm changing &quot;calculus&quot; to &quot;logic&quot; because &quot;logic&quot; seems to be the more common usage.  It's not a big deal, but as long as I'm making the other change, I might as well change this too.  Second, I'm changing &quot;propositional&quot; to &quot;sentential&quot; for several reasons.  1) &quot;Sentential&quot; seems to be the more common usage.  2) &quot;Sentential&quot; fits better with a schematic notion of validity while &quot;propositional&quot; fits better with a modal notion of validity.  The sentential notion is more commonly found, probably for better philosophical reason.  3) Thinking of propositions as objects of logic moves logic from the study of reason to the study of metaphysics.  This generates very awkward problems.  The sentence &quot;a=b&quot; is true where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; refer to the same object.  But propostional components ''a'' and ''b'' do not refer, they are the references of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.  So the propostion ''a=b'' can not be true.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 19:21, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Project standards ==

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] is meant to provide an extensive detailing of all things in the [[Wikipedia:Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] universe. An important goal of the project is to make this book a useful standalone guide not only for adults but for children and young adults of similar age to the Harry Potter characters. Therefore, several standards have been put in place to ensure proper quality of articles and the overall structure of pages in the book:

*Follow the present structure of the site:
**There are six main sections to the book: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books|Books]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters|Characters]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places|Places]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events|Major Events]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Timeline|Timeline]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic|Magic]]. Place your content in one of these.
**Sections and articles are normally very distinct entities within the book. A chapter in a Harry Potter book goes on its own page (i.e. Chapter 6 of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' goes in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 6|like this]]). There is a hierarchical system stemming from the five main sections listed above.

*Articles are generally not incredibly long. If the content is useful, by all means, include as much as possible, but remember to break up information into one of the five main sections if you can. Forming an intermixed yet individually distinct set of pages is ideal.

*The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Index|Index]] provides an alphabetical lookup. This may be the single most useful page in the whole book, especially for readers only looking for reference information. Whenever you add a new article, make sure any important characters, places, or events in your article get referenced on the index page.

*If you plan on making significant edits, by all means, be bold, but don't forget who you are writing for and what the rest of the book's authors would like. Any radical new formatting techniques should be discussed.

*When writing articles, refer to events and characters in the present tense.

*Several templates are available for use in articles. Please always use them in their appropriate sections:
**Spoiler: [[Template:Spoiler|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{spoiler}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**End Spoiler: [[Template:Endspoiler|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{endspoiler}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**Beginner Spoiler: [[Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**Intermediate Spoiler:  [[Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**Character: [[Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Character|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Character}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**Place: [[Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Place|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Place}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**Magic: [[Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
**Major Event: [[Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Event|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Event}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Frameworks|Frameworks]] for each section of the book exist to make new page formatting easier. Please follow them exactly when creating or laying out a page.

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters|Character]] page section descriptions should follow this format:
**Attributes: general descriptive statistics. A small amount of text about how the character looks, acts, etc. No analysis (i.e. looks, demeanor, main activities and occupation).
**Role in the Books: details of the character's actions in the book. Some reflection on the cause and effect surrounding a character but mostly factual and extremely light on analysis. This is still the descriptive phase of the page (i.e. killed X in Book 5).
**Strengths and Weaknesses: some analysis on where the character has faults, etc. Beginning of inserting facts to back up character statements (i.e. has trouble with confidence, crafty).
**Relationships with Other Characters: interactions with other characters and the character's stance on others. Personal referencing (i.e. affectionate towards Y).
**Analysis: general analysis on the character. Whereas the Role section covered how the character acted, this covers why the character acted. Some content here can tie in with relationship analysis the section above (i.e. X feels at home when at Y and feels a great sense of protectiveness over it).
**Questions: reflection questions for the reader. Made to help the reader gain insight on the character (i.e. does this character really care about X?).
**Greater Picture: present on many other pages, this is the true &quot;tie-in&quot; section. It points out what the character is likely to do / how likely to act. Point out future controversy and where the role of the character is headed, especially in reference to other characters (i.e. X is likely to go after Y in Book 7 due to his infatuation with Z. After Z's death this damaged X greatly). 

Enjoy. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]]

=== Links ===

We have elected to use absolute links (of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) rather than relative links (of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Harry Potter|Harry]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) throughout this work. This was originally done because of the tool used to convert Wikitext into PDF in preparation for printing; this tool is incapable of handling relative links, and was not likely to be changed by the toolmaker in a reasonable time frame. It appears that this also makes it easier for novice editors to add links, as a specific page is linked the same way from every other page. Relative linkage can be hard for the new user to understand.

As a side effect, however, we have lost one useful simplification. If we have a relative link on the same level, ending it with a slash causes the last part of the link to appear as the link (e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[[../Severus Snape/]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on a Character page appears in the text as &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]&quot;). This does not work with absolute links; the link &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape/]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; appears as a redlink, as the Wiki interpreter looks for a subpage of the Severus Snape page with an empty name. Thus every link must have not only the full absolute path to the page, but also the text to use for that link.

=== Scope and Fanfic ===

We have elected to base this book entirely on the work of the original author, J. K. Rowling. To this end, the primary references are the seven books of the series, and the three books written for charity: ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', and to a lesser extent ''Quidditch Through the Ages'' and ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. We are currently debating the use of the Pottermore web site as a secondary reference. Also as secondary references we can use the other related works by Rowling, the Chocolate Frog cards and copies of the ''Daily Prophet'' that were released in the late 1990s. However, we cannot use either the films or the video games as reference material, as they are derived from, and diverge from, the original sources in ways that Rowling had little control over.

We are aware that there is a considerable body of &quot;fanfic&quot;, fiction created by fans of the series that takes place in the same universe. Without ruling on its merits, we have to exclude it from this work, partly because it is not generally available for reference, but primarily because it is out of the control of the author and so does not reflect her consistent world view or writing abilities.

== Names and Spelling ==

The first book of the series came out with two different titles. In the UK, it was named &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;. Apparently the US publisher felt that the US audience would not have sufficient background into classical mythology to know what the Philosopher's Stone was, and so titled the book &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;. The author has stated that she rather wishes she hadn't given in to her US editor on the matter of the title. While many fan sites, mostly in the US, have chosen the US title, this book uses the UK title as being somewhat closer to the author's intent.

By the same token, some words are spelled differently in the UK and US versions of the book. One in particular is the word &quot;defence&quot;, which is spelled with a &quot;c&quot; in this book, following the UK practice. As this one word is used so frequently in the series (in the course title &quot;Defence Against the Dark Arts&quot;, and in all of the teachers of that course), and as we have standardized on that use in topic headings and link targets, that same spelling should be used throughout the text. While we encourage British spelling (colour, rumour), with the one exception noted above we should not insist on it.

Finally, there is at least one character who has a slightly different name in the US book. The Divination instructor is named Sibyll Trelawney in the US edition, Sybill Patricia Trelawney in the UK / Canada edition. As per our usual practice, we use the UK variant of her name throughout, though in the article on the character, we do note the alternate spelling. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Capitalization ===

We have elected to capitalize the adjective &quot;Wizarding&quot; where it appears in the text, to highlight uses such as &quot;Wizarding world.&quot; We feel that the distinction between Wizarding and Muggle is important enough that it should be highlighted in this manner. We do not, however, capitalize &quot;wizard&quot;, except when it appears in context where it would usually be capitalized, as in &quot;Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,&quot; as it is used so frequently that the resulting scatter of capitals could interfere with the readers' smooth progression and understanding. We also note that, while it almost makes sense to capitalize &quot;wizard&quot; in this book, it does not make sense to capitalize &quot;witch.&quot; [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Book name format ===

In this project, we have chosen to spell the name of the book out in full, and italicize it, for instance &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which appears to the reader as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]. Our decision to use the full name of the book was made after all the character pages were created, so the book sections in each character page still use the abbreviated form of the book title. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Internal links ===

Following common practice in Wikibooks, the first instance of a character, artifact, place, or major event mentioned in the article text, for which there is an article in this book, is linked to the main article for that item. Later mentions of the item are generally not linked, though if an explicit reference is made, that may, at the editor's discretion, include a redundant link. For instance, if the Analysis section of a page contains something like &quot;There is more on this subject on Hagrid's character page,&quot; the text &quot;Hagrid's character page&quot; may reasonably be a link to that page, despite Hagrid's being mentioned, and linked, earlier on the page.

On the Magic and Place pages, where the info box contains a First Appearance entry, where possible that entry should link to the specific book chapter. The First Appearance can actually occur twice; for instance, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]] first appears at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], but it is not mentioned by name there; we hear all students are given a warning note that magic is not allowed, but no explanation as to why not. The first time the name of the act is spelled out in full is in the second book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. Both &quot;first mentions&quot; should be linked from the info box. By the same token, we hear about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], but don't actually visit the place until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], four years later. 

Note also that there are a few pages that fit under two categories. Two classic examples are the Ministry of Magic, which is both a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|place]] and an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|organization;]] and the House of Gaunt which is both a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|place]] and a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/House of Gaunt|Wizarding family]]. The only way to deal with these appropriately is to create two articles, as we have done in these instances, and separated the article material by category. A page may refer to one subject in several categories; in such a case, each first mention in a category should be linked, to the article appropriate category. A chapter summary that mentions the physical location of the Ministry, and a policy of the Ministry, will link to both Ministry articles, for example. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;

== Category ==

The annotated texts category was removed in February, so this book is now effectively in no category other than utility categories.  Looking through RFDs in the past applied to it, it was referred to as an annotated text.  The literature category is a higher level one but is for books referring to literature in general.  So I am noting that the only major category this book belongs to now is &quot;featured books&quot; (other than the LOC/DDC/Alphabetical hidden ones).  Maybe that's acceptable to the contributors but it may lead to lower visibility. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:59, 29 March 2010 (UTC)

:I understand the concern, and don't quite know how to proceed. The intent of this book is actually more aimed at the Literature category, as we are longterm interested in the how and why, rather than merely the what, of Harry Potter; but I don't know how we can get there. Frankly, my concern from the beginning has been that as an annotated text we were likely to become no more than a Potter encyclopedia, which while possibly useful to the reader, is certainly not useful as a textbook. I have been trying, in my poor way, to add literary material to the book, but as an engineer, my grasp of such is very basic. And despite all my work on this, if we can't get it to the stage of being a work on literature, my personal inclination would be to let it go. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:15, 29 March 2010 (UTC)

::We've only one subcategory of literature, annotated texts, and that subcategory is getting pretty full.  It may be worthwhile to create some subcategories of literature based on genre instead.  After all, we have subcategories of history divided by type and subcategories of computer software divided by type.  That will diffuse the books currently in annotated texts and also provide a place for Muggles' Guide. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:30, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

:::We are by definition not an annotated text since that requires inclusion of the book texts which is a copyright violation and also isn't really necessary. I like the idea of literature sub-categories though and think that's the correct place for our work. Also, &quot;literary study guide&quot; is a better name to me since it's meant to be used alongside the real works so that's another option if we don't like the literature section. It would be nice to see other study guides. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:10, 31 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/TOC}}



Welcome to the [[w:Wiki|wiki]]-based annotated text and analysis [[Main Page|Wikibook]] for the highly popular [[w:Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] novels by [[w:J.K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]].  It is organized to minimize accidentally revealing [[w:Spoiler (media)|spoiler]] information and strives to provide insight into the literary value and techniques of this extremely popular work. In the process, it must include extensive detailing of the Harry Potter universe.

== Book Contents ==
Please see the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Contents|Contents]] page for a full list and organizational overview of the book. If you wish to browse the entire Muggles' Guide, use this page to move through the book. A [[Media:Muggles' Guide.pdf|PDF]] of the book is also available.

== Where To Start ==
This book is structured to handle several different levels of readers of the Harry Potter series. Therefore, the book has several pages available that detail suggested reading guides for specific reading levels:

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Beginner|Beginner]] - Readers who are new to the Harry Potter series in general. This page should be used by readers who have read only a small amount of the Harry Potter books or are just interested in a general overview of the storyline and biographical information.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Intermediate|Intermediate]] - Readers who have read most of the Harry Potter series and are familiar with many of the principal characters and places. Analysis for characters, places, and events and detailed summaries of the books.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Advanced|Advanced]] - Readers who have read the entire series and are looking to develop detailed knowledge of the books' content and realize the greater picture. A slight step up from the intermediate level, almost every topic in the book is covered, providing a comprehensive view of the series.

All text is available to anyone who wants to read it; we do not &quot;turn off&quot; text if you are not at the proper level. Also, the level warnings mark an end to specific levels: beginners who do not want their reading experience spoiled by having plot points prematurely revealed should only read up to the &quot;Beginner warning&quot; or &quot;Spoiler warning&quot; tag. Intermediate readers similarly should read only up to the &quot;Intermediate warning&quot; tag. Advanced readers presumably have already read the entire series, and are fully knowledgeable about what happens in each novel, so their enjoyment in reading the series is undamaged by anything in this book. Thus, there is no tag for Advanced readers, as there is no place where they should stop reading.

For those who want to avoid spoilers, we add this caution. Particularly on the Character pages, and to a lesser extent the Magic pages, there are sections where analysis requires that we cover things that the reader may not have yet seen. In particular, several characters are suddenly seen in a new light in the last two books. In as much as it is possible, we mark sections where these appear with the name of the book or chapter to which they apply. In a character Analysis section, therefore, there might be a heading &quot;''Deathly Hallows''&quot;; this is an indication that the following section should be avoided until you have read ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', to avoid spoilers.

This book is a study guide meant to accompany the reading of the Harry Potter series in a course context; it is not meant to replace the books. This book does not contain the full text of the series; to include the full text of the series in that manner would be violation of copyright. We strongly recommend that if you do not already own a copy of the Harry Potter series, a very good place to start, even before looking any further at this Guide, is to obtain copies of the seven books in the series.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

''Mr and Mrs Dursley, of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|number four, Privet Drive]], were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.''

''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Mr. Dursley]] was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Mrs. Dursley]] was thin and blond and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.''

Vernon Dursley notices strange events on his way to work: a cat on Privet Drive appears to be reading a map, and people wearing colourful robes are wandering the streets. Mr Dursley attempts to ignore these oddities, but during his lunch break, he sees more such curiously-clad people. He overhears some mentioning the Potters and their son, Harry; one even stops Mr Dursley, telling him that he must be overjoyed that &quot;You Know Who&quot; is gone. All this reminds Vernon that the Dursleys have a shameful secret, and why they pretend the Potters never existed. Arriving home, Mr Dursley hears TV news reports about unforeseen shooting stars and owls flying during the daytime. Previously unwilling to discuss the Potters with his wife, Petunia, he finally verifies that their nephew's name ''is'' Harry. Vernon Dursley sleeps uneasily. 

Late that night, a mysterious figure appears in Privet Drive. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], a wizard, uses an object called a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Put-Outer]] to extinguish all the street lamps. Dumbledore addresses the cat, who transforms into a witch named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. They discuss how recent celebrations have left &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]]&quot; inquisitive. Dumbledore confirms that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] were murdered the night before (October 31) by the Dark wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. He also tried to kill their one-year-old son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], who is somehow involved in causing the Dark Lord's demise. Voldemort is often also referred to as &quot;You-Know-Who&quot; by those fearing to speak his name. Harry, according to Dumbledore, is being brought to Privet Drive by someone named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].

Soon after, the gigantic Hagrid arrives on a flying motorbike with a snugly wrapped baby tucked into his arm. Dumbledore places the infant on Number Four's doorstep with a letter addressed to Petunia Dursley. McGonagall despairs that baby Harry, an instant celebrity, must spend his childhood with such people. Hagrid re-mounts his motorcycle, McGonagall transforms back into a cat, and Dumbledore re-illuminates the streetlights; all three quietly depart.

== Analysis ==

Harry Potter enters the story when he is brought to the most seemingly normal family in all Britain&amp;mdash;the Dursleys. Not only are they &quot;normal&quot;, they are apparently also quite mundane, boring, and averse to anything even remotely out-of-the-ordinary in their dull, routine lives, though there may be a particular reason for some of their behaviour. Only gradually do readers become aware that a magical world populated by witches and wizards secretly co-exists alongside non-magical humans, known as &quot;Muggles&quot;. The odd characters wandering the streets dressed in rather outlandish clothing are the first hint to this hidden society. Little is revealed about what has recently happened, though it has created some noticeable activity that has spilled over into the Muggle world. The scar on baby Harry's forehead will clearly be a lasting reminder that sinister events must have occurred, resulting in the infant being orphaned. Dumbledore's, McGonagall's, and Hagrid's actions lead us to believe that Harry is far more special than a mere orphan needing a home, though little is explained here. And while Professor Dumbledore does leave a letter with the infant, presumably explaining everything to the Dursleys, whatever information it contains is withheld, for now, from readers. We, like Harry, will gradually discover what has transpired and learn about this remarkable hidden world in small bits, though this chapter's title, &quot;The Boy Who Lived&quot;, in addition to baby Harry's scar, indicates he must have had some near-fatal experience. Judging by Vernon Dursley's behaviour, he may already know more about this hidden world than readers are initially led to believe.

The conversation between Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore in this chapter is designed to bring several points of information to the reader without having to explicitly state them. One of the basic tenets of writing is &quot;show, don't tell,&quot; which can make it difficult to illuminate backstory that is necessary to understanding. In particular, we need to know of the existence of Voldemort, and of his downfall, and this is communicated to us by this conversation. We also need to know that there is a reason for Dumbledore's placing Harry with his relatives, and the conversation is also tailored to inform us that there is a reason, but that it is not to be divulged just yet. Additionally, this conversation establishes the character of both McGonagall and Dumbledore, and the relationship between them, as director and trusted aide. The student could well profit by study of this one short interaction and all that it tells us.

Other commentators have noted that the author is very strong in what is called the &quot;set-up and pay-off&quot;: creating a situation, then suddenly resolving it. Sometimes the set-up and pay-off are contained in a single chapter, other times they span multiple chapters or even multiple books. This chapter, in fact, is one example of a set-up (the list of strange things that occur in the vicinity of the Dursleys, and the discovery that they are connected to the Dursley family) and pay-off (revelation of the reason for the events and the arrival of the infant Harry). Students are encouraged to examine the work for set-ups and pay-offs, and determine how they enhance the &quot;holding power&quot; of the book and of the series as a whole. We will note that while the set-up and pay-off is a staple of writing for the film industry, the ''Harry Potter'' films are not as rich in this as the books; we believe this is because of the amount of material that must be elided from a novel to fit into two hours of film. In order to keep the necessary story elements, some of the less-important set-up events had to be dropped.

We will learn about the Wizarding world through Harry's eyes: in the entire series there are only five chapters, including this one, that are written apart from his point-of-view. These chapters are at each book's beginning, and provides us information that is still unknown to Harry. The other chapters are: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|Chapter 2]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince'']], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. These are the only times readers are privy to information that Harry is not. Generally, we see events only when and how Harry experiences them. 

Evidence indicates that Harry was born on 31 July, 1980, and orphaned on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|31 October]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Timeline#Note on dates|1981]] — [[w:Hallowe'en|Hallowe'en]] night — when he is one year and three months old. Critics point out a lack of &quot;trick-or-treating&quot; and similar festivities on Privet Drive that night, but it should be mentioned that we never actually see Privet Drive on the 31st; it is the 1st of November when Vernon Dursley leaves for work, and later that same night when Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Hagrid arrive.

Evidence also suggests that there is a day between when Harry's parents died, and his arrival at Privet Drive; Harry is orphaned on 31 October, 1981, and the story opens with Vernon Dursley leaving for work on the morning of 1 November. This has sparked speculation amongst readers; is there an accident of dates, or is the &quot;missing day&quot; a purposeful addition by the author? It was believed by many readers that the occurrences during that day would be important, possibly even pivotal, to events in the seventh book. 

There is also a contradiction: 1 November, 1981 was, in reality, a Sunday, and the book states that that day is a Tuesday. There are similar minor internal conflicts throughout the series. These errors or oversights do not detract from the sweep of the story, so while they may be mentioned, they are provided more as a curiosity than as something for the readers to concern themselves with.

Readers should also note the TV news reports about flying owls being spotted during daylight. This is an early reference to the Wizarding world's owl postal system. Voldemort's death likely prompted a huge flurry of wizard mail being carried by owls which was noticed by Muggles.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The framework that is echoed throughout the series is established here: the contrast between the magical Wizarding realm and the more mundane Muggle world. By contrasting these two worlds, Muggle and Magic, an ongoing theme is seen throughout the series - prejudice, suspicion, and intolerance of anything or anyone different from ourselves. Vernon and his wife, Petunia, represent the great divide that exists between the magical and non-magical realms. Their constant fear, disdain, and hostility toward Harry's world shows how most Muggles would likely react if they knew wizards existed, though these two very different populations do occasionally collide. And as will be seen shortly, these fears and prejudices also exists within wizard society. Albus Dumbledore is the antithesis of Vernon Dursley, and each man becomes the figurehead for his respective world. Whereas Dumbledore, a powerful Wizard, is eccentric, unpredictable, and colourful, the blustery Muggle, Vernon, is conventional, regimented, and bland.  

The specific events resulting in Harry's being orphaned, rather than revealed in this chapter, are gradually uncovered throughout the series. They are included here by way of reference.

After partially hearing a prophecy connecting him to Harry Potter, a Dark wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], tipped off by an informer, located Harry's wizard parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]. Voldemort attacked the Potters' house in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], a tiny village, killing James before Lily and Harry could escape. Lily was also killed, her desperate pleas to spare her and her son's lives mercilessly ignored. Voldemort then cast a lethal curse at Harry that ricocheted off the toddler, fatally striking Voldemort instead.

During Harry's first year at Hogwarts, he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|encounters the disembodied Voldemort]], who states that Harry's mother need not have died. It was Lily's sacrificial attempt to save Harry that created an ancient and protective magic, causing the deadly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|curse]] to rebound off Harry onto Voldemort. This act formed an as yet unknown connection between attacker and victim, during which Voldemort's powers were partially transferred to the infant, leaving a lightning-bolt shaped scar on Harry's forehead. The protection that Lily gave her son — which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] later explains as her love for Harry — destroyed Voldemort's physical body and would have killed him completely had it not been for the Dark magic he previously used to splinter his soul into shards called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Voldemort's downfall renders Harry into a celebrated figure in the Wizarding world, hailed as a hero and the only person known to have survived the Killing curse.

It is entirely possible that, due to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius charm]] that was meant to protect the Potters from Voldemort still being active, Hagrid would have been unable to find their house until one of those privy to the secret of the Potters' location arrived on the scene. We can safely assume that Sirius Black, as one of James' closest friends, would have been one of them. Sirius does say in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 19|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] that he &quot;saw the bodies and the house's destruction&quot;, so he must have been let into the secret by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] (who we will meet in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|the third book]]), probably at James Potter's direct request. It has been conjectured that Hagrid was unable to enter the house's remains to recover Harry, and it may have been Black who actually removed Harry from the wreckage and passed him to Hagrid to carry back to Little Whinging. Hagrid does say, however, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|Chapter 4]], that he took Harry from the wreckage, so we have to assume that either Hagrid was also privy to the secret, or else the Fidelius charm ends automatically when the secret it is designed to protect (in this case, James and Lily's whereabouts) is no longer operative. We could speculate as to which it is, but given that the house is apparently visible to all wizards by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|the seventh book]], it is most likely that the charm expired either upon Lily's death, even though baby Harry was left alive; or upon removal of Harry from the house.

There is no little bit of debate about the expression &quot;house was almost destroyed&quot; used in this chapter, and the similar terms &quot;destruction,&quot; &quot;wreckage,&quot; &quot;rubble,&quot; and &quot;debris&quot; used to describe the Potter house after the events of 31 October. We have since discovered that the destruction was confined to Harry's nursery where Lily was killed and Harry was sleeping. We will find later that curses, if they miss, cause destruction; but the Killing Curse does not affect objects, only people, and so does not leave wreckage if it hits its target. On the other two occasions when a killing curse rebounds, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|in the Forbidden Forest]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|in the Great Hall]] during the series' final battle, there were no explosions or damage to anything outside Voldemort. It has been pointed out that these two cases were different, in the first as Voldemort did not actually get struck by the full force of the rebound, and in both cases because the wand Voldemort was using was not truly his own. Some weight is given the theory that the destruction occurred at the time the spell rebounded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|Voldemort's recollections of that event]], where he remembers having to flee the &quot;rubble&quot; of the failed attack, but as he had just been killed by his own spell, it is possible that the rubble in question was purely in the remains of his own mind.

There was some speculation, before the release of the seventh book, that the house could have been damaged in Voldemort's encounter with James. Voldemort's memories of that event reveal that the &quot;duel&quot; with James did not damage anything in the house. Likewise, Voldemort's dispatching of Lily did not result in any damage to the house, so any damage that occurred must have been either when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, or afterwards. Thus, following Voldemort's attack on Harry, there would remain a standing house (possibly with a large hole in the second story), and three dead bodies. Added to this, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Voldemort regained his original wand, and we are led to conclude that someone had accompanied Voldemort, witnessed his downfall, recovered his wand (and perhaps concealed his body), and probably damaged the house. This may have been an act of revenge or frustration, but whoever did this left Harry unscathed, perhaps fearing that whatever felled Voldemort could also kill anyone attacking Harry. As it is Pettigrew who restores Voldemort's wand to him, it is a safe assumption that Pettigrew was the unknown third party. From Pettigrew's personality as revealed in later books, we can safely expect that, if he followed Voldemort into the house and found his corpse, he would be too scared to do anything except get out of there as quickly as possible, which would include blasting a hole through the wall to escape proximity to Harry. That Voldemort, in his memory of that night as viewed in the seventh book, does not recall Pettigrew accompanying him is inconclusive. Voldemort generally pays little attention to his minions unless they have failed him or were merely in his way.

Hagrid having seen the wreckage, and having taken Harry out of the house himself, indicates that Hagrid was trusted enough to be privy to the secret of the Potters' whereabouts. While this is never mentioned, it is possible that Hagrid is already &quot;Keeper of the Keys and Grounds&quot; at Hogwarts at that point. We will later discover that, when Harry enters Hogwarts, Hagrid is about 60 years old; so, when James and Lily entered Hogwarts, he would have been about 40, and likely would have held that job already for several years &amp;mdash; it is possible Dumbledore started him assisting the then incumbent in that position when he was expelled from Hogwarts, in his third year at age 14. Harry trusts Hagrid, within the limits of his understanding of Hagrid's abilities; it is not a great stretch to believe that James trusted him as much.

Also of note: The flying motorbike Hagrid arrives on actually belongs to Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, who was falsely implicated in and later imprisoned for the Potters', Peter Pettigrew's, and twelve Muggle bystanders' deaths. Though mentioned here, Sirius appears later in book 3.

=== Connections ===

One of the characteristics of this series of books that makes it interesting is the connections throughout the series; seemingly insignificant characters or objects appearing in one book that are then referred to in another. These indicate that the entire seven-book arc had been to a large extent planned out before pen first hit paper. In the interests of highlighting these areas where connections are made throughout the story arc, many chapters will contain a Connections section like this one, in which those characters and items that connect from earlier books, to later books, or within the same book can be detailed.

This first chapter of the story, of course, sets up the entire story arc, with its mentions of the evil Voldemort, our hero Harry who survived his attack, his relatives the Dursleys, and the Wizarding world. However, the following specific items, which reappear later in our story, should be specifically mentioned:

*Sirius Black will reappear as the putative villain of the third story in the series, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. He will then play roles in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].
*Sirius Black's flying motorcycle will appear again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where it will carry Harry away from Privet Drive. It will eventually crash, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 6|the wreckage will be transferred]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s home, where he will attempt to reconstruct it.
*The &quot;Put-outer&quot; will appear again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] will use it to extinguish street lights as the Advance Guard takes Harry into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]]. Renamed a Deluminator, it will be bequeathed to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 19|Ron will discover]] that apart from its effects on lights, it also has the ability to pick up conversations in which its owner is named, and transport its owner to the conversation's location. It will be used to help Ron and Harry escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 23|in that book]] also.
*McGonagall's changing shape from human to cat and back will be revisited in in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], where we learn that this is a very difficult bit of magic called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus transform]]. This transformation will have additional connections and ramifications, which will be discussed in that chapter.
*We will find in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that Petunia had applied for admission to Hogwarts and been declined. This rejection very likely formed a large part of her attitude towards magic, including her denial of Harry's magic coupled with a surprising amount of awareness of the magical world.
*It is mentioned that Dumbledore's nose looked like it had been broken &quot;at least twice&quot;. We will find out that one of those times likely occurred at his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|younger sister's]] funeral, and the damage was done by his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|brother]]. The story will not be revealed until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the final book in the series.]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">After you have the proper posture, the next step is to learn to breathe correctly. Breathe deeply. As you breathe imagine you are smelling a rose and feel your lower back expand. This will help you gather all the air necessary to hold long notes. This will not happen right away but with time you will be doing it. 
First start singing the vowels. One good way to understand how to sing correctly is to feel as if you are yawning. If you notice, your throat will expand and allow the air to flow freely. Practice scales from high to low, and low to high without hurting yourself. You want to start easy and build as you practice. If a note is too high for you, don't try it. This will warm up your larynx and allow you to stretch your vocal cords.

== Exercises ==
Professional singing is done from the diaphragm, so a singer's midriff should move, not their shoulders as though they were panting. One simple exercise is to lie on the ground and place a light book or box on the midriff. This way, you can see the box moving up and down when you are singing correctly.

Once you have been singing for a while, you may want to &quot;improve your range&quot;. This means that you wish to be able to hit more notes correctly and without hurting yourself. To do this, simply go through scales as normal, but when you get to the highest note you can hit, flip your head upside down and try to hit that elusive high note. Chances are you will be able to do it!

If you want to hit a low note, do the same as described above except flip your head back instead of forward.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finding an Algorithm==
In many cases, the issue is finding or creating any algorithm.  Here are some hints to get past the algorithm writers block, to find an existing algorithm you didn't know existed, and new ways to find algorithms you already knew existed.

; Phone a friend. : Thoroughly explaining the problem you need to solve to someone else in person, on the phone, or in email often allows you to generate a solution.  Your friend might have a solution as well.
; Read an algorithm textbook. : Skimming or reading an algorithm textbook can produce more terms for web searches, and fields likely to use this algorithm.  You might just stumble on the answer.
; Search in other fields. : If you can express your problem as a problem in other fields, such as computer graphics, other resources become viable.
; Try a newsgroup. : There's a really good chance that someone else has experienced this problem before.  Open source solutions may already be available.

==Choosing an Algorithm==
In the case where you find more than one appropriate algorithm, you can use these ideas to compare their suitability for your application.  

; Implement, then optimize. : All algorithms available may be good enough.
; Performance : How does it run on your typical data?  How does it run on your exceptional data?
; Ease of Implementation : How quickly can you get this algorithm implemented and running?
; Scalability : What is the order (big O notation) of the algorithm?  How does it scale with more input?  How does it scale with more complex input?
; Maintainability : How easy is the algorithm to understand and maintain?
; Multi-processor compatibility : Do you have multiple processors available?  Does this algorithm maximize their usage?
; Size : Is code size an issue?  Is memory/cache/file size and issue?

These questions will be wieghted differently for different applications.  For instance, a prototype will likely emphasize the ease of implementation over the other criteria.  A search through a massive database is likely to emphasize performance over the other criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{This module needs expanding}

Post processing is process of editing the data captured by camera while taking the photo to enhance the image. Better the data captured during clicking of photo better is the enhancement possibility. There are more and more camera which have come into market which can capture RAW files. Raw files has much more data at pixel level which and help in post processing and enhancing the image. 

Post processing can surely help in enhancing the image but might not be able to convert a really bad exposure to excellent one. There are various stages of post processing based on what is the final result that one wants to achieve.

# Fine tuning of RAW file.
# Converting RAW file to easily readable formats like jpg/png/tiff.
# Editing of jpg to remove unwanted features.
# Mixing of various files to achieve creative result.

==Software ==
There are basically two things that are done in post processing : 

# An algorithm is run on all existing data of pixel and minor changes are applied to pixel data.
# Manually selecting and Replacing the pixel data with total new data.

There are software by camera manufacturers, specialist software vendors and there are also freeware and free software available for taking care of post processing needs.

RAW file handling and conversion is possible in RawTherapee, UFRAW, darktable, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe camera RAW, FSViewer and many more. 

Jpg file editing is generally done in image editors that have various features such as grain and red-eye removal, for example, the [[w:GIMP|Gimp]](free), or Adobe [[w:Photoshop|Photoshop]], or Photoshop Elements.

==Work flow of post processing ==

There are lot of changes possible during post processing. Sequence of these changes is important as change made at one stage can affect the effectiveness of next stage. Most of the software are also organized in a fashion to guide the users through a smooth work flow.

Few actions can achieve great results when applied in RAW file. These can also yield result in jpg files in case you do not have RAW file. 

Some of actions that may be preferred while editing RAW file are
# Exposure Value adjustment
# White balance adjustment
# Hue and tone adjustment
# Highlight and shadow recovery
# Vibrance and saturation adjustment
# Cropping &amp; Rotation

Some of the actions that can be done at RAW or jpg stage are
# Noise reduction
# Sharpening

Some of the actions that are preferred after conversion to jpg files are
# Red-eye removal
# Local touch up of cloning to erase unwanted object in frame
# Adding of frame
# Mixing with other jpg files like changing the background.

===Removing red-eye===
[[File:Severe red eye.jpg|thumb|Example of red-eye.]]
It's much better to avoid red-eye than to try and remove it in post-processing, as red-eye means you lose the color details of your subjects eyes and can't recover it.

Basically it is done by replacing the red flare with black and adding a white high light to the black dot.

Some Photo-Editing programs provide &quot;Red-eye&quot; removal effects.

===Adjusting Colour balance===

When photos are taken, some colours often do not appear real. This can be adjusted using the software above. Microsoft Photo Editor, for instance, allows you to balance individual colours and preview them before okaying them.

=== Converting to black and white ===
Many times one can emphasize certain picture by converting it to gray-scale. There are various ways of doing so depending on software being used.
* Converting layer from RGB to Gray-scale
* De-saturating
* Decomposing to HSV or RGB and using one or more layers to compose the image

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital Photography is in a class other than 'normal' photography.  While traditional photography uses photographic media that reacts when exposed to light (creating a picture), digital photography uses a photosensitive plate that translates the wavelength of the light that strikes it into 1's or 0's, hence the name digital.  Both forms of photography, however, use optical lenses to focus light onto the respective medium.

== Digital vs. Traditional ==

The sequence of 1's and 0's that make up the photograph is called a file.  The file, and effectively the photograph, can be reproduced perfectly and also transferred over the internet or other forms of digital communication without loss of quality.

The disadvantages of digital photography are directly related to limits in technology.  To have a high quality image, you have to have an extremely large amount of 1's and 0's.  The limiting factor is the plate that translates the light into digits.  In first generation digital technology, the plates were not very good at digitizing the light, and so digital photographs taken with these plates look fuzzy and &quot;squarey.&quot;  In the past few years, however, technology has advanced so that the plates are much more effective at digitizing light, and pictures can be taken at much higher qualities.

The resolution of an image taken by traditional means is limited by the film it is taken on and the lens that focuses the light.  Some film is better than others, and some lenses are better than others.  While mild enlarging and cropping of a traditional photograph can be done in the darkroom without much loss of resolution, the sharpness and clarity of the image decreases as the image is enlarged and less of the surface area of the film is being used to create the photographic print. This does not refer to the effects of &quot;zooming in&quot; with a tele-photo lens, which vary greatly depending on the lens and can be just as sharp as any other kind of photo. Because the whole surface of the film is still being used when one uses a tele-photo lens the quality of the image will be equal to an image captured on the same film with any other lens of equal quality.

The resolution of a digital image is limited to the quality of the plate and to the quality of the lens in the same way that a traditional photograph is limited by the film and the lens.  A higher quality plate records more information (measured in pixels or Megapixels), in the same way that a lower ISO film is able to record a higher resolution image. In the same way that a traditional photograph loses sharpness and clarity when it is enlarged, digital images that are later cropped either to alter the composition or &quot;zoom in&quot; decrease in quality as the resolution decreases and noise becomes more apparent. Lower-quality digital images are notorious, however, for losing quality much more rapidly than a traditional photograph.

One advantage that digital photography has over traditional is that digital photographs can be stored on a computer or a small data storage device. Because digital photographs are digital information they can be imported into sophisticated image editing software where they can be manipulated in both very simple and very complex ways. Traditional photographs must be developed on expensive film whether you want the picture or not, while digital photographs only need to be printed on photo paper if you want the image on photo paper.  Also, the beauty of digital means that you can instantly see what your photograph looks like on some cameras that have an LCD screen for viewing, while traditional photographs have to be developed (greater expense and time) before you can see the image.

Naturally, however, there are also advantages to traditional photography that digital photography cannot replicate. Currently, the startup price for a serious hobbyist or fine art photographer wishing to do digital is much higher than a photographer pursuing traditional methods. For one to seriously begin working digitally and obtain high quality results they must purchase a fairly modern computer, expensive software, a printer, and a camera (serious digital SLRs have just recently fallen below $1,000USD), not to mention still having to pay for paper and ink. Whereas both old and modern film based equipment can easily be purchased for very low prices used while offering results that are of equal quality.

However, it is important to remember that the greatest diversity of images can only be reached by utilizing both digital and traditional, along with other alternative processes. Certain mediums are better suited for certain situations and at times it can be good to let go of some control by allowing a traditional medium to cause spontaneous effects outside of your control, while at other times it may be more appropriate to have the tight control of digital. If you never let the medium take some control then you will not have the opportunity to learn from your mistakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knoppix includes many other useful and fun applications. There isn't space to describe them all fully here. In this section are some of the highlights to look out for.
= Graphics =
== The Gimp ==
[[File:Wilber_gimp2.2.8_Knoppix4.0.2.png|thumb|right|Gimp 2.2.8 in [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm|twm]] (Knoppix 4.0.2)]]
The [[GIMP|GNU Image Manipulation Program]]&lt;SUP&gt;[[:w:en:GNU Image Manipulation Program|Wikipedia article]]&lt;/SUP&gt; (The Gimp) is a wonderful graphics editor. It is for painting, image editing and photo retouching. Many people think The Gimp is the greatest thing after Linux itself.

*To start using it in KDE, click K menu -&amp;gt; Multimedia -&amp;gt; Graphics -&amp;gt; The Gimp.
*In [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm|twm]], click on the desktop, hold down the mouse button for the Main Menu and follow through Debian &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Graphics &amp;gt; The GIMP.

The screenshot thumbnail shows Wilber, the Gimp's mascot. Wilber was created by Tuomas Kuosmanen, also known as “Tiger T”. Underneath is the Gimp Toolbox, and a Brushes dialog.&lt;BR STYLE=&quot;clear:right&quot;&gt;

==ImageMagick==
[[File:ImageMagick6.0.6 Knoppix4.0.2.png|thumb|right|ImageMagick 6.0.6 in twm (Knoppix 4.0.2)]]
[[:w:ImageMagick|ImageMagick]] is the mainstay of classic Knoppix versions (those older than 6.0) and typically takes less resources than The GIMP, so resource usage depends on actual image size.

ImageMagick contains many image editing features, which for an advanced user manifest in the number of command-line utilities; For common users, it uses an X GUI for showing and changing images called IMDisplay.

===Invoking===
*KDE: K menu &amp;gt; Multimedia &amp;gt; Viewers &amp;gt; ImageMagick
*twm: Main Menu &amp;gt; Debian &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Viewers &amp;gt; ImageMagick
*From the console ImageMagick is invoked with the &lt;CODE&gt;display&lt;/CODE&gt; command.

===Characteristics===
In Knoppix, ImageMagick typically starts up with a default image and a file open dialog. To access functions outside opening a file right away, the user must close the filepicker and click once on the default image, which will open the Commands window.

Thus clicking on an image (not just the default image) opens or closes the Commands window.

ImageMagick uses a very basic graphical user interface (GUI), much of which consists of the Commands window, function menus and manipulation dialogs, all of which must be operated with a mouse.

Clicking a function button opens a command menu, but moving the mouse cursor away or clicking on other windows does not close menus (at least in twm). A user can have one menu be closed by clicking on another menu button to access functions there; to close a menu until further use, the user must click on the &quot;Image Magick&quot; logo in the Commands window.

Closing an image window from a window manager also closes ImageMagick.

===Caveats===
In Knoppix 4.0.2 it is impossible to make screenshots with ImageMagick (or through a command line with &lt;CODE&gt;display&lt;/CODE&gt;) because of a bug.

Typically, screenshots can be made through File &amp;gt; Open &amp;gt; Grab, but that won't work; editing the File Open textarea's content from &lt;CODE&gt;/ramdisk/knoppix/x:&lt;/CODE&gt; to something else won't help and the program will yield this error text:
 unable to open image `/ramdisk/knoppix/x:': No such file or directory :
 [empty space for text]

The solution is to use either of the following alternatives in order of resource usage (the list is slightly subjective):
*'''KSnapshot,''' which uses underlying libraries of KDE and its framework. Invoked through
:*KDE: K Menu &amp;gt; Graphics &amp;gt; Screen Capture Program
:*twm: Main Menu &amp;gt; Debian &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Graphics &amp;gt; KSnapshot
:*Command line: &lt;CODE&gt;ksnapshot&lt;/CODE&gt;
*'''The GIMP''';
*and &amp;mdash;

==X Window Dump==
X Window Dump, or xwd for short, is a command-line app for making screenshots. Being the least resource-intensive of all, it dumps an image of either a targetted window or the whole screen. The simplest way to invoke the program:
 xwd -out imagename.xwd
This changes the mouse cursor to a crosshair pixmap for targetting a window or a free area (the desktop) for the whole screen. The dumped screenshot can then be converted to PNG with ImageMagick. For more on xwd and making PNG screendumps from the outset, see [[Guide to X11/Starting Sessions#Making screenshots|Starting Sessions#Making screenshots]] from the [[Guide to X11]] wikibook or the xwd man page.

In twm, one can write the command in the [[w:rxvt|rxvt]] console whilst not yet executing it, then iconify the rxvt window and move its icon to an accessible area. The user can then bring up a desired visual setup for the screenshot, move the mouse over the rxvt icon (and not de-iconify it) and then press enter.

This works by way of an rxvt window being able to receive input even when ''iconified'', with the mouse cursor hovering above the icon either on the desktop or in the TWM Icon Manager. &amp;mdash; Such behaviour in Knoppix has been observed to be specific to rxvt only.

;Caveat
In Knoppix 4.0.2, xwd is unable to capture the main OpenOffice.org window or the root window showing the main OO.o window, if screen color depth for Knoppix has been set to 16 bits (65,536 colours) with the &lt;CODE&gt;depth=16&lt;/CODE&gt; startup parameter. Attempting to make a screenshot at that color depth will yield an error. This may be because of OO.o's use of gradients in its user interface.

The solution is to try to make a screenshot with GIMP or to run Knoppix with color depth of at least 24 bits; monitor and video adapter combinations not supporting such a set-up are few and far between.

= Office applications =
== OpenOffice.org office suite ==
[[Image:Openofficescreenshot-andrew.jpg|thumb|right|OpenOffice.org 1.1.3 in a setup similar to Knoppix 3.7 ([[Linux Guide/Distros in detail#Mandriva|Mandriva Linux]] 10.1&lt;SUP&gt;Mandrakelinux at the time&lt;/SUP&gt;)]]
[[OpenOffice.org]] is the slowest but most powerful office application in Knoppix. OpenOffice.org combines word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, drawing, and databases in one huge package.

On older computers, OpenOffice.org versions 2.x and earlier may take several minutes to start, because the application takes its time loading language aids (dictionaries and thesauri). Every successive version of the package has more language aids with it.

''For instructions on how to disable writing aids and other optimization tips, see the [[OpenOffice.org/Performance_Tips|Performance Tips]] chapter from the OpenOffice.org book.''

As part of framework changes, language aids are integrated in the form of separate extension modules with OO.o 3.0 and later and language modules' default amount reduced as a result (as usual, every language-specific installation of OO.o still includes the modules specific to its respective package).

Starting with Knoppix 6.4.3, the distribution has switched to [[:w:en:LibreOffice|LibreOffice]], a functionally equivalent fork of OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bodnar |first=Ladislav |title=Distribution Release: KNOPPIX 6.4.3 |publisher=Distrowatch |date=2010-12-24 |url=http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=06424 |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invoking===
To begin using OpenOffice.org:
;In KDE:
Click K menu -&amp;gt; Office -&amp;gt; OpenOffice.org -&amp;gt; OpenOffice.
;In [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm|twm]]:
In Knoppix 4.0.2, OpenOffice.org is absent from the default menu; This means that other window managers in Knoppix lack the relevant menu hooks, too. A user can start OO.o from the command line, or rectify this situation by adding the following preformatted text to the local [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm#.twmrc|.twmrc]] file:

&amp;bull; Add text (boldfaced here for emphasis) into the section (within curly brackets) of the Debian submenu:
 menu &quot;/Debian&quot;
 {
   &quot;Apps&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/Apps&quot;
   '''&quot;OpenOffice.org&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/OOo&quot;'''
   &quot;Games&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/Games&quot;
   &quot;Help&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/Help&quot;
   &quot;Screen&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/Screen&quot;
   &quot;System&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/System&quot;
   &quot;XShells&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/XShells&quot;
 }
&amp;bull; Then add the following (avoid pasting inside other menu sections):&lt;PRE&gt;menu &quot;/Debian/OOo&quot; {
&quot;Writer&quot; f.exec &quot;soffice -writer -nocrashreport &amp;&quot;
&quot;Web&quot; f.exec &quot;soffice -web -nocrashreport &amp;&quot;
&quot;Calc&quot; f.exec &quot;soffice -calc -nocrashreport &amp;&quot;
&quot;Impress&quot; f.exec &quot;soffice -impress -nocrashreport &amp;&quot;
&quot;Math&quot; f.exec &quot;soffice -math -nocrashreport &amp;&quot;
&quot;Global&quot; f.exec &quot;soffice &amp;&quot;
}&lt;/PRE&gt;
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:88%&quot;&gt;^ Using the &lt;CODE&gt;-nocrashreport&lt;/CODE&gt; flag for &lt;CODE&gt;soffice&lt;/CODE&gt; alone causes OO.o to launch with Writer; &lt;CODE&gt;-global&lt;/CODE&gt; or &lt;CODE&gt;-nodefault&lt;/CODE&gt; command-line flags are thus not necessary.&lt;/span&gt;

:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:88%&quot;&gt;In a computer environment with a limited amount of useful (RAM) memory, using the &lt;CODE&gt;-nocrashreport&lt;/CODE&gt; command-line option disables invoking the crash reporter, if it happens that OO.o crashes and OO.o's document recovery mechanism and crash reporter are invoked at next program start.&lt;/span&gt;

:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:88%&quot;&gt;The crash reporter would ask for confirmation to send crash data to Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in 2010). If the crash reporter does appear, then it's best not to send crash data, because Knoppix has moved away from OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice and it's pointless to send crash data about earlier OO.o versions.&lt;/span&gt;

&amp;bull; Save &lt;CODE&gt;.twmrc&lt;/CODE&gt; and restart twm.

;Command line:
&lt;PRE&gt;soffice &amp;#91;-writer|-web|-calc|-impress|-math&amp;#93; &amp;#91;-nocrashreport&amp;#93;&lt;/PRE&gt;
^ Flags in square brackets to start different OO.o apps are optional.

== KOffice ==
[[w:KOffice|KOffice]] is a simple office suite, for word-processing, spreadsheet, drawing, presentations and other tasks. Unlike OpenOffice, KOffice is quick to start. To begin, click K menu -&gt; Office -&gt; KOffice, then click the program you would like to use.

KOffice is present in Knoppix versions of up to 3.1&amp;ndash;3.3 and 4.0.2&amp;ndash;5.3.1. CD variants of these versions of the distribution might not contain it.

== Gnumeric ==
[[Image:Gnumeric 1.6.3 Ubuntu.png|right|thumb|Gnumeric 1.6.3]]
[[w:Gnumeric|Gnumeric]] is a powerful standalone spreadsheet application. Like KOffice, Gnumeric is quick to start. To begin, click K menu -&amp;gt; Office -&amp;gt; Gnumeric.

Gnumeric is present in Knoppix versions up to 3.1&amp;ndash;3.3; 4.0.2&amp;ndash;5.3.1 and 6.2.1&amp;ndash;6.4.4 (the latest version). Modern CD variants might not contain it.

== AbiWord ==
[[w:AbiWord|AbiWord]] is a simple word standalone processor. To get started, click K menu -&gt; Office -&gt; AbiWord word processor. Compared to OpenOffice Writer and KOffice, abiword is lighter with less bloat.

=Wine=
[[:w:Wine (software)|Wine]] is an application compatibility layer that allows programs written for Windows to run in Linux. Its self-explanatory meaning has become a recursive backronym, which is '''''W'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot an '''E'''mulator''.

Knoppix has typically included a contemporary snapshot of the program's releases, which are more outdated with every older version of the distribution. While Wine can run a large variety of Windows applications, then there are some that won't run with it, and some apps that may run with varying degrees of success.

==Invoking==
One way to invoke a Windows program though Wine is through the command line:
 $ wine /path/to/application.exe
Assuming an existing Windows installation on a hard drive, programs can be run from there by mounting the hard drive:
 $ mount /mnt/hda1
and then invoking Wine to run an application originally made for Windows:
 $ wine &quot;/mnt/hda1/Program Files/K-Meleon/k-meleon.exe&quot;
[[File:Wine20050725Launch Knoppix4.0.2.png|thumb|right|Wine Launch Window.&lt;br&gt;Wine v.20050725 at Knoppix 4.0.2]]
:&lt;SMALL STYLE=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt;'''^''' Because the &lt;CODE&gt;Program Files&lt;/CODE&gt; folder contains a space, the whole path must be surrounded with double quotes.&lt;/SMALL&gt;
In either case, the Wine Launch Window will start, to notify the user of the activity. The launch window can be set not to be shown in the future when invoking Wine.

If Wine hasn't been run before, the Wine launch processes create necessary configuration folders and support files and then launch the requested application (the K-Meleon browser in this case).

After exiting a Window program, Wine will show either a status message that the program closed with success or an error message. A number of seconds may pass between the apparent program exit and the status message.

==Caveats present in Knoppix 4.0.2==
Depending on a version of Knoppix, Wine might or might not be included in the default menu file.

The following are caveats specific to Knoppix 4.0.2. Wine version 20050725 is a pre-beta release and running Windows software with that may not be easy:

* The Wine menuitem is not in the default menu file in Knoppix 4.0.2;
* Shortcut menus of programs that use the native Windows widget toolkit are inaccessible; Commands from the menu bar can only be accessed classic Mac-style: by clicking on a menu item and holding the mouse button down the menu to reach and invoke a command. (This has been observed in the twm window manager.)
* Standard text find functionality does not work, while alternative implementations do (examples are various find bars);
* Some newer applications' functionality is hampered: For example, the URL bar in K-Meleon 1.5.4 is not functional &amp;mdash; URLs can be entered by editing bookmarks and then accessing those.

===Non-permanence===
After using a Windows program through Wine, saving the configuration and restarting the computer with said configuration, launching Windows programs becomes impossible because of very slightly corrupted file paths. A workaround is to delete the &lt;CODE&gt;.wine&lt;/CODE&gt; configuration directory in the local user folder:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;knoppix@[knoppix]$ rm -r -f .wine&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
:&lt;SMALL STYLE=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt;''^'' Where: &lt;CODE&gt;rm&lt;/CODE&gt; (remove) is the delete command, &lt;CODE&gt;-r&lt;/CODE&gt; stands for ''recursive'' (deletes the folder), &lt;CODE&gt;-f&lt;/CODE&gt; stands for ''force &amp;#91;delete&amp;#93;'', which does not ask for confirmation before deletion (therefore no verbosity).&lt;/SMALL&gt;
&amp;mdash; After that, it's possible to run the programs again but any Wine settings are then also deleted.

===Font issues===
By default, Windows programs' UI texts are displayed in a font called Adventure, which is shown in small type, and is ugly and unsuitable for use in user interfaces. This is because of a bug in Wine, which has been fixed in later versions, but software on a Live-CD distribution is static and therefore requires a workaround described below.

Upon starting a Windows program for the first time, Wine creates Windows-like support directories and files, along with the Windows fonts directory in the virtual &quot;C&quot; hard drive, the path of which in Knoppix is:

 &lt;SPAN STYLE=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;/home/knoppix/&lt;/SPAN&gt;.wine/drive_c/windows/fonts
The above &lt;CODE&gt;windows/fonts&lt;/CODE&gt; directory is empty and Wine defers to a fallback font, which for some reason is Adventure.

A usual way to solve this issue on permanent Linux installations is to populate the directory with standard fonts, either those made specifically for Windows or with substitutes.

Because of a Live CD's typically non-permanent nature and above caveats, the workaround for a normal user interface font is to create a symbolic link for &lt;CODE&gt;windows/fonts&lt;/CODE&gt; to a specific font directory created in Linux, but all this is effective only ''after'' &lt;CODE&gt;.wine&lt;/CODE&gt; configuration and support folders and files have been created by running a Windows executable for the first time. Symlinking to a font directory goes like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;$ ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera .wine/drive_c/windows/fonts&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
:&lt;SMALL STYLE=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt;'''^''' The dollar &lt;CODE&gt;$&lt;/CODE&gt; sign is traditionally the command-line marker; &lt;CODE&gt;ln&lt;/CODE&gt; is the ''linking'' command, &lt;CODE&gt;-s&lt;/CODE&gt; stands for '''''s'''ymbolic'', the first path is the target path, the second path is the one from which the target is linked to. The symbolic link can be removed in the &lt;CODE&gt;fonts&lt;/CODE&gt; directory with a simple &lt;CODE&gt;rm&lt;/CODE&gt; command.&lt;/SMALL&gt;

[[File:K-Meleon154 Wine Knoppix402.png|thumb|right|The result of setting the default Wine font right, where a Windows program's user interface font looks normal]]
If a user is '''consistently''' using Knoppix 4.0.2 with the configuration saving method, then they can add a command sequence with the above command into their window manager menu file, especially because of the non-permanent nature of Wine configuration data.

The following complex, yet handy, example set of commands for the [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm|twm]] window manager assume the presence of an existing hard drive and a Windows installation on it. The sequence of commands first mounts the hard drive, then starts Wine, which will create support folders and files to launch a screen saver, and then links the actual font folders. The Blank Screen screensaver is one of the smallest possible native Windows apps to close with the least amount of user input (moving a mouse cursor in the screen saver window), which means that the program will close almost by itself.

The highlighted part of configuration text is to be added:
&lt;div style=&quot;height:10.6em; overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--150px--&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot; highlight=&quot;5&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;menu &quot;/Debian/System&quot;
{
  &quot;Security&quot; f.menu &quot;/Debian/System/Security&quot;
  &quot;&quot;    f.nop
  &quot;Set Wine font&quot; f.exec &quot;mount /dev/hda1; wine \&quot;/mnt/hda1/windows/system/Blank Screen.scr\&quot; \/s &amp;&amp; ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera .wine/drive_c/windows/fonts &amp;&quot;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;SMALL STYLE=&quot;font-size:90%&quot;&gt;'''^''' The &lt;CODE&gt;f.nop&lt;/CODE&gt; line following &lt;CODE&gt;Security&lt;/CODE&gt; inserts a line break. &lt;CODE&gt;mount /dev/hda1&lt;/CODE&gt; mounts the hard drive. The colon &lt;CODE&gt;;&lt;/CODE&gt; ensures that the next command is started only after the previous command has been completed. Because &lt;CODE&gt;Blank Screen.scr&lt;/CODE&gt; contains a space, the whole path to it must be wrapped in double quotes; these, in turn, must be escaped with a backslash &lt;CODE&gt;\&lt;/CODE&gt; so as not to break the command sequence. The &lt;CODE&gt;/s&lt;/CODE&gt; option starts the screensaver and not its configuration applet; As the option's trigger character is a forward-slash, which serves to separate directory names in Unix and like systems, then it's also been escaped by a backslash just to be on the safe side. Double ampersands &lt;CODE&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/CODE&gt; serve to execute one ''and'' another command and the last ampersand ensures the command or command sequence separates from its originator.&lt;/SMALL&gt;

===Settings specific to TWM===
[[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm|Twm]] is a window manager, which by the standards of today and at least 21 years back&lt;SUP&gt;(as of 2011)&lt;/SUP&gt; exhibits non-standard behaviour for a windowing environment, where a program window is rendered only after the user has specified its location by moving the window's skeleton crosshairs to a desired place on the screen and then clicking the main mouse/pointer button.

;The following instructions are meant to reduce the amount of user input when running Wine and setting up fonts for it
First off, after launching Wine to run a Windows program, Wine will invoke the Wine Launch Window and then the Windows program itself. This is two instances of moving a pointer and clicking the primary button, which makes four movements. And setting the font right in Knoppix 4.0.2 beforehand will total eight movements.

One workaround is to click the &quot;Never display this message again&quot; button in the Wine Launch Window. The button is self-explanatory.

Nevertheless, the Wine Launch Window also serves the purpose of showing launch status of Wine and some users might want to keep seeing it appear.

Avoiding window skeleton crosshairs by [[Guide to X11/Starting Programs#Specifying window geometry|specifying window geometry]] won't work with Wine, because Wine launches more than one window, and at least one of them is not native to X.

The workaround is in twm's &lt;CODE&gt;.twmrc&lt;/CODE&gt; config file to have the Wine Launch Window start in iconified form:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot; highlight=&quot;5&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;
StartIconified {
&quot;Wine Launch Window&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This will remove the need for the user to place the launch window somewhere. (More windows can be in each following line added by specifying the exact window title or app command with the same syntax.)

Secondly, when setting user interface fonts right for Wine-run apps, a screen saver program is used to invoke Wine itself (See [[#Font issues|Font issues]] above). Because it's a screen saver, it requires the least amount of user input to quit the app, which is why it won't require a title bar (for some reason, attached to the screen saver by default), so as to have the least distance between the cursor and the screensaver proper to dismiss it in nearly a click. The &lt;CODE&gt;NoTitle&lt;/CODE&gt; setting for the screen saver window in the .twmrc file applies here:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot; highlight=&quot;5&quot; enclose=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;
NoTitle {
&quot;Screen Saver&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The user then clicks to render the screen saver to just move the mouse cursor southeast to close the applet. This should take only a second or two.

== KStars planetarium ==
[[w:KStars|KStars]] shows the position of the stars and planets in the sky in real time. KStars can show the view of the sky from hundreds of locations around the world. It also has a catalogue of planets, stars and other objects. To start using KStars, click K menu -&gt; Entertainment -&gt; Science -&gt; KStars.
== Frozen Bubble ==
[[Image:Frozen-bubble-screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Frozen Bubble screenshot]]
[[w:Frozen Bubble|Frozen Bubble]] is an arcade style bubble bursting game for one or two players. The idea is to hit two or more other bubbles of the same colour to make them disappear. To start, click K menu -&gt; Games -&gt; Tetris-like -&gt; Frozen-Bubble.

== KSokoban ==
[[w:KSokoban|KSokoban]] is a gemstone-pushing puzzle game. The object of the game is to move the red diamonds onto the green squares, only by pushing the red diamonds. Move the man using the cursor keys. To begin, click K menu -&gt; Games -&gt; Tactics &amp; Strategy -&gt; KSokoban.
== GTans ==
[[w:GTans|GTans]] is a shape-building puzzle game. Move, rotate and flip the shapes to make the larger shape shown on the right hand side. To start, click K menu -&gt; Games -&gt; Puzzles -&gt; GTans.

=Installing Applications not included on the CD=
==About UnionFS==
Starting with Knoppix 3.8 and higher, there is a new feature included and enabled by default called UnionFS.  This enables ANY file on the filesystem to be changed, and when it is the new file is stored on the RAMdisk, and the system knows not to refer to the &quot;old&quot; version of the file on the CD.

This feature is important to allow you to add software that is not included with the Knoppix distribution easily while running the system from any Internet connected computer (high speed connection recommended).

==Installing Packages==
You will be using the standard debian packaging tool, apt-get.  Don't worry, apt-get is really easy to use.

#First, go to a command prompt with konsole and type in:
 sudo apt-get update
#What this does is update the listing of available packages.  &quot;sudo&quot; runs the command as the super-user, which must be done when working with apt-get.
#Next, find the package you want.  You can find a searchable listing of all packages available for debian at:
 http://packages.debian.org
#After finding your package, type in at the konsole prompt: 
 sudo apt-get install packagename
where &quot;packagename&quot; is replaced with the name of the package you want to install.

As an example, say you want to work with the kdegames package (which includes all the games included by default with the K Desktop Environment).  FYI, this package includes a wide range of games, from remakes of classic arcade games, board games, as well as card games.

All you have to do is type at the prompt: 

 sudo apt-get install kdegames

==Miscellaneous Notes==
You are limited in the amount of packages you can install by the amount of your physical RAM.  When you run apt-get, it will tell you the amount of space the packages take up.  Watch how many packages you install, if you have 256 MB of RAM it's probably not wise (but may be possible) to install about 230 MB of packages.

If the lack of packages on the CD concerns you, don't worry.  There is now a Knoppix Live DVD, which includes over 9 gigs of software (uncompressed) on the DVD... All your favorite packages are likely included on this DVD!

To install more than one package, simply put a space between each package you want to install, like this:

 apt-get install kdegames planetpenguin-racer gnome-games bsdgames


Note to all debian users. Anyone who has used debian before will probably be itching to issue
 apt-get upgrade
You are urged not to do this as knoppix has many custom scripts that apt-get upgrade seems to break.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Common hardware =
Knoppix has built-in hardware identification. This means Knoppix can identify the make and model of a huge range of common PC components, such as processors, graphics cards, network cards, and so on. To [[w:use|use]] the hardware identification:
#Click K Menu.
#Click System.
#Click Info Center.&lt;br/&gt;
#The ''[[w:Info Center|Info Center]]'' application will come up. On the left side are the various categories. Click a category to view the details.&lt;br/&gt;
The most useful categories are:
*Processor (Central Processing Unit).
*Memory (Random Access Memory, or RAM).
*Partitions (partitions on hard disks and other drives).
*PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect cards).
*PCMCIA (credit-card sized cards for laptops. PCMCIA stands for Personal Computer Manufacturer Interface Adapter).
*Storage Devices (hard disks and other drives).
*USB Devices (Universal Serial Bus peripherals).
;Note :If you plug in a new USB device, and you are already on the USB Devices page, choose any other category and then select USB Devices again to refresh the list.

= Listing hard disks =
To get a listing of the hard disk drives in the computer, including the make and model of each one:
#Click the Konsole (bottom row, 6th from the left).
#Enter the following command, then press Enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[w:dmesg|dmesg]]&lt;/code&gt;
#The &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; command shows the “kernel messages”. You will get quite a lot of output. Scroll up about two-thirds of the way until you see lines like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;hda: ST320410A, ATA DISK drive&lt;br/&gt;hdc: JLMS XJ-HD165H, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive&lt;br/&gt;hdd: LITE-ON LTR-52327S, ATAPI CD/RW drive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The example above is from a computer with IDE drives. It has one hard disk drive and two CD drives. The primary master (hda) is a “Seagate Technology 320410A” hard disk drive. “ATA” stands for “AT Attachment”. The secondary master (hdc) is a DVD drive and the secondary slave (hdd) is a CD writer.
;Tip 
:To see only the lines from &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; that contain the letters “hd”, enter:
:&lt;code&gt;dmesg | grep hd&lt;/code&gt;
:The “|” character is a vertical bar, not a capital “i”.
:On a UK keyboard layout, the vertical bar is on the key between “Z” and the left “Shift”.

= Limitations =
The ability to identify hardware is tremendously useful. However, there are [[w:limitations|limitations]] you should know about.
== Hardware newer than Knoppix ==
The most important limitation is that Knoppix cannot accurately identify PCI and PCMCIA hardware that is newer than Knoppix is. USB and Firewire devices work differently and are not subject to this limitation.

This book comes with Knoppix version 3.3, which is dated September 2003. Knoppix should be able to identify most hardware made before that date (except the very old or very rare).

However, Knoppix version 3.3 may only be able to identify PCI and PCMCIA hardware made after September 2003 as an “Unknown device”. A newer version of Knoppix may help. A newer version can be obtained from the Knoppix web site and from other vendors.

== Winmodems ==
The vast majority of modems made these days are [[w:winmodem|winmodems]].  A ''winmodem'' is a modem that relies on the CPU for some of it's communication routines.  This is done to save a few components and reduce manufacturing costs. ''Winmodems'' tend not to work well with Linux.  A common example is the Intel 537 series of PCI internal modem cards.

Knoppix can only tell you what a winmodem identifies itself as, in its hardware. Knoppix cannot tell you about the Windows-specific software needed to get it working in Windows. For example, in the case of Intel 537 based winmodems, there are many different vendor-specific Windows drivers, which may be incompatible with each other. However, these cards will all be reported the same in Knoppix. That is more a limitation of the hardware, rather than a limitation of Knoppix.
== Identified does not mean supported ==
Knoppix may not have driver support for all the hardware it can identify. In other words, just because Knoppix tells you the make and model of a device does not mean it actually works in Knoppix. For example, the Intel 536EP internal modem PCI card is accurately identified; but it is not usable because it requires proprietary software that cannot be distributed with Knoppix.
== Not guaranteed ==
The identification provided by Knoppix may be wrong. This is because Knoppix is not perfect (sorry). However, it is pretty reliable. For example, in two years of using Knoppix every day, I have had only one instance of wrongly identified hardware (a fairly obscure sound card).

The hardware identification strings are mostly provided by Linux users, rather than the hardware vendors themselves. However, the hardware vendors are not perfect either. Sometimes the Linux users' identification corrects mistakes made by hardware vendors!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knoppix supports all IDE and most SCSI hard disk drives. It reads files from the full range of Microsoft operating systems – from MS-DOS through to Windows XP.

This is useful because if you cannot start Windows, often all the data files are still there happily on the hard disk. On many occasions, it is a simple matter to locate the files using Knoppix. It is usually then equally trivial to rescue the files by copying them somewhere safe (explained in the later sections).

To browse the files on the internal hard disk, look on the Desktop. You should see an icon for each ''hard disk partition''. To access the files on that partition:
#Click the icon for the hard disk partition.
#Wait for a moment while the partition is ''mounted''. A green triangle will appear, indicating that the partition is in use.
#Wait while the ''Konqueror'' file manager starts up.
#The files on the partition should be displayed, read only. This example shows a typical “drive C:” from a computer that usually runs Windows 98.
= Selecting files and folders =
To create data CDs and copy files and folders onto other disks, you need to know how to select. There are several [[w:ways to select|ways to select]] files and folders:
*Lasso. Click and hold the left mouse button on a blank area in the ''Konqueror'' window. Drag across to the opposite corner. The files and folders in the marked area will be selected. To deselect, click any blank area within the window.
*Ctrl + click. Hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard, and click a file or folder. It will be selected. To deselect, Ctrl + click the file or folder icon again, or click any blank area within the window.
*Shift + click. Ctrl + click the first file or folder. Let go of the Ctrl Key. Hold down the Shift key, and select the last file or folder. The range will be selected. To deselect, click any blank area within the window.
*Right-click. Click the right hand mouse button on a file or folder. A “context menu” will appear, showing the most common actions for that item. The file or folder will also be selected. To deselect, click any blank area within the window.

= Enabling write access =
Knoppix has the optional ability to [[w:write|write]] to hard disk drives. ''Write mode'' lets you copy files to the drive, and change existing files. Knoppix supports writing to MS-DOS and Windows 95/98/Me formatted partitions. Writing to native Windows NT/2000/XP partitions is not supported. To enable write access:
#Click the icon of the hard disk partition you want to write to.
#Wait for a moment while the partition is mounted.
#Wait while the ''Konqueror'' file manager starts up.
#The files on the partition will be displayed.
#Right-click the icon of the hard disk partition.
#Click “Change read/write mode”.
#You will be prompted to make the partition ''writeable''. Click “Yes”.
#You should now be able to write files to the partition.
= Quick help =
'''Question: There are no icons for the hard disk on the Desktop.'''&lt;br/&gt;
If you have an IDE hard disk, this usually means the BIOS did not detect the hard disk drive. Go into your motherboard's BIOS and make sure the hard disk is detected by the BIOS properly. If you have one of the recent “Serial ATA” hard drives, they are not supported in this version of Knoppix. Try a newer version of Knoppix.

'''Question: I still can't access the hard disk.'''&lt;br/&gt;
The partition may be encrypted, which means it may have been specially set up on purpose to make it inaccessible to outside tools like Knoppix. The partition table may be incorrect, or there may be data errors. In the worst case, the drive may be physically damaged; listen for ping-pong ball bouncing or loud rattling noises.

'''Question: How can I check or test my hard disk?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Knoppix has many built-in tools, but they are beyond the scope of this book. You will need a more advanced book, a knowledgeable friend or help online to use these tools. Having said that, here is a hint. To list the commands that have the words “dos”, “ntfs” or “partition” anywhere in their short description, enter:
 man -k dos ntfs partition

see: [[Knowing Knoppix/CD reading and writing|CD reading and writing]]

Knoppix has built-in support for [[w:reading|reading]] ''Compact Disc Digital Data'' discs. It is best to have two CD drives – one for the Knoppix CD, and one for the data CD that you want to read. If not, see [[Knowing_Knoppix/Advanced_startup_options#If_you_only_have_a_single_CD_drive|“If you have only one CD drive” in the “Advanced startup options” section]]. To read a data CD:
#Insert the data CD into an empty CD-ROM drive.
#Click the icon on the Desktop on that represents the drive. The “CDROM” icon represents the first CD drive, and “CDROM1” represents the second drive. In Windows, the first drive is given a lower drive letter (''eg'' “D:”). The second drive is given a higher drive letter (''eg'' “E:”).
#A green triangle will appear on the CD drive icon to indicate that the drive is in use.
#Wait while the ''Konqueror'' file manager starts up.
#The files on the CD will be displayed.
== Ejecting the CD ==
#Close all windows and files opened from the CD.
#Press the Eject button on the front of the drive.
#The CD tray will be ejected.
== Quick help ==
'''Question: When trying to access a CD for the first time, it says “The file or directory file:/mnt/cdrom does not exist”. What does this mean?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Usually this means the drive is still preparing itself, or the ''Knoppix'' [[w:auto-mount|auto-mounter]] has not finished working yet. Wait a few moments, then try again. If it still doesn't work, click the Home icon in the Panel, then type file:/mnt/auto/cdrom or file:/mnt/auto/cdrom1. If it still doesn't work, click the ''Knoppix'' icon in the Panel, click Root Shell, then enter this command:
 /etc/init.d/autofs restart

'''Question: Why is the CD stuck in the drive?'''&lt;br/&gt;
''Knoppix'' uses the locking mechanism of the drive to prevent you from taking out a CD that is still in use. Close all windows and documents opened from the CD, then try again.

'''Question: When I right-click on the CD drive's icon and then click “Eject”, it says “Eject failed!” What does that mean?'''&lt;br/&gt;
It means the drive doesn't like the ''Knoppix'' “eject” program. Just press the eject button on the front of the drive instead.

= CD writing =
see: [[Knowing Knoppix/CD reading and writing|CD reading and writing]]
Knoppix has [[w:built-in support|built-in support]] for CD writing. To create your own CDs using Knoppix, it is best to have two CD drives. You need one drive for the Knoppix CD, and a Compact Disc Re-Writeable drive for the blank media. Normally, the Knoppix CD occupies the first drive, and it cannot be removed while Knoppix is running.

However, if you have a suitable hard disk, it is possible to start Knoppix from a single CD-ROM drive and then use it for other CDs. See the later section, “Advanced startup options”.

The following CD-RW drives are compatible with Knoppix:
*All SCSI CD-RW drives.
*Nearly all IDE CD-RW drives produced after 1999.
*Some IDE CD-RW drives produced before 1999.
*Most external (USB) CD-RW drives.

Knoppix uses SCSI commands to create CDs. When working with IDE CD-RW drives, Knoppix uses ''SCSI emulation''. This means that ''Knoppix'' works with IDE CD-RW drives while actually using the SCSI language to talk to the drive. For this reason, SCSI CD-RW drives are ideal, while most IDE CD-RW drives should work. To copy files [[w:onto a data CD|onto a data CD]]:
#Select the files or folders to be written onto CD.
#Right-click on the selection.
#Click “Create CD with [[w:K3b|K3b]]”.
#Wait for a moment while the ''K3b'' program starts.
#The ''K3b'' window will be displayed. In the “Current Projects” pane, you will see the folder that you chose. To add additional files and folders, drag and drop them into the Project pane.
#The [[w:disk usage|disk usage]] is in shown in the green bar at the bottom of the Projects pane. It shows the amount of space that will be used on the writeable CD. This example shows 90.3 MB will be used, out of a possible 650 MB.
#Click the “Burn” button (fourth from the left in the toolbar). The disk writing window will be appear. The make and model of your CD-RW drive will be shown.
#Select the writing [[w:speed|speed]] to be used from the “Speed” box. The correct writing speed to choose depends upon the speed of your CD-RW drive and the media. For example, if you have an 8x CD-RW drive and 4-10x compatible media, choose 8x.
#Click the “Filesystem” tab.
#Click “Generate Joliet extensions” to put a tick in the box. This step is needed to make the CD fully readable in Windows. If you are only going to use the CD in another Linux or UNIX computer, you do not need this.
#Click “Write”.
#The CD will be created. When the writing process has finished, the CD will be ejected.
#Click “Close” to return to K3b.
== Quick help == 
'''Question: Why does it eject the CD and do nothing? Or, why do I get an error while CD writing?'''&lt;br/&gt;
You may be trying to use incompatible media. For example, if you try to write onto CD-RW media labelled “4-10x compatible” at 32x then the drive will just eject the blank CD.

'''Question: When I put the written CD in a computer running Windows, some of the file names come out in capitals and some spaces or dots are turned into underscores. Why?'''&lt;br/&gt;
You need step 10, “Generate Joliet extensions”. The original specification for data CDs allows each file name only 8 characters plus a 3 character extension. For example: “''hello.txt''” fits, but “long file name of your ''dreams.txt''” does not. “''Joliet''” is the Microsoft way of putting long file names on a data CD.

'''Question: The setup works fine, but when it gets ready to burn, there are no devices to be selected. How come?'''&lt;br/&gt;
You need to run K3B as root. Go to a terminal (the image of a monitor with a shell on it), then type 'su', hit return, then type 'k3b' and hit return. This runs K3B as root and fixes some issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knoppix supports two types of external USB hard drive:
*USB hard drive stick (flash drive or pen drive).
*Conventional external USB hard disk drive.

Knoppix uses its built-in ''[[w:USB Mass Storage|USB Mass Storage]]'' driver to support these drives. Both USB 1.1 and the faster USB 2.0 drives are supported. USB 1.1 drives work at 12 Mbits per second (about 1.5 megabytes per second). USB 2.0 drives work at up to 480 Mbits per second (about 60 megabytes per second) when plugged into a USB 2.0 capable socket.

A USB hard drive stick is a small device like a key fob. Many digital cameras also work as an external USB hard drive. Any digital camera will work provided it supports USB Mass Storage. Some digital cameras have to be put in “DSC Mode” to enable USB Mass Storage. To copy files [[w:onto an external USB hard disk|onto an external USB hard disk]] drive:
#Insert the USB drive into any USB socket.
#After a short pause, an icon for each partition on the new drive should appear. In most cases there will be a single partition on the USB drive that covers the entire disk, so one new icon will appear.&lt;br/&gt;If the icon doesn't appear, take the USB drive out and insert it again more slowly. There are four pins on the USB drive's connector. Two of the four pins are longer because they must make contact first.&lt;br/&gt;To see if Knoppix accepts the USB drive when you put it in, refer to the “Identifying Hardware” section. Look at the Info Center's “USB Devices” and “Storage Devices” categories.
#When USB drive icon appears, click it with the left mouse button.
#Wait for a moment while it is ''mounted''.
#The files on the USB drive will be displayed.
#Right-click the icon of the USB drive.
#Click “Change read-write mode”.
#Click “Yes”.
#Drag and drop the files or folders that you want to copy into the window of the USB drive.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The files or folders will be copied.
#When copying has finished, close all open windows for the USB drive.
#Right-click on the icon of the USB drive.
#Click “Unmount”.
#The green triangle on the USB drive's icon will go away.
#It is now safe to take the USB drive out of its socket.

 '''NOTE:'''
 Knoppix version 3.3 does not support USB 2.0, as claimed.
 USB 2.0 devices such as external hard disks do work with Knoppix version 3.3, but only at the USB 1.1 speed (ie: much slower).
 If you need full USB 2.0 speed, try Knoppix version 3.6 and start with &quot;knoppix usb2&quot; at the boot prompt.
== Quick help ==
'''Question: I still can't get my USB drive to appear.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Click Konsole, then type &lt;code&gt;[[w:dmesg|dmesg]]&lt;/code&gt;. If the drive is connected successfully, you will see lines like this at or near the end of the output:
 scsi2 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: USB2.0    Model: Flash Disk        Rev: 2.00
  Type:   Direct-Access    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
 Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi2
 SCSI device sda: 512000 512-byte hdwr sectors (262 MB)
 sda: Write Protect is off
  sda: sda1
This shows that a “USB2.0 Flash Disk” has appeared as the first SCSI drive (sda). It is 262 Mb in size. It contains one partition (sda1). If you insert a USB drive too quickly, it will say “[[w:unable to read partition table|unable to read partition table]]” instead of “SCSI device”. This means try again, more slowly.

If it still won't work, try using another USB socket. 

Or you may try mounting the drive by hand:

 sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/usbdisk

'''Note:'''If the 'usbdisk' mount point doesn't exist, use an unused existing mount or create the mount point yourself

 sudo mkdir /media/usbdisk

If that doesn't help, try starting Knoppix with the USB drive already connected. If it really won't work, buy or borrow a USB hub PCI expansion card. Put it into the computer and try connecting the USB drive to the expansion card, rather than to the computer's built-in USB ports.

'''Question: Why did it say “out of disk space” when copying to the flash drive, even though the total size of the files to be copied is less than the free space on the drive?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Some flash drives are formatted with the FAT12 or FAT16 filesystem. This is inefficient when storing small files. If there are a lot of small files, the flash drive may fill up much more quickly that you might expect. There are two ways round the problem. The first way is to archive the files onto the flash drive. To archive means to create one big file instead of lots of small ones. To create an archive, click K menu, Utilities, Ark (Archiving Tool). The second way is to reformat the drive to a more efficient filesystem, such as FAT32.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== Note on dates ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] gives us one concrete date: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] (aka Nearly Headless Nick) celebrates the 500th anniversary of his deathday, which occurred 31 October 1492. Working from this, we can date nearly every event mentioned in the books.

The author has evidently decided to adhere to this timeline. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we see the gravestone of Harry's parents, and learn, as we had already surmised, that they died on 31 October 1981. We also learn that they were born in 1960.

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=61 The author has said] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] was about 22 when he went to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], which was mere days after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s parents were killed. From this, we can determine that Harry's parents, who were in the same year as Sirius, would have been born around 1959, which is of course consistent with our assumptions above.

There is one leap of faith: In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', The Very Secret Diary is mentioned as being &quot;fifty years old&quot;, as is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s citation for &quot;services to the school&quot;. While it is likely that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] would have thought it a rare joke to send Riddle's diary to Hogwarts on its fiftieth anniversary, it is possible that &quot;fifty years&quot; in this case means &quot;about fifty years&quot;. However, in order to clarify sequence, we have assumed that &quot;fifty years&quot; means exactly that. All dates based on that, however, have an uncertainty of about five years either way – this includes all dates for things occurring in the early life of Tom Riddle.

At least one fan site has placed the death of Tom Riddle's father in 1942, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s death as occurring much later than this, about 1945. Evidence in the books only somewhat supports this theory; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] does state that Myrtle's death occurred in the latter half of Tom Riddle's fifth year at Hogwarts, which would have been the spring of 1943, give or take about five years, and Harry says in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] that Tom Riddle visited the Riddle Manor and killed his father, then returned to the school and asked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. When he talked to Slughorn, he was a prefect, so that must have been his fifth or sixth year; not his seventh year, because he was then Head Boy. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] does state that Frank Bryce, at the time of his death in what we assume was August 1994, was nearing seventy-seven years old, which places his birth in 1917; it also says he is a veteran of the War, which would have to be the Second World War. Based on this, we have assumed Frank was invalided out of the Army quite early in the War, and tentatively placed the death of the Muggle Tom Riddle in the summer of 1942, followed by the death of Moaning Myrtle in the spring of 1943.

==== Hallowe'en ====

It is interesting to see how many things seem to happen on Hallowe'en. Before the series starts, we have Nearly Headless Nick's death day. Harry's parents are murdered on Hallowe'en, and the troll is let into the school on Hallowe'en in Harry's first year. In Harry's second year, Mrs. Norris is Petrified on Hallowe'en. It is Hallowe'en again when Sirius Black first tries to break into Gryffindor tower in Harry's third year, and when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire in Harry's fourth year. It is curious, then, that given this long string of Hallowe'en events, that nothing of note seems to happen on Hallowe'en in Harry's fifth, sixth, or seventh years.

==== Events at the Shrieking Shack ====

Internal evidence suggests that these events, filling more than five of the book's twenty-two chapters, occurred between about 8:30 PM on the last day of exams, and 12:30 AM the following morning, in Harry's third year at Hogwarts. The constraints of the timeline generator require that we assign actual times. We do not intend these times to be taken as in any way being canon, except for 9PM and midnight which are specifically given in the text; all other times are guides only.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Welcome to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], a collaborative effort towards providing an extensive guidebook to the [[w:Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] series. This book is under development at [[Main Page|Wikibooks]], a site providing a collection of open-content textbooks. Anyone can edit this book, and all who are interested in helping out the project are encouraged to [[w:WP:BB|be bold]] and dive right in to make this one of the most useful books on Harry Potter anywhere.

== What This Book Will Cover ==

This book is intended to provide in-depth analysis and specific detailing of all things in the Harry Potter series. Readers should be able to learn more about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters|characters]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places|places]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events|events]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic|magic]] than what is merely present in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books|books]]. Critical commentary on each chapter, character, place, and event is provided in an effort to help the reader better understand detailed content and realize possible underlying connections to a greater storyline. It is also intended that the book will shed some light on the story-telling techniques used, and offer some analysis, if possible, into why the series proved so popular.

This book is meant to cover only the actual series, the seven books that make up the actual story. There are a number of additional publications that are only indirectly related to the main story; some of these are:
* A number of issues of ''The Daily Prophet'' were issued to fans, containing short &quot;news stories&quot; about happenings in the Wizarding world. Apparently copyright by J. K. Rowling, the events these newspapers cover are outside the events of the main story and thus are not covered here.
* &quot;Chocolate Frog&quot; candy was produced for a while, containing Famous Wizard cards; additionally, a Famous Wizards trading card game was produced at one point. These cards were written by the author of the series. In at least a few instances, the text from these cards has enhanced understanding of the series, and thus has been referenced in this work.
* Three books were published to raise money for charity. 
** ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;, which has details of magical creatures that improve our understanding of the role they play in the main books, is included in this study. 
** ''Quidditch Through the Ages'' has little to tell us that we cannot learn through the primary seven books, and so is largely excluded. Some information from this book appears in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]].
** ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' includes some information that sheds light on some characters and some magic in the main story arc. This information is included in this study.
* [http://www.jkrowling.com The author's web site] contained rather a lot of authoritative information about the overlooked corners of the wizarding world. While much of its content is irrelevant to our study, those areas that cast some illumination on the books and on the creative process are referenced herein.
* The author has assisted in creation of a web site, [http://www.pottermore.com Pottermore], that contains additional information about the events in the seven books. Where information on this site is germane, notably for background on characters, places, and events, it has been included here.
* Various interviews with the author have appeared, both during production of the books and afterwards. Transcripts of these interviews have appeared on some fan sites. Where these interviews have improved understanding of the books, they have been referenced, though it is not always possible to provide links.

This book will explicitly not cover the Harry Potter films, theatre production, video games, fan fiction, or other authorized or unauthorized works in the same fiction universe.

== Where To Start ==

This book is built to handle several different levels of readers of the Harry Potter series. Therefore, most pages in the book contain indications of where you should stop reading based on your specific level of reading:

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Beginner|Beginner]] - Readers who are new to the Harry Potter series in general. This part of the page should be used by readers who have read only a small amount of the Harry Potter books or are just interested in a general overview of the background and biographical information.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Intermediate|Intermediate]] - Readers who have read most of the Harry Potter series and are clued in to many of the principal characters and places. Analysis for characters, places, and events and detailed summaries of the books.
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Advanced|Advanced]] - Readers who have read all of the series and are looking to develop detailed knowledge of much of the books' content and realize the greater picture. A slight step up from the intermediate level, almost every topic in the book is covered, providing a comprehensive view of the series.

Note that the individual chapter summaries are marked with a generic &quot;spoiler warning&quot;. A summary cannot be as well-written as the original work, so we highly recommend that rather than reading the summary for story elements, the student should first read the chapter in the book. The summary is meant only as a reminder of the events in the chapter in question, to assist the student in analysis of the story elements and techniques. The spoiler warning placed at the head of each chapter summary is meant to reinforce this.

The Prime Minister is not pleased at the prospect, as every previous meeting has brought bad news, and the week had already been difficult, with a number of crises including a locked-room murder just a short distance from Parliament.

The Prime Minister first met Fudge shortly after his election several years ago when Fudge informed him about the Wizarding world and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], the wizard governing body in the UK. There have been other visits over the years, usually to discuss how the magical community was affecting Muggles. Soon, Fudge appears via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]]. With each visit, Fudge had looked increasingly haggard and stressed, and the Prime Minister wonders what bad news Fudge, looking worse than ever, has brought this time. It has been a difficult week for Fudge, also, who reports that recent events, including a bridge collapse and a hurricane in the West Country, involved the Wizarding community. The hurricane, in fact, is an invention to cover an attack by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|giants]].

According to Fudge, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|He Who Must Not Be Named]] has returned, and the past week's crises were perpetrated by him and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Also, members of wizard families have been murdered and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] are roaming the countryside, attacking people ever since defecting as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison guards. They are breeding, which is causing the bad weather. Fudge, who has resigned as Minister for Magic after mishandling the Voldemort affair, is there to introduce his successor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]].

Scrimgeour arrives through the fireplace and informs the Prime Minister that wizards will handle his security. Scrimgeour's new secretary, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], has been assigned to protect the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is displeased that the Wizarding realm has leaked into the Muggle world, but Scrimgeour and Fudge assure him that they are doing all they can.

== Analysis ==

This marks the third time in the series that a book has opened somewhere other than with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] at the Dursleys. The first was ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', before Harry actually reached the Dursley's. The second was in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], where we are presented with some of Voldemort's back story and his apparent return. The student might want to consider how much the story is enhanced by these departures from the main character's point of view.

A point worth mentioning is touched upon in the final three paragraphs of the chapter. Much earlier in the series, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], explaining to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] why the Wizarding world had to remain hidden from Muggles, had said, &quot;Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.&quot; In this chapter, the Prime Minister echoes this belief, saying &quot;But for heaven's sake &amp;mdash; you're ''wizards!'' You can do ''magic!'' Surely you can sort out &amp;mdash; well &amp;mdash; ''anything!''&quot; This hope for someone else to come along and solve problems for them is all too recognizably human, and one of the strengths of this book is the accuracy and believability in these portrayals.

The meeting between the British Prime Minister and Ministry of Magic officials is a rare instance where wizard and Muggle domains overtly collide. For centuries, wizards have secretly coexisted alongside Muggles, remaining carefully hidden and separate. And while there have always been Muggles who are aware that wizards exists, and even some who have married into that society, what happens in one realm rarely affects the other. This changes when Voldemort's violent attacks begin to include Muggles. Whether or not this is deliberate is, as yet, unclear; Voldemort may intend for the violence to spill over into the Muggle realm as a brazen act to confuse and intimidate other wizards and to demonstrate just how far he can and will go to achieve power. He may also be intending to breach the long-standing divide between the two realms, bringing both under his rule. Whatever Voldemort's intent, the Prime Minister is powerless to protect his own people, and he has little choice but to accept the Wizarding world's help and to hope that Voldemort can be defeated, or at least contained to his own sphere.

It may be worth recalling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]’s warning to Fudge, at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire's'']] conclusion, that &quot;history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!&quot; Clearly, this has now come to pass. When Voldemort was revealed to be alive, thus showing plainly that Fudge's ministry, by discrediting both Harry and Dumbledore, had been systematically lying to the Wizarding world, retribution by the general populace was swift. Despite Fudge's efforts to retain power, he has been ousted and replaced by someone who appears more dynamic and better prepared to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

The Prime Minister recalls an earlier visit, where Fudge mentioned that he was required to inform the Muggle government that they were importing dangerous magical creatures into Britain for a Wizarding competition: three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]] and a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sphinx|Sphinx]]. This may confuse some readers, who remember that there were four dragon species at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|that competition]]; however, one was a Common Welsh Green and therefore a native species. It should also be noted that this conversation was quite likely before Harry's name had unexpectedly come out of the Goblet; the original plan might well have been to import three Dragons, and when a fourth was needed, a native variety was used so they would not have to notify the Muggle government again. It is interesting, perhaps, to note the mix of planning and improvisation that went into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task maze]], as we have seen that the challenges Harry faced in that task included one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Blast-Ended Skrewts]], creatures that did not even exist, apparently, until the previous September, and here we see that the Sphinx that Harry encountered in the Maze had been planned well-prior to even the First Task in November.

Two points are mentioned in passing: the Death Eaters have allied with the Giants, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] have abandoned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] and are wandering throughout England, and breeding. We note that Dumbledore had warned Fudge that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|this would happen]], which would seem prescient except that Harry had [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 33|overheard Voldemort planning that earlier]] and presumably had reported it to Dumbledore.

We note that although the main point of this chapter is to acquaint the reader with the change of power, and so prepare them for the change of direction on the part of the Ministry, we actually hear nothing of how that change of power is effected. We suspect that this is because the book is intended for children who have, appropriately enough for their age, only a sketchy understanding of what government does and how it gets into power. The mature reader may be wondering how a vote for Minister was carried out, if in fact the process is at all democratic.

In yet another of the date confusions endemic to the series, Fudge reportedly says, when first meeting the Muggle Prime Minister, &quot;I must say, you're taking it a lot better than your predecessor. ''He'' tried to throw me out of the window&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&quot; (italics in original). The internal timeline suggests that this book should cover approximately July 1996 to June 1997; if we accept this timeline, this chapter must occur in early to mid July 1996. At that time, the Muggle Prime Minister was [[w:John Major|John Major]], which would make his predecessor [[w:Margaret Thatcher|Maggie Thatcher]], definitely not a &quot;he&quot;. Ms. Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, so Fudge would have had to introduce himself to her in 1979. If, as we assume from the same timeline, Voldemort murdered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s parents in 1981, that would mean that Fudge would have been in power before Voldemort's fall. However, the story states that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Barty Crouch Sr.]] was being groomed for that position, and when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|his son]] went to Azkaban, '''after''' the fall of Voldemort, they tried to tap [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] for that position, and only elected Fudge when Dumbledore refused. So Fudge could not have come into power before 1982 or so in our timeline, which would mean that he could not have introduced himself to Ms. Thatcher immediately after her election. One could try and fit the timeline to the tenure of [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]], who took power in 1997, but there is little point: the story does not depend on any specific interaction with our world, and errors of this sort do not even distract the reader unless we let them. (It is also worth noting that Fudge could have visited Thatcher when ''he'' became Minister of Magic, and could have forgotten that Thatcher was a ''she'', not a he &amp;ndash; although this is extremely unlikely, as he would have had to deal with her repeatedly between his accession to power in about 1982 and Major's arrival in 1990, a period of some eight years. Additionally, would Thatcher have tried to throw the representative of the Wizarding world out the window, if she had been introduced to the previous Minister of Magic, Millicent Bagnold, when she first took office three years earlier?)

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As expected, Scrimgeour's election will result in a new and more aggressive direction for the Ministry of Magic. As a result, Harry, who was denigrated in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], will now be lionized, hailed as &quot;the boy who lived&quot; once again and as &quot;the Chosen One&quot;. Having thus re-elevated him, the Ministry will attempt to tap his celebrity power for their own benefit. At Christmas, Scrimgeour will attempt to persuade Harry to occasionally be seen visiting the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. As a bonus for his cooperation, Scrimgeour hints that Harry may be easily accepted into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] branch. Harry recognizes this as a bribe to help sway the general populace's opinion that Harry, the &quot;Chosen One&quot;, supports the Ministry and its actions; he refuses, believing the Ministry is still doing a poor job. And though the Ministry's position on Voldemort may have swung from one extreme position to another, they are still evidently more interested in presenting a good public face, than building substance, under Scrimgeour's new leadership.

When Harry later discusses this incident with Dumbledore, we learn that Dumbledore had blocked Scrimgeour from proposing this same scheme to Harry earlier in the school year. Dumbledore knew Harry would never allow himself to be recruited as a Ministry pawn, and that he was still in a fragile mental state over his godfather [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] death. Dumbledore and Scrimgeour's altercation became loud enough that it was overheard and later leaked to the general public. Dumbledore reveals that this argument was actually the Ministry's second attempt to draft Harry. Prior to his ouster, Cornelius Fudge had made a very similar suggestion to Dumbledore, in an attempt to control the damage and retain his power, and had been similarly rebuffed.

Further to our comments above about the change of power in the Ministry, we note that another part of the reason for the obscurity surrounding the change of office holder is necessary for a later bit of plot. At the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|the next and final book]], we learn that &quot;the Ministry has fallen&quot; to the Death Eaters, and that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius-controlled]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]] has been installed as Minister for Magic. Getting a specific candidate elected is problematic in most democratic regimes, so we can't assume Thicknesse was legitimately voted into power; we have to guess he was elevated in some other way. We never find out how that was actually done, so it's possible the author didn't want to commit to a specific method for the handover.

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Two cloaked figures [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] beside a dark, dirty river in a run-down mill town. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] and her sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], head for a dilapidated brick row house on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Spinner's End|Spinner's End]]. While walking, Bellatrix is apparently trying to dissuade Narcissa from doing something. At the house, they are greeted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who assures them that they are alone, except for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew)]]. Snape orders Wormtail to fetch drinks for himself and his guests. Wormtail complies while protesting that he is not Snape's servant. Narcissa says she believes only Snape can help her, but before she can continue, Snape points his wand at a concealed door and sends Wormtail, who is listening from behind, scurrying. Bellatrix, distrusting Snape, interrogates him about where (and with whom) his true loyalties lie. Before responding, Snape asks in turn: does Bellatrix really think that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]] had not asked him those same questions? Does she think he would be sitting there, talking to her if he hadn't been able to provide The Dark Lord with satisfactory answers? Does she think he could have fooled the Dark Lord, possibly the greatest [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimens]] in the world?

Snape then addresses Bellatrix's concerns: when the Dark Lord fell, he was at Hogwarts, where Voldemort had ordered him to spy on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. He did not hunt for the Dark Lord after his fall for the same reason many other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] failed to: he believed the Dark Lord was finished. Bellatrix retorts that she searched for him, prompting Snape to sarcastically remark how &quot;useful&quot; she was in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison, while he collected sixteen years' worth of information on Dumbledore for Voldemort. Snape continues that he did not knowingly stand between the Dark Lord and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]; he thought [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Quirrell]] wanted it for himself and he acted to prevent that. He failed to respond to the Dark Lord's summons when Voldemort returned so that Dumbledore would continue to believe Snape was still his ally, rather than Voldemort's. Bellatrix claims she is Voldemort's most trusted lieutenant and would know of any information Snape passed to him. Snape asks if she still retains this status after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the Ministry fiasco]]. When she is unable to answer, he continues: on the Dark Lord's orders, he stayed away from that battle to protect his position at Hogwarts. The information Snape supplied made [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Emmeline Vance|Emmeline Vance]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] deaths possible, and the Dark Lord was satisfied with his information. Snape has not killed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] because it was only Dumbledore who was keeping Snape effective as a spy and out of Azkaban. Killing Potter would have lost him that protection, and he would be unable to help Voldemort. It is Dumbledore's continued trust in him that makes him so useful to the Dark Lord.

With Bellatrix's worries seemingly appeased, Narcissa explains her visit. Voldemort has assigned her son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] a difficult and probably deadly task. Narcissa wants Snape to protect him. Snape replies that Narcissa telling him about this mission is against Voldemort's orders; however, as he already knows about this, there is little harm done by her disclosing this to him. However, he is powerless to interfere with Voldemort's orders, nor will he try. Narcissa believes Draco was assigned this task as revenge for her husband [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius']] failure at the Ministry. Snape admits that the Dark Lord is angry at Lucius. Snape is finally persuaded to swear an '[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]]' to protect Draco and complete his mission should he fail.

== Analysis ==

This chapter starts off with something of a shock: two avowed Death Eaters visiting Severus Snape. Events to date seem to have polarized readers into two camps: those believing Harry's view of events, and his view that Snape is a Death Eater, and opposing them, those who believe Dumbledore's steadfast championing of Snape. The latter camp points at Dumbledore's track record, showing that in the first five books Dumbledore has been right far more often than he has been wrong in his guesses and conclusions. This chapter deals that understanding a large blow.

Perhaps a key part of this is Snape's being sent on an unexplained mission in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. In this chapter, we learn that his mission was to rejoin Voldemort and pledge his allegiance. Snape says that his return to Voldemort was delayed to reassure Dumbledore that he was still working on Dumbledore's side, rather than Voldemort's, and that Voldemort is satisfied with his reasoning and pledge. There is no indication as yet whether this return was done purely at Dumbledore's bidding, or whether Snape would have gone to swear allegiance to Voldemort without Dumbledore's orders. At any rate, we can now see that when Voldemort, on his return, spoke of his faithful servant at Hogwarts, he was not referring to Snape but to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]], and the one he fears has left him forever would most likely have been Snape, as the one who had run away would have been [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]].

By far the strongest blow against any belief in Snape's loyalty to Dumbledore, established in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], is his agreement with Narcissa Malfoy to make an Unbreakable Vow. Snape, whose fidelity to Voldemort is questioned by many Death Eaters, including Bellatrix Lestrange, must be aware that he can help dispel these doubts by swearing a magically binding oath to protect Draco in his mission for Voldemort, even at peril to his own life. Bellatrix probably remains skeptical, despite Snape's convincing answers to her probing interrogation; indeed, it seems that Snape's true allegiance always remains just vague enough to keep each side guessing. Readers know that Snape has been acting as a double agent, and this situation may be forcing him into taking the vow to maintain his cover. To do otherwise would cast even more suspicion on his supposed loyalties. But with double agents, it is always difficult to know where their true loyalties lie; in fact, Snape may be willing to take this oath because he is truly loyal to Voldemort, and the object of the oath is to complete a mission that Voldemort wanted completed. It is also conceivable that Snape is loyal only to himself, maintaining a tenuous and dangerous position where he can align himself with either winning side. A final possibility is that he is protecting Draco, who he has always seemed to favour, and who is still underaged.

Wormtail's loyalty is far less questionable, as he is fully dependent on Voldemort for his very survival. Unlike Snape, he is unable to align himself in any way to Harry, Dumbledore, and their allies. And while it initially seems that Snape has Wormtail under his constant, watchful eye, Wormtail may be secretly keeping tabs on Snape for Voldemort. Even though it appears that Snape has convinced Voldemort that he is his faithful servant, the Dark Lord may have lingering suspicions about him or seeks to reassure his doubtful followers. However, Voldemort may have discovered that Wormtail owes Harry Potter a life debt, an obligation as magically binding as Snape's Unbreakable Vow, and that could be a severe liability to the Dark Lord. Voldemort is likely having Snape and Wormtail watch each other.

Rowling also sheds light on some Death Eaters' personal relationships, as evidenced when sisters Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy affectionately refer to each other as &quot;Bella&quot; and &quot;Cissy.&quot;  This is a contrast to how Harry has viewed most Death Eaters. Until now, Voldemort's followers have generally been portrayed as two-dimensional evil characters who unwaveringly serve Lord Voldemort. Other than the Malfoys, little is known about Death Eaters' family life, social interactions, or what factors, other than &quot;pure-blood&quot; beliefs, motivates them. Bellatrix, in particular, has been portrayed as purely evil, fanatical, and probably unbalanced, even by Death Eater standards, and she may believe Voldemort is doing too little to rid impurities from the Wizarding world. In this chapter, however, she is seen as caring about her sister, Narcissa, wanting to protect her and Draco from Voldemort. 

And while Bellatrix generally remains two-dimensional, the cold and haughty Narcissa, desperate to protect her husband and son, displays love, fear, empathy, and sadness&amp;mdash;emotions not generally associated with Voldemort's affiliates, but that help develop her into a more fully-rounded character. Narcissa believes Voldemort has tasked Draco with a near-impossible mission (in which he will likely fail and then be killed) only as a means to punish her husband, Lucius Malfoy, for his failure to retrieve the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] at the Department of Mysteries (in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''), and also possibly for Voldemort's diary being destroyed (in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]), though this is not mentioned explicitly in this chapter. This could ultimately affect Narcissa's loyalty to the Dark Lord and also to her sister. And despite their seeming affection for one another, it should be remembered that both Bellatrix and Narcissa readily disowned their sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]], as a blood traitor for marrying the Muggle-born wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] is their daughter, and thus niece to Bellatrix and Narcissa.)

We note that this is only the fourth chapter of the entire series with a viewpoint character other than Harry. The first was ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', before Harry actually reached the Dursley's. The second was in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], where we are presented with some of Voldemort's back story and his apparent return. The third was the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|first chapter of this book]], where we were acquainted with the interaction between the Muggle and Wizarding governments, and shown the change of power at the Ministry. Finally, of course, this chapter shows us interaction between four Dark wizards and establishes that Draco has been given a perilous mission, one that he is probably expected to fail, that Snape knows about and will act to complete. These will turn out to be four of only five chapters of the entire series that are not seen directly through Harry's eyes. The student may want to examine how much the story is enhanced by these few glimpses of events occurring outside Harry's direct sphere, and consider whether the important events covered in these chapters could have been shown to us through Harry's eyes. In this analysis, the storyteller's edict to &quot;show, don't tell&quot; would be a useful basis for gauging the value of the digression.

Finally, we will mention in passing that there is little if any information about where this town is. The characteristics of the town, as described, could fit any of hundreds of towns in England, towns where the main industry has proven unprofitable and shut down or moved away, leaving an empty plant and rampant unemployment. At least [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-spinners-end.html one fan site] has concluded that this town, if it existed, would be near Manchester, supporting this in part with Snape's personality and word choice, which seem on inspection to be similar to those found in people from northern England.

It may be of interest to compare the reason for Dumbledore's belief in Snape's loyalty to the reason for Voldemort's belief. Dumbledore believes in Snape's loyalty because of a promise made to Dumbledore out of love for Lily Evans. Voldemort bases his belief on legilimency, reading Snape's memories, confident that nobody would be able to conceal thoughts from him. Dumbledore is basing his belief on the strength of Snape's character, while Voldemort is assuming an overwhelming strength in his own abilities. It will turn out, as we discover in the final book, that Dumbledore's faith was placed correctly, and that Snape's skill actually was greater than Voldemort's, a thing Voldemort likely could not have believed. Snape comments that Voldemort is &quot;possibly the greatest legilimens that the world has ever known,&quot; but one has to wonder if the weasel word &quot;possibly&quot; was put in there only because he knew himself to be the stronger of the two.

As a side note, although it seems that Bellatrix is satisfied by Snape's answers, she could have insisted on him taking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum (truth serum)]] before interrogating him. However, she does not, possibly because, as Dumbledore will suggest later, even Veritaserum can be circumvented if it is expected. Though this is nowhere mentioned in the book, it is likely that those who know [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] can also cheat Veritaserum, if only by being able to perceive intent to administer the potion. And for that matter, Snape as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions Master]] likely has an antidote to Veritaserum brewed, and may have it with him. Dumbledore will not go into detail about the means of subverting Veritaserum; however, Snape is more likely than most wizards to be aware of them. It is likely, though, that Veritaserum would not have helped Bellatrix in this case, if she had asked the questions that we see her asking. Snape's answers are, in every case, the truth, though perhaps not the full truth.

We will find out near Christmas, at the Slug Club Christmas party, that Bellatrix has been teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] to her nephew Draco. As such, it is safe to assume that Bellatrix is a Legilimens herself, and so is confident in her ability to detect any falsehood from Snape. Snape's answers are carefully crafted so as not to trigger the ability of a Legilimens to know when he or she is being lied to; he probably also finds Bellatrix' abilities easy to subvert because of his practice with Voldemort.

Readers see Draco cast in a more sympathetic role here when it appears that he is Lord Voldemort's victim as much as his ally, forced to do his bidding under duress and at extreme risk to himself and his family. We will shortly see how a smug Draco initially revels in his own bloated self-importance at being appointed the Dark Lord's task, woefully unaware and unable yet to comprehend the probable consequences to himself and his parents should he fail. Narcissa, however, has correctly determined Voldemort's true intention: to punish Lucius Malfoy through Draco. She is risking her own life by defying Voldemort in an attempt to save her family. This raises the question as to why so many Death Eaters faithfully serve Voldemort, who demands his servants' total obedience and loyalty while offering little reward in return, and who readily eliminates a follower or their family for any reason; even his most devoted and trusted confidants are capriciously expendable, even for the smallest misstep. This flagrant abuse could eventually create enough dissent and discord from within to undermine or destroy Voldemort's power, although, for now, his continued rise seems unabated.

Snape tells Bellatrix that his information led to the death of Emmeline Vance, who as we have seen is a member of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. We will [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|much later]] find out that Snape actually is working for the Order himself, as a double agent; it is safe to assume that Snape discusses with Dumbledore the information he will give to Voldemort. At the same time, we hear that Snape has only let those people die that he could not save. That strongly suggests that Dumbledore and Snape were somehow forced to give Voldemort information on Vance, and that they could not prevent her death. From this, we can assume that Vance's death was not preventable, Voldemort had already set his sights on her, but Snape had provided some small piece of information that had helped him find her. It is more than likely that Snape and Dumbledore had also provided Vance with the information that would allow her to fight back. While Vance clearly would not want to simply die, it is likely that she would agree to being put in harm's way, if in the battle she would have a chance to take some Death Eaters with her. While this is never confirmed, it is quite possible that, in fact, she did, and that the retreating Death Eaters had carried away and probably concealed their dead, as they tend to.

At the same time as we learn of Snape's true allegiance, we will learn that Snape's Unbreakable Vow, which would require him to kill Dumbledore in the event that Draco was unable to, was for Snape only reinforcement of a promise he had already made. The injury to Dumbledore's hand, which Harry will note in the next chapter, and which Snape here alludes to, is the outward sign of a curse that will take Dumbledore's life within a year. In a conversation that immediately follows Dumbledore receiving that injury, and so plainly occurs before the events in this chapter, Snape has reluctantly agreed to end Dumbledore's life himself, in order to save Draco's soul and spare Dumbledore's dignity.

=== Connections ===
* Many of Snape's answers to Bellatrix's questions refer back to events in previous books.
** Snape's attempts to prevent Quirrell from retrieving the Philosopher's Stone form a large part of the backdrop to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]. Harry, not being privy to the entire discussions between them, believes that it is Quirrell who is trying to protect the Stone from Snape.
** Snape did not respond to Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 33|summons in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] and Voldemort said he believed that he had &quot;left my service&quot;. We find out here that Snape had delayed his return to Voldemort's service deliberately, to make it appear that he remained faithful to Dumbledore. We will find out later that he really was faithful to Dumbledore. The delayed return, risky as it was for Snape, also consolidated Voldemort's belief in Snape's faithfulness.
** We don't know what information Snape provided that aided Sirius Black' death, but we can suppose that it was likely something learned during Harry's Occlumency lessons, possibly information about the dreams of the Ministry corridor.
** Snape and Bellatrix' conversation about the battle at the Ministry, which occurred at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|the previous book]], provides a few side lights on that battle that may be of interest.
* Snape mentions that Dumbledore has suffered an injury over the summer, which Harry will see and comment on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|in the next chapter of this book]]. We will find out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]] how that injury was inflicted, and that as a result Dumbledore has, as of the time of this chapter, at most a year to live. At the same time, we will learn that Dumbledore already knew of the mission assigned to Draco, before he received his injury.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Dursleys' house]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is leaning against his window, asleep. Scattered about his room are many copies of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']]. The paper now hails Harry as 'The Chosen One', who, it is believed, will be instrumental in the recently-returned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] downfall.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] arrives at the house to collect Harry. Despite Harry having received Dumbledore's letter setting the time, and having anxiously awaited Dumbledore's arrival for nearly the entire week, he is astonished and puzzled that Dumbledore is fetching him after only two weeks at the Dursleys; he is further surprised when Dumbledore actually arrives, as are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]], who Harry never told about Dumbledore's visit. Dumbledore merely ignores their dismay and makes himself comfortable, presenting the Dursley family and Harry with glasses of mead. Harry notices that Dumbledore's hand is black and shriveled, but Dumbledore only says he will explain it later.

Dumbledore explains that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] has bequeathed Harry all his possessions, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|12 Grimmauld Place]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]]. Uncle Vernon's interest is clearly piqued by the news that Harry now owns a house in London. However, Dumbledore continues, a spell may exist that automatically leaves the inheritance to the eldest surviving Black male or prevents it from passing to a non-pureblood wizard. Because Sirius was the last Black male, it would likely pass to the eldest female relative, namely [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] (Sirius's cousin). To test whether Harry is the true heir, Dumbledore summons Kreacher, the loyal Black family [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]]. When Kreacher obeys Harry's command, despite protest, it confirms that Harry is the rightful heir. 

At a loss as to what to do with this filthy elf on Aunt Petunia's spotless carpet, Harry accepts Dumbledore's suggestion to order him to work at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Buckbeak (now renamed Witherwings) will be left in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s care. Dumbledore tells the Dursleys to expect a short visit from Harry in a year's time. The magical charm that has protected Harry from Voldemort since infancy will expire when he comes of age on his seventeenth birthday. However, he must make one final visit to the Dursleys the following summer to maintain its effectiveness, then all ties to his maternal family can be permanently severed. Before departing, Dumbledore reproaches the Dursleys for their bad manners, mistreating Harry, and over-indulging [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]].

== Analysis ==

Harry and Dumbledore's vindication at the last book's conclusion had resulted in Harry once again being lionized; while not actively seen here, we somewhat sense Harry's discomfort at again being hailed the hero. While Harry acted heroically based on the information he had, and alerted the Wizarding world to Voldemort's return, he feels duped and indirectly responsible for Sirius' death. Dumbledore can certainly see this ambivalence in Harry, and while he realizes that Privet Drive is the one place he will be unable to emotionally heal, he also knows that Harry's protection from Voldemort depends on his returning there each summer. Dumbledore probably calculated the minimum time that Harry needed to stay at Privet Drive to retain his mother's protection and has arranged for more a appropriate accommodation, almost certainly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]. While Harry cannot believe it, we see that Dumbledore will move Harry away from Privet Drive as soon as safely possible.

Readers may wonder at the reasoning behind Harry's elevation to the role of hero in training. Clearly, Harry will have to be the one to face Voldemort again, as we know from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]], but the Ministry seems to want to keep the content of the prophecy a secret. So there must be some other basis on which the Ministry and its propaganda arm (as we now see the ''Daily Prophet'' has become) have decided to tout Harry. The specific reasoning is never made clear, but we suggest that the combination of Harry's surviving Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] some fifteen years previous, and his involvement with the revelation of Voldemort's return, are the starting point. We have seen that the Ministry is a political organization, meaning that it lives and dies by the popular opinion that it has been spinning, and we believe that they have determined that they need a hero to set against Voldemort. Given Harry's track record, clearly either he or Dumbledore would have to be that hero, and Dumbledore, they almost certainly know, will not stand for the sort of image manipulation that the Ministry would be doing to make him a hero. (Also, Dumbledore is aged, and it is not a good idea to appoint a hero who is likely to die  of old age.) So even without the prophecy, the image technicians at the Ministry perforce make Harry into the hero they need, not caring about his wishes in the matter.

Dumbledore's injured hand indicates that sinister events may be underway in the Wizarding world that Harry is not yet privy to. For whatever reason, Dumbledore withholds this information, at least for now.

We note that neither Dumbledore nor Harry seems to show any particular reaction to the idea that Kreacher is considered a chattel, property that can be transferred through inheritance as part of the house in Grimmauld Place. This may highlight the difficulty that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] experienced in the previous book, and will continue to experience, in her efforts to gain some measure of equitable treatment for House-elves. Clearly the treatment of house elves has been institutionalized to the point that even the gentle and even-handed Dumbledore has no particular difficulty stomaching the idea of Kreacher as being Harry's property, despite his being willing to pay the free elf [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] more than Dobby was willing to accept to work in the Hogwarts kitchens. Hermione is almost certainly not going to be able to overcome the inertia of this widespread belief.

In the same vein, we note that while Harry was willing to arrange to free Dobby from the Malfoys, he does not seem equally willing to free Kreacher. The obvious reasoning is that Kreacher still holds secrets that he could reveal to the Black family sisters if he were freed, and that as a Hogwarts kitchen hand he will not be ill-treated the way Dobby was. However, this reasoning is not mentioned here, it simply seems to be accepted that Kreacher is and will remain Harry's property.

A small highlight on Petunia's character is seen here; as part of her nighttime routine, Petunia apparently cleans and disinfects the kitchen. We have already seen her assigning endless cleaning chores to Harry, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] had earlier mentioned that the house seemed overly clean. Petunia may suffer from an obsessive compulsive disorder, resulting in a need to have everything spotless and germ-free. She may also subconsciously be attempting to wash away any magical traces that Harry's presence has caused to spill over into her very Muggle home. Harry's thoughts about her dismay at having Kreacher appear on her parlor carpet are not surprising; Harry clearly is aware of Petunia's cleanliness fetish.

It has been suggested on a number of fan sites that Dumbledore's behavior is out of character in this book. This is particularly obvious in this chapter. While still a peaceful and wise wizard, Dumbledore's actions seem a bit more direct and urgent than usual. He magically sweeps the Dursleys to the couch, chides them for their ill-manners, and actively criticizes how they have treated Harry and raised Dudley. While he is still as good-natured and civil as ever, there seems to be an unanticipated edginess in his manner. As expected, the Dursleys apparently ignore Dumbledore's rebuke and seem as unlikely to ever change.

It might be wondered why the author had Dumbledore's offered mead be so insistent &amp;ndash; the mead glasses actually become quite intrusive, even bouncing on the Dursleys' heads when they refuse to acknowledge them, for instance. This is called a &quot;nut of fun&quot;, a bit of lighter entertainment designed to keep a serious scene from becoming overwhelming. In this chapter we are faced with Harry's having to handle some aspects of Sirius' will, which of course once again forces the realization on Harry that his godfather is dead. We also are presented with a change in Dumbledore's character, and with a sudden return of the spotlight on Harry. Coupled with the need for Harry to decide what to do with Kreacher, this part of the book could become very grim and very heavy, without the animated mead livening the scene a bit. We suspect that the mead, and its behavior, is also used to point up the Dursleys' gracelessness, a characteristic that hardly needs additional support.

Many readers may be somewhat alarmed when Dumbledore offers Harry and Dudley each a glass of mead. Mead, a wine made from honey, is usually relatively strong at 14% alcohol by volume, and it would be illegal to give it to a minor in North America. Liquor laws are less restrictive in Britain, however, and though someone underage may not purchase liquor in the UK, there is nothing that prohibits someone younger than 18 years from drinking wine or beer if it is offered by an adult.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Some theorists believe that Dumbledore used the &quot;Kreacher test&quot; not only to see whether Number 12 Grimmauld Place actually belonged to Harry, rather than Bellatrix Lestrange (Sirius' cousin), but also as a means to determine whether Sirius' younger brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], was still alive. (It will be learned in the next book that Regulus is the mysterious R.A.B. who had left a note that is found at the end of this novel.) This test may be inconclusive, as the tradition is that property, such as a house, is directly handed down the male family line from eldest to eldest. If there is a charm meant to ensure this (what is called &quot;entailment&quot; in the UK) its parameters are unknown; it is possible that the charm ensuring this, if there was one, would prevent a lateral transfer from the eldest male child, once he had come into his inheritance, to his younger brother. It is also possible that the entailment, if there was one, simply ended when the male Black line did. There is no way of knowing; we only know that the house and property passed successfully to Harry on Sirius' death.

While the Ministry is busily making Harry a hero in the press, we don't see them approaching Harry directly to get his support. We will find out that this is because the Ministry had first approached Dumbledore, as Dumbledore was shielding Harry from Ministry visitations, and Dumbledore had rebuffed them. The Ministry, in the person of Minister for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]], will approach Harry directly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 16|at Christmas this year]]. Dumbledore will [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 17|later]] reveal that there had been two similar attempts previously, which he had blocked: first when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]] had attempted to rope Harry in to shore up his crumbling hold on power, and then in the early days of Scrimgeour's administration. There will be a final attempt made by Scrimgeour [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 30|after Dumbledore's funeral]], but then, as earlier, Harry will rebuff him.

The reason for Dumbledore's drastic character change can be attributed to his being injured by a fatal curse embedded in a ring; the curse was apparently intended as a trap to protect a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], which was housed in that ring. The curse, triggered when he put the ring on, had withered his hand. He was able to get help from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who has kept him alive by extraordinary magical means, though only temporarily. This minute-to-minute awareness that he will soon die, and the resulting sense of urgency, is likely the cause for his changed character.

Dumbledore, speaking directly to Petunia, mentions that they have corresponded before. There were actually at least four letters, though at this point in our reading there is nothing that can be attributed as being &quot;correspondence&quot;. Dumbledore wrote a letter, which he left, along with Harry, on the Dursleys' doorstep [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|at the series' beginning]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] addressed to Petunia in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] is also revealed to have been sent by Dumbledore. There is no indication that Petunia responded to either, and correspondence does rather imply that messages are being exchanged; despite this, many readers will assume that it is either one of these letters to which Dumbledore is referring. However, we will learn, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that Petunia had earlier written to Hogwarts pleading for admission, and that Dumbledore responded, declining her plea on the grounds that she was unable to perform magic. Dumbledore's implied informational exchange, then, can only have been referring to this first set of letters.

=== Connections ===

Very little in this chapter, apart from the ongoing plot lines (Kreacher's antipathy for Harry and other &quot;mudbloods&quot;, the Dursley family dynamic, Harry's treatment by the government-influenced press), could be considered to constitute any particular connection elsewhere in the series. Rather than explicitly connecting to other events, this chapter is to a certain extent a re-introduction to the Wizarding world and an exposition concerning how Harry's status has changed with the revelations at the end of the previous book.
* Dumbledore's injury, mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|the previous chapter of this book]], will remain unexplained until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|late in the final book]].</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

After leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to keep his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] with him, but sends his trunk on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]. As Harry clings to Dumbledore's arm, Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] them to a small village. Having never Apparated before, Harry finds the sensation slightly disorienting. Dumbledore explains now that once again, Hogwarts is one instructor short, and Dumbledore has come to Budleigh Babberton to recruit a new faculty member. They arrive at a wrecked house, finding what appears to be destruction and blood-splattered walls within; after examining the wreckage, Dumbledore pokes an armchair with his wand. The armchair grunts and transforms into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], Dumbledore's old colleague and a former Hogwarts professor. Slughorn created the false destruction to convince intruders that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] had killed him. However, Dumbledore knew the attack was staged because there was no [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] looming over the building. Dumbledore helps Slughorn repair the house, then attempts to persuade Slughorn to return to Hogwarts. On Slughorn's refusal, Dumbledore excuses himself, leaving Harry and Slughorn alone together.

Slughorn mentions that he taught [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]]. Lily was a favorite student, always top in Slughorn's class, and he believes she ought to have been sorted into his House&amp;mdash;he was head of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]]. Observing Harry's reaction, he correctly guesses that Harry is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]]. Slughorn suggests his reluctance to take a post at Hogwarts is partly because it would be seen as declaring allegiance to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. Harry reminds him that teachers are not required to join the Order and that Hogwarts is safe (as Dumbledore is the only wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has ever feared). The only teacher who died there is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]].

Slughorn remains reluctant to leave his comfortable retirement, though, as Dumbledore points out on his return to the room, he has essentially been in hiding since Voldemort's return. After adroitly manipulating Slughorn's ego and attracting him to Harry's celebrity, Dumbledore finally convinces him to resume his old post. As they depart, Dumbledore tells Harry that Slughorn relishes his creature comforts and likes being the power behind a multiplicity of thrones. He also enjoys being among the rich and influential, and Harry, being famous, is someone he will attempt to cultivate.

Dumbledore then transports himself and Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], and, before departing, says he and Harry will be having private lessons during the year. Dumbledore also suggests that Harry share the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], and requests that Harry keep his Invisibility Cloak with him at all times.

== Analysis ==

Dumbledore's suggestion that Harry reveal Trelawney's prophecy to Ron and Hermione emphasizes Dumbledore's understanding that Harry's strength and abilities are enhanced by his friends' assistance and support. Clearly, Dumbledore realizes that Harry has often refused help from others. Although Harry is a talented wizard, it is also Ron's and Hermione's loyalty, support, and their individual skills that have helped him overcome many adversities; each is at their best when they work together. Harry realizes that he cannot remain shut away in response to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] death; it is time to reconnect with his friends and the wizarding world. Dumbledore chooses this moment to reinforce that thought.

Until now, we have seen Dumbledore as an extremely wise wizard genius, but this is the first time he has been observed manipulating someone. He knows Slughorn is vain and likes being connected with powerful and influential people who can provide him favours and allow him to bask in their reflected glory. When Dumbledore offers Slughorn the Hogwarts position, using Harry as bait, he knows Slughorn will be irresistibly intrigued by and attracted to Harry Potter's fame, and will want to hitch his own wagon to Harry's star; Dumbledore cleverly positions himself and Harry so that Slughorn will be fully exposed to Harry's presence. When his initial attempt to recruit Slughorn fails, Dumbledore excuses himself, leaving Slughorn and Harry alone, allowing Slughorn to convince himself that Harry is a celebrity he wants to collect. Finally, as Slughorn is considering the offer, Dumbledore re-appears, snatches Harry from under Slughorn's nose, and departs. His prize about to vanish, and, somewhat desperate, Slughorn accepts Dumbledore's offer. This is a very neat bit of coercion by Dumbledore, particularly in that it allowed Slughorn to convince himself – Harry, unprimed for this, never participated in any coercion.

Although Slughorn is an excellent teacher (otherwise Dumbledore would have been unlikely to recruit him) he could prove problematic for Harry. Slughorn has a vain personality and is attracted to other wizards' celebrity and influence. The astute reader may see some similarity to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], at least insofar as attitude to celebrity goes; Gilderoy, however, has managed his own way to fame, while Slughorn, apparently accepting that he will never be famous, still likes to bask in reflected glory, and we suspect may be inclined to push Harry into prominence for his own ends. Harry, who tries to avoid the limelight, may resent having yet another person fawning over him to serve their own purposes. This may put further stress on Harry. Also, Harry's mother, Lily, was among Slughorn's favorite and most talented pupils. He may have an unrealistic expectation that Harry has the same abilities, putting undue (although perhaps somewhat needed) pressure on Harry, a rather lazy student, to perform at a higher level than he currently does.

Harry's assertion that Quirrell is the only teacher that ever died at Hogwarts is an over-simplification. Hogwarts has been a school for a long time, over a thousand years, with teachers in residence year round; it is certain that at least a few teachers have died there, one being, of course [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]], whose spirit is still teaching there. However, it is true that the only teacher who has died there as a result of Voldemort's actions was Quirrell, though he likely will not be the last.

We note that Dumbledore does not Apparate into the Burrow, landing fairly near the house but neither in it, or even adjacent to it. While this might be considered simple courtesy, as when Dumbledore Apparated into Slughorn's village rather than onto the doorstep, and when he appeared near the Dursley home rather than on the doorstep there, we will learn that by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|the start of the next book]], the Weasley home had been made a &quot;safe house&quot; and Apparition onto the property was no longer permitted. Though it is not discussed in this book, it is possible that the apparition-prevention charm is already in place as Harry and Dumbledore arrive. The timing would seem to be reasonable: until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 36|the end of the previous book]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] would have wanted to remain concealed, and so would not have moved openly against the Order of the Phoenix. With the revelation of his return, however, that constraint could be lifted, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|opening chapter of this book]] clearly indicates that he has started operations targeting the Order and its allies.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry believes (and readers assume) that Slughorn has been hired as the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher to replace [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. However, Slughorn has actually been recruited to fill another position; this change will significantly affect Harry's future.

Some believe that this chapter contains direct evidence that Horace Slughorn is or was a Death Eater.  When Slughorn asks Dumbledore how he knew that he had faked his own kidnapping/death, Dumbledore replies, &quot;My dear Horace, if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house,&quot; to which Slughorn answers, &quot;The Dark Mark. Knew there was something&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ah well. Wouldn't have had time anyway&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&quot;  As far as anyone knows, only Death Eaters can create the Dark Mark. However, Horace Slughorn neither denied nor asserted that he ''could'' do it, he just stated that there wasn't enough time before Dumbledore arrived.

It is unlikely that Slughorn is an active Death Eater. He enjoys his creature comforts far too much to relinquish them, and yet, he has gone into hiding. He seems rather taken aback, in fact, to realize that he has been hidden and incommunicado for a year. If he is a Death Eater, he may have refused to answer the Dark Mark summons; in that case, he likely fears for his life should he be found. This would explain him hiding, and his actions upon detecting a wizard Apparating into his current home village. However, Dumbledore asks if the Death Eaters have &quot;come recruiting&quot;; the implication is that Slughorn is seen as a potential or past ally, rather than an actual Death Eater. Additionally, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we will see that Slughorn continues to teach at the school even after the school has become a Death Eater stronghold. With Voldemort's tendency to exact revenge on those who failed to respond to the initial summons (for instance [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]]), it is unlikely that Slughorn, if he had been a Death Eater the first time Voldemort was in power, would have survived the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]'s fall.

The apparent ease with which Dumbledore manipulates Slughorn into agreeing to be a teacher at Hogwarts should be noted by readers. This shows a side of Dumbledore's character which we have not been aware of until now. An astute reader might wonder, given Dumbledore's skill at convincing Slughorn to come out of hiding, whether Dumbledore might not be using this same skill on Harry. Is he being as forthright with Harry as he seems? If not, what would be Dumbledore's intent? This concern will be brought out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the final book in the series]], where Harry will discover that Dumbledore had apparently been concealing his younger life. Dumbledore's brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], will tell Harry that this pattern of manipulation was one that Dumbledore had followed for much of his later life.

* The blood spattered around the walls of the house where Slughorn is hiding is, in fact, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon's blood]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]], we saw that Dumbledore's fame comes in part from a treatise on the Twelve Uses of Dragon's Blood. That treatise is mentioned here, amid banter about this being a thirteenth use.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Frequent deaths and disappearances are occurring throughout the Wizarding world. On [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s birthday, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] had been found dead with indications he had been killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Others, such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Florean Fortescue|Florean Fortescue]], who owns the ice cream parlour in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]], the wand maker, are missing. 

Booklists arrive, along with an announcement that Harry is the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] captain. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] says that gives Harry equal status with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], allowing him to use their luxurious bathroom. 

Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys go shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley, accompanied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who works for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]], has retrieved a sack of money for Harry from his vault because security is so tight. In ''Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions'', Harry, Hermione, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] have a nasty encounter with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and his snobbish mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]. When the dressmaker tries lifting Draco's left robe sleeve as she is measuring him, he jerks his arm away, claiming she stuck him with a pin; he and his mother quickly leave.

Harry, Ron, Hermione and the other Weasleys head for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]]'s joke shop, which is enjoying a booming trade. Not only are joke items selling well, but the Twins are also supplying spell-deflecting Shield Hats, Cloaks, Gloves, and other serious magical items to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] (presumably for the war against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]).

Harry spots Draco passing the shop alone. Hidden under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], Harry, Ron, and Hermione trail Draco into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] and to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]], the Dark magic shop. Using Weasley's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]], they overhear Draco asking how to repair something. Draco threatens Borgin, showing him something on his arm, but the large black cabinet that Harry hid inside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|four years earlier]] partially blocks their view. Draco warns that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], a 'family friend', will be &quot;dropping in from time-to-time to see that you're giving this matter your full attention.&quot; Draco also reserves an item for himself, ordering Borgin to keep it secret. After Draco exits, Hermione, hoping to learn what Draco reserved, enters the store pretending to be looking for a birthday present for her &quot;friend&quot; Draco. Borgin, suspicious, orders her to leave and puts a &quot;Closed&quot; sign on his door.

They return to Fred and George's store under the Invisibility Cloak. To calm [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], worried over their absence, they claim they were in the back room.

== Analysis == 

That Death Eaters have killed Karkaroff isn't the least bit surprising, as they think nothing of killing traitors, and Karkaroff himself had clearly expected it.

The trip to Diagon Alley physically shows just how much Voldemort's growing power is beginning to affect the Wizarding world. Not only are once-prosperous shops being vacated, but people, including Mr. Ollivander, the wand maker, have disappeared, their whereabouts unknown. The Twins' joke shop is able to thrive in this increasingly hostile environment, though their supplying the Ministry with weapons to fight Voldemort could make them targets. 

Harry, meanwhile, is suspicious that Draco's visit to Borgin &amp; Burkes involves something sinister, though Ron and Hermione discount this. Draco threatens Borgin into assisting him by mentioning that someone named Fenrir Greyback is a &quot;family friend.&quot; Whoever Greyback may be, Draco clearly feels the name alone is apparently sufficient to ensure Borgin's cooperation. Whatever Draco must repair, it may be related to the task Voldemort assigned him that was mentioned in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|second chapter]]. It is particularly interesting that Draco may be performing this step of his task without his mother's knowledge – perhaps she is somehow attempting to prevent him from undertaking this mission so Snape will have to complete it for him, as he is now magically bound to do. Draco jerking his arm away from the dressmaker but threateningly showing it to Borgin is significant; his forearm may carry Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]]. Harry certainly suspects it does; if he is correct, it would be a clear sign that Draco has become a Death Eater.

Hermione's attempt to gather more information about Draco at Borgin &amp; Burkes shows that she is learning to act more spontaneously under stressful conditions. However, her actions here were not only clumsy, they clearly created suspicion in Borgin's mind that someone is investigating Draco's actions. Whether that suspicion will get back to the Malfoy family is uncertain. We don't hear the entire conversation between Borgin and Draco, and Draco's having evaded his mother for this mission suggests strongly that he, at least, believes that his family doesn't know about it. Malfoy may have told Borgin that his parents were not to know about this, before the Trio's eavesdropping started. If Borgin reports his suspicions at all, it's possible that they will be reported only to Draco.

Unlike Harry, Ron and Hermione remain skeptical that Draco is a Death Eater, though they still support Harry, even knowing he makes emotion-driven assumptions that are as often wrong as they are right. They are at least willing to consider Harry's speculation here, while offering their own opinions to counterbalance his. Readers, having previously witnessed the encounter at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s home in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Spinner's End|Spinner's End]], have a far better idea that Draco has indeed been assigned a significantly important task for Voldemort, though just what that might be is still unknown. Considering that dire events in the Wizarding world are unfolding at an alarming rate as Voldemort's power grows, it may seem that Ron and Hermione are being unrealistically dismissive regarding Harry's suspicions. However, despite the Malfoy family's affiliation with Voldemort and their affinity for the Dark Arts, Ron and Hermione simply believe that Draco is just too young and inexperienced to be a Death Eater or to have been entrusted with an important mission. While this is never explicitly stated, the reader has seen that Harry has been entrusted with an important mission himself, and likely sees no reason why Draco would be excluded from being a Death Eater simply on the basis of age.

Not only was Harry disappointed (and also jealous) the previous year when Ron was made a Gryffindor Prefect and he was not, but he was also rather offended. However, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|at the end of the previous book]], it is revealed that this was a deliberate decision by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. His stated reason was, &quot;I must confess... that I rather thought you had enough responsibility to be going on with.&quot; Selecting Ron as Prefect was possibly, in part, to allow Ron an opportunity to assume an independent role apart from Harry's celebrity and influence so he could develop his own abilities and identity. When Harry becomes Quidditch captain, Hermione points out that he now has equal status to a Prefect and shares similar privileges.

This revelation that the house Quidditch Captain has equal privileges to Prefects feels a bit like the author's afterthought. While it is mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] was Quidditch Captain, nowhere in that book is it mentioned that he is a Prefect, a fact that would have been significantly important to the students. Thus, we must conclude that he was not a Prefect. And yet, he knew about the Prefects' bathroom and was able to give Harry the password to enter it. Likely, we will never know the author's intent, but it seems that granting Quidditch captains access to the Prefects' bathroom could be a means to rationalize Cedric's knowledge about that privilege, knowledge that could not be explained otherwise.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry will remain convinced that Draco is involved in a sinister plot throughout the entire year. To uncover what that is, he will continually trail Draco, piecing clues together leading to a definitive answer. Harry will become nearly obsessed by this quest, to the point that even some readers will feel he has been going too far. Harry's suspicions will, however, turn out to be justified.

Items that we see in the Weasleys' shop will prove important in this story and later. In particular, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]] will be used in this book against Ron, much to his dismay; and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the next book]], the Trio will have use for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Puking Pastilles]], Extendable Ears, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Decoy Detonator|Decoy Detonators]]. Similarly, items seen in Borgin and Burkes will play roles in this book; the cursed necklace and the Hand of Glory, both first seen by Harry when he accidentally visited that store [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|in his second year]], show up later in this book

While Harry, Ron, and Hermione are spying on Draco, they are unable to see what he shows to Borgin because Draco was behind a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]]. This cabinet apparently matches one in Hogwarts, which is seen later when Harry hides his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] textbook in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. The Hogwarts Vanishing Cabinet was broken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|during Harry's second year]] at the school. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] took Harry into his office, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] convinced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] to drop the cabinet over the office as a diversion so Harry could escape. Apparently the Weasley twins [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|once forced]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] into it, before it was hidden away in the Room of Requirement. The cabinet turns out to be a key part of the task Draco has been set, and plays a significant role in the book's conclusion.

Even though Hermione's attempts to learn what Draco was doing at Borgin &amp; Burkes could have inadvertently alerted Draco Malfoy that hiss secret mission was being investigated, it will be Draco himself who deliberately allows Harry to eavesdrop on a conversation where Draco boasts that he has been assigned an important task for the Dark Lord. 

Readers will learn that Fenrir Greyback, who Draco mentions is a &quot;family friend&quot;, is a particularly vicious [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] pack leader who serves Voldemort. It was Greyback who attacked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] when he was a young boy, turning him into a werewolf. Lupin will eventually infiltrate Greyback's pack as a spy for Dumbledore.

Mr. Ollivander's disappearance will play an important role in the final book. While we never see Fortescue again, it will turn out that Ollivander has been captured by Voldemort, specifically for his knowledge of wand lore.

Sent in an attempt to kill Dumbledore, it fails when Katie touches the necklace and is cursed by it.
** Considering the Disappearing Cabinet that Draco is half hidden behind, and the one at Hogwarts, as a unit, we will see them again several times. The one in Borgin &amp; Burkes first appeared when Harry hid from Draco and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|his father]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|four years earlier]]. The Hogwarts cabinet is dropped and broken by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]], at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s request, to distract [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|later in that book]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]] stuff [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] into it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. Draco learns of its linkage to the one at Borgin &amp; Burkes from Montague, and in this chapter demands assistance in its repair from Borgin. Draco then spends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|all of his spare time throughout the year]] attempting to repair it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 24|Late in the year]], Harry actually sees the Cabinet in the Room of Requirement where Draco has been trying to repair it. The repaired cabinet is the way that Draco smuggles Death Eaters into the school to support him while he tries to carry out his assignment from Voldemort. And Harry will be looking for this cabinet again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|the final book]] as he searches for the Diadem.

** [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Skiving Snackboxes]] first appear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where the Twins' development and testing of the product is an ongoing subplot, and a source of some friction with Hermione. They will later appear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where they will be used to incapacitate Ministry employees so the Trio can infiltrate the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].
** [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]] first appear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], when the Twins use them to attempt to eavesdrop on the Order meeting in the kitchen. They are also used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|later in that book]] to eavesdrop on the conversation in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley's]] hospital room. And they will be used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 15|in the final book]] to listen in on another party of refugees who camp close to where the Trio are hiding.
** [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Decoy Detonator|A Decoy Detonator]], of the type seen here on a shelf in the shop, will be used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 13|in the final book]] to make a distraction while Harry breaks into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge's]] office in the Ministry.
** [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]] will be used by Draco to conceal himself and the Death Eaters he is bringing into the school late in this book.
* Mr. Ollivander will turn out to have been captured by Death Eaters and secured in the basement of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. There, he will be required to create a wand for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], and will be grilled on wand lore by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Arriving at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] are met by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]. Also present is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], whose colorless and sad appearance shocks Harry; her usually vibrant pink hair is now a mousy brown. Tonks insists she must go and declines a weekend dinner invitation, hearing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye]] will be there. Mrs. Weasley asks Harry about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]. Apparently, he started teaching at Hogwarts about the same time as Dumbledore, and he taught Mrs. Weasley. She disapproved of Slughorn's favorites, apparently since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] was not among them. 

Mr. Weasley has recently been appointed head of the new ''Office of Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects''. This promotion will help improve the Weasley finances. When Mr. Weasley arrives home, he discusses the counterfeit devices he has found. Harry is actually interested, but when he attempts to stifle a yawn, Mrs. Weasley sends him to bed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins']] vacant room. They are now living in a little apartment over their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] shop.

The next morning, Harry is awakened by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who are concerned about his well-being after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/The Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the battle at the Ministry]]. Harry tells them about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], who is replacing former [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] slouches in, complaining about someone she refers to as &quot;'''''her'''''&quot;; Harry's curiosity is ended when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] enters with his breakfast tray, and Mrs. Weasley in her wake. Fleur says she and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] are marrying next summer, then heads back downstairs. Ron is still clearly rather infatuated by Fleur, but the three women feel she is very full of herself and wonder what Bill sees in her. Ginny derogatorily calls her &quot;Phlegm&quot;, upsetting Mrs. Weasley, but making Harry and Hermione laugh.

When Mrs. Weasley departs, Ron, clearly still embarrassed in Fleur's presence, confides it is hard getting used to having Fleur around when she jumps out like that. Ron, Ginny, and Hermione agree that Mrs. Weasley is unlikely to get Bill interested in Tonks rather than Fleur. Tonks has been depressed since her cousin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], had died. That she evidently blames herself for Sirius' death interests Harry, who carries the same guilt. As a result, Tonks has apparently lost the ability, or perhaps the inclination, to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Metamorphmagus|transform her physical appearance at will]].

After Ginny leaves, Ron tells Harry that the family and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] remain estranged, despite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s return. Ron and Hermione are amazed that Dumbledore wants to give Harry private lessons. Harry reveals the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] to them, and Ron and Hermione worry that Harry will have to face Voldemort. Harry is also worried, but on reflection, realizes he has always known he would eventually have to face Voldemort. Privately, he is greatly reassured by Ron and Hermione not abandoning him at the revelation that he is fated to either kill Voldemort or be killed by him.

Shortly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione receive their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.]] results. It is revealed that &quot;T&quot;, rather than a joke by the Twins, is an actual grade meaning ''Troll'', not ''Terrible'' as might be imagined. Harry's grades are:

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]]: Acceptable (A)		
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]]: Exceeds Expectations (E)	
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]]: E		
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]: Outstanding (O)	
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]]: Poor (P)		
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]]: E		
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]]: Dreadful (D)		
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]]: E		
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]]: E		

These results are good, but Harry's hope to become an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] has apparently been dashed. He needed an 'O' in Potions for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] to accept him into his advanced Potions course, one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T.]] subjects required to become an Auror.

Ron receives similar grades, minus the one 'Outstanding', and is quite pleased that he only failed Divination and History of Magic. Mrs Weasley is also very proud, noting that Ron has achieved more O.W.L.s than Fred and George together. Hermione, as everyone except herself expected, receives 9 'O's and one 'E' (in Defence Against the Dark Arts). All three have passed into N.E.W.T. level, although Harry privately regrets that he will be unable to join the Auror profession and cannot think what else he would like to be.

== Analysis ==

Harry is shocked by Tonks' radically changed appearance. There is no explanation yet as to what might have happened since she was last seen about a month ago, but she is no longer the cheerful and vibrant person Harry last saw. Some readers may believe, given the amount of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] hysteria about Dark wizards, that Tonks is being controlled by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. Hermione, Ginny, and Ron think she is suffering from grief and guilt over Sirius' death and may even have been in love with him. Readers who are aware that Sirius was Tonks' cousin may believe the relationship is too close for marriage, but examination of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|Black family tree]] shows that they are in fact second cousins, and so distantly enough related that they could marry. Sirius' mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Walburga]], is sister to Cygnus, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda Black's]] father, making Andromeda a first cousin to Sirius, and Tonks, as Andromeda's daughter would be second cousin to Sirius. As a side note, we will point out that the Black family is no stranger to inbreeding: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Orion Black|Sirius' father]] and mother both descend from the marriage of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]] and Ursula Flint, their mutual great-grandparents.

Harry also fears, on getting his OWL results, that his professional future has been permanently derailed. The only career that interested him is an Auror (Dark wizard catcher), even though the primary person who encouraged him was actually a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] in disguise ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]]). Unfortunately, Harry's Potions grade is too low to admit him into Snape's N.E.W.T.-level Potions classes, which he needs to fulfill the Auror prerequisites. This will deeply trouble Harry, and being unable to pursue his chosen career path leaves him discouraged and feeling adrift. Harry's tendency to be single-minded has, as yet, prevented him from seriously considering other professions, and with his chosen career track now apparently closed to him, he is uncertain how to proceed.

In another continuity glitch common in this lengthy series, we see Mrs. Weasley's clock, now with all its nine hands, one for each family member, pointing at Mortal Peril. The astute reader may have noticed that here it is apparently a mantel clock, while in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] it is described as a grandfather clock. Mrs. Weasley claims that nobody else has a clock like that, which is probably why Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|specifically mentioned it]] at one point. The unique nature of the clock would suggest that possibly someone in the family built it or had it built to specification, and in fact with his known ability with mechanical magical devices, it might well have been Dumbledore himself who built it for them. As the clock has a hand for Ginny, it must have been built or modified after Ginny was born, in 1981, which would argue that the clockmaker is still alive. It is possible that Mrs. Weasley wanted the clock to be more portable, and had the original builder, or a clock-maker, separate the mechanism from the clock case and build a mantel-type case for it. This continuity problem does not hinder our appreciation of the story; it is only mentioned as a side light.

Another minor problem occurs in early editions of this book. Hermione had initially been taking &quot;everything&quot;, which came to twelve graded courses, in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. She dropped Divination mid-year, and reports that she will no longer need the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-turner]] at the end of the year because, having also dropped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle Studies|Muggle Studies]], she can now fit all of her courses in a normal schedule. Thus, she must now be taking 10 courses. Early editions of the book show her receiving 10 Outstanding and one Exceeds Expectations grades, for a total of eleven courses. Later editions drop that to nine Outstanding grades.

Harry's belief that Slughorn is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor is to be expected, as we have seen five different teachers fill that post in the previous five books. The author clearly intends for us to make this erroneous assumption, as Slughorn, Dumbledore, and Mrs. Weasley all fail to mention that Slughorn had previously taught Potions. This revelation, when it occurs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 8|in a few chapters]], will have major effects on Harry and his future, and will provide a core plot device for this book.

Tonks' forlorn emotional state has little to do with Sirius' death, but is actually because she is in love with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who spurns her affection. Lupin believes that being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] makes him unworthy, that he is too old for her, and that the times are too unsettled to risk bringing children into the world in any event. Mrs. Weasley comments that in troubled times like these, people &quot;rush into decisions that they'd normally take time over.&quot; She is referring to Bill and Fleur's engagement, that she believes was made rather hastily, but it could equally apply to Tonks, who wants to pursue a relationship with Lupin. His repeated refusal (which we must infer, as we never see it directly) will, over the course of this book, cause Tonks' increasing depression. As another result, we will see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 8|later]] that Tonks' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] has changed into &quot;something large and hairy.&quot; It appears to Harry to be a dog, which reinforces the mistaken belief that she was in love with Sirius Black. We will finally learn the facts of the relationship between Tonks and Lupin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 29|late in this book]], and Harry will then realize that Tonks' Patronus is now a wolf.

In retrospect, Percy's continued estrangement from the family will be seen as quite in character. Dumbledore at one point will comment that it is sometimes much easier to forgive someone for being wrong, than it is to forgive them for being right. While we note that this makes Dumbledore an observant man and an excellent student of human behaviour, we must also point out that in order for Dumbledore to have this insight, the author must also possess this level of understanding.

=== Connections ===
Apart from ongoing plot lines, there is little that connects this chapter to other sections of the series. We do find out some trivia about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in this chapter, but while they are possibly of interest to the student, they are not referenced outside this chapter.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Back at the Burrow, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] claims that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] are met with skepticism by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who argue that Draco is too young and inexperienced for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] to entrust him with any important task. Harry, still convinced, cites how Draco yanked his arm away from Madam Malkin, the same arm where Death Eaters carry a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]]. Malfoy also showed Borgin something on the same forearm that apparently caused Borgin to take Malfoy seriously. 

Vexed that Ron and Hermione remain unconvinced, Harry heads to the kitchen, interrupting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], who is in full flow with her wedding plans, much to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]'s relief. Mrs. Weasley wants everyone packed the night before leaving for Hogwarts to avoid the usual last-minute chaotic rush. The next morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] cars arrive to transport them to the station. Surprisingly, everyone is ready on time, their trunks packed, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s new pet, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pygmy Puff|Pygmy Puff]] named Arnold, are all safely caged. Harry speaks privately with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] regarding Draco Malfoy's suspicious behavior. Mr. Weasley is also doubtful that Draco is a Death Eater and says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] was raided; anything even slightly Dark was confiscated. 

On the Hogwarts Express, Ron and Hermione report to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects']] carriage while Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] find a free compartment. Harry is bemused at being in the spotlight again, and shortly after, fourth-year student [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]] invites Harry to sit with her and some other students. Harry declines, saying he is with friends. Harry discusses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L results]], and Neville wonders if he will be able to take [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T.-level]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] with only an Acceptable test result. Harry muses to himself that it could as easily have been Neville with the scar and the admirers.

Ron and Hermione return with news that Malfoy is just sitting in his compartment; it is unlike him to be doing anything other than lording over other Slytherin students. As Harry ponders Draco's uncharacteristic behavior, a third-year girl appears with lunch invitations for Harry and Neville from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. There is a large gathering, including Ginny and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Blaise Zabini|Blaise Zabini]], a Slytherin in Harry's year. As Slughorn interrogates them, it becomes apparent that the invitees are all connected to influential Wizarding families, except for Ginny, who was included because Slughorn was impressed with her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bat Bogey Hex|Bat-Bogey Hex]]. Having questioned Harry, Neville, Ginny, Blaise, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Belby|Marcus Belby]], to assess their family connections and prospects, Slughorn entertains them (excepting Marcus, who is estranged from his famous uncle) for the afternoon, then dismisses them to prepare for arrival at Hogwarts.

Leaving Slughorn's carriage, Harry slips on his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and tails Zabini to the Slytherin carriage to eavesdrop on Malfoy. Climbing into the luggage rack, Harry worries that Malfoy glimpsed his trainer (US: sneaker), but Malfoy simply settles back with his head on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]]'s lap.

Malfoy is annoyed at being excluded, but Zabini says Slughorn is only interested in students' connections to influential wizards, and speculates he is uninterested in Death Eaters. Malfoy lets slip that he may not return to Hogwarts next year, claiming he has moved on to, &quot;bigger and better things.&quot; When Zabini asks what an unqualified wizard could do for Voldemort, Malfoy retorts his task may not require qualifications.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] Station, Malfoy remains behind in the compartment. In a surprise move, he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrifies]] Harry. Malfoy spotted Harry's shoe as he climbed onto the luggage rack. As revenge, Malfoy stomps on Harry's nose, breaking it, then tosses the Invisibility Cloak over him so he will go unnoticed until after the train returns to London.

== Analysis ==

Harry is frustrated that Ron and Hermione are continually dismissive regarding his suspicions about Draco. However, their frequent skepticism often acts as a counterbalance to his occasional overreaction and drawing conclusions without fully considering all facts and opinions. This time, however, Harry is positive that Draco has become a Death Eater and is involved in some malicious plot, and seems nearly obsessed with proving it. Considering the information readers are already privy to regarding Draco's task for Voldemort, Harry is obviously correct, although he, and also we, are still clueless as to just what that is, other than it requires repairing some object that probably contains Dark magic.

For the first time, Harry's budding romantic feelings for Ginny are seen. As she goes to meet Dean, Harry feels a slightly annoyed twinge which could be interpreted as jealousy. Of course, Harry may not recognize this emotion because he has never thought of Ginny this way before, but he clearly sees her in a different way.
 
Slughorn's personality is becoming more apparent here as he immediately begins singling out those students connected to influential families. And though Slughorn was formerly the head of Slytherin House, it appears that he does not fully embrace their pure-blood beliefs. In addition to Slytherins, Slughorn invites other well-connected students, and also those, like Ginny Weasley, displaying exceptional magical talent. Draco is offended at being excluded, but someone points out that Slughorn is probably uninterested in Death Eaters, though he may be distancing himself for other reasons. Though Harry was invited for his fame, Slughorn also included him and Neville because both were involved in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]]. He repeatedly tries to pump them for details about that incident, but each remains silent for their own particular reasons. Curiously, even though Ron and Luna were also involved in the battle, they were uninvited. 

Harry also demonstrates personal integrity when he declines Romilda Vane's invitation to sit in her compartment with the other popular students. While he wishes to avoid the attention and others fawning over him, he also prefers Neville and Luna's company, two people he once would have been embarrassed to hang out with, but now feels the most comfortable being around. Their loyalty and bravery at the Ministry of Magic battle has forever altered Harry's opinion and esteem for them, showing his growing maturity in valuing others for their inner worth and accepting these two so-called &quot;misfits&quot; as his peers and friends. His influence has dramatically helped each one to realize their untapped potential, while they, in turn, befriend him for the person he is, rather than his celebrity.

And while Harry shows great maturity and personal integrity in accepting Luna as a friend and equal, Ron does not. When Harry invites her to a party later in the story, Ron will chastise him for asking &quot;Loony&quot; Luna. As Luna herself will accurately note, Ron can sometimes be funny but also hurtful. It does seem that Ron has forgotten Luna's participation in Dumbledore's Army and how she always responded to Harry's distress calls, as well as risked her own life at the Department of Mysteries battle to aid Harry and Ron.

Although Draco has always been portrayed as a cowardly bully, he is a powerful wizard, and his intelligence and magical abilities are often underrated. Throughout the story, he is well aware that Harry is trailing his movements, and he even intentionally lets slip some enticing information within Harry's hearing regarding his connection to Voldemort. Just why he does so is unknown, though Draco seldom resists showing off and extolling his own perceived virtues to others. Draco must also have been relatively confident that Harry would never report the attack (and breaking his nose), thus allowing Draco to indulge himself in his cruel act. However, there may be other underlying reasons for at least some of his brazen behavior.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Over the school year, Harry becomes nearly obsessed with Draco Malfoy's suspicious behavior and goes to extreme lengths to uncover what he is plotting. Eventually he discovers that Malfoy is indeed involved in a sinister scheme, although Draco's participation is not entirely what it seems. Just why Draco purposely allowed Harry to overhear critical information while on the Hogwarts Express is unclear. Whether he was just being careless, arrogantly confident, or subconsciously hoping that Voldemort's plan would be discovered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] through Harry is unknown, though the latter reason will seem more plausible by the book's conclusion. Harry will report his suspicions about Draco, and later about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], to Dumbledore at various times throughout the year, and, from his point-of-view at least, is seemingly rebuffed each time. It is revealed later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]], that Dumbledore already knows about Draco's mission and Snape's involvement. Careful attention should be paid to how Dumbledore addresses Harry's accusations: Dumbledore never says he disbelieves Harry, rather that the issue is not Harry's concern. Harry, however, fails to perceive this important detail, instead increasing his efforts to uncover some clue that will convince Dumbledore that his suspicions are valid.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] suddenly appears in the compartment and unpetrifies [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. Before the departing train picks up too much speed, they leap off. Tonks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Episkey|mends]] Harry's broken nose and then sends a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus Charm]] to the castle. She is not guarding Hogwarts alone; Proudfoot, Savage, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] are also there. Harry again notices her depressed and unhappy expression, and that her usual vibrantly-colored hair remains faded. Harry speculates that she was in love with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] and is mourning his death.

Reaching Hogwarts, they are met by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], who ridicules Tonks' new Patronus. Snape deducts 70 points from Gryffindor, then escorts Harry to the Great Hall without allowing him to change into his robes. Embarrassed and ashamed, Harry does not report [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]]'s actions, and when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] ask where he was, he tells them to wait until later.

After the feast (which Harry misses by a few seconds), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] announces two new appointments. Professor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] is the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] Master, while Professor Snape is now the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructor. Everyone is stunned by Snape's appointment, one he has coveted for so long. Harry is particularly angered, though the Slytherin table enthusiastically greets the news. With [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] reappearance, Dumbledore has implemented new security measures, and before dismissing them, he requests that students be patient and cooperative and to report any concerns they may have.

Hermione leads the first-years to the Gryffindor dorms, but Ron remains behind with Harry, who relates what happened on the train, and Draco's discussion. Ron believes Draco was probably just showing off for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] approaches and says they can say hello to  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Witherwings|Witherwings]] (Buckbeak) if they arrive early enough for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] class. When Hagrid departs, Harry and Ron wonder how he will react to the news that his three favorite students are not taking his course.

== Analysis ==

Harry's growing obsession over Draco caused him to be careless, giving Draco an advantage&amp;mdash;he knew Harry was eavesdropping and would likely be monitoring him. Just why Draco purposely revealed so much to Harry is puzzling, however. It would also seem that Harry, having been caught eavesdropping by Draco, would now consider the information to be false and merely intended to manipulate and taunt Harry. Instead, Harry fully believes everything Draco said and continues to act to prove it. Although Ron and Hermione doubt Draco's claims and want Harry to disregard it, readers already know that Draco is being truthful, though exactly what his mission is, remains a mystery. Also, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]] is guarding Hogwarts, Tonks finding Harry so quickly indicates that Harry is particularly being protected. When Harry failed to emerge from the train with the other students, Tonks searched for him. Although she says the Order has stationed her in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], she may actually have been assigned to guard Harry; though, of course, as a friend of Harry's, she may simply have wanted to see him as he got off the Express and just wanted to be sure that he arrived safely there.

A wizard's Patronus cannot be consciously chosen, but instead reflects the person casting it. Therefore, Tonks' new Patronus form must signify her current emotional state. Although it is unknown what new form it has taken, or what shape it was before, it is a significant enough change for Snape to jeer at it. This is also the second time the Patronus has been seen as other than a defensive charm, the first time being in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] used it to summon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].

Although Dumbledore has finally appointed Snape to the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching position he has so long coveted, why he chooses to do so now is unclear and rather mysterious. While Dumbledore has never doubted Snape's loyalty, Snape's past history and his affinity for the Dark Arts has apparently been an ongoing concern. However, both Dumbledore and Snape know there is a specific reason why no one has ever served longer than one year in that post. Ron alludes to this, saying that he believes it is jinxed. If it is, then Dumbledore and Snape must have somehow overcome this particular obstacle, or neither intend for Snape to remain in that position any longer than his predecessors. Although Harry is angry that Snape was appointed, it may actually provide an as-yet-unknown benefit.

It is revealed later that Voldemort did indeed cast a curse on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position. Ever since Dumbledore rejected him for the job, no teacher has remained in that position for more than one school year. Knowing this, it is curious as to why Snape continually applied for the position each year, or why Dumbledore chooses to appoint him now. It will be learned in the next book that Dumbledore, as a youth, was briefly attracted to the Dark arts when he befriended Gellert Grindelwald, who later became a notorious Dark Wizard that Dumbledore defeated in a famous duel. Dumbledore fully rejected Dark magic, though he never trusted himself to be in a position of power, choosing instead to teach at Hogwarts. One reason Dumbledore may have repeatedly denied Snape the position is because he similarly feared that Snape could be tempted by teaching a subject so closely linked to his Death Eater past. He also knew it was pointless to appoint Snape, assuming he was unlikely to hold the position any longer than his predecessors, and it would risk losing his talented potions instructor. As it turns out, Snape will also only hold the position for the one year. Both Snape and Dumbledore know, however, that Dumbledore's life expectancy is less than a year at this point, and Dumbledore has, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|as we see in the final book]], required Snape to promise that he will take over as Headmaster at Hogwarts after Dumbledore's death, to protect the school and the students. Dumbledore also needed to vacate Snape's position so he could bring back Professor Horace Slughorn, Hogwarts' former potions master, solely to obtain an important memory Slughorn has guarded that is related to Voldemort and his Horcruxes. 

Also, Harry notes that Tonks' Patronus is &quot;something large and hairy&quot;, and, reviewing recent events, decides that it may be related to Sirius' death, and that her ongoing melancholy is probably due to this as well. The reader may wonder why Tonks will still seem so sad, months later, when Harry sees her inside the castle. In fact, her depression is because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] repeatedly rejects her affections. He apparently does love her, but feels he is too old for her, times are too dangerous, and, being a Werewolf, believes it is too risky to father children. As a result, her Patronus has assumed a wolf shape.

Although Snape jeers at Tonks for her new Patronus form, understanding what it represents, it will be revealed in the final book that his own Patronus is its current shape for similar reasons. It is entirely possible that Snape, consciously or otherwise recognizing the reason Tonks' Patronus has changed, feels the need to denigrate it to somewhat salve his own feelings.</text>

The next morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] what he overheard on the train. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] repeats that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was probably just showing off for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy]], but Hermione thinks that is an awfully big lie just to impress a girl. Ron takes a Fanged Frisbee that Hermione has just confiscated from a student, saying he has always wanted one. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] giggles at Ron as she passes by.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] hands out schedules, a complicated process for sixth-year students because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL results]] determine which classes students qualify for. Hermione gets her courses straight away, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville's]] Acceptable OWL grade is too low for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]].

Harry's lost hope to become an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] is suddenly revived when he learns that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] accepts a lower OWL grade (Exceeds Expectations) than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] (Outstanding) for NEWT-level [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] classes. Both Harry and Ron sign up, though Harry worries that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] will be upset that they are not taking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]]. Professor McGonagall also hands Harry a list with new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] recruits. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, Snape demonstrates nonverbal spells (performing magic without a spoken incantation), and uses Harry to demonstrate; Harry instinctively reacts by blasting a spoken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|Shield Charm]] at Snape, and (after giving him cheek) earns a detention. A student arrives bearing a message from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] regarding their private lesson, which happens to be scheduled at the same time as the detention.

Harry finds Potions far more enjoyable without Snape. Hermione, as usual, excels and earns Gryffindor thirty points for correctly guessing three cauldrons' content, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Amortentia|a Love potion]], and for accurately identifying the effects of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]]. Slughorn is impressed by her abilities, even though she is Muggle-born. Another Muggle-born student, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] (Harry's mother), was another favorite, though he tends to favor purebloods. That he is the former Head of Slytherin House further supports this tendency.

As the name suggests, Felix Felicis is liquid luck. One tablespoon at breakfast will provide a perfect day. It is dangerous if made improperly and is banned in competitions, examinations, and elections. Excessive consumption can cause giddiness, recklessness, and even death. For the first lesson, whoever brews the best [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Draught of Living Death|Draught of Living Death]] will win a tiny flask of Felix Felicis from Slughorn, enough luck for twelve hours.

Draco attempts to curry favour with Professor Slughorn by mentioning his apparently famous grandfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Abraxas Malfoy|Abraxas Malfoy]]; Harry is pleased that it doesn't seem to work. Harry brews his potion using a second-hand textbook, ''Advanced Potion Making'', that Slughorn loans him until he can buy his own copy. In the book's margins are many hand-written new spells and jinxes, as well as revisions to standard potions. The revisions seem more effective than the original instructions, and Harry brews the best Living Death draught in the class, winning him the Good Luck potion. 

Hermione is furious when Harry later admits that he used the mysterious book's instructions. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], overhearing, asks if Harry is using instructions from a book. Remembering Ginny's nearly-fatal experience with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Tom Riddle's diary]], Hermione tests the textbook for any hidden magical properties, but is unable to detect any. Harry notices writing on the back cover: ''This book belongs to the Half-Blood Prince''. Whoever the &quot;Prince&quot; may be, Harry is grateful to this talented unknown student.

== Analysis ==

Harry is a naturally intelligent and talented wizard, but academically he is a rather lazy student, usually getting by on average or just-above average grades and often relying on Hermione's help. Potions, in particular, has always proved tedious and difficult for him, partially due to his strained relationship with Professor Snape. It is only when a particular subject, like Defence Against the Dark Arts, interests Harry that he works hard and excels at it. For the first time, he is challenged to learn about Potions after discovering a talented former student's innovative methods to brewing standard potions more efficiently. Harry is a non-traditional learner, and while Snape has ineffectively taught him Potions, the Half-Blood Prince, in a brief time period, has inspired him to learn more than he has over the past five years, even though it is with unorthodox methods. Harry may also be feeling somewhat pressured to live up to his mother's reputation in Slughorn's Potions class. And though Hermione is outraged that Harry ignores official potion-making instructions, an action she feels is equivalent to cheating, the Prince's book has given Harry an alternative learning avenue that has aroused his academic curiosity and will serve him later in the story. Hermione's negative reaction, while justified, may also be tinged by jealousy and resentment. She has always earned the top grades in her classes (except Defense Against the Dark Arts), and she revels in the accompanying accolades; now, Harry is outshining her in Potions, something she may have difficulty accepting, especially considering that she feels Harry has done so with illicit methods compared to her diligent studying.
 
Though Hermione correctly identifies the three cauldrons' contents in Slughorn's class, winning her high praise and House points, it is hardly surprising that she recognizes the Polyjuice Potion, having brewed it herself during her second year (in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''). Unfortunately, for Hermione at least, the results were less than successful when she accidentally added cat hair rather than human to her portion, leaving her covered in fur and sporting a tail and whiskers, as well as landing her in the infirmary for weeks.

This chapter drops another hint that Harry has growing feelings for Ginny. In the first Potions class, when Harry sniffs the love potion, he detects &quot;''treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]''&quot;. And later, when the Trio meet Ginny, Harry, &quot;''caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon''&quot;. Hermione mentions that a love potion contains the scent of what it is that attracts a person to someone, and it is different for each individual; she runs off the scents she detected, but stops short before mentioning the third, possibly afraid that it would identify someone she cares about. By this stage in the series, we should certainly know Harry's feelings about broomsticks and treacle tart, and it is hardly surprising that Hermione characteristically identifies one odor as fresh parchment. Harry's noticing Ginny's scent in the potion, even though he does not yet recognize it, shows his growing attraction to her, while simultaneously oblivious to that fact.

Neville is despondent that he is unable to take NEWT-level Transfiguration, and taking Charms as an option hardly heartens him, saying his grandmother believes it is a &quot;soft&quot; course with little value. However, he is greatly cheered to discover that his fearsome grandmother failed her OWL-level Charms exam. This single, small event puts a human face on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|Augusta Longbottom]], who has only been a starchy, distant presence with a vulture on her hat, but is now revealed as having the all-too-human tendency to discount any skill she performs poorly at. It is one more step on Neville gaining his independence from his grandmother.

It is interesting that Harry's mother was so talented at Potions. Particularly given that Snape was in her class, one would expect that Snape would have used Lily as a counter-example to Harry's apparent ineptness. One can almost hear Snape sneering, &quot;Unable to brew a simple Strengthening Solution? Your mother could have done that with one hand tied behind her back. Clearly this apple has fallen far from the tree...&quot; And yet, Snape never once mentioned Lily. There is a reason why not, of course, but it is not revealed until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|the final book in the series]].

Harry will continue searching for hints to the Half-Blood Prince's identity. At Christmas he discovers that the book was printed some fifty years before, which  he believes rules out that it may have belonged to his father. Actually, the Half-Blood Prince attended school when Harry's father and mother were there, though, as a poor student, he was unable to afford new books and purchased second-hand. It is curious, perhaps, that Harry fails to consider the possibility that used textbooks can be purchased, even though he saw that second-hand books were bought for Ginny [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|some years before]].

This used textbook becomes a large plot device throughout the book, with Harry constantly consulting it in Potions class, and thereby becoming one of Slughorn's best students. Additionally, Harry will find many other unrelated magical spells written in the book's margins, using them through the year. Hermione is never entirely happy with Harry using the book's spells, unsure what their provenance is; her worries eventually prove somewhat valid as Harry will discover the very Dark [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] spell in the book, using it with no clue as to its effect.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Over the the next week, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] remains angry about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] using the Prince's notes. She suggests that the &quot;Prince&quot; may be female, based on the book's handwriting, but Harry retorts, &quot;How many girls have been Princes?&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is also angered, because even though Harry has offered to share, Ron is unable to read the tiny handwriting and has to rely on textbook formulas. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], of course, believes Harry is among the best [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] students he has ever taught.

After dodging a tipsy [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] in the hallway, Harry arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] office for his first lesson. Dumbledore explains that they will try to determine [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s intentions, based on Dumbledore's previous investigation. Dumbledore has shared all he knows with Harry; now they are embarking on guesswork and supposition. Dumbledore produces a vial containing memories from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]], who worked in Magical Law Enforcement. Dumbledore pours the contents into his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], and he and Harry enter.

Near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]] village, Bob Ogden approaches a ramshackle cottage. A young wizard with several missing teeth and small, dark eyes staring in opposite directions appears and challenges Ogden, speaking in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. Ogden is jinxed before stating his business. An older wizard appears and addresses the younger one as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]]. He identifies himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Mr. Gaunt]]. When Ogden says he is there about Morfin, Gaunt invites him in. Inside, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope]], Gaunt's teen-aged daughter, is in the kitchen. She has a plain, heavy face, and, like Morfin, her eyes stare in opposite directions.

Ogden says Morfin jinxed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]], whereupon Merope drops a pot, causing Gaunt to taunt her. Ogden, saying Morfin has broken Wizarding law, produces a summons. Gaunt shows him a ring that he says bears the Peverell coat of arms and also points out Merope's locket, claiming it is Salazar Slytherin's, saying they are his descendants. Ogden dismisses this, their heritage has no bearing on Morfin Jinxing a Muggle. Horses are heard approaching outside. In Parseltongue, Morfin says it is the Muggle that Merope fancies and the one he Jinxed. Gaunt demands to know if Merope is chasing a Muggle. When she does not answer, he attacks her; Ogden defends her and is attacked in turn by Morfin, but Ogden escapes. Harry and Dumbledore exit the memory.

Dumbledore says Ogden quickly returned with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] reinforcements; Morfin was sentenced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] for three years while Marvolo Gaunt received six months. Harry instantly recognizes the name: Marvolo was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s grandfather. Dumbledore says that Merope was Voldemort's mother, and his father was the elegant Muggle on horseback that Morfin attacked. Harry wonders how the extremely handsome [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]] could possibly have married the equally unattractive Merope; Dumbledore suspects she used a love potion. The two ran away together, causing a scandal; Marvolo never forgave her and died shortly after his release from Azkaban. 

A few months later, Riddle returned to his manor house alone, saying he had been hoodwinked. Dumbledore suggests that either Merope believed bearing Tom's child would bind him to her and stopped using the love potion or else she lost her ability to perform magic. Voldemort was raised in an orphanage when Merope died soon after giving birth.

Dumbledore agrees that Harry should share this with Ron and Hermione, but warns against spreading it any further. Harry notices a cracked ring on a table, the same ring Dumbledore wore when they visited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]], and the same ring Marvolo Gaunt was wearing in the memory. Dumbledore says he acquired it recently, but turns aside further questions, and sends Harry to bed.

== Analysis ==

If another student was using the Prince's textbook, Hermione, who is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], would likely have confiscated it and reported them. However, she says nothing about Harry, and instead voices her disapproval directly to him, though she knows it will have little effect. This is a typical behavioral pattern for Hermione, who only once has reported Harry for something. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 11|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], she informed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] that Harry had received a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt broom]] from an anonymous donor (who she suspected was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], then believed to be trying to murder Harry). Hermione's motivation was genuine concern over Harry's safety rather than reporting him for mischief. Unfortunately, her actions resulted in a severe backlash and being shunned by Harry and Ron for months, causing her much anguish. Hermione staunchly believes in obeying school rules, but she fears Harry and Ron's retaliation even more, and she  frequently overlooks their minor misconduct. And while Hermione remains disapproving over Harry using the Half-Blood Prince's notes, and resents Harry outperforming her in Potions class, she remains silent, likely fearing another reprisal. Over time, she actually becomes quite curious about the Prince's identity. This has also subtly changed the Trio's relationship. Ron and Harry have usually sought out Hermione mostly for help or information, though they occasionally had to suffer her disdain for their academic laziness. Now Harry has another avenue for finding the information he needs, at least regarding Potions.

Dumbledore's private lessons are hardly what Harry expected. Rather than learning new magic, he is to study Voldemort's past by viewing other people's memories. Exactly how this can aid Harry is still unknown, but learning more about his enemy may help defeat him. Clues about Voldemort's own personality has been gleaned from studying the Gaunts, who had sunk to a low social status and lived in poverty after previous generations squandered the family fortune. Regardless, they still considered themselves superior to other wizard clans based solely on their bloodline's descent from Salazar Slytherin, and therefore expected preferential treatment. This reflects Voldemort's own attitude. And while the Gaunts apparently felt little need to educate or cultivate themselves, the sad, pathetic (and physically unattractive) Merope secretly yearned for a better life, despite her severely limited prospects. When she fell in love with the Muggle, Tom Riddle, she magically entrapped him to escape her abusive family and abysmal life. Unfortunately, as soon as the enchantment wore off, Riddle abandoned the pregnant Merope, who, deeply despondent and either unable or unwilling to use magic to care for herself, died soon after giving birth, leaving her son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] (Voldemort), to be raised in an orphanage. While Harry, and readers, may see Merope as a sympathetic character, it should be remembered that she magically entrapped Tom Riddle, Sr., who otherwise would never have had any interest in her. It is unknown why Merope stopped using magic on him, though perhaps it becomes less effective over time, she was affected by pregnancy, or she may have hoped that Riddle would eventually fall in love with her on his own. While Riddle had every right to leave the bogus relationship, if he knew Merope was pregnant, his abandoning an innocent child is inexcusable; Merope may not have revealed her condition before Riddle was gone, though the orphanage where Tom Jr. was raised certainly knew Riddle Sr.'s identity; it is never known if they were ever in contact with him about his son, however.

Several things in this little scene will prove important. This is the first time Slytherin's locket and the Peverell ring are seen. Both will be turned into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] by Voldemort, though we do not know yet what Horcruxes are. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|the next book]], readers learn why the ring's destruction is necessary, and how Dumbledore injured his hand. In the final book, it is revealed that the ring's stone is one of the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]].

Harry chides Hermione for claiming that the Half-Blood Prince could be a girl. While he is quite right that a royal female is a princess and not a prince, in this particular instance Hermione was more accurate. The &quot;prince&quot;  referred to here is not a royal title at all. Rather, it is someone's surname, and it could therefore have applied to either a male or female. Although Hermione is ultimately wrong that the book's previous owner was a female, nor does she realize yet it is someone's name, that surname did indeed belong to a woman, and she was related to the book's owner. Hermione demonstrates that her logic is more abstract and intuitive than Harry's typical linear reasoning. Rowling is dropping a subtle clue here that readers should look beyond the seemingly obvious.

The Half-Blood Prince's handwriting could possibly reveal his identity. On the notes that were pinned to Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], the handwriting was described as &quot;narrow [and] loopy.&quot; The note about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] was a &quot;narrow handwriting [that] was vaguely familiar.&quot; Both were written by Professor Dumbledore, as are a letter in &quot;narrow, slanting handwriting&quot; Harry received [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|earlier in this book]], as well as the note Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 9|just received]], also in narrow, slanting handwriting. Harry recognizes the similar style; and we can suppose that Dumbledore deliberately made his writing more ornate and loopy when sending Harry the Cloak as a gift. However, we are not granted this clue regarding the Half-Blood Prince. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 15|the previous book]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s grade on Harry's essay is described as a &quot;large, spiky black 'D',&quot; while the Half-Blood Prince's notations are noted as &quot;small, cramped writing.&quot; Snape was the Half-Blood Prince, though the handwriting does not reflect this. Snape's writing may have changed over the years, or he adopted a different writing style to cram all his thoughts in the limited book margin space. A hint may have appeared in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] when, using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], Harry observes the young Snape as he is writing. Harry never notices any similarity, however, leaving us unable to make any connection via the writing style.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Classes continue with students still trying to learn wordless spells, not only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] has been ignoring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], Ron, and Hermione, apparently because they are not taking his Care of Magical Creatures class, so Harry resolves to visit him.

Harry holds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] trials to select a new team. In attempting to explain why so many have turned out for the tryouts, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] offhandedly remarks to Harry that he has &quot;never been more fanciable,&quot; and that, &quot;it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer.&quot; Apparently it is Harry who is popular, rather than Quidditch. Hermione ignores [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] comment that he is tall.

Harry and Ron's new Potions books arrive. Wanting to keep the Prince's notes, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Diffindo|removes]] and swaps the books' covers, then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Reparo|re-attaches them]]. The tattered-looking book can be returned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. 

Hermione reads in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]] conductor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] was arrested for discussing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters']] plans.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] has been absent since his and Harry's private lesson. As general fear spreads throughout the wizarding population, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Eloise Midgeon|Eloise Midgeon's]] parents remove her from Hogwarts, concerned about her safety. Also, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbott]]'s mother had been found dead.

The Trio head to the Quidditch pitch for try-outs, passing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]], who smiles at Ron. When he smiles back, Hermione becomes cold and distant. The trials are a bit of a fiasco. Lavender wishes Ron luck as he flies up for his trial. Hearing this, Hermione later praises Ron for playing brilliantly, pleasing Ron but frustrating Lavender. Harry chooses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and a new player named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Demelza Robins|Demelza Robins]] as Chasers, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jimmy Peakes|Jimmy Peakes]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ritchie Coote|Ritchie Coote]] as Beaters. Ron is the new Keeper, much to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen]]'s dismay. While walking to Hagrid's hut, Ron mentions that McLaggen looked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunded]] during the last goal shot; unnoticed by Ron, Hermione blushes.

The talk with Hagrid is awkward, but he and the Trio eventually make up after Hagrid confides that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] may be dying, and they tell him (untruthfully) that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] is an awful teacher. Hagrid thinks they might have fit in his class using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-Turners]], but Hermione says they were all destroyed in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry]].

Returning to the castle, they spot Cormac McLaggen attempting to negotiate the front steps and running into the doors. Pulling Hermione aside, Harry says Cormac looks Confunded. Hermione admits she Confunded him, defensively claiming he made horrible remarks about Ron and Ginny, and his temper would cause problems.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] invites Harry and Hermione to &quot;a little party, just a few rising stars,&quot; while ignoring Ron. Harry declines, citing his detention, but Slughorn says he will ask Snape to excuse him.

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Evening Prophet'']] reports that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] searched [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|the Malfoy residence]] for suspicious magical objects but found nothing. Hermione insists that Draco could not have smuggled an item into Hogwarts because everything was checked by Dark Detectors. Ron, meanwhile, stares at Lavender Brown, while Harry receives a message from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] saying he is expected for detention, no matter how many parties he has been invited to.

== Analysis ==

Hogwarts remains a relatively safe environment, and students have mostly been shielded from the increasingly violent events unfolding in the general wizarding population. However, as attacks increase, readers can see how fear and insecurity have seeped into the castle, creating concerns about safety, to the extent that some parents have removed their children from school. Adding to this, Dumbledore, a symbol of strength, protection, and stability to students and staff alike, is often gone now, and his absences are likely contributing to everyone's stress and concerns, as well as fostering rumors regarding Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Whatever Dumbledore is doing, he probably realizes that his frequent absences particularly affect Harry, and this may be why he re-emphasizes how important friendship and unity are. He encourages Harry to share whatever he learns with Ron and Hermione, knowing they will help protect and support Harry. 

Harry is also gaining a clearer picture about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and their deceptive tactics. When Stan Shunpike is arrested as a Death Eater, Harry knows he is most likely innocent. Unable to apprehend real Death Eaters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]] instead arrests easy-to-target victims like Shunpike as a means to appease the wizarding community's fears about Voldemort and to shine a more positive light on the Ministry.

Meanwhile, Hermione is acting out-of-character by Confunding Cormac McLaggen during the Quidditch trials to help Ron. As she has done before, Hermione will break rules if she feels it is justified. Readers may believe that Harry is also bending rules and using favoritism to select Ron over a stronger player like McLaggen. Harry believes that if Ron can overcome his insecurities, he has the potential to become a talented athlete like his siblings. He also realizes that Ron's personality is better suited to the team, unlike the egotistical McLaggen, who most likely would create turmoil by challenging Harry's authority. Without Hermione's unsolicited help, Harry might have had difficulty justifying choosing Ron over Cormac. 

Despite Hermione's helping Ron, their relationship remains strained. Their mutual jealousy may indicate each has deeper feelings for the other than either will acknowledge. Events during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] two years earlier showed that Hermione knows her feelings better than Ron, and understands Ron's feelings more than he does. Ron struggled with jealousy when Hermione dated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], and was angry and upset when he learned she was still writing to Viktor, though he never fully understood exactly what those emotions were. The circumstances seem reversed here when someone becomes interested in Ron. Hermione may be remaining silent because she is uncertain what his reaction might be.

Students are also studying more advanced magic, and casting wordless spells is apparently difficult to learn. Being able to cast spells without your opponent knowing what they are is an essential skill for an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]]. Harry struggles to master the technique, but if he is unable to learn this, his future career as an Auror could be affected.

Harry continues to avoid Slughorn's invitations, and we sense he seems pleased that Snape's detention gives him a plausible excuse to skip Slughorn's party. And while Ron probably has no real desire to attend Slughorn's get-togethers, his being slighted only adds to his feeling inferior to Harry and Hermione. Even Ginny has gained Slughorn's notice.

Harry feels the Ministry has swung too far in the opposite direction. From [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]]'s ineffectual denial there was ever a threat, Scrimgeour now attempts to appear as if the Ministry is taking action against the renascent Death Eaters. Twice Scrimgeour will brace Harry directly, seeking &quot;The Chosen One's&quot; support for current Ministry policies. Near Christmas, he offers Harry a position in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] branch of the Ministry in return for Harry being frequently seen entering the Ministry. When Harry asks if Stan Shunpike has been released yet, Scrimgeour avoids answering directly. When Scrimgeour repeats his offer in May, the conversation will be remarkably similar.

Aragog's ill health plays an important plot point later on. Slughorn was at Hogwarts when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] was a student, and he was present at an event that will prove to be important to Dumbledore's mission. As this event casts Slughorn in a bad light, he has given Dumbledore an altered memory. Aragog's death provides an opportunity for Harry to catch Slughorn off his guard sufficiently enough that he is persuaded to yield the true memory.

When Cormac substitutes for Ron in one Quidditch match, it results in Harry being sent to the Hospital Wing with a broken skull, and for one of Gryffindor's worst Quidditch defeats ever. While this is a minor event, it does show Harry's increasing ability to judge character. Harry is initially reluctant to place McLaggen on the team, but had few grounds to select Ron over Cormac except for his feelings about Cormac and his erratic performance at the trials, which he correctly suspects Hermione tampered with. The one time Cormac does play on the team, Harry's gut feelings about him are confirmed.

As mentioned in the article on Time-Turners, it is necessary that they be destroyed as they are simply too useful. A wizard without scruples, like Voldemort, could use a Time-Turner to replicate himself multiple times over, thus making a virtual army of himself. Harry would stand little chance when faced with twenty Voldemorts... and being effectively in charge of the Ministry from behind the scenes, as he will be in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the final book]], Voldemort would have unfettered access to any remaining Time-Turners. Their destruction thus becomes necessary for the plot.

Harry will spend considerable energy avoiding Slughorn's soirées, deliberately scheduling Quidditch practices at the same time, and he will be pleased that, at least once, Dumbledore's lessons take precedence over a Slug Club party. Despite oft-repeated invitations, Harry only attends Slughorn's Christmas party.

The object that Malfoy is trying to repair was never at Malfoy Manor because it is at the school. It is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]], one of a pair, which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] had damaged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|some years before]]. Draco has hidden it and is attempting to repair it as a portal for Death Eaters to invade the school.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Despite telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] how important the lessons are, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] is often absent, and there are no additional lessons before the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] weekend in mid-October. While reading the Half-Blood Prince's textbook one morning, Harry casts a non-verbal one, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Levicorpus|Levicorpus]], and unintentionally levitates a sleeping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. Harry frantically invokes the counter spell.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is unamused when told about Ron's experience. This Prince could be a dodgy character, and Harry is invoking his spells without knowing their effect. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|recognizes the spell]] from Snape's memory in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] as the same one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father]] used on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]. Harry briefly considers that his father was the Half-Blood Prince, but discounts this because James was a pure-blood wizard. Meanwhile, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] delivers a note to Harry from Dumbledore, scheduling another lesson for Monday evening. Ginny mentions she is going to Hogsmeade with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] and may see them there.

On Saturday, after being scanned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Secrecy Sensor|Secrecy Sensors]], the Trio embark to Hogsmeade. Finding Zonko's joke shop boarded up, they move on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Honeyduke's Sweetshop|Honeyduke's]] and run into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], who extends yet another dinner invitation to Harry and Hermione. Harry is grateful Dumbledore's lesson gives him an excuse to decline, though Ron feels slighted. 

On the way to The Three Broomsticks, Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] talking to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]] barman. Mundungus drops a suitcase, spilling its contents, including a silver goblet bearing the Black family crest. Harry, enraged, seizes Mundungus' throat, claiming he has looted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Sirius Black's house]]. Mundungus blasts Harry away and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] appears and says it is useless to hunt for him, but Harry intends to report Mundungus to Dumbledore.

Hermione suggests heading back to Hogwarts, to which Ron and Harry agree - this has been an unpleasant outing. They follow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] and her friend Leanne, who are arguing over a package. Leanne tries to take it from Katie, but it rips open. Katie, suddenly deathly still, rises into the air, then falls to the ground, writhing and screaming in pain. Harry runs for help and returns with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who carries Katie to the school. Harry prevents Ron from touching the package, recognizing a necklace inside as the same one he saw at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] that bore a label reading, 'Cursed.' Leanne says Katie returned from the toilet carrying a package that she insisted she must deliver to someone at Hogwarts. Leanne suspects Katie was under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]]. Harry immediately suspects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] is involved, though Ron discounts this. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] meets them at the gate, and Filch takes the necklace to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. Harry suspects Malfoy was involved, but McGonagall says Draco was doing detention with her. Dismissed, Harry, Ron, and Hermione wonder who the necklace was intended for. It seems unlikely that anything harmful could get past Filch and his Secrecy Sensor. They conclude it was a poorly thought-out plan.

== Analysis ==

The attack on Katie Bell bolsters Harry's suspicions that Draco is directly involved in some sinister plot, though there is only circumstantial evidence linking Draco to the necklace, and he has an iron-clad alibi. Regardless, Harry remains positive that Draco was behind the attack. While readers can sympathize with Harry, knowing that Draco has been tasked with some unknown mission for Voldemort and that it probably is linked to this incident, Harry lacks any objectivity whatsoever. He becomes so single-mindedly convinced that Draco is guilty that he stubbornly refuses to consider other possibilities. Also, the Trio's belief that the attack seemed poorly planned may be more significant than they realize.    

Adding to Harry's concerns is Dumbledore's increasingly frequent and unexplained absences. Not only is this disturbing to Harry, but probably the entire school. Dumbledore is Hogwarts' symbol of authority and security, and his empty chair in the Great Hall may signal that there is greater turmoil in the wizarding world than anyone realized. Harry, in particular, is affected by his absence. Harry still deeply mourns his godfather Sirius' death, and Dumbledore has become even more a father figure to him. When a parent is away, a child often feels abandoned and unprotected, even when left in capable hands.

Harry physically attacking Mundungus shows a rare side to his personality. While Harry is often quick to anger, he normally maintains control and never reacts physically. Still grieving his godfather's death, he is so outraged that Sirius' possessions (which now belong to Harry) have been violated that he is overcome by rage. Only an extreme circumstance could have provoked such an outburst. And only Tonks' intervention prevents Harry from inflicting serious harm on Mundungus and possibly facing severe legal consequences.

Harry's hope that the clever Half-Blood Prince could actually be his father may indicate he is looking for even more redeeming qualities in James, though he is quickly forced to discount his own theory. Harry may still have conflicted feelings over his father. Although he loves the man he never knew and knows he was a good and brave person, he was deeply disappointed when he accidentally learned (in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]) that the youthful James was once a rather obnoxious bully. James, along with Sirius Black, often tormented and humiliated Severus Snape purely for their own amusement while they were students at Hogwarts, though James outgrew his childish behavior.

Despite Hermione's warning, Harry will continue using the Prince's spells without any regard to their function. Although the one he used on Ron resulted in a humorous, and generally harmless, episode, a curse Harry later casts on Draco Malfoy in anger will have a more devastating effect. Snape, recognizing the curse, intervenes in time to save Draco's life.

Katie Bell was put under the Imperius curse, not by Draco, but by one of his agents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], who in turn had been placed under that curse by Draco. This is the first of three failed attempts Draco makes on Dumbledore's life. However, the plan may not be as ill-conceived as the Trio believes. In particular, we discover later that Secrecy Sensors detect secrets; however, bottling a love potion in a perfume bottle is sufficient to allow it to pass both visual scrutiny and the Sensors. As Katie Bell unknowingly was carrying something lethal, had no malign intent, she was therefore not intentionally concealing any secrets, likely enabling her to pass through the Secrecy Sensors undetected. A poisoned mead bottle also makes its way into the school without detection, and the Trio believes it may have entered unscanned, with one of the teachers.

When Harry encounters Mundungus Fletcher in Hogsmeade, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]], the Hog's Head Inn barman, has apparently just refused to buy something and walked away. It is clear that, having ransacked Sirius/Harry's house, Mundungus is attempting to sell his spoils when Harry confronts him. It is learned later that Mundungus sold the mate to Harry's broken two-way mirror to Aberforth, who was told the mirror's function by his brother, Albus. Late in the final book, Aberforth admits he periodically used the mirror to check on Harry. Harry will occasionally catch Aberforth's eye in the mirror, mistaking it for Albus Dumbledore's, which is apparently similar in shape and color.

Another item that Mundungus loots from Grimmauld Place will play an important role in the final book. When Grimmauld Place was being cleaned, &quot;a locket which none of them could open&quot; was found. This locket will prove quite valuable to Harry, but he will have to trace it through a long chain of thieves before reclaiming it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] had retrieved it from the trash, and by now Mundungus has stolen it from Kreacher. At some point, it is extorted from Mundungus, and it is from this final thief, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], that Harry will have to collect it.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] is moved to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]] in London. With the exception of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and Leanne, students are unaware that someone other than Katie was the intended target. Ron and Hermione ignore Harry's comment that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] knows.

Though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] has remained unseen all day, Harry reports to his office for his second lesson. Dumbledore is there and reassures Harry that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], who has more experience with the Dark Arts than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], has done all he can to help Katie. Dumbledore also says that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] has apparently gone into hiding, but nothing else will be taken from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. Dumbledore tells Harry that Draco's involvement will be investigated, but their lesson is more important now. 

In Dumbledore's previous lesson, they had determined [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Riddle]], abandoned by her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] husband, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]], was pregnant and alone in London. Lacking the will to perform magic to care for herself, she needed money. She sold a gold locket once belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Caractacus Burke|Caractacus Burke]], one of the founders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]]. Harry was outraged that Burke only gave Merope ten [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]] for the priceless relic.

In this memory, a younger Dumbledore with auburn hair and beard visits the eleven-year-old [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] in a Muggle orphanage. The matron comments Tom is a strange boy and leaves the impression she is hoping someone will take him well away, Dumbledore then speaks with Tom. Initially, Tom believes Professor Dumbledore is a doctor who has come to take him to a sanatorium. However, Dumbledore explains that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] is a school of magic. Even as a boy, Tom manipulated and terrified other children, strangled a pet rabbit, hurt people, and spoke in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. When Tom demands proof that Dumbledore is a wizard, Dumbledore conjures flames on Tom's wardrobe, and as suddenly extinguishes them. Dumbledore orders Tom to retrieve a small cache of stolen items and demands he return them to their owners. The young Dumbledore worries about the boy's ambition, his cruelty, his thieving, and his reaction to learning he is a wizard; he resolves to keep a close eye on him.

Back in the office, Dumbledore says he was unaware Tom would become the most feared Dark Wizard in centuries, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. He draws Harry's attention to several traits about the young Tom Riddle: he disliked his common name, Tom, and wanted to be separate from everyone else. He was already very self-sufficient, secretive, apparently friendless, and he liked collecting trophies.

As he is leaving, Harry notices the ring is gone and comments that he expected to see one of Voldemort's trophies, perhaps the mouth organ? Dumbledore comments that the mouth organ was always only a mouth organ.

== Analysis ==

By sharing his and others' memories, Dumbledore shows Harry how Voldemort crafted himself from an abandoned, insecure boy into a notorious Dark wizard. While readers may be sympathetic to Riddle's difficult early life, it can be seen that he was a naturally unpleasant person from an early age. Even the orphanage caretakers came to fear him. And despite growing up without knowing his family, young Tom Riddle inherited many unpleasant Gaunt family characteristics. He was egotistical, secretive, aloof, and lacked empathy for others. He was also highly intelligent, far beyond an ordinary eleven-year-old. As a child, Riddle isolated himself from the other orphans, who he considered inferior and frequently stole objects from, saving them as trophies. He also physically and/or emotionally threatened or harmed them, and later learned to manipulate people to obtain what he wanted. When Dumbledore reprimanded Tom for being disrespectful, Riddle's sudden good behavior seemed insincere and designed to appease the strange professor only to ensure his attending Hogwarts. Young Riddle feared being ordinary in any way and needed to feel superior to everyone. However, being introduced to the Wizarding world may have had the opposite effect. Though Riddle learned he possessed special powers the other orphans lacked, upon arriving at Hogwarts, he was no longer unique, but just one among many talented wizard children. Even here, he was driven to rise above his peers and worked hard to learn as much as possible, eventually leading him into mastering Dark magic. 

Riddle also shares many similarities to Harry. Both were orphans raised in a loveless environment, they are half-blood wizards, each learned they had magical powers only when they were old enough to attend Hogwarts, and both could perform magic at an early age without any training or using a wand. However, even if both boys had been raised by their respective parents, their outcomes would probably still have been very different from one another. Riddle believes himself to be a wizard immediately, whereas Harry is initially doubtful.  And unlike Harry, Riddle hated Muggles, even though his father was one, a fact Riddle loathed about himself and may have been deeply rooted in his Muggle father abandoning his mother. Harry would probably be much the same good-hearted person he is now, only more confident and self-assured, while Tom Riddle's Gaunt heritage likely would still have despised his Muggle origins, even if his father had raised him. Riddle felt forever tainted by this &quot;blood impurity&quot;, and it had an adverse effect on his psyche. Learning that he was a wizard inflated his sense of superiority, while  his connection to Salazar Slytherin later fueled this egotism, gradually manifesting itself into his new persona as Lord Voldemort and diminishing, in his mind, his sullied Muggle bloodline.

Dumbledore says he kept a close watch on Riddle at Hogwarts. Although Dumbledore never mentions it, during his interviews with the orphanage Matron, we see that he may suspect Riddle could be tempted to learn and perform the three Unforgivable curses. Riddle's speaking to Dumbledore in a commanding voice suggests the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]], while his boast that he can cause pain in others is similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]. His capacity to kill another child's rabbit to establish dominance and control through fear is a precursor to using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]]. Riddle also showed the potential for quickly learning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]] when he stared into Dumbledore's eyes to determine if he is lying. While it is unlikely young Tom had ever performed these difficult spells, particularly without a wand, his emerging abilities strongly suggest he had the potential to become a powerful Dark wizard.

Careful attention should be paid to Dumbledore's words when he responds to Harry's concerns about Draco Malfoy. Here, and in later chapters, when Harry reports on Draco's actions, Dumbledore never actually dismisses them, but instead tells Harry, &quot;they are not your concern.&quot; Examining the text reveals that he is not belittling Harry's allegations; rather, he is saying that he is aware, but believes Harry has more important things to do than worry about Draco, nor is it Harry's place to know more than he does. In fact, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]], we learn that Dumbledore knows what Draco's mission is, though not exactly how he plans to execute it, and is having Severus Snape watch Draco. Snape's surveillance will be less complete than Harry's, and when Draco finishes his plan's main step, it is discovered and reported by Harry rather than Snape.

Dumbledore's comment, that the mouth organ (harmonica) was only ever a mouth organ, is enigmatic to Harry, and to the reader. In the final novel, the ring is revealed to have been a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] before Dumbledore broke it, and it is to this that Dumbledore was probably alluding. That the ring's stone is also one of the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] probably is not what Dumbledore is thinking about. While that part of the ring's nature is probably predominant in Dumbledore's mind, given the previous summer's events, Dumbledore already believes that Voldemort fails to grasp the Hallows' nature. As such, the ring's stone being a Hallow is irrelevant to his and Harry's discussion here, as it centers on Voldemort.

The ring's absence is curious, and the reader may wonder why it is gone. In fact, we do not see it again in this book. When it reappears, near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|the final book]], it is inside the Snitch that Dumbledore has bequeathed to Harry. It is a safe assumption that Dumbledore has already secreted the ring within the Snitch, in preparation for his demise, which he now knows will be no later than July, no more than nine or ten months in the future.</text>

{{spoiler}}

On the way to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] class the next day, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] fills in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] on what he has learned about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], though Ron wonders why [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] is teaching Harry all this.

Hermione says the 'Slug Club' dinners are actually quite enjoyable, and encourages Harry to attend the Christmas one, and says invitees can bring a guest. Ron mockingly suggests she invite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|McLaggen]]. Hermione hotly replies that she was going to invite Ron, but as he is acting so stupidly, she will not bother. Ron sheepishly says that he would go with her, however it is uncertain whether or not she will relent. Harry worries that if Ron and Hermione ever do become a couple, a break-up could create an unbridgeable gap between them, or that the two would become so close they would shut Harry out. 

Harry recruits [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] to replace [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team while she is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. At practice, Ron, overcome with nerves, plays horribly, and even punches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Demelza Robins|Demelza]] in the mouth.

Heading back to the Gryffindor Common room, Harry and Ron stumble across [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and Dean kissing in a corridor; Harry feels jealous while Ron reacts angrily. Ginny is equally angry at Ron, shouting that Harry kissed Cho Chang and Hermione kissed Viktor Krum, but Ron has as much experience as a twelve-year-old; she then storms off. Heading to the Common room, Harry and Ron startle a girl who drops a jar. 

Ron, Ginny's words still stinging, broods dark thoughts, apparently about Hermione having kissed Viktor. Harry struggles with his own romantic feelings towards Ginny, though he dismisses it as only friendship. He also fears that if he did start dating Ginny, it could end his and Ron's friendship.

The next day, Ron, still angry, lashes out at everyone, especially Hermione, and cold-shoulders Dean and Ginny. Ron's mood hardly improves over the next several days and plays miserably at practice. He nearly resigns, but Harry snaps him out of it. However, Ron remains dejected before the match against Slytherin. Harry devises a brilliant plan. At breakfast, Hermione glimpses the small flask containing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]] potion concealed in Harry's hand and, suspecting Harry spiked Ron's pumpkin juice, berates him. Ron drinks the juice anyway. Apparently, the luck potion works, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] and another player are not playing that day, though Harry suspects Draco is planning something. When Ron asks if Harry did put the Felix potion in his drink, Harry says nothing.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]], a Hufflepuff who is announcing, continually criticizes Gryffindor, but he is forced to stop when they play brilliantly, eventually gaining a 100 point lead. The Slytherin Seeker spots the Snitch, but Harry distracts him and catches it for the win. In the changing room, Hermione bursts in and lambastes Harry for cheating, but Harry reveals he never used the potion, Ron only believed he did.

At the victory party, Ron is kissing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] in plain view. Hermione ducks in and out of the common room, and Harry follows her to an unlocked classroom. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avis|Conjured birds]] are flying around her head; he tries consoling her, but Ron barges in with Lavender, who quickly exits. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Oppugno|sends the conjured canaries]] to attack Ron.

== Analysis ==

Although Hermione used magic to help secure Ron a place on the Quidditch team, she has apparently fallen back into her usual &quot;follow the rules&quot; way and rebukes Harry for cheating (or so she thinks) by giving Ron the Good Luck potion to enhance his game skills. Ron played brilliantly because he believed the potion would improve his performance, but Harry never actually gave it to him. When Ron believes in himself, he has the ability to perform well in many things.

Harry's skill at utilizing people's flaws and habits is improving; he knows Hermione will intervene if there is any unethical behavior, and that Ron, like a petulant child, tends to resist her. This is why, we believe, he allows Hermione to see the phial of Felix Felicis as he passes it over Ron's pumpkin juice; Harry knows that if Hermione assumes Ron's drink was spiked with the potion, she will object. It is uncertain whether Harry is counting on that to motivate Ron into drinking it; it is certain that Hermione's protest will lead Ron to believe that he has been given a chance at some liquid luck. This is somewhat similar to how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] manipulates people and their thought patterns to his advantage. Unlike Voldemort, however, Harry's aim is to help his friends rather than for his own selfish ends.

Ron once again reacts in a bad way to his unresolved feelings for Hermione. Ginny's taunts regarding his romantic inexperience deeply embarrass him, but it is probably her revelation about Hermione kissing Viktor Krum that truly upsets him, causing him to lash out at Hermione; by failing to recognize his emotions for what they are, he allows himself to be propelled into a questionable relationship with Lavender, a silly, giggly girl who Ron probably never would have noticed had she not overtly flirted with him, thus flattering his ego. Hermione, in turn, becomes even more furious with Ron for succumbing to Lavender's attentions, though she is actually more hurt and upset than angry. And while this is the most openly emotional that she has expressed her feelings about Ron, only Harry, and we, can perceive what he does not. 

While Harry wants his two best friends to be happy, he also has concerns. If Ron and Hermione should ever overcome their differences and become a couple, it could mean he would be left behind or be forced to choose sides if they break up. Harry is beginning to realize just how much he relies on each for their friendship and support, a fact Dumbledore has subtly been impressing upon him for some time. Harry also wrestles with budding romantic feelings for Ginny Weasley, though he brushes this off as &quot;brotherly&quot; concern.

Also, Harry is working on two fronts simultaneously. The first, mentioned above, is to instill confidence in Ron by showing that he is able to perform well (here, keeping goal at Quidditch) when he believes in himself. In this endeavor, Harry will be successful. Harry's other battle is to reconcile Ron and Hermione. This has failed so far, possibly due to Ron's emotional immaturity relative to the other two, leaving Harry again having two good friends who are not on speaking terms.

Readers should note the small girl in the seventh-floor hallway who drops the jar.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We see here what could be considered the formal beginning of the romantic relationship between Ron and Lavender. She had quite clearly set her sights on Ron early in the year, but rather than making any overt move, had simply responded more strongly than necessary to any of his sallies, whether directed at her or not. Ron has been consciously unaware, but now, partially elated by the Quidditch victory over Slytherin, and partly in response to Ginny's accusation that he is romantically inexperienced, he is drawn to Lavender as the quickest way to disprove Ginny's claims. This romance, if it can be called that, will put serious tension on the bond between Ron and Hermione, tension that will gradually ease in the Spring as Ron realizes that he and Lavender actually have little in common, and starts looking to Hermione once more for friendship and advice.

Although she is passed by almost unnoticed, the small girl in the seventh-floor hallway who drops the jar of frog-spawn will be important. The alert reader will note that a small girl is often standing in that hallway, and who invariably drops something noisy as Harry passes. Readers may also note that this occurs near the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. This girl is either [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], disguised with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] and standing guard outside the Room of Requirement while Malfoy works within on his secret task for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Harry never realizes this until he has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] tail Malfoy later in the spring.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] for Christmas, talk about what Harry had overheard. Ron agrees it is odd that Malfoy was assigned a task, and is incredulous that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] made an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] to help him. Anyone breaking an Unbreakable Vow will die. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] arrive and tease Ron; apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] told them about Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]]. 

A large crowd is expected at The Burrow over Christmas, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], still estranged from his family, will be absent. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] admits privately to Harry that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] has been arresting and imprisoning innocent people, and says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] is still being detained to avoid bad publicity. Harry tells him and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] about the conversation he overheard between Snape and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]]. Both say [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] trusts Snape, and that is good enough for them. Lupin neither likes nor dislikes Snape, saying Snape always perfectly prepared his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane Potion]]; and while he revealed that Lupin was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]], he could have caused worse damage. Although the bitterness between them (and also Harry) cannot be healed, they should still trust Snape.

Lupin, meanwhile, has infiltrated the vicious [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback's]] Werewolf pack as a spy for the Order. Lupin says Werewolves support [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] because they would be free under his rule. It was Greyback who infected Lupin when he was a child. Greyback targets children to raise them to hate Wizarding kind. He wants to infect enough people for the Werewolves to take over.

Harry asks about the Half-Blood Prince and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Levicorpus|Levicorpus]] spell. Lupin explains that spells come in and out of favour, and the &quot;Prince&quot; may not have invented it. He also has no idea about the Prince's identity except that it was not James or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]]. As Lupin suggested, Harry later checks the book's publication date to help learn the Prince's identity. It was printed fifty years before, which seems to rule out Harry's parents and their contemporaries.

Among Harry and Ron's Christmas presents are the usual jumpers (sweaters), a disgusting necklace for Ron from Lavender, and a package of maggots from House-elf [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] to &quot;Master&quot; (Harry). Over Christmas dinner, the family (along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] and Lupin) discuss [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], who declined to attend. Harry asks why Tonks' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] would change shape. Lupin suggests that a major upheaval in someone's life can cause a change

Percy and the Minister of Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour's]] unexpectedly arrive. Scrimgeour claims he and Percy had business in the neighbourhood when Percy &quot;decided&quot; to drop in for a visit. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] is ecstatic to see Percy again, but the other Weasleys react coldly. On the pretext of giving the Weasleys private family time, Scrimgeour asks Harry to show him the garden. Outside, Scrimgeour asks about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] and also wants Harry to be seen frequently at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. They want to present him as the &quot;Chosen One&quot;, and show that he supports the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|the Ministry's policies]]. Harry refuses, citing the Ministry's failure to act sooner, and for imprisoning Stan Shunpike, an innocent person. Harry ignores Scrimgeour's probes about Dumbledore. Scrimgeour angrily claims Harry is &quot;Dumbledore's man through and through,&quot; to which Harry readily agrees, though not in the way Scrimgeour meant, and abruptly returns to the house.

== Analysis ==

Scrimgeour's attempt to woo Harry as a Ministry &quot;poster boy&quot;, along with the Ministry's continual refusal to release known innocents like Stan Shunpike, again shows how he is more concerned with presenting a good public face to the Wizarding community rather than obtaining actual results. It also appears he wants to separate Harry from Dumbledore's influence. Harry sees through both ruses and refuses to cooperate, turning around Scrimgeour's insult by stating that he is indeed, &quot;Dumbledore's man.&quot; Unfortunately, this incident only serves to further estrange the Weasleys from Percy, who obviously colluded with Scrimgeour to exploit his family solely to give Scrimgeour access to Harry. It seems there is no limit to what Percy will do to advance his own career, and this may be the breaking point in his relationship with his parents and siblings.

As events grow more sinister in the Wizarding world, Lupin's perilous mission for the Order of the Phoenix highlights his sad and lonely life as a Werewolf. He is risking himself by infiltrating Fenrir Greyback's dangerous realm. Lupin does provide insight into how Werewolves and other darker creatures like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Vampire|Vampires]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblins]], and so forth, have been ostracized by the Wizarding community, giving some justification to them supporting Voldemort who offers more advantages. Only the Goblins rebuff Voldemort; as his power increases, he increasingly interferes with their internal affairs, thus losing their allegiance. Lupin also provides a possible reason why Tonks' Patronus has changed its appearance, though he may know more about this than he is revealing.

Readers will recognize Fenrir Greyback's name as the same one Draco Malfoy mentioned at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 6|earlier in the book]]. It is now clear why Mr. Borgin suddenly was so cooperative after Draco mentioned Greyback was a &quot;family friend&quot;. Considering Greyback's reputation, Borgin likely feared for his life if he failed Draco's request.

Lavender's gift for Ron, and Ron's reaction to it, are a clear indication that their relationship is probably doomed. Though their union is physically intense, it seems Lavender has no idea what Ron would actually like. Additionally, it seems improbable that Ron has put any thought into what Lavender might want, as we can safely expect that he would have to ask someone, most likely Harry, and then Ginny, before making his selection. Lavender's gift to Ron seems to be something Lavender herself would like, which would indicate that she is more centered on herself in this relationship than on Ron. While Ron's feelings are still unknown, he entered this relationship largely to spite Ginny, and possibly Hermione, and we can guess that his motives also remain selfish. In that respect, Ron and Lavender seem well matched.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The printing date on Harry's book is fifty years before, putting it into a period near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s time at Hogwarts. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], we are led to believe that Tom was a sixth- or seventh-year student fifty years before Harry was a second-year, so Tom, or a contemporary, could have purchased it new. However, all this really shows is that the Half-Blood Prince attended Hogwarts sometime after that date. We have seen that there is a brisk business in second-hand books, as they appear to change little from year-to-year, so it is entirely possible that one of James Potter's contemporaries owned this book. In fact, it will turn out to be one of James' classmates, one who was impoverished and thus forced to purchase his books second hand.

Curiously, even though text books are infrequently updated, readers are constantly reminded that new spells, jinxes, and hexes are always being invented. These apparently rarely become standard magical practices, and, as Lupin points out, these new ones fall in and out of fashion.

This is not the first time that Scrimgeour attempts to manipulate Harry to help bolster the Ministry's public image; Dumbledore and Scrimgeour, back in September, had also quarreled over this, and it was publicly commented on; Dumbledore will later mention that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]] had also wanted to exploit Harry this way to help retain his position as Minister for Magic. Scrimgeour hoped to sway Harry by talking to him directly, and he used Percy's family to get to Harry and try to remove him from Hogwarts and Dumbledore. Scrimgeour will make one last attempt later in the book, only to again be refused. This, along with Shunpike's continued incarceration, is a clear indication that Scrimgeour, who is as astute a politician in his own way as Fudge, is as driven by public opinion as Fudge, regardless of their perceived differences. Despite the deep schism between Harry and Scrimgeour, in the last book, when the Ministry falls to Voldemort, Scrimgeour is tortured for information but never reveals Harry's whereabouts, thus allowing Harry, Ron, and Hermione to escape.

Snape's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|unbreakable Vow]] has left us wondering, as Ron is, exactly why he would agree to fulfill Draco's task at peril to his own life. The only reason is that Dumbledore had extracted Snape's promise to perform Draco's task. It is only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|late in the final book]] that we discover this, and that Snape and Dumbledore were acting together to protect Draco.

Lupin explains to Harry that a major upheaval in Tonks' life could be why her Patronus changed its shape. Unknown to Harry, and readers, just yet, is that Lupin has caused that upheaval.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] return to Hogwarts via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]] after Christmas. Evidently, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|the Fat Lady]] enjoyed too much wine over holiday, and the new Gryffindor Tower password is Abstinence. In the Common room, Ron is immediately enfolded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]], while Ginny has promised to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]], though Harry senses she is rather unenthusiastic. Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who is ignoring Ron, find a quiet corner, and he shares what happened during Christmas break, including the conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Hermione naturally concurs with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] was attempting to discover what [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]]'s mission is. She reminds Harry that it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback's]] name that Malfoy threatened Borgin with.

The next morning, a notice on the bulletin board announces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] training for students turning 17 before 31st August, which includes everyone in the Sixth Year class. Students are excited about learning how, even after Harry admits he traveled by side-along Apparition, saying the sensation is unpleasant.

That night, Harry arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] office for another lesson. Harry relates what happened over Christmas, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]'s visit. Dumbledore displays a rare emotional flicker when Harry tells him about being, &quot;Dumbledore's man through and through&quot;. Harry also recounts Snape and Draco's conversation; Dumbledore thanks him for the information, but says Harry need not be concerned and reaffirms his trust in Snape.

Before they enter the memories, Dumbledore recaps: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Riddle]] was admitted to Hogwarts and sorted into Slytherin house, where he learned about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's]] ability to converse with snakes. The staff expected little from Riddle. He was a polite, good-looking, ambitious orphan, so many took pity on him. Dumbledore never shared his opinions about Tom to the staff, allowing him to start anew without any bias. Dumbledore describes how ''Death Eater'' forerunners gravitated around Riddle but admits difficulty in obtaining memories of him during his time at Hogwarts. Riddle also became obsessed with his parentage.

The first new memory belongs to Riddle's Uncle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]]. In it, Riddle arrives at the Gaunts' and converses with Morfin in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. Morfin tells Tom about his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle, Sr.]], and his mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope]], and shows him the Peverell ring, saying that Merope had taken Slytherin's locket. The memory abruptly ends. Morfin remembered nothing until after he awoke the next day and the ring was gone. Dumbledore says when Riddle Sr. and his parents were found murdered, the Ministry fingered Morfin, who readily confessed. Dumbledore speculates that Riddle [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] his uncle, performed the murders, and then implanted false memories into Morfin's mind.

The second memory is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s. He and the ''Slug Club'' during Riddle's era are chatting. Twice the memory inexplicably turns foggy and only Slughorn's voice is heard, notably when Riddle asks him about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Slughorn seems to respond that he knows nothing about them. Dumbledore explains that the memory was tampered with and tasks Harry with obtaining Slughorn's true memory.

== Analysis ==

Dumbledore had hoped Tom Riddle would turn over a new leaf, but his underlying suspicions were well founded. It appears Tom began building the foundation for his evil plan while still at Hogwarts, recruiting followers who were to become the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Riddle also sought retaliation against his father for abandoning him and his mother, even though Riddle Sr. had actually been magically seduced by Merope. That does not completely absolve Riddle, Sr., however, who rejected his child that bore no fault for his mother's duplicity, leaving him stranded in an orphanage. However, this all matters little to Tom, who is so consumed by hate and revenge that he extends his retaliation beyond his doomed father to his innocent paternal grandparents, murdering them to obliterate any ties to his despised Muggle bloodline. Although Riddle succeeded in eliminating his Muggle family, this violent act could never purge what he truly is&amp;mdash;a half-blood. He will be continually plagued with and motivated with self-loathing over his perceived tainted lineage. Nor did Riddle feel any loyalty to his pure-blooded Gaunt side, falsely incriminating his Uncle Morfin for the Riddles' murders. By eliminating both his paternal and maternal relations, Riddle took the first step in his &quot;rebirth&quot; as Lord Voldemort, shedding blood ties and have loyalty to no one.

We note, in Slughorn's memory, that Slughorn mentions someone named Lestrange. While it is possible that the person referred to here is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], those characters are apparently quite young when we see them [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 30|at their trial]]. In support of their apparent age, we understand that one of them has married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], sister to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], who is only slightly older than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]]. Recalling this memory is now some fifty years old, we tentatively identify this Lestrange as possibly being the father, or uncle, of Rabastan and Rodolphus.

Although the new Gryffindor password, &quot;abstinence,&quot; supposedly refers to the Fat Lady having imbibed too much wine, it could also reflect the older students' burgeoning sexual maturity. With all the confused emotions and chaotic relationships that many characters are experiencing, this may be the author's way of humorously warning them to &quot;slow down.&quot; This could certainly apply to Lavender, though Ron seems rather reluctant to return to her arms. Hermione may also have noticed this, which is why she is willing to talk with Harry in the common room, rather than finding an empty classroom as she had done previously. Hermione, being far more observant about human nature than either Harry or Ron, may have noticed that Ron and Lavender's relationship could be unraveling. Harry similarly notes Ginny's apparent reticence to return to Dean's side, though readers may suspect this is merely wishful thinking on Harry's part.

Note is made here that the Floo network had been extended to Hogwarts specifically to allow the students to return after Christmas. This seems something of a contradiction, as Dumbledore had returned to his own office by means of the Floo network [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|in the previous book]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s head had appeared on a number of occasions in the Gryffindor common room fireplace, Snape had summoned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] using a very similar technique [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 14|in an earlier book]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] had mentioned that all the fireplaces were monitored. There is no explanation for this apparent contradiction, but we can speculate. It is possible that, in order to prevent students from slipping away without permission, the vast majority of the fireplaces at Hogwarts were connected to the Floo network by a very small portal, enough to admit a head and no more. Why even this connection would be made is uncertain, unless it is intended to serve as an emergency exit from the common room; a head-sized attachment may be sufficient to keep the grate attached to the Network, but not present a threat of unwanted incursions or excursions, and the charm could be set to expand the connection to full size in an emergency. It is possible that the limitations are removed from the House Heads' and the Headmaster's fireplaces, or of all teachers at the School, on the grounds that they are responsible enough to use them. In this case, the restriction against using the Floo network is not actually one of the school not being connected, but of the House Heads restricting the parade of people through their fireplaces.

Harry points out that Tom Riddle was underage when he stunned Morfin, but the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] failed to detect it. Dumbledore explains that when an underaged wizard is in a Wizarding residence, the Ministry is unable to tell who performs magic, and must rely on adult wizards to monitor any underage magical activity. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Ron calls this monitoring a Trace and says it automatically breaks on a wizard's 17th birthday. The Trace apparently detects underage magic and the location, which is why [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]'s Hover charm at the Dursley house was detected just before Harry's second year. This generally would have been ignored if it occurred in a Wizarding residence, but as Harry is the only magical person living at Privet Drive, it was automatically assumed he was the one who cast it. One does rather wonder why the Trace failed to detect Tom Riddle Sr.'s murder and the creation of the resultant [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. We can only speculate, of course, but one possibility is that the Trace does not report magic occurring in the immediate vicinity of an adult wizard; this would also explain the Ministry's failure to detect Harry's use of magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|later in this book]]. If Tom were aware of that, as he likely would be, he could have brought the stunned Morfin with him to the Riddle house; and Morfin's presence would have prevented the Trace from triggering.

Before Dumbledore collected Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']], he already knew about Draco Malfoy's mission, and quite possibly Snape's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] almost as soon as Snape made it. This is why he seems unconcerned by Harry's revelation: because to him, it is not a revelation at all, but simply a report on a situation of which he is well aware. The specific wording Dumbledore uses here is important; he does not say that he disbelieves Harry, rather that this is not Harry's concern. Harry, however, fails to hear the actual words, seeing only the dismissal, and believes Dumbledore is discounting this threat, whatever it is.

Of course, Harry's observations that Ginny seems reluctant to return to Dean, and also Ron's hesitation to resume his relationship with Lavender are foreshadowing. Both relationships will break up at the same time, in about four months.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

As Hogwarts prepares for Christmas, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] does his best to avoid giggling girls and mistletoe clumps. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] now spends every evening kissing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] who &quot;seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted.&quot; Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] continue to ignore each other, while Harry and Hermione frequently study in the library together. Harry once again has found himself best friends with two people who are not speaking to each other.

Meanwhile, Harry continues doing well in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] using the Prince's notes. Hermione warns him that the girls who are infatuated with him might try to slip him a Love Potion. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]] is particularly determined to go to Slughorn's party with Harry, and gives him a box of chocolates, that Harry puts away unopened. Hermione suggests that Harry invite someone to discourage the other girls. Harry mentions [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] and the necklace again, but Hermione insists the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Secrecy Sensor|Secrecy Sensors]] would detect any powerful curse. Hermione is still angered that Harry refuses to stop using the Prince's book. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], Ron accidentally gives himself a handlebar moustache, causing Hermione to laugh. In retaliation, Ron rudely imitates Hermione, sending her running off crying. Harry cannot wait to leave for the Burrow, hoping the distance will help heal Ron and Hermione's relationship. Harry finds Hermione in a nearby bathroom, being comforted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. Hermione collects her things from Harry and leaves.

Luna says that Ron sometimes says funny things, but hurtful ones as well. Harry thinks Luna has a knack for telling unpleasant truths. Luna says she misses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]], as she felt she had friends there and mentions how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] sticks up for her and stopped two boys from calling her &quot;Loony.&quot; Harry suddenly decides to invite Luna to Slughorn's party&amp;mdash;just as friends. Luna is surprised and quite happy, as nobody has ever invited her to a party before. 

Soon, everyone knows Harry has invited Luna. Ron rebukes Harry, telling him he could have asked anyone other than &quot;Loony Lovegood&quot;, though Ginny commends Harry. Lavender appears and starts kissing Ron. In response, Hermione loudly tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati]] that she is going to Slughorn's party with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac]] which causes Ron to resurface from his kiss in shock. Harry ponders the depths to which girls will sink for revenge.

Luna wears silver-spangled robes to the party, eliciting giggles from other girls. Harry, relieved she has foregone her usual Butterbeer-cork necklace and radish earrings, thinks she actually looks quite nice. At the party, Hermione, having escaped Cormac's attempts to get her under the mistletoe, steers Harry and Luna to the refreshments table, where she can watch for Cormac's approach. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] is also present. When Slughorn comments that Harry is a natural at Potions, just like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]], Snape responds sarcastically. 

Harry is having a great time until Filch drags in Draco, who Filch caught in the hallway, apparently gatecrashing. Slughorn laughingly reprimands him, but allows him to stay, at which Draco looks surprisingly disappointed. When Snape asks Draco for a private word, Harry, hidden under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], follows and eavesdrops on their conversation. Snape probes Malfoy for information about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], but Draco mentally blocks him. Snape remarks that Draco's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Aunt Bella]] must have taught him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]]. Snape says he knows Draco is working on some project upstairs and offers to help, citing his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]]. Draco says nothing and storms out.

== Analysis ==

When Harry overhears Snape questioning Draco regarding his secret activities, Snape appears clueless about what Draco's mission is, and Draco refuses to divulge anything, even though Snape has sworn an Unbreakable Vow to assist him. However, Draco's refusal to confide in Snape, indicating distrust, does little to convince Harry that Snape is not a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], despite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s repeated assurance that he is loyal. Harry's stubbornness and emotions often overrule his judgment and logic, and his hatred for Snape prevents his considering other possibilities regarding him. It also appears that Harry's suspicions regarding Draco may be correct.

Harry seems oblivious that the opposite sex find him so appealing. His interest in girls has mostly been confined to one person, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], and he has seldom considered pursuing other relationships up until now, when he experiences budding feelings for Ginny. That he generally ignores girls who are interested in him may show that he lacks confidence, or that he is so preoccupied by more serious matters that it never occurs to him to seek female companionship other than Hermione or Ginny, his platonic friends. To discourage girls' attention, Harry invites Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party, partly because he considers her &quot;safe,&quot; but he also feels bad that other students mistreated her. Nor has he forgotten her participation in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the battle at the Ministry of Magic]], in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], earning her a secure place within his circle. Although Harry knows other students, including Ron, will mock him for inviting &quot;Loony&quot; Luna, he has matured enough that he considers his peers' disapproval is outweighed by one individual's needs. While Hermione and Ginny express their approval, Ron's deplorable behavior not only shows his immaturity, but also his insecurity about himself; he shuns the unpopular students, fearing that associating with them will reflect badly on him. 

Luna's observation that Ron often says funny things, but also hurtful ones, is accurate and insightful; but considering how Luna risked her own life to help Harry and Ron during the battle at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], Ron's rudeness towards her is inexcusable and disgraceful. Ron has previously demonstrated poor behavior not only with Luna, but also Hermione. His difficulty with girls in general and unresolved feelings for Hermione in particular results in him lashing out at her for any perceived misstep. After Ginny mentioned that Hermione kissed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] the previous year, Ron retaliated by dating Lavender Brown, a rather silly, annoying girl he never particularly liked. Ron's motive largely appears to be to hurt Hermione and make her jealous. In that end, he has apparently succeeded. Ron may also be trying to prove he is more romantically adept than Ginny claimed; in this, he has made some progress, having finally gotten kissed by someone other than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]], but likely remains woefully immature emotionally, and just as clueless about girls. And while Ron's intention may have been to hurt Hermione, the silly Lavender's cloying possessiveness may be having an adverse effect on Ron.

Luna's comments about Ron are interesting because she also tends to say what she is thinking. Whether Luna cultivates her abstract air to soften her comments is unknown. She is correct that Ron tends to disregard others' feelings when he speaks, making what he says painful at times. Curiously, though Luna is often equally direct, her words are not hurtful to others.

Hermione's revelation about Secrecy Sensors having weaknesses indicates it is possible that harmful materials can enter Hogwarts in some circumstances. Whether the cursed necklace that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] was carrying would have set them off is unknown, as Katie, apparently under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] at that time, was unaware she was transporting something dangerous, and thus no secrecy was immediately involved; Hermione seems to imply that the sensors would still be triggered by the jinx within the necklace, but she is interrupted, and we never learn why she thinks that.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Draco's mission has him trying to repair something in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], which is the place upstairs that Snape is referring to. When Filch caught him &quot;skulking about the halls&quot;, Draco was not trying to gatecrash the party; it is only Slughorn's self-centredness that prevents his seeing that Draco has no wish to be there. Almost certainly, Draco was en route to the Room of Requirement to continue with his mission. Likely his vexation with Snape is partially due to Snape's preventing him from reaching the Room for what he had probably hoped would be a productive night's work.

Draco's refusal to accept Snape's help initially seems harder to fathom, as Draco is clearly having difficulty carrying out his mission and probably needs some assistance. Snape has risen quite high in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s inner council, likely to a level that Draco believes rightfully belongs to his father. Draco has been charged with what he sees as a very important mission, specifically eliminating Dumbledore, &quot;the only one he (Voldemort) ever feared&quot;. Draco quite possibly sees this mission as the only means to restore his family to its rightful position, and correctly believes that accepting assistance may help him succeed, but would certainly hinder his family's redemption. He also likely has only Snape's word that there was an Unbreakable Vow, his mother would never have revealed this to him, and he knows Voldemort forbids his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] from discussing their missions with one another. Add these factors to his own pride and the normal distrust teenagers have toward the older generation, and we can see that Draco's refusal to share his mission details with Snape is completely in character.

Some readers, following the events of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', suggested that Luna seemed an important enough character that she might join the Trio more completely, possibly even becoming Harry's girlfriend. Events in this chapter both bolster, and deny, that theory; while Harry does take Luna to Slughorn's party, he remains amused by her actions, which strongly suggests the relationship will never grow deeper.

The cauldron cakes that Romilda gives Harry are spiked with love potion, as Hermione had warned. Ron's finding and sampling them will jeopardize his relationship with Lavender, and will result in his accidental poisoning, in the spring.

Related to that incident, we will find that a poisoned bottle of mead had made it into Hogwarts without tripping Filch's Secrecy Sensors. It is unknown how, though it is suggested that because a teacher was carrying the bottle, it was left unscanned; alternately, as the teacher never knew what he was actually carrying, and the poison may not have been magical in nature, the Secrecy Sensors were unable to detect it. It could be argued that as the teacher carrying it was not keeping any secret, the Sensors would not have triggered, and in fact Hermione suggests as much when Harry asks how the girls are managing to get love potions shipped to them.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] confides to both [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] task to retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s memory. Meanwhile, Slughorn has the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class brew an antidote for different poisons. Harry's textbook provides little assistance until, with only a few minutes left, he finds a scrawled note in it, &quot;Just shove a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]] down their throats.&quot; Harry also remembers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] once saying that a Bezoar (a stone from a goat's stomach) will protect against most poisons. Finding a Bezoar in the cabinet, Harry holds it up to Slughorn. Amused, yet impressed, Slughorn says Harry thinks like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]]. Harry lingers after class and asks Slughorn about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Realizing what Harry is attempting, Slughorn insists there was nothing more to the memory that he gave Dumbledore, and departs hurriedly.

Students sit their first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] training in early February. During the session, Harry eavesdrops on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]]. Crabbe seems upset that he has to guard Malfoy while he is doing something. After several attempts, only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Susan Bones|Susan Bones]] successfully Apparates, but ''splinches'' herself, leaving a leg behind.

After overhearing Malfoy and Crabbe's conversation, Harry resolves to track Draco's movements on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]]. Over the next several weeks, he watches Crabbe and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] moving around the castle more than usual, sometimes standing in an empty hall. Harry is often unable to locate Malfoy on the map and considers that he is actually leaving the school, but dismisses this due to Hogwarts' increased security.

On his birthday, Ron eats several of the chocolates that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]] gave Harry. When Ron becomes dreamy over her, Harry realizes the candies were spiked with Love Potion and takes him to Slughorn. En route, they bump into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]], and Ron excitedly announces that Harry is taking him to Romilda. Slughorn administers an antidote, then decides they should toast Ron's birthday. Slughorn opens a bottle of mead he intended as a present for Dumbledore. After taking a sip, it quickly becomes obvious Ron has been poisoned. When Slughorn is slow to react, Harry finds the Bezoar in Slughorn's bag, and forces it down Ron's throat. &lt;!-- Note to editors: Will Ron survive? Leave the cliffhanger intact, please. --&gt;

== Analysis ==

Obtaining Slughorn's complete memory is more difficult than Harry realized. Slughorn knows Dumbledore wants this information, and, for whatever reason, he refuses to share it, and now carefully avoids being caught alone with Harry. It is apparent that Slughorn will never willingly yield this memory, and Harry must devise a more clever plan if he hopes to retrieve it.

Harry grows more obsessed with discovering Draco's secret and continually watches him on the Marauder's Map, though he is unable to figure out why Draco's name occasionally disappears. That no one else seems concerned about Draco's suspicious activities further frustrates Harry, and he needs some other means to trail him, if he is to discover what Draco is doing.

Although Hermione is disapproving that Harry uses information from the Half-Blood Prince's book, she is perhaps being a little overly critical and obsessive when Harry uses the Bezoar stone in Slughorn's class. It was, after all, something Harry had previously learned about in Snape's class, and the notes in the book only acted as a reminder. It is possible that Hermione not only resents what she considers cheating, but also anyone outshining her in class. We can safely assume that she will be grateful, however, that Harry knows how to use the stone when Ron is poisoned.

Romilda Vane had given Harry a box of chocolates just before Christmas. Harry, heeding Hermione's warning that they might be spiked with a love potion, tucked them away in his trunk unopened. Here, we see the truth in Hermione's words: Ron, finding the treats, assumed they were for his birthday, and ate three, immediately becoming infatuated with Romilda. It is a safe assumption that if Harry had eaten any, he would equally have been in Romilda's thrall, and would have taken her to Slughorn's party.

Harry is 16 years old; Ron is turning 17 on his birthday. American readers who know that mead is alcoholic may be dismayed that Slughorn offers an alcoholic drink to a clearly underage Harry. It is worth mentioning that the drinking age in the UK is much lower than it is in the United States; it is legal to drink at age 18 in a pub, or at 16 in a restaurant with a meal, and at age 5&lt;!-- yes, five years--&gt; at home. The laws in the Wizarding world must be even more lenient, as the Three Broomsticks and the Hog's Head are clearly pubs, yet third-years (age 13 and 14) can order Butterbeer (which is apparently mildly alcoholic).

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
# Why is Malfoy arguing with his cronies?
# Why does Ron fall in love with Romilda Vane? Who did Romilda intend to fall in love with her?
# Did Harry actually cheat, as Hermione claimed, when he presented the Bezoar stone to Slughorn during the class? Explain why or why not.

=== Further Study ===
# Why does Malfoy's name keep disappearing from the Marauder's Map? Where might he be during those absences?
# Why is no one other than Harry suspicious about Draco's behavior? Is Harry over-reacting?
# Who could have poisoned the mead, and who might it have been intended for?
# Why was Slughorn unable to react after Ron drank the poisoned mead?
# Are the poisoned mead and the cursed necklace connected to one another? If so, what evidence is there for this?

Disapparating will be a point of contention again between Ron and Hermione, as Ron is among the students who have difficulty with it (he will literally fail his test by half an eyebrow) and Hermione seems to naturally get the hang of it. Hermione's repetition of the technique's mnemonic will be met by Ron using a similar mnemonic to privately insult the Ministry wizard.

When done improperly, Disapparating can be dangerous. And though Susan Bones' Splinched leg is presented as a rather humorous and generally harmless training mishap, in the next book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Ron's shoulder will be badly Splinched while he is Disapparating under perilous and chaotic circumstances, causing a severe injury with serious blood loss, needing immediate medical attention. When Apparition is first discussed, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], there is a general wince when underage wizards Splinching themselves is mentioned; we do not yet fully understand why, even now, but having to have so many wizards on hand to re-attach Susan Bones' leg is a good indication of how serious it is.

Unknown to Harry just yet, Draco is spending time in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], working on something related to his mission for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Once Harry determines Draco's whereabouts during these disappearances, he will spend considerable time over the next few months trying unsuccessfully to get into the Room of Requirement to discover just what Draco is doing in there. It is unknown why the Room of Requirement does not appear on the Marauder's Map; possibly the Marauders never knew it existed, or whoever first thought it to be a junk warehouse instructed it to be unplottable, so as to be unseen on any map.

While Ron does recover from this accidental poisoning, it should be obvious already that his romantic entanglement with Lavender is unraveling. Injured though she may be by Ron's enthusiasm for meeting Romilda, Lavender will visit him repeatedly in the Hospital Wing, always finding him &quot;asleep.&quot; Ron later admits to Harry and Hermione that he was feigning sleep to avoid dealing with Lavender. This rough stretch will prove too much for their relationship to weather, and it will be dealt a final blow very shortly.

It was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] by Draco Malfoy, who poisoned the mead. Two threats have now come from The Three Broomsticks' direction: the necklace back in October and now the mead in December, so the reader should suspect that someone at the Three Broomsticks might be involved. It will turn out also that Madam Rosmerta is reporting when Dumbledore has left the school, and that the threats are aimed at Dumbledore. It is never revealed exactly how the poisoned mead was able to pass the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Secrecy Sensor|Secrecy Sensors]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] was using to track things entering and leaving the castle, though the Trio do speculate on this somewhat. Dumbledore later says that Filch would not think to check a bottle of Rosmerta's mead, we suspect that this would particularly be true of one being carried by a teacher. It was also pointed out previously by Hermione that Filch had been mistakenly letting love potions enter the castle through the mail disguised in perfume bottles from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. It would make sense he could similarly be taken in by a poisoned bottle of Rosmerta's mead.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] are discharged from the Hospital Wing together. Meeting up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], they head to breakfast, passing a small girl studying a tapestry. Startled, the girl drops the scales she had been holding; Hermione repairs them for her, and then mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] had an argument. Harry tries to react calmly to this news, but Hermione remains suspicious that he harbors feelings for Ginny.

Continuing on, the Trio runs into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]], who is miffed she was not told Ron was being discharged, and also that Hermione is with him. Harry and Hermione walk off, and Ron arrives at breakfast a half hour later; he is upset and not talking to Lavender. Hermione seems secretly pleased by this development. 

Later that evening, Harry arrives for his appointment with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. He is embroiled in a discussion with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], who is upset that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]] is still teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]]. After she leaves, Dumbledore gently chastises Harry for failing to retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s memory. Without it there is little point in continuing their lessons. Dumbledore and Harry then review what they have learned thus far: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] killed his father, framed his uncle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]], and took the Peverell ring; after returning to Hogwarts he asked Slughorn about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. 

Now they enter the realm of deep speculation. At this session, there are only two memories. The first belongs to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] who worked for an elderly rich woman. At that time, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] was working as a buyer for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]]. Tom's career choice surprised many, as it was assumed he was headed for a political career and as the Minister for Magic. But Tom had first approached [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Armando Dippet|Armando Dippet]], the Headmaster then, for a teaching post at Hogwarts. Dippet declined him, saying he lacked experience.

In Hokey's memory, Tom Riddle visits [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]], who claims to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff's]] descendant. Hepzibah shows Riddle two coveted family treasures. One, a cup once belonging to Helga Hufflepuff that was bought from Borgin &amp; Burke's. The other is a locket once owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. The locket was sold to Hepzibah by Borgin &amp; Burke's, who bought it off some poor woman. Harry recognizes the locket as the one seen earlier in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt's]] possession, and Riddle clearly also recognizes it.

Two days later, Hepzibah died, and her treasures went missing; Hokey confessed that she had mistakenly poisoned her. Riddle considered the locket was rightfully his, and Dumbledore suggests that he also stole the cup because of his deep attachment to Hogwarts; why he wanted it must wait for another lesson. 

The second memory is Dumbledore's as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] Headmaster meeting with Riddle. Ten years after Hepzibah Smith's death, Riddle has again applied to be the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. His facial features have changed somewhat; while unlike the snake-like mask that Harry remembers, this is certainly not the handsome Tom Riddle seen in the previous memory. Dumbledore confronts him about his true motives for wanting the position and his rumored behavior. He turns down Riddle for the job, saying he knows Riddle has a new name ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]) and that his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] are in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. 

Returning to the office, Dumbledore tells Harry that ever since he refused Voldemort's request, there has never been a Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher who lasted more than one year.

== Analysis ==

There is now a possible explanation for Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers having such short tenures: Dumbledore believes that Voldemort cursed the position after he was rejected for it. Dumbledore must either have been hoping that the curse would be broken when he appointed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, or otherwise never expected him to last any longer than his predecessors. Dumbledore trusts Snape, though it is still unclear why; at least two of the previous five incumbents have been driven mad: ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] by a self-inflicted backfiring charm, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]]). One, ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]), has died, and another (the false [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]) had his soul sucked out by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]]. Only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] left the post relatively unscathed, at least physically. Thus, the post does have a definite risky element to it, leaving us wondering why Dumbledore would appoint such a valued teacher and someone he deeply trusts in a position where harm could easily befall him.

As Dumbledore implies, the memories seen tonight do not significantly increase our understanding about Voldemort. Dumbledore clearly believes that the missing memory contains vital information for Harry to understand Voldemort's plans.

While it is probably insignificant, this is one of the few occasions where Dumbledore uses Tom Riddle's chosen title, &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot;. In fact, when speaking of the curse on the Defence position, he uses the full title; elsewhere in the chapter he refers to Tom as &quot;Voldemort.&quot; While this is interesting to note, we don't think it has any particular significance.

Also, in the previous chapter, Draco was seen accompanied by two girls, both looking sulky and rebellious. Now there is a small girl standing in the seventh-floor corridor studying a tapestry; we also saw a small girl standing in the seventh-floor corridor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 14|earlier]]. Each time the girls drop something, presumably from being startled. This might prove important to the story; it does seem to be something of an odd coincidence. Is there anything we should be able to recall about the seventh floor hallway?

The tenor of Lavender and Ron's encounter is another clear indication that their relationship is on the rocks. Whether they can patch up their differences and go on is unknown, but we suspect not.  Ron seems to have little inclination (or ability) to deal with the issues, instead avoiding them, in this case, by feigning sleep.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] is Dumbledore's brother, and according to an interview with the author and information in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the seventh book]], the bartender of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]]. It is safe to assume he has been so for some time, and likely was at the time that Voldemort approached Professor Dumbledore for a job. That is most likely the reason Dumbledore knows there are Death Eaters in Hogsmeade.

There is some speculation, both within the book and by fans, about Voldemort's true purpose in visiting Hogwarts to apply for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position. Dumbledore states that Voldemort probably wanted a teaching position there so he could investigate Hogwarts and all its secrets with impunity. There would also be many impressionable young minds to recruit to his peculiar beliefs. Dumbledore also apparently suspected that Voldemort was attempting to make a Horcrux – possibly using Godric Gryffindor's sword. Some fans suggest that he was planting a Horcrux there (which proves to be true in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''). That would fit his &quot;style&quot; — hiding a Horcrux under Dumbledore's nose, basically saying that he knew Dumbledore's school better than Dumbledore himself did. Voldemort may have partially used the interview as a ruse so he could hide Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, one of his Horcruxes, inside Hogwarts. His intent here was actually to keep the Diadem safe, convinced he was the only living person who knew about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]].

Voldemort probably told Draco how to summon the Room of Requirement. Putting the clues together, as Harry does [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 21|in the next chapter]], we will see that Draco is working on his project in this room. Crabbe and Goyle, disguised as little girls by stolen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], stand guard outside, dropping objects when it is unsafe to exit the room. Although Draco would already have known about the Room of Requirement after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] was discovered there the previous year (in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]), it seems Voldemort will continue to be under the assumption throughout the next book that he and Draco are the only ones who know it exists. Clearly Draco failed to mention to the Dark Lord that he already knew the Room of Requirement existed; one might wonder what other information Draco is keeping from Voldemort. Presumably, despite working in the room where it is hidden, Draco knows nothing about the Diadem Horcrux.

In the summer preceding this school year, Dumbledore learned he had approximately one year left to live after he was inflicted with a fatal curse. He specifically required Snape to kill him by the school year's end, thus protecting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] from executing Voldemort's assassination plot. Realizing he will only last out the year, and that Snape will be accused of murdering him, Dumbledore knows that Snape's tenure as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would be limited in any case. This is likely why Dumbledore repeatedly refused Snape the post: Snape is too talented a teacher, too valuable an ally, to risk losing. After this year, it will no longer matter, so placing him in the cursed post will do no harm. More importantly, it aids Dumbledore's plan to retrieve Slughorn's true memory by bringing him back to Hogwarts to fill Snape's vacated potions position.

The ongoing byplay with an increasingly alcoholic Sybill Trelawney is actually aimed at two related revelations. First, Harry discovers that Trelawney has been hiding her sherry supply in the Room of Requirement, and that she heard Draco celebrating his success. As Trelawney accompanies Harry to Dumbledore's office to report this, she reveals that it was Snape who carried the prophecy's first half to Voldemort, which in turn resulted in James and Lily Potters' deaths.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is in the Hospital Wing with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] at his bedside. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], who were in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] investigating opening a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] shop, are also there. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr.]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] arrive and express their sincere gratitude to Harry for saving yet another member of their family. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who is also visiting Ron, says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] is getting worse. He lets slip to Harry and Hermione that Hogwarts could be closed due to the increasingly dangerous incidents. He also overheard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] arguing over something Snape no longer wanted to do. Dumbledore firmly reminded Snape that the latter gave his word. There was also a reference about Snape's investigations in Slytherin, which Hagrid assumes is about the cursed necklace. Hagrid's information deepens Harry's suspicions about Snape.

Later, Harry grudgingly agrees to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen's]] request to replace Ron as Keeper. Meanwhile, Harry continues watching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco's]] movements on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], though he is beset with classes, homework, Quidditch practice, and Cormac repeatedly pestering him with strategy ideas. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] also constantly pesters him about Ron, saying that he is always asleep whenever she visits.

On his way to the next Quidditch match, Harry notices Draco and two sulky-looking girls heading into the castle. Harry is certain that Draco is going to his usual hidden place, and sorely wants to follow, but he is already late. Harry is astonished that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] has been appointed as the Quidditch match commentator; her dreamy game description has everyone laughing, except [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. McLaggen, attempting to micromanage the team, borrows a Beater's club and accidentally hits a Bludger at Harry, cracking his skull and landing him in the infirmary with Ron. 

While recovering in the infirmary, Harry realizes he can order [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] to trail Draco. He summons, the Black family [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] that he inherited with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. Kreacher appears, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. The two are fighting, apparently because Kreacher made insulting remarks about Harry. Harry instructs the two elves to trail Draco Malfoy and to bring him regular reports on everywhere Malfoy goes and what he does. He forbids Kreacher from warning Malfoy in any way. Kreacher sulkily obeys, saying he would prefer having Draco as his master.

== Analysis ==

Harry's quick thinking saved Ron from certain death. Although Hermione continually chastises Harry for using the Half-Blood Prince's methods, in this instance, she is grateful for what the Prince taught him. Hermione's silent vigil by Ron's sickbed is mute testament to her feelings about him; that he may feel the same is evidenced by his response to her voice, when she finally speaks.

Someone obviously knew that Slughorn intended to give Dumbledore the mead and poisoned it to murder him. It is also possible that the cursed necklace that nearly killed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] was intended for Dumbledore. Harry remains convinced that Draco perpetrated the attacks, but he lacks specific proof tying Draco to either object. Though Draco was at Borgin &amp; Burkes where Harry saw the necklace, many other people could have been there. Regardless, Harry becomes more determined than ever to uncover what Draco is doing.

Though Harry's suspicions as to who was the intended recipient or the delivery agent of either the necklace or the mead is the only proof we have, it would be useful to consider these objects' source.

Draco and the two sulky girls that are often with him is another interesting point. It is unusual for Draco to have girls, particularly younger ones, as companions. Why would he suddenly have sidekicks so different from his usual hangers-on, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]? 

Although he is magically bound to obey Harry, Kreacher is less than trustworthy and remains loyal to the Black family, and by extension, the Malfoys (through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]), which is why Harry specifically orders him to reveal nothing to Draco. Harry may have been a bit careless in his instructions, however. Although Harry orders Kreacher to reveal nothing to Draco, Kreacher is clever and devious enough that he could bypass his master's orders by relaying information to Draco through someone else. Kreacher previously manipulated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] orders after he told Kreacher to &quot;leave&quot;, which Kreacher twisted into meaning he should leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. He then visited Narcissa Malfoy, providing her with valuable information about Sirius and Harry.

Hagrid's concerns about Aragog are well-founded. Aragog will die shortly, and Hagrid will invite Harry to his funeral. With a little magical help, Harry will be able to use this event to retrieve Slughorn's memory that Dumbledore needs. However, the next lesson with Dumbledore will occur before this happens, and Dumbledore will be disappointed that Harry has been unable to retrieve the memory.

The argument that Hagrid overheard between Snape and Dumbledore will be revisited in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where it is essentially heard in its entirety. Snape threatened to renege on his promise to Dumbledore to kill him in order to spare Draco, under orders from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], from carrying out this task. Dumbledore believes Snape will follow through, as he presumably knows that Snape has made an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]]; still, the threat is real and must be addressed, as Snape could, presumably, somehow convince Draco to kill Dumbledore rather than doing it himself. Hagrid felt that Dumbledore was not his usual self, and seemed angrier than usual. By this time, the curse that had destroyed Dumbledore's hand was gaining force, though bottled up in his hand, for eight months; no doubt it was causing discomfort, and continuous pain can make anyone, even someone as patient as Dumbledore, rather testy.

We know from Katie's friend Leanne, that the cursed necklace that injured Katie Bell was given to her at The Three Broomsticks. Though there is no proof, it is possible that this may have been aimed at Dumbledore, along with the poisoned mead. Whatever its eventual destination, it seems likely that the mead's source would be The Three Broomsticks; Slughorn is unlikely to trust [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]] for his needs, he is too much the aesthete. This points to a center of malevolence in the Three Broomsticks; we discover later that that center is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] by Draco Malfoy.

In the previous chapter, during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] lesson, we heard Crabbe complaining to Malfoy about something Malfoy requires him to do. That turns out to be Malfoy having him and Goyle use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to transform into small girls, and stand guard outside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] while Malfoy worked inside on his project for Voldemort. In the next chapter, Dobby and Kreacher will report to Harry that Draco has been in the Room of Requirement; Harry correctly guesses that Crabbe and Goyle appeared on the Marauders' Map loitering in a hallway because they were guarding that doorway. The two sulky-looking girls accompanying Draco prior to the Quidditch match are almost certainly the disguised Crabbe and Goyle, likely upset because they are unable to retain their muscular physiques while guarding the door, and annoyed at the prospect of an hour or more of boredom.

While Kreacher is devious, and claims he would much prefer to have Draco as his master rather than Harry, he is unable to avoid Harry's restriction on informing Draco that he is being tailed. Possibly, this is because Dobby has volunteered to provide the same report, and Kreacher knows that he cannot avoid Dobby. Kreacher's report to Harry will, however, be valueless, consisting only of praise for Draco and insults for Harry. Dobby's account informs Harry where Draco is going, though not what he is doing there.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are studying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] handbooks in preparation for their test, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], too young to take the test, is keeping them company. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] sends a message saying that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]], the giant spider, has died. He asks if Harry, Ron, and Hermione could attend the funeral. Between the three, they decide not to go; it is such a silly thing to get detention over, after all.

Hermione suggests Harry have another try at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s memory during class, as it will be pretty sparse with students off taking Apparition tests. Ron suggests using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]] to help Harry get Professor Slughorn's memory. Hermione agrees, but Harry is reluctant; he had been saving it, although he is unsure for what – but it has something to do with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] breaking up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]], and Ron somehow getting a girlfriend he actually likes. 

With only three people in Potions class (Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]), Professor Slughorn sets an open challenge: make whatever they like. Harry notices that Draco is looking thinner and rather unhealthy, and believes that whatever he is doing in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] is not going so well. Slughorn is impressed with Harry's Euphoria Elixir, but he again escapes when they are left alone. Returning to the Gryffindor Common room, Harry learns that Hermione passed Apparition, but Ron failed for splinching half an eyebrow.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron head for the dorm, where Harry drinks some Felix Felicis. To Ron and Hermione's amazement, Harry suddenly decides to attend Aragog's funeral. Covered by his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility cloak]], Harry returns to the Common room,  followed by Ron and Hermione. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] seeing only Ron and Hermione emerging from the boy's dorm, flies into a jealous rage. Heading out the portrait hole, Harry brushes against Ginny; she thinks it is Dean, and rounds on him. 

Following a detour that the potion seems to suggest, Harry runs into Slughorn who, upon learning about Aragog's death, notes that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantula]] venom is particularly valuable. Recognizing that this might entice Slughorn to share his memory about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], Harry invites him to the funeral. Slughorn arrives at Hagrid's hut, well dressed and carrying bottles of mead. After an emotional service, and with help from Harry's flawless and surreptitious refilling charm, Hagrid and Slughorn become drunk. Knowing Slughorn will remember nothing the next morning, Harry talks about his parents' death. Hearing how his favorite student, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]], died, causes Slughorn to become extremely sad. Harry says he needs the memory about Tom Riddle, and, as a persuasion tactic, reminds Slughorn that he is Lily's son. After being convinced that Harry is the &quot;Chosen One&quot;, the teary-eyed professor yields his memory to Harry, then falls asleep.

== Analysis ==

This is the first time Harry's persuasion powers have been truly observed, though as he was using Felix Felicis at the time, we are uncertain if he would be so persuasive without it. This is also the first time that Harry has spoken about his parents' death in this manner, and probably the only time without experiencing extreme emotion, knowing it will help secure Slughorn's memory and to fight [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Even in death, James and Lily are still able to battle the Dark Lord. Readers should recall some chapters back that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] said Harry was uniquely equipped to obtain Slughorn's memory. Dumbledore may have known about the Felix Felicis, though using it may actually have been unnecessary; Dumbledore knows that Harry having Lily's eyes, and Lily being one of Slughorn's favorite students, would be a powerful and emotional persuasion tactic. That, and being well plied with alcohol, is enough to coax Slughorn into divulging the memory; remembering Lily's sacrifice in fighting Voldemort also helped. Although Slughorn will have forgotten the incident when he awakes, he probably would have appreciated the irony that it was his own Good Luck potion that allowed Harry to retrieve a memory that he tried so hard to keep hidden.

Slughorn's self-centredness also becomes more evident here. He mentions that all the mead he brought is quite safe, he had a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-Elf]] drink some from each bottle to ensure it was not poisoned. This revelation disquiets Harry, as it shows that Slughorn sees nothing wrong with risking a House-elf's life to protect his own. We can give him the benefit of the doubt, here, and assume that he had another [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]] on hand in case a bottle was poisoned, though this is not mentioned. However, this rather callous display might lead Harry to be more involved with, or at least less dismissive of, Hermione's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/S.P.E.W.|Society for the Protection of Elvish Welfare]].

Hagrid's almost child-like simplicity is seen again. His reaction to most setbacks is to get drunk, which he manages quite quickly here. Hagrid's amazement at Aragog's children not affording him safe passage is also a sign of his innocence. Though he is probably at least 65-years-old, he still fails to understand that obligations are not indefinite, and that a covenant Aragog considered binding may not extend to his descendants, nor will it protect Hagrid's friends. 

Harry's first year at Hogwarts started in September after he turned 11-years-old, though this is the first time that his, Hermione's, and Ron's relative ages have been mentioned. Hermione, whose birthday falls in September, is nearly a year older than Harry, while Ron, who has a March birthday, is four or five months older than Harry and six months younger than Hermione. Harry's birthday falling in July means he is unable to take his Apparition test until the summer.

Ron's failing the Apparition test by such a small margin is fully in character; his use of magic seems somewhat slap-dash and, perhaps, marginally competent at times. One wonders if the author's reason for his failure is a nod to idiom; &quot;missed it by half an eyebrow&quot; seems a very likely sort of colloquialism. And while Ron's magical ability can sometimes be marginal, his natural intelligence is becoming more overt when he suggests Harry use the good luck potion to get Slughorn's memory.

Ron's failing his Apparition test will result in him signing up for additional classes, held in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], over the next few weeks. This will be mentioned in passing, as will his eventual success in the test, but will not have any significant effect on the story.

As mentioned, Harry has been saving the potion to help improve both his and Ron's situations regarding girlfriends. As luck and Felix Felicis would have it, he manages that as a side effect of his efforts to retrieve Slughorn's memory. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 24|We will find out]] that the blazing row Lavender started when Ron and Hermione appeared unaccompanied from the dorm ended that relationship, leaving Ron free to pursue a relationship with Hermione, one that turns out significantly better. At the same time, Ginny, already annoyed by Dean's over-solicitousness, will misinterpret Harry's invisibly pushing past them as a final instance of that and will break up with Dean, leaving her free to answer Harry's pursuit.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] spends much spare time devising a way to retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn's]] memory. As his potions book has been so useful, Harry studies it carefully. But [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] points out that Slughorn will likely be protected against anything in the textbook. Harry notices a new curse in it, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]], that is labeled, &quot;For Enemies.&quot; He wants to test it, but knowing Hermione's objections to using the Prince's spells, he refrains. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] Spell-Checking quill stops working, Hermione offers to correct the spelling on his essay. Ron jokingly responds that he loves her, causing a blushing Hermione to warn not to let [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] hear him say that. Ron thinks maybe he should; he has been trying to dump her.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] report to Harry regarding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]]'s activities. Draco has spent considerable time inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. A &quot;variety&quot; of students stand watch while Draco is inside. Harry surmises these &quot;students&quot; are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] disguised by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] stolen from Slughorn. He also guesses that the Room was not on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] because the map's creators never knew it existed, though Hermione suggests the room may be &quot;unplottable&quot; if the user needs it to be. Harry thinks he should be able to enter the Room of Requirement, just as Malfoy had when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] was there. But Hermione counters that Draco knew what the Room was being used for.

The next day, Harry attempts to enter the Room of Requirement, but is unable to make the door appear. Later, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]] asks about the difference between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]]; Professor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] says that a story in the ''Daily Prophet'' was actually was about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who was arrested for impersonating an Inferius. After class, Ron and Harry duck into a bathroom so Ron can avoid Lavender. There they find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]], who says she was expecting someone else &amp;mdash; a boy who has been crying.

Ron decides to take the extra [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] classes being offered in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] village. Hermione, meanwhile, repeatedly urges Harry to try and get Slughorn's memory. Harry is trying, but Slughorn, knowing what Harry is after, avoids being alone with him. Harry spends another day looking for Malfoy in the Room of Requirement. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] suddenly appears, claiming she is there to see Dumbledore, though Harry notices she is teary eyed. Harry relates this to Hermione, suggesting Tonks was in love with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]]. Her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus']] changed shape could reflect Sirius' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus dog form]]. Hermione thinks it is possible, but is doubtful.

== Analysis ==

Harry learns that Malfoy has been spending time in the Room of Requirement, which is why he periodically disappears from the Marauder's Map. However, Harry still has no idea what Malfoy is doing, and anyone he tells seems unconcerned. Harry only becomes more obsessed with following Draco, which could cause Harry to neglect Dumbledore's task to retrieve Slughorn's memory. Here, Harry does seem to be trying to handle both, along with his schoolwork, but he is becoming increasingly distracted by Malfoy's suspicious activities.

Harry is having significant difficulty entering the Room of Requirement. As we have seen, the Room can be anything that is required, but apparently it can be only one thing at a time; for instance, it can be a room full of chamber pots, as Dumbledore apparently discovered, it can be a place for a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] to sleep off a Butterbeer binge, as Dobby and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]] have done, and it can provide a space for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] to practice Defence Against the Dark Arts. But once the room is occupied, in order to gain entrance, you must have that same specific need. Hermione is likely correct that Harry will be unable to enter until he knows what Draco needs, and, at least in this chapter, he is unsuccessful.

Ron may believe he is only joking when he tells Hermione he loves her, but he may actually be revealing his strong feelings for her, though he hardly realizes what those feelings are. And while he remains confused about what he actually feels for Hermione, there is no doubt about his feelings for Lavender&amp;mdash;he wants to be rid of her.

Tonks' ongoing depression remains a mystery, but it has deeply affected her, to the extent that her Patronus has  changed its shape. Harry believes she was in love with Sirius, while Hermione doubts this, and Hermione's beliefs are seldom wrong. One thing seems obvious, Tonks is secretly guarding Harry, twice now appearing just as he lands himself in trouble.

It may be interesting to note the difference in just how Kreacher and Dobby relay their report to Harry. Though Harry is nominally Kreacher's master, Kreacher begins his account with abuse and insults for Harry and compliments for Draco. Dobby cuts him off to tell Harry what he actually wants to know. Kreacher's behavior seems almost childish, and so seems accurate for what we know of House-elf character in general.

Readers should perhaps wonder why a boy would be crying in Moaning Myrtle's lavatory and why Myrtle seems to be expecting him.

Inferi are mentioned, though not for the first time, but it is only now that they are defined. We should take note, as the author is generally efficient, and they will likely be mentioned again. We also may suspect that the Sectumsempra spell, which is at least a jinx, and more likely a curse, will also reappear.

It is perhaps surprising that the Room of Requirement can be used to carry out what we assume is a task for Voldemort, as Hogwarts is supposed to be protected from Dark Magic. There are several possibilities here. One possibility is that the Room of Requirement is an exception, or that someone has performed a spell which allows it. Another possibility is that what is being done is not Dark as such, but can be used for Dark purposes. What Draco is doing is repairing a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing cabinet]], a task which in isolation is not Dark. It is the use it is put to once it is repaired that makes it so useful to the Dark side.

Draco, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly distraught over the task he must perform for the Dark Lord and the real danger his family is in should he fail. He eventually seeks solace from Moaning Myrtle, frequently sobbing to her in the lavatory. 

When Voldemort found the Room of Requirement, he was apparently looking for someplace to hide something, likely the result of some Dark experiment gone awry. Thus, when he told Draco how to open the Room of Requirement, he shared only what he knew about the room, its &quot;hiding place&quot; form. Harry would be able to open the Room while Draco occupied it if he told it that he needed a place to hide something, that being the way that Voldemort and Draco were opening it; but Harry, knowing that the Room could be anything, persists in asking it to be a place where he can work on something. This is, strangely perhaps, a case where Harry has too much understanding for the task at hand.

Harry's decision to heed Hermione's advice and refrain from testing the Prince's spells on someone without knowing the results was a wise one. Sectumsempra has a devastating effect, which, had it been used in a different circumstance, could have cost someone their life, and in a later chapter, it will be nearly fatal for someone. It is somewhat curious that Harry never guesses its purpose from the incantation; we have seen that spell incantations are based on Latin, and this spell's incantation appears to be based on the Latin for &quot;cut forever&quot;, a fair description of its action.

It is revealed later that Tonks is in love, not with Sirius, but with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin| Remus Lupin]]. While Lupin also cares for Tonks, he has rejected her feelings because he believes he is too old for her, is generally concerned about bringing children into the current world, and about them having a Werewolf father in particular. Not wanting to risk passing on his affliction to his offspring, Lupin refused to marry Tonks. Note that this being a book intended for children, it is assumed that there is no extramarital sex, so Lupin and Tonks must get married as the next stage in their relationship, and marriage implies children.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] returns to the castle as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]] is wearing off.  Memory in hand, Harry presents himself to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], who seems amazed and pleased with Harry's success. He fetches his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], and they enter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s fifty-year-old memory.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] asks Slughorn about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Slughorn explains it is the darkest of Dark magic that can split a soul to encase it into another object; if killed, the perpetrator never actually dies because his soul shard remains earthbound. Souls are not meant to be split, and it takes the ultimate evil, murder, to rip a soul apart. Prodded further, Slughorn reveals there is a spell, but claims not to know it. Riddle asks if, as one Horcrux can keep someone alive, would more not be better? Seven is a very powerful number. Slughorn, horrified, tries calming himself by saying this is all hypothetical. Riddle agrees, but as he departs, Harry sees the same wild joy on Riddle's face as when he learned he was a wizard.

Back in his office, Dumbledore says the diary that Harry destroyed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|four years before]], was not only a Horcrux, but also a weapon, intended to possess a Hogwarts student to reopen the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore also theorizes that Voldemort may have divided his soul into seven pieces (Tom Riddle had claimed that seven was the &quot;most powerfully magical number&quot;) to obtain immortality. As long as any Horcrux survives, Voldemort is unable to be killed. Dumbledore also speculates that Voldemort only used unique items to house his Horcruxes &amp;mdash; objects with a significant history and value to Riddle. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary (seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]) and a ring once belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]], Voldemort's maternal grandfather. Dumbledore's injured hand resulted from destroying the ring, and it was only his own skill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s timely action that contained the damage. Of the four remaining Horcruxes, Dumbledore believes that one will be Hufflepuff's cup and the other Slytherin's locket; the third may be a Ravenclaw artifact. The only known Gryffindor artifact, the sword, remains safe in Dumbledore's office. The final Horcrux may be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], Voldemort's pet snake. Placing a Horcrux in a live being is risky, however, as living creatures can be killed. Dumbledore also notes that his recent absences were due to his searching for Horcruxes, and says Harry can accompany him if he finds additional ones.

Dumbledore believes Voldemort is unaware when a Horcrux is destroyed, and that he can only be be killed when all his Horcruxes are destroyed by someone with uncommon skill and power, someone like Harry, who possesses the ability to love.

== Analysis ==

While Dumbledore never explicitly says so, a reader piecing clues together can see that Dumbledore has only counted six Horcruxes: with two destroyed, four remain to be found. While this seems to counter Riddle's belief in seven being the most magical number, we should remember that Voldemort retains one soul piece within himself. It should be mentioned that a Horcrux is not &quot;used up&quot; when Voldemort returns from the dead; when his body is killed, his main soul remains anchored to the Earth by the Horcruxes, and that is used to re-animate him. 

It is easy to assume that the artifacts Voldemort chose to house his Horcruxes in are based on their economic value, and that an artifact dating back to Salazar Slytherin would be protected by its antiquity. However, Dumbledore never says anything like that. The artifacts were selected because they are valuable to Riddle. The ones we know of are the diary, valuable because it contains proof that Riddle is the heir of Slytherin, and the Gaunt ring which links him to the old Peverell family. The Slytherin locket and the Hufflepuff cup that Dumbledore mentions, are associated with the founding of Hogwarts, the first place Riddle could call home. The one within Nagini was likely placed there in haste, and the snake happened to be a convenient receptacle; but the one unknown Horcrux will be an object that is valuable to Riddle, whether or not it is valuable to anyone else.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] stated that &quot;The Chosen One&quot; would have powers the Dark Lord lacked. That power is love, and Dumbledore realizes that it is Harry's abilities, combined with his capacity to love, that will empower him to defeat Voldemort. Unlike Harry, who is emotionally intact, and whose friends support him out of loyalty and amity, Voldemort is psychologically, spiritually, and emotionally shredded, feeling only hate, envy, and rage, and controls his followers through fear, intimidation, and coercion. And while Harry finds it difficult to fathom that something so simple as love is the more powerful force, he understands that, once again, it is also about choices:  Voldemort's actions regarding Harry are based on the prophecy, but Harry would choose to fight Voldemort whether or not the prophecy had been made. That choice, and the ability to make that choice, is largely what gives Harry powers that Voldemort lacks and prevents Harry from falling victim to the Dark side. Some years earlier, Dumbledore had stressed to Harry that it is one's choices that makes a person what they truly are, just as it had with Harry's father, James, when he chose to overcome his youthful bad behavior. 

Dumbledore believes that Voldemort's snake, Nagini, is also a Horcrux. It has been suggested that Voldemort's final Horcrux might have been generated when Voldemort murdered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Riddle Manor|Riddle Manor]] caretaker. Voldemort's wand was also used to murder [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], so it could have been her death that allowed Voldemort to create a Horcrux that he may have embedded within Nagini. It is also possible that all his Horcruxes were in place when he encountered Baby Harry; weak and disembodied, Voldemort may have been unable to create Horcruxes after that incident. This would then rule out a Horcrux being made from either Bertha Jorkins' or Frank Bryce's deaths. However, Dumbledore is correct that Nagini is much more self-aware than an ordinary snake, and that Voldemort seems to have far more control over her than expected. As Dumbledore noted, we have entered the realm of speculation: as Dumbledore knew nothing about the circumstances surrounding Frank Bryce's or Bertha Jorkins' deaths, his speculation does not quite tally with readers' understanding. Nagini was already acting most decidedly un-snake-like when Frank Bryce was killed, so the best assumption is that Voldemort's final Horcrux was actually created from the earlier Bertha Jorkins' death, and was retained in Nagini.

Dumbledore is mistaken in saying that the sword is Gryffindor's only known artifact; there is also the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]], which says it once belonged to Gryffindor. The Hat is somewhat sentient, and it is questionable as to whether it is properly an artifact.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One Horcrux was previously seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. &quot;A heavy locket that none of them could open,&quot; matching Slytherin's locket that has been seen in the Pensieve memories a few times now, was discovered and discarded during the cleanup of Grimmauld Place. A note inside a fake locket that will be found later in a secret sea cave is signed R.A.B., which are the initials of the late [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Arcturus Black]], a repentant Death Eater and Sirius's younger brother. The locket at Grimmauld Place will prove hard to find; originally [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], retrieving it from the trash, had set it aside, unable to part with any Black heirlooms. It is later stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who was seen earlier busily looting Grimmauld Place. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione eventually catch up with Mundungus, he informs them that the locket was extorted from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] at the Ministry of Magic.

Curiously, even though Harry clearly sees Slytherin's distinctively-shaped locket during his and Dumbledore's forays into the Pensieve, Harry fails to recognize it as the same one that was found and then discarded at Grimmauld Place, nor will he fully realize that another locket that will be collected from a sea cave near the book's end is also different until he finds a note inside explaining that it is a fake Horcrux. Dumbledore also never notices the difference; however, he will be in an extremely weakened physical and mental state after recovering the locket, and did not necessarily record the small details so accurately.

Dumbledore believes Voldemort is unable to feel when his Horcruxes are being destroyed, given that he was unaware the diary had been dispatched until Lucius Malfoy told him. What Dumbledore has withheld from Harry is that a second Horcrux, the ring, has also been destroyed, with no apparent response from Voldemort. It is learned later that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] is able to bring information about Voldemort to Dumbledore, and he would have reported Voldemort's reaction to the ring's destruction had Voldemort known about it. While Harry learns that the ring Horcrux has been destroyed, he must remain unaware of just what Snape's true role is for a while longer.

If Riddle was truthful when he spoke to Slughorn, it indicates that he found nothing about Horcruxes in the library and that the book, ''Secrets of the Darkest Art'' (which we learn in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] is an authoritative source on the making and destruction of Horcruxes) had already been hidden away. Even then, though, Tom Riddle and the truth had, at best, no more than a nodding acquaintance. So it is entirely possible that Riddle had a greater understanding about how to create Horcruxes than he let on and could have created one. The author has stated that the ring Horcrux was made via the death of Tom Riddle Sr., which happened at the same time as Tom collected the ring from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]]; thus, if the ring was on Tom's finger in the memory, it must already have been a Horcrux. One of Dumbledore's infrequent mistakes is seen here:  Dumbledore stated that once the ring was made into a Horcrux, Tom no longer wanted to wear it. He is wearing it in this memory, and it is presumably already a Horcrux. Possibly, a better statement would have been, &quot;Once he had made a second Horcrux, he felt a need to keep them all safe and separate from himself.&quot; Thus the ring Horcrux would have been hidden once he had made the diary Horcrux.

It is certain that Riddle would have waited to hide the ring Horcrux in the Gaunt shack until Morfin and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo]] were no longer there. He had learned from Morfin that Marvolo had died. Having framed Morfin for Tom Riddle Sr.'s murder, Riddle would have known that Morfin was in Azkaban, but there is always the possibility, slim though it may be, that he would escape or be released. Presumably it was only after hearing about Morfin's death in prison that Riddle thought it safe to return to the Gaunt shack and hide the ring there. Having taken great pains to conceal his original name, and especially his middle name, Voldemort thought it would be impossible to make the connection back to the Gaunt shack.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] class the next day, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] shares with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] what he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] learned from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s memories. Ron, in return, mentions that he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] have broken up. Hermione comments that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] have also split. Though he tries hard to conceal his elation, Hermione senses Harry is hiding something.

Ginny and Dean's mutual silence leaves Harry worrying whether they can Chase together on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team. Luckily, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] returns from the hospital and can resume playing. Unfortunately, she cannot recall who gave her the necklace.

With [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|McLaggen]] gone and Katie back, Quidditch practice is wonderful now. Ginny becomes the life of the team, cracking jokes and doing marvelous imitations. Harry is glad to have a reason to look at her, happy to be able to walk alongside her, but he is still seriously worried about his friendship with Ron if he started dating her. Harry remembers Ron's expression when he caught Ginny and Dean together; how would he react to Ginny and him together? Meanwhile, interest grows about the upcoming Quidditch match against Ravenclaw; the Quidditch championship is still in doubt. Gryffindor must win by three hundred points to get the championship; that is still possible, but if they lose by as much as a hundred points, they will still be in second place. 

Harry, making his usual pass by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], sees on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] is in a bathroom one floor below with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]. Harry investigates and finds Draco sobbing: whatever he is planning, he is frightened that he is unable to do it and fears for his parents' lives (and his own) if he fails. Malfoy spots Harry and casts a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]; Harry, defending himself, using the Half-Blood Prince's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|''Sectumsempra'']] spell without knowing its effects. To his horror, it gashes Draco's face and chest, spilling his blood everywhere. Moaning Myrtle flies off, screaming. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] responds swiftly and heals Draco's wounds, subsequently hurrying him to the Hospital Wing. 

Returning, Snape demands to know where Harry learned the spell, and, despite Harry's attempts at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|occlumency]], Snape apparently gleans some information about Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] book. Snape demands to see his textbooks. Harry runs to the Common room and borrows Ron's books, including the Potions textbook, and, asking the Room of Requirement for a place to hide something, enters and finds himself in a vast warehouse filled with broken and discarded objects. Passing the damaged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]] in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] had run into trouble [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|the previous year]], Harry hides his book in a large cupboard, placing an old stone bust, a wig, and a battered tiara on top to locate it again.

Snape seems unconvinced that the Potions book, which is signed &quot;Roonil Wazlib&quot;, is actually Harry's. For using Dark Magic, albeit unknowingly, to cause serious harm, Snape sentences Harry to detention every Saturday until school ends. Snape dismisses Harry's protests, as does [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], who later informs Harry that he was lucky not to be expelled. Hermione, of course, affirms that she knew that the Prince was involved in Dark magic, though Harry disputes this, saying the Prince could have copied down the spell. Hermione is upset that Harry still intends to retrieve the Prince's book, but Ginny tells her to leave Harry alone. Ron and Harry are both amazed, given how close Ginny and Hermione have been. Harry cannot help feeling cheered by Ginny defending him.

With Harry unable to play in the Quidditch Final due to Snape's detentions, Ginny replaces Harry as Seeker, and Dean Thomas takes over as Chaser. That Saturday, Harry reports to Snape's office for his first detention and is assigned copying over old detention files for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]. Snape suggests Harry start with the boxes detailing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father's]] misbehaviour. When Harry returns to the Common room, he learns that Gryffindor won the match 450 to 140, and so, against all odds, have secured the Quidditch Cup. Ginny runs into his arms and he kisses her. When he looks around: Dean Thomas is holding a broken glass, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]] looks angry, Hermione approving. Ron appears stunned, but gives a small nod, as if bowing to the inevitable. Harry suggests, wordlessly, to Ginny that they should go for a long walk.

== Analysis ==

This is the first time Draco is seen attempting an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable curse]], and his familiarity with it suggests he has been practicing privately. Although Harry was justifiably defending himself against Malfoy, who was about to cast the Cruciatus Curse, using an unknown spell was dangerous and reckless. However, despite this grievous action that could have permanently expelled him from Hogwarts, Snape only assigns Harry detention. It is also the first time Draco is seen as anything but a swaggering, obnoxious bully, and his uncontrollable sobbing shows he possesses a more human side. Draco is obviously terrified for his and his family's safety should he fail in his task, indicating he is under extreme emotional duress. Harry catching him in such a vulnerable state prompted his severe reaction, which, in turn, caused Harry to react just as rashly. 

Ginny defending Harry when Hermione is chastising him for wanting to retrieve the Half-Blood Prince's book serves several purposes. First, Ginny reminds Hermione that Draco was about to cast an Unforgivable curse, and shows that there is a definite possibility that Harry was acting on impulse, not rational thought. Second, this is the first time that someone other than Ron or Harry has defended the Half-Blood Prince, though in this instance, it is more to justify Harry's actions; Hermione's long-standing animosity toward the Prince seems to be based as much on her jealousy over Harry outperforming her in Potions, as it is concern that the Prince might be a Dark wizard. In particular, Hermione sees Harry using the Prince's work and claiming it as his own. For Hermione, it seems that this issue may be more about that rather than the Prince's spells possibly having Dark aspects, though she uses the ''Sectumsempra'' spell's Dark nature as justification for her excoriating the Prince. And finally, this helps set the scene for Harry and Ginny's kiss. Seeing Ginny standing up for him, Harry now knows that she is not angry with him, and this gives Harry hope that she may still have feelings for him.

While Ginny and Harry's relationship has been gradually building almost from the series' beginning, this is the first time it has been declared openly. It would seem that it took this long because they were often at cross purposes. At first, Harry simply was uninterested romantically in Ginny, having first set his sights on Cho Chang and considering Ginny only as Ron's little sister. It is only later that Harry realized that he and Cho were incompatible and that he not only had feelings for Ginny, but that they were suited to each other in nearly every way. She, however, appeared to have moved on and became involved with someone else, though she never actually lost interest in Harry; she simply gave up. Harry need not have worried about what Ron thought, however. In fact, when Ginny announced that she had broken up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]] at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|the previous book]], Ron subtly hinted to Harry that he was a better choice than Michael, even if Harry was oblivious about what he meant at the time.

The reader should take careful note of the artifacts Harry finds in the Room of Requirement when he goes to hide his textbook.

Harry and Ginny's relationship, which begins publicly here, will be thrown into turmoil near this book's end. Knowing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] will attack anyone close to him, Harry ends his and Ginny's relationship to protect her. This separation, as ill-advised as it may seem (discussion [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 30#Greater Picture|in a later chapter]]), is temporary, much to the reader's relief.

While inside the Room of Requirement, Harry unknowingly touches another [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], putting it atop the dresser that he hides his Potions book in. This is something that he will need to remember in the next book. The fact that the Horcrux is here, meaning that Voldemort must have been able to enter this room, may reveal something about what Draco is working on; however, as we have not yet knowingly seen a Horcrux, this hint is lost to us at the moment. The Vanishing Cabinet being here could also be a clue; it was last seen in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', barely a year ago, and at that time it was in the hallway where the Twins could push Montague into it. How did it get into the Room of Requirement? This is actually a very adroit use of tension on the part of the author:  Harry is under such pressure to find a hiding place for his textbook that he does not think twice about the presence of the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement, and we readers are perforce dragged along with him. The reader interested in writing technique should carefully note how the author carries our attention past the Vanishing Cabinet, showing us the clue to what Draco is attempting, yet not giving us the necessary time to process that clue.

This will not be the last time Snape gives a light sentence for a student's serious offense. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 15|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], when Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] attempt to steal Gryffindor's Sword from the Headmaster's office, Snape, the then-Headmaster, catches them, but he only assigns them detention in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. There may be a reason for the latter punishment's lightness, though the reason that Harry got off so lightly in this instance remains uncertain. It is possibly because both Dumbledore and Snape know that Draco, involved with the Voldemort's Dark task, fears for his and his family's life, and that Harry, having no understanding regarding Draco's predicament and feeling disfranchised by Dumbledore, has become obsessed with and highly emotional over trying to uncover what this task is. Another possibility is that Snape is aware of the origin of the hex Harry cast upon Draco. Snape's immediate demand to see Harry's Potions book suggests strongly that Snape knows where the ''Sectumsempra'' spell originated, and also perhaps that he is its original author. Whether Snape is concerned about having his half-blood past exposed (as it would be if the title he gave himself in that book, the &quot;Half-Blood Prince,&quot; comes to light) is debatable; however, if it was determined that Snape was the source of this very Dark spell that Harry had used, there could be serious repercussions on Snape, possibly losing him his job. Snape may have eased off on Harry's punishment out of hope that the Half-Blood Prince's book would not reappear. While the reason is not explained, the analytical reader may want to examine this chapter to determine why Snape's relatively lenient punishment seems in character, despite his earlier antipathy towards Gryffindor house and Harry.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] are happy together, laughing over the circulating rumors about them; for once, everyone talking about Harry actually makes him happy. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] seem to be growing closer as well, and Harry's concerns that his and Ginny's relationship could affect his friendship with Ron have largely evaporated.

Harry dares not enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] to recover his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] textbook, worried that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] might confiscate it. As a result, his Potions work is suffering, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] attributes this to his relationship with Ginny. Hermione, meanwhile, theorizes about the 'Half-Blood Prince'. A write-up she found about a former Hogwarts student named Eileen Prince, suggests that if she was a half-blood, she could have been the &quot;Prince&quot;. 

When Harry is summoned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s office, he encounters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] sprawled on the hallway floor, outside the Room of Requirement. She admits to using the Room of Requirement to hide her sherry stock, but she is unable to get in. Harry thinks the 'whooping' she heard from within is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] finally finishing his task. When Trelawney called out in the darkness to see who was there, she was pushed out into the hall. Harry suggests she tell Dumbledore. Trelawney accompanies him, and along the way, she recounts the evening that Dumbledore hired her. When she mentions that Severus Snape had interrupted their interview, Harry realizes that he was the one who passed the prophecy to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], resulting in his parents' deaths. 

After a fiery exchange with Harry about Trelawney's revelation, Dumbledore simply states he has reason to trust Snape, despite Snape's skills at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]]. Dumbledore has located another [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], and if Harry wishes to accompany him to retrieve it, he must follow Dumbledore's instructions explicitly. Harry promises, and Dumbledore orders him to fetch his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and meet him in the Entrance Hall.

Before leaving the castle, Harry gives Ron and Hermione his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] and the phial of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]], believing there could be some imminent danger now that Draco has finished his task. Harry tells Ron, Hermione, and Ginny to use Felix to protect themselves, and wants [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] to guard the Room of Requirement and also Snape.

Dumbledore and Harry, who is covered by his Cloak, head to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. They pass [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]] and go on towards the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]]; they [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparate]] before reaching it.

== Analysis ==

Harry and Ginny are happy, finally realizing they were meant to be together. However, their happiness may be short-lived:  the book's mood is rapidly becoming markedly darker, especially when Harry learns it was Snape who betrayed his parents. Also, Harry knows that whatever task Draco has been working on appears to be completed. Just what this task is and how it will affect Hogwarts is still unknown, and Harry is exceedingly frustrated that his warnings about Draco's suspicious activities have been repeatedly ignored by Ron and Hermione, and apparently also by Dumbledore. However, it is actually unlikely that Dumbledore ever ignored Harry's warnings, and he likely knows what has been happening within his own school. Harry fails to realize that a Headmaster is unable to divulge sensitive information to a student, even Harry. There have been hints that Dumbledore assigned Snape to investigate Draco's suspicious behavior. And while Harry continues to suspect Snape, Dumbledore reiterates his complete trust in him.

Many story lines in this book are rapidly coming to a peak in this chapter. It was Trelawney's prophecy that was conveyed to Voldemort, while Draco has apparently completed a major portion of his mission. Also, Dumbledore is preparing to leave the school with Harry to hunt down another Horcrux. Because Draco's task has apparently reached this point, Harry fears that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]] guards patrolling are now insufficient. They are only guarding the school's perimeter and the known entrances into Hogwarts; Harry suspects the threat is Draco, and also Snape, from inside the Room of Requirement. His instructions to Ron and Hermione are based on that suspicion.

At least one reader has commented that Madam Rosmerta is acting out-of-character in this chapter when she is seen tossing out an unruly customer:  we have been led to believe that she generally runs an orderly pub, and should not have to resort to physically ejecting wizards, and yet she is seen doing exactly that. Of course, we have never been in Hogsmeade during the evening, so we have no idea what generally goes on then.

We have the clue needed to determine why Harry was unable to enter the Room of Requirement while Draco was working in there, and Harry has the option of going in and finding out what Draco has been doing. Trelawney reveals she was hiding her sherry in the Room, which was in the same warehouse form as when Draco was using it. We can guess that the invocation, &quot;I need some place to hide my sherry,&quot; caused the junk warehouse to appear, which was the same form as when Harry hid his Potions book there in the previous chapter. It is likely that whatever Draco is working on is inside that warehouse. The other revelations that Trelawney revealed, however, are profound enough that he, and we, failed to notice this clue. 

It is interesting to note that after this book's publication and before ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' was released, many &quot;good Snape&quot; theorists based their opinions on Professor Trelawney's identifying Professor Snape as the intruder the night she gave the prophecy. Since we know from Chapter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 16|16: Professor Trelawney's Prediction]] in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' that Trelawney is oblivious to her surroundings while experiencing a true prophecy, she could only have seen Snape before or after she related the prophecy to Dumbledore.  This contradicts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|Dumbledore's story]] that the intruder (Snape) only heard the prophecy's first half before being ejected from the Hog's Head Inn.  Furthermore, since we know from Voldemort's actions in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' that Snape only heard the prophecy's first half, many people assume that Snape either heard the entire prophecy or none, and either way, only reported as much of it to Voldemort as Dumbledore ordered him to.  This would certainly go a long way towards explaining why Dumbledore trusts Snape. However, it is also necessary to remember that in both instances, Trelawney repeated the prophecy's beginning. Therefore, the prophecy's critical part was the middle. If Snape heard only the end, and relayed that to Voldemort, that would be the same as carrying only the beginning.

Later information leads us to believe that Snape was Voldemort's ally, but after sharing the prophecy's content, he was revolted by how Voldemort utilized this information. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] it is learned that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] was Snape's great unrequited love, and so when Voldemort determined that the prophecy meant that she and her child (Harry) must die, Snape was effectively lost to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]].

Snape's memories in that chapter suggested that Dumbledore never ignored Harry's information about Draco and Snape; his response to Harry was always, &quot;Put that out of your mind.&quot; Literally, he was saying that this was not Harry's concern, not that it was unimportant. In Snape's memories, Dumbledore already knew about Draco's mission before Snape told him, and before this book had even opened, though we never know how he learned this. (Dumbledore and Snape talk of Draco's mission when Snape has just finished containing the curse which killed Dumbledore's hand; and the damage to his hand is alluded to in chapters 2 and 3 of the book.) So Dumbledore's response to Harry's information is more along the lines of, &quot;I already know all about this, and you should not concern yourself with it.&quot; Dumbledore had said previously that he is an old man, and old men tend to forget how young men think and feel. Perhaps dismissing Harry's concerns this way is another case of this forgetfulness?

Hermione's belief that Eileen Prince could have been the Half-Blood Prince is incorrect, but her theory is actually closer to being accurate than she, or anyone, realizes.

Madam Rosmerta's greeting Dumbledore in passing is more important than it seems. We shortly discover that she is under Draco Malfoy's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|control]], which may account for her uncharacteristic aggressive behavior when she ejects a customer from her establishment. It was because she was under Draco's control that she sent the poisoned mead and the cursed necklace to the school, in an attempt to kill Dumbledore. Tonight, when Rosmerta sees that Dumbledore has left Hogwarts, she notifies Draco, who uses this opportunity to allow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] into the school through the Vanishing Cabinet.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] himself and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to the foot of a seaside cliff. This is where the young  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle]] led two younger orphans on a horrifying outing. As Dumbledore and Harry approach the cliff, Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Lumos|illuminates]] his wand, revealing a fissure that he and Harry swim to.

Inside they find a sea cave, but it is only an antechamber; their actual destination lies further ahead. Dumbledore finds a slit in the cave's wall, but it does not open. Divining its secret, Dumbledore cuts his arm and sheds blood on the rock, explaining that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] likely prefers to weaken those seeking his artifacts. An opening appears, and inside is an underground lake with a strange green glow in its center. As Dumbledore searches for something, he cautions Harry against touching the water. When Harry suggests [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning]] the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] Dumbldore urges him to try. Far out in the lake, something large jumps, intercepting Harry's spell. Dumbledore says that is likely what they will have to face in order to retrieve the Horcrux.

Dumbledore summons a submerged chain and reels in a tiny boat that has surfaced. Harry and Dumbledore climb in, and the boat propels itself towards a small island. Harry, peering into the water, sees dead bodies floating beneath the dark surface. Dumbledore assures him that as long as the bodies are merely floating, there is no danger, they will avoid light and warmth. 

On the island is a basin filled with green glowing liquid. Presumably the Horcrux is immersed within. Dumbledore determines that he must drink the substance to uncover the locket and makes Harry promise to force him to finish every drop. He produces a goblet and begins drinking. As he progresses, the potion appears to cause intense pain, and, in delirious agony, Dumbledore begs Harry to kill him. When he suddenly collapses, Harry persists in refilling the goblet and forcing Dumbledore to drink it all. Dumbledore finishes it and, to Harry's horror, lapses into temporary unconsciousness. Recovering, and seeming weak and thirsty, Dumbledore requests water. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Aguamenti|conjures]] water, but it vanishes as soon as he gives it to Dumbledore. When Harry is forced to draw water from the lake, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]] (the corpses floating beneath the surface, now animated) emerge and attempt to drag Harry into the lake. Harry tries fending them off, but finds himself outnumbered and overpowered. Dumbledore recovers enough to surround them with magical fire, driving the Inferi back into the water. After collecting the locket, he and Harry climb into the boat. The Inferi, dully, lose interest in Harry and Dumbledore, who return to the lake shore. Harry leads the weakened Dumbledore from the cave.

== Analysis ==

The only explanation we ever receive for Dumbledore asking Harry to accompany him on his mission to retrieve the Horcrux is that Harry &quot;has earned that right,&quot; through his recovery of the memory from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. It was actually critical that Harry go with Dumbledore, not only for his magical abilities, but also for his incomplete mastery of them. Dumbledore believes Voldemort charmed the boat to carry only one adult wizard at a time; it cannot be summoned to and from the island with magic while it is empty - a passenger must be in it. However, two people are needed to retrieve the locket from the basin. Harry is underage and small, so his presence in the boat goes undetected. If Dumbledore did not know this before he actually entered the cave, it is then fortuitous that he brought Harry with him.

It is a measure of Dumbledore's character that he deliberately undertakes the mission's hardest part. He refuses Harry's offer to provide the blood that opens the portal, and chooses to drink the unknown potion himself, rather than subjecting Harry to it.

=== Review ===
# What was the green liquid that Dumbledore drank?
# Why would Dumbledore ask a still-unqualified student to accompany him on such a dangerous mission?
# Why did Dumbledore wish Harry to kill him?

=== Further Study ===
# If, when Harry used ''Aguamenti'' to pour water into the goblet, it did not work, why didn't he simply attempt spraying a small quantity of water into Dumbledore's own mouth? He has seen Inferi in the lake, and, even if he doesn't know what exactly that means, he is frightened by it; why would he want to touch the water in the lake?
# We learned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 13|earlier in this book]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] had taken two of his fellow orphans to a cave on a seaside trip, and they had never been the same after. We now learn that this is the same cave. Why would Riddle have brought the two orphans here?

As mentioned, it takes two to recover the Horcrux, and one must be small and an unqualified wizard. It will soon be learned that Harry and Dumbledore are not the only ones who overcame this obstacle: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] had been used by the Dark Lord for the same purpose, and had returned to his master afterwards, and Kreacher and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|his master]] had then also made the same trip.

The way this Horcrux was retrieved clearly indicates that Voldemort's power has limits, and demonstrates how his blindness to those limitations ultimately results in his defeat. This pattern is repeated throughout the series. In this case, Voldemort believes that his hiding place is impenetrable because he concealed his past history, forgetting that it was Dumbledore who retrieved him from the orphanage and that he probably knew about Tom's behavior at the orphanage. It is also apparent to us now that Dumbledore is familiar enough with Tom Riddle's thought patterns, that he is able to deduce how Tom conceals and protects his valuables. That the real Horcrux itself is gone is another piece of the same pattern; Voldemort, having protected his hiding place against wizards, discounts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves']] magical abilities, and never considers Kreacher's knowledge about the cave to be an issue. Kreacher, of course, was unhindered by the anti-Apparition spells placed on the cave, and could return home after Voldemort left him for dead. This allowed Kreacher's master to learn about the Horcrux and to take steps against it.

It is worth noting Dumbledore's comment that Harry is more valuable than he is himself. Dumbledore now knows his time on Earth is very nearly done; it has been some eleven months since he was cursed by the Peverell ring, and Snape had given him no more than a year to live at that time. His time is even shorter than he can predict, as his death at Snape's hand is now only hours away. However, whether it is because of his own impending demise, or as a more general statement, we cannot be certain. 

Compare Harry's feelings of &quot;revulsion&quot; and &quot;self-hatred&quot; as he forced Dumbledore to drink the potion, to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]] expression as he performs the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Avada Kedavra]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|the next chapter]]. Both Harry and Snape have been forced, by promises they have made to Dumbledore, to inflict harm on him. While Harry has accepted Dumbledore's promise out of love, it is uncertain what Snape feels for Dumbledore; we will discover later why Snape does Dumbledore's bidding, but not what his true feelings are. We will see in the next book that Snape continues to do Dumbledore's bidding even past his death, which suggests strongly that Snape did have some feelings for Dumbledore.

As Dumbledore drinks the potion, we briefly glimpse what may be his worst fear: his loved ones, which it will eventually be learned are his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|brother]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|sister]], suffering on his account.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] a weakened [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. Collapsing, Dumbledore tells Harry to get him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] runs up, reporting that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] is floating over Hogwarts. She lends them [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|brooms]], and they fly to the Astronomy Tower, with Dumbledore mumbling incantations to allow them through Hogwarts' protective spells. Harry fears for his friends' lives.

As they land atop the tower, Dumbledore orders Harry to fetch Snape, but hearing footsteps in the stairwell, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|petrifies]] Harry under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] bursts through the door and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Disarms]] Dumbledore. Draco reveals that his task is to murder Dumbledore, and that he has helped the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] invade [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] via a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]] that he repaired. Draco also used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] on Madame Rosmerta, forcing her to poison the bottle of mead and to send the deadly necklace to the school. 

Malfoy seems reluctant to kill Dumbledore, but believes he has no other choice, as his and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|his mother's]] lives are at forfeit should he fail. Dumbledore calmly reasons with the frightened and conscience-stricken boy to abandon his mission, promising protection from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Malfoy falters, apparently considering Dumbledore's offer. As he lowers his wand, four Death Eaters arrive: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], and one other. Despite their taunts spurring on Draco, he is unable to kill Dumbledore. Harry, still immobilized under his Cloak, can hear the Hogwarts defenders yelling below as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] suddenly appears on the scene. When Dumbledore calls out his name almost pleadingly, Snape, revulsion and horror on his face, casts the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]] directly at him, hurling Dumbledore's lifeless body over the parapet and to the ground below, Harry watching in frozen, silent terror.

== Analysis ==

Perhaps the greatest mystery in the entire series is, did Snape actually murder Dumbledore or was there a prearranged plan? Evidence supports either conclusion, and despite Dumbledore's unwavering trust in Snape, his loyalty remains questionable to Harry and readers. Regardless, it appears that Snape had little choice; he must either kill Albus Dumbledore or die, since he is bound by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] to protect Draco Malfoy and complete his mission should Draco fail. Though many readers may believe that if Snape was truly loyal to Dumbledore, then he should have willingly sacrificed himself to protect him and Harry, yet he does not. It is possible that Snape and Dumbledore were communicating with each other using Legilimency, and Dumbledore's pleas may represent a request for Snape to sacrifice him to protect Harry and allow Snape to remain in the Dark Lord's favor, implying that Snape might play a key role if Harry is to destroy the Dark Lord. These speculations, and whether or not Dumbledore was actually dead, were hotly debated by readers until the seventh and final Harry Potter book was released.

Whenever the Avada Kedavra curse has previously been seen, the victim merely collapsed and died. Yet in this instance, Dumbledore is hurled into the air and spun around before falling dead to the ground. This was cited as evidence that Snape's curse was not actually the killing curse, but something else; it was suggested that he had spoken the ''Avada Kedavra'' incantation, but had actually voicelessly cast something like ''Expelliarmus'', to make it appear that Dumbledore was dead but sparing his life. 

Snape's killing Dumbledore may not actually be ''murder''. That is, there may have been a prearranged agreement that Snape would kill the Headmaster if events deemed it necessary to protect the Order's and Harry's missions. Indeed, during their confrontation on the Astronomy Tower, Dumbledore is almost pleading with a conflicted Snape to curse him. In a previous conversation between them, Snape was overheard telling Dumbledore that he would refuse to do something, to which Dumbledore insisted he must follow through. This may have been a reference to Snape's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] that would require him to kill Dumbledore if Draco failed. 

Voldemort himself may have unintentionally prevented Dumbledore's death. When Dumbledore drinks the potion in the cave, he says it will not immediately kill him, because Voldemort would want to keep whoever stole the locket alive long enough to learn how he was able to penetrate the Dark Lord's defenses. Is it possible that the potion protected Dumbledore from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Avada Kedavra]] curse, keeping him in a deathlike state? If this were true, there may be an antidote to the potion's poisonous effects, and which could be why Dumbledore wanted Harry to fetch Snape rather than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], when they returned to Hogwarts. 

Countering these speculations is the author's assertion in an interview after the sixth book's release that Dumbledore is &quot;definitely dead.&quot; And though Rowling has often planted &quot;red herrings&quot; in the storyline, she has never been prone to outright deception by issuing false statements to her fans. The Headmasters do live on, in a fashion, within their portraits, interacting with people and retaining the headmasters' memories. Should Dumbledore's portrait appear in the Headmaster's office, to join the other portraits there, it should be able to speak with Harry and provide information regarding unresolved events. Additionally, Dumbledore will also have stored memories in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], which Harry may be able to access.

In previous books, Rowling included a particular character who demonstrated suspicious behavior (e.g. the implication that Snape was trying to steal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|book 1]]), before revealing it was actually someone else (e.g. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Quirrell]] was attempting to obtain the Philosopher's Stone). Given her tendency to plant red herrings, it is impossible to say conclusively where Snape's loyalty lies. His actions have been such that he has been useful to both sides, and he has done nothing that would force him to choose one over the other.

Dumbledore seems either to have been intending to die or was taking a tremendous gamble. The Death Eaters were able to quickly conjure an impenetrable barrier on the stairway, which begs the question why Dumbledore did not react similarly after hearing footsteps on the Astronomy Tower staircase. This would have allowed both Harry and himself an opportunity to escape, but instead he chose to incapacitate Harry, preventing him from intervening and allowing himself to be disarmed by Draco Malfoy, an unqualified wizard. He was either expecting (or planning) to be killed by either Draco or Snape, or he hoped to turn Malfoy over to his side. Dumbledore's already seemingly weakened condition, followed by the events in the sea cave, may have left him extremely vulnerable, resulting in his failure to defend himself and Harry against this attack.

Nothing is mentioned in this chapter about what happened to Dumbledore's wand after Draco sent it over the tower parapet. However, it is revealed in book seven that the wand was interred with Dumbledore's corpse, and it becomes an important plot element in the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort.

Dumbledore's death was, we discover [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|later]], premeditated by both himself and Snape; Snape was charged to kill him at an appropriate time to spare Malfoy from completing Voldemort's task, thus saving Draco's soul, which would be forever damaged by committing murder. Dumbledore was slowly dying from a deadly curse that was inflicted when he put on the now-destroyed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] (Gaunt's ring). Wishing to die by his own design, to spare Draco's soul, and to retain the dignity that Death Eaters such as Fenrir Greyback or Bellatrix Lestrange would have denied him, Dumbledore tasked Snape with his death. The potion Dumbledore drank in the cave had left him too weak to defend himself. His final plea to Snape was not to spare him, as Harry naturally believed, but to carry out his final wish, which Snape reluctantly executed.

It is never explained why Dumbledore allows a Cloaked Harry to witness his death. We can only guess at his motives, though the circumstances may have prevented him from making another choice. Dumbledore, who has known that his death is impending, fully expects that either Draco or a Death Eater is on their way up the tower. Dumbledore has stated that Harry is far more valuable than he is himself, and so his primary purpose is to protect Harry and keep him out of the battle. Dumbledore knows Harry will defend him and would be over matched by the invading Death Eaters, so he disables Harry. Whether Dumbledore deliberately chose the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|freeze spell]] that would immediately free Harry upon Dumbledore's death, must remain unknown. The nature of the spell, Harry's witnessing the events atop the tower, and his immediately being released from the spell's effects, is clearly necessary from the author's viewpoint. Our protagonist must see these events at the book's climax.

As a side note, the unnamed fourth Death Eater present at Dumbledore's death, is later identified as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]]. Yaxley, a Death Eater in Voldemort's old organization, will play a moderately significant role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] forces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] back down the tower stairwell, followed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], released from the paralyzing spell by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s death, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrifies]] the last one and charges down the steps after the others. At the bottom is a melée of Hogwarts students, teachers, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] members fighting Death Eaters. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] is dueling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]]. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Impedimenta|Jinxes]] Amycus, as Snape and the other Death Eaters break away and run. 

At the the front entrance, Harry sees a Death Eater on the grounds, Snape and Draco further away. The large blond Death Eater casts multiple curses at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], but his massive body deflects them. Harry hurls the Prince's spells at Snape, but Snape easily blocks every one, proclaiming he created them&amp;mdash;''he'' is the Half-Blood Prince. Although Snape blocks every curse Harry casts, he does nothing to harm him and continually tells him what he is doing wrong. Snape prevents the other Death Eaters from attacking Harry, claiming he belongs to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Harry calls Snape a coward. Enraged, Snape jinxes Harry before escaping with Draco and the other Death Eaters.

Seeing that Hagrid's hut is afire, Harry, finding his dropped wand, helps [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Aguamenti|douse]] the flames. Hagrid cannot believe that Dumbledore is dead, but as he and Harry approach a huddled crowd, Dumbledore's twisted corpse is seen lying on the ground. Harry takes the locket that has fallen out from the old wizard's robe pocket. Inside is a note reading:  

:''To the Dark Lord''
:''I know I will be dead long before you read this''
:''but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.''
:''I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.''
:''I face death in the hope that when you meet your match,''
:''you will be mortal once more.''
:''R.A.B.''

== Analysis ==

Harry chases Snape in a blind rage and with one intent: to kill him. Snape, who easily eludes him, has every opportunity to murder or capture the outmatched Harry. Instead, he merely deflects Harry's ineffective curses. Snape continually does nothing to harm Harry, and actually tells him what he is doing wrong and how to correct it. He also prevents the other Death Eaters from cursing him. Why?  Although he claims he wants Harry left alive for the Dark Lord, he could easily have stunned and presented him to Voldemort. By leaving Harry at Hogwarts, Snape not only risks having the determined and vengeful Harry single-mindedly hunting him down, but also the Dark Lord's deadly wrath by letting his number one enemy remain alive and free. For Harry, learning that his admired mentor (the Half-Blood Prince) is actually his hated nemesis is shocking and revolting.

It is interesting to note Snape's enraged reaction when Harry calls him a coward, even though murdering the unarmed Dumbledore is an extremely cowardly act, as was his subsequent running away. One must wonder if there is something beyond what Snape has actually done, some way in which Snape can still see himself as honourable and living up to some form of standard.

Harry learns that someone with the initials R.A.B. stole the true Horcrux from the sea cave. However, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|that chapter]], it was learned that two people were needed to recover the locket from the basin on the island. R.A.B. must have had some assistance. Although R.A.B. is probably dead, ''if'' someone else was involved, it is possible he or she may still be alive and could provide valuable information. It also appears that R.A.B. may have known about the prophecy, as that person refers to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] meeting his match. However, it also seems that R.A.B. may have mistakenly believed that the locket was the only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], as he seems to assume that destroying it will be sufficient to make Voldemort mortal once more.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In the final book, it is revealed that &quot;R.A.B.&quot; are the initials of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]] ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]]' brother). Regulus' middle name is &quot;Arcturus,&quot; a name appearing on the Black Family tree. The person who stole the Horcrux had to be someone close to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], most likely a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], which Regulus Black was. It is usually, although not exclusively, Death Eaters who refer to Voldemort as the Dark Lord. Our understanding of the timing leads us to believe that Regulus cannot have been aware of the prophecy, as it likely had not yet been made.

It was believed that Regulus had gotten into Voldemort's hierarchy, and not liking what he found, wanted out, but had been killed. This is not what actually happened. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] will know more about it, as he was involved; it is noted in the Analysis that it would have taken two people to remove and replace the locket, and that will turn out to have been Regulus and Kreacher. Regulus decided that he wanted out, but rather than simply leaving (and being killed), he had decided to make his death count for something. Having learned of the existence of a Horcrux, and having determined, from Kreacher, where something valuable was hidden, Regulus determined to destroy what he believed was Voldemort's only Horcrux.

Snape is this book's titular Half-Blood Prince, and the textbook that Harry used so successfully was originally Snape's. The book was fifty years old when Harry looked at it, which seemed to rule out his father owning it, as well as Snape. However, it is learned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|later]] that Snape comes from a poverty-stricken household, and likely had second-hand textbooks. From seeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]'s books [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|in her first year]], we know used books are available, and so it is entirely possible that the young Snape would have them. Quite possibly, having to use a text that was already a quarter century old, would have increased his dislike of the more-privileged students.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 6|the previous year]], as Sirius, Harry, and the Weasleys sorted through the various family heirlooms at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|12 Grimmauld Place]], the Black family home, ''a heavy locket that none of them can open'' is tossed aside. Unknown to anyone, Kreacher saved the locket, keeping it hidden in his cupboard, though it will be stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], and then extorted from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. It will turn out to be the Horcrux locket, once belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], and can only be opened by someone speaking in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|parseltongue]]. That would explain why no one could open the locket, and why Regulus was unable to destroy it as he intended. Since no one suspected the locket was a Horcrux, Harry did not speak Parseltongue to it (although he does so later to destroy it). Voldemort probably did not create the charm that prevented the locket from opening, though he was likely glad that it was difficult as it protected his Horcrux within. Slytherin's descendants were proud of their ability to speak to snakes; it is entirely possible that Slytherin himself, when he created the locket, charmed it to prevent it from opening unless spoken to in Parseltongue.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Over the next few days, some students leave the school with their parents. Others, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]], refuse to go until they have paid their last respects to Dumbledore. Meanwhile, wizards and witches pour into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] to attend the funeral. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] now spend all their time together. They visit the Hospital Wing often. While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] is healed, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] remains under constant care. Apart from being permanently disfigured, the only lasting effect seems to be a preference for very rare steaks.

Hermione's library research has uncovered that Eileen Prince, the likely original owner of Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] text, was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s mother. Prince, &quot;married a Muggle named Tobias Snape and later gave birth to a son, Severus.&quot; Harry is maddened that Snape, unknown and unknowingly, was helping him. He sees a similarity between the half-blood [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and his assumed title, and the Half-Blood Prince and his adopted moniker. How could Dumbledore have missed it? 

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s request, he is laid to rest at Hogwarts in a glorious white tomb overlooking the lake. Many students and the staff attend the funeral, as well as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], who fire arrows into the air in salute.

Harry ends his relationship with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]—for now. Harry realizes that Voldemort attacks him through those he loves—his parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], and Dumbledore. By ending their romance, he hopes to protect Ginny.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]], the Minister for Magic, takes Harry aside to ask for details about the night Dumbledore was killed. Harry refuses to tell him anything, and wants to know whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] has been released yet. Harry reiterates that he is, &quot;Dumbledore's man through and through.&quot; 

Harry tells Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] he is leaving Hogwarts, even if the school remains open. Finding the remaining [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] and killing Voldemort are his only focus now. He intends to visit his parents' former home in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] after a brief stay at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] to fulfill Dumbledore's wish that he remain under his mother's protective charm. Ron and Hermione pledge to join his quest, despite Harry's preference to go it alone. Harry finds comfort in spending one last peaceful day with his friends, and he looks forward to Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding.

== Analysis ==

Unlike the first five books, the story ends with Dumbledore's funeral, rather than the students arriving at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform 9¾]] in King's Cross Station, London on the Hogwarts Express and bidding each other goodbye for the summer. If Harry follows through on his mission, which seems certain, the next book will probably also deviate from the traditional opening with students headed back to school in the fall. In any event, without Dumbledore, Hogwarts will be a far different place. His effect on the school has not only been deeply significant but, as seen by the many magical creatures that attended his funeral, far-reaching. For Harry, Hogwarts has always been a source of comfort and security. Without Dumbledore, it may have been too much for him to return. One thing seems certain&amp;mdash;the Dursleys will probably make an appearance, as Harry must make one last visit to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] to reinforce his mother's protective charm before it expires on his next birthday. This will be the Dursleys' final opportunity to reconcile with Harry, although their mutual loathing is probably too deep to bridge.

Ron and Hermione inform Harry they are joining the Horcrux mission, whether he wants them to or not. Their decision is an affirmation of their love, friendship, and loyalty for their friend. Harry intended to search for the Horcruxes alone, wanting to protect those he cares about, driven by the need to battle Voldemort himself. He has, however, finally accepted that it takes unity, support, and cooperation to defeat evil.

We also see here Harry's unwillingness to ally himself with the Ministry. Harry has correctly determined that the Ministry is more interested in maintaining a good public face, rather than in dealing with Voldemort directly.  

Harry unhappily and regretfully ends his relationship with Ginny to protect her from Voldemort, though she is probably still in grave danger. Harry never mastered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]], and Voldemort could possibly penetrate his mind and see images involving Ginny. It was earlier mentioned, though, that he found being inside Harry's consciousness extremely unpleasant, and he may never attempt this again. This would hardly prevent Voldemort from obtaining information about Harry, and also Ginny, from others who are close to him, and possibly even from Ginny herself.

Snape, Voldemort, and Harry share an important characteristic: they are all half-bloods. Snape, however, apparently grew up connected to the Wizarding world, unlike Harry and Voldemort, though his home life was certainly just as unpleasant. As much as Harry always disliked and resented Snape, he is now driven solely by hatred and vengeance. This vigilante desire to avenge Dumbledore's death has clouded Harry's judgment; rather than seeking justice, Harry is consumed with inflicting revenge. This could jeopardize his mission to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. Harry will need to control his extreme emotions if he is to succeed. 

It is also an unpleasant irony for Harry that his least favorite and most ineffective teacher (Snape) is also an admired and influential mentor (the Half-Blood Prince), someone who inspired him and from whom he has learned so much. This conflict will continue to affect Harry.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry ends his and Ginny's relationship to protect her from Voldemort. This actually is a bad decision. Saying that a relationship is over does not end it, and even if Harry no longer had romantic feelings for Ginny, he would still care about her as a friend. Their relationship, however brief, actually puts her in more danger, as Voldemort, if he is monitoring matters as closely as we believe, probably knows about the attachment and will likely attempt to use it against Harry. Voldemort's using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] against Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] was greatly assisted by poor communication between Harry and Sirius. If Harry wants to protect Ginny, his best course is to keep her at his side throughout his travels. Fortunately, this never become a problem; though Ginny returns to Hogwarts for her sixth year while Harry wanders England hunting Horcruxes, Voldemort attacks Hogwarts only at the book's conclusion, and Ginny handles herself quite well. We also learn that Ginny and Harry marry, finally.

As the book ends, it is unclear if Dumbledore was truly dead or merely in some deathlike state. This led to much speculation among readers as to whether or not he would return in some form in book 7. Voldemort is not the only one who knows how to create Horcruxes, though Dumbledore would never result to murder to create one. It is always possible that there are other magical means for a resurrection in Book 7. There were certainly many clues that he could return. Dumbledore was acting uncharacteristically when he pleaded with Snape just before he killed him. Was Dumbledore begging for his life or asking Snape to strike him according to some prearranged plan? Readers noticed that the Avada Kedavra curse that Snape used reacted differently than others seen in the series. Also, Dumbledore has always been closely associated with a Phoenix, a bird that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. The smoke from Dumbledore's funeral pyre appeared to have briefly assume a Phoenix form. Whether that symbolized a corporeal resurrection or only a spiritual one, Dumbledore does return in some form in the next book. 

Also, it is unknown where Dumbledore's portrait appeared from or how it was hung in the office. Presumably, no one had entered the office since his death, and yet it is already hanging on the wall when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and Harry arrive there. Portraits may magically appear when a headmaster or headmistress dies. It is also unclear how closely associated portraits are with those they represent. They may merely be talking autobiographies of their subjects, or they may retain their essence, including the ability to develop mentally and/or gain new insights. Later evidence does suggest that portraits remain able to think and reason, as it seems that Dumbledore's portrait continues advising Snape and Harry.

J. K. Rowling had stated, following this book's publication, that Dumbledore was definitely dead, though readers may still hope for a resurrection; while we do see him again, it is now known that he is definitely not resurrected.</text>

{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] leads a grief-stricken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to the Hospital Wing where everyone has gathered. Harry, remembering the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]], fearfully asks who is dead. Surprisingly, only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] and a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] have been killed. The &quot;body&quot; Harry fell over was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]], who was savagely mauled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]]. Bill will survive, but is permanently disfigured, and the long-term effects are unknown. Because Fenrir was not transformed at the time, Bill probably escaped being infected as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were protected during the battle because they took [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]]. 

While Harry and Dumbledore were away, the Death Eaters appeared when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], Lupin, and Bill were on patrol. Ron says that he, Ginny, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] were watching the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] appeared, carrying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hand of Glory|Hand of Glory]]. Draco threw [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|something]] into the corridor, darkening it, and blinding Ron, Ginny, and Neville so they were unable to Jinx the people they heard running past. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] found the Death Eaters at the Astronomy Tower while Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] had gone to Snape's office. Confused sounds were heard from within, then Snape emerged, saying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] had fallen inside and to help him.

During the battle, Draco disappeared, apparently going up the Astronomy tower. Four Death Eaters followed, casting a barrier behind them, with one Death Eater firing curses in all directions. Then Snape arrived and went through the barrier, returning soon with Draco, passing unheeded through the fighting.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] arrive. Fleur becomes angry when Mrs. Weasley suggests she will want to cancel the engagement because Bill is scarred. Fleur's declaration that she still loves Bill bonds her with Mrs. Weasley. Tonks reveals she loves Remus Lupin who, because he is a Werewolf and older, had discouraged her attachment. Harry suddenly realizes that Tonks' new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] is a wolf. Lupin is still reluctant, but Mr. Weasley points out that the future is always uncertain.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] reports that he moved Dumbledore's body, the students are back in bed, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] has been alerted. Professor McGonagall takes over as interim Headmistress and calls a meeting with the House Heads plus Hagrid. McGonagall first meets with Harry in the Headmaster's office, where Dumbledore's sleeping portrait now hangs among the other past headmasters. Harry, still honoring Dumbledore's wishes, refuses to say what happened after he and Dumbledore left the school, though he has told McGonagall about Snape revealing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy's]] contents to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]; Dumbledore said he trusted Snape because he claimed he was remorseful. Harry also warns McGonagall that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] is under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. The House Heads arrive, and all agree Hogwarts will remain open and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] should head [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin House]]; the Governors will make the final decision. It is also unanimously agreed to honour Dumbledore's wish to be laid to rest at the school.

Hearing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]] is just arriving with a delegation, Harry, wanting to avoid questions, heads to Gryffindor tower. Thankfully, only Ron is in their dormitory. Harry tells him that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] was a fake; the real one was stolen. Ron reads the note. Harry says he has no idea who R.A.B. is.

== Analysis ==

Whether or not Dumbledore is really dead was endlessly debated by fans. The author left many hints that Dumbledore may still be alive or will return in some manner - either physically or spiritually. His portrait in the Headmaster's office &quot;appears&quot; to be sleeping. It is possible it is not a real portrait, but only imitating those of other former Headmasters and Headmistresses as a ruse to deceive enemies. If, however, the portrait starts interacting in a similar manner as the others, this would be some proof that Dumbledore is actually dead. 

That Dumbledore's animal familiar is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]] is unlikely a coincidence. A Phoenix dies by bursting into flames and is reborn from its own ashes. This could be symbolic that Dumbledore may experience a similar resurrection. Phoenix tears are healing, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes']] lament was heard as he soared over his ''master's'' body, though we never see any tears falling, and it has never been said they can resurrect the dead.

On a completely separate subject, the author makes several statements on the nature of love and relationships in this chapter.

First, we again see the romance between Harry and Ginny. When Hagrid tells Harry that he must leave Dumbledore's body, Harry does not move; it is only when Ginny leads him away that Harry moves. Also, in the Hospital Wing, Ginny stays next to Harry, possibly to give him comfort if he needs it, possibly to receive some from him herself. He stays by her side until Professor McGonagall summons him to the headmaster's office.

A previously unsuspected strength in Fleur is seen. To date she has seemed very self-centered, as well as being somewhat weak in witchcraft, despite having been named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] Champion in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|the fourth book of the series]]. Her willingness to take on Bill's care is totally unexpected, both by Mrs. Weasley and by us, and shows a previously unseen aspect of Fleur.

Additionally, Tonks' ongoing depression over her unrequited love for Lupin is finally resolved. The catalyst here is Mr. Weasley pointing out that times are always hard, with the implication that if their race had waited for a guaranteed good time to raise children, it probably would have died out. Love's power to overcome adversity is highlighted here by Lupin's finally accepting Tonks affections.

It is uncertain whether Hogwarts will be re-opened next year. McGonagall states that decision will be left to the governors. Many readers assume that McGonagall will be Headmistress if the school does continue, but that decision is also one that will be made by the governors.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The speculation surrounding Dumbledore's death was ended when the seventh and final book was published. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|It]] revealed that Dumbledore had been cursed by the Peverell ring, which had been cursed to protect the Horcrux it contained. Despite Snape's best efforts to contain it, the curse left Dumbledore with about a year to live. Dumbledore, knowing that Voldemort tasked Draco Malfoy with murdering him, also knew that Draco would likely be reluctant, subjecting him to constant torment from Voldemort's Death Eaters to comply. Dumbledore had exacted Snape's promise that Snape would undertake this task, so as to spare Draco's soul and allow Dumbledore to retain some dignity in his death.

Also, it hardly seems surprising that Dumbledore would wish to be entombed at Hogwarts. It was his beloved home for many years. However, in ''Deathly Hallows'' it is learned that his mother and sister, who both died tragically, and who he loved dearly, are buried in Godric's Hollow, and in the same cemetery as James and Lily Potter. Upon this revelation, it then seems rather odd that Dumbledore would request to be laid to rest alone, apart from those closest to him, and perhaps where Harry may eventually be buried (to be near his parents). There is never any explanation given for Dumbledore's choice, though many secrets about his past will be uncovered in the next book, revealing much about his character and motives, and providing us a few clues, but no definitive answers, as to why this is where he requested to be interred.  

When Harry tells McGonagall his theory about why Dumbledore trusted Snape, she will seem taken aback, as if wondering why such loyalty could be commanded by a relatively small act. The reader is also somewhat surprised that it is believed Dumbledore could give his trust based on a simple remorseful statement. However, the final book reveals that there was more behind this. Lily Evans, Harry's mother, was Snape's one great, though unrequited, love. Snape was devastated by the threat against her, and promised &quot;''anything''&quot; in return for Dumbledore protecting her and her family. This revelation, near the last book's conclusion, finally explains Dumbledore's trust.

While the school does re-open for Harry's seventh year, Harry does not attend. Dumbledore's mission is far more important to him than formal schooling, and instead he elects to pursue it rather than returning to Hogwarts. Events will show that this is the correct decision, as the school will become an unhealthy place for him, and many other students, to be, under its auspicious new Headmaster and teachers.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I know I should edit this page instead of complain about it, but I don't have time right now.

The whole triplet explanation of jazz phrasing is a very classical way to approach it.  If you listen to jazz even in the 30s but certainly 40s and after, it is not really triplet eights, especially as the tempos get faster.  Rather, the offbeat notes are accented.  You can play notes totally straight, but if you accent (e.g., tongue on trumpet) off the beat, you will be getting there.

:Hoo-ee. Well, at least there's a lot of work to do. Yes. The explanation of swing was the first thing that caught my eye. Don't worry, there are better educators out there who are more familiar with how these things work. I don't want Wikibooks to not have a damn good book on one of the truest American art forms. (Until I actually get to editing the articles: What &quot;swing&quot; denotes is an organisation of rhythms which can mean different things in different contexts - e.g., Latin jazz has a different kind of swing that is completely unrelated to &quot;swing&quot; music. The &quot;staggered triplet&quot; myth is one that must be dispelled; it's not jazz, and it's not helpful to understanding jazz.) To the buzcave! [[User:Buzgun|this raven is icy]] ([[User talk:Buzgun|talk]]) 07:38, 15 May 2009 (UTC)

Also, Dave Brubeck's appearance as one of the first jazz artists mentioned is another classical music lover tip-off, since he was very palatable to that crowd.

Anyway, there are more important properties of jazz that the way eight notes were phrased.  Call and response is good (which is present).  Heavy blues influence, especially 12-bar blues.  Emphasis on improvisation and improvised solos.

where did you come up with this &quot; Jazz is very widely known as the only art form to have originated in the United States&quot;


---
art form as &quot;art music,&quot; as opposed to &quot;low&quot; or &quot;folk music&quot;... its a poor word choice, but is considered legit. If you are looking at it from a &quot;classical&quot; perspective, which is the easiest, if not most correct, way to look at jazz, it is the most &quot;arty&quot; music from the US, blues being a folk style and rock being a commercial style.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Using a floppy disk =
Knoppix supports all standard 1.44 Mb floppy drives. If you have an Imation LS120 SuperDisk drive, see the later section. The SuperDisk drive is not a standard 1.44 Mb floppy drive; it works quite differently. To copy files [[w:onto a 3.5” floppy|onto a 3.5” floppy]] drive:
#Check the write-protect tab on the floppy disk. Make sure the tab is in the closed (write enabled) position.
#Insert the floppy disk into the drive.
#Click once on the “Floppy Disk” icon on the Desktop.
#The files on the floppy will be displayed.
#Drag and drop files and folders to be copied into the floppy disk window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The files will be copied.
#Wait until the floppy drive's “busy” light goes out.
#Close the floppy disk window.
#It is now safe to remove the floppy disk from the drive.
 '''Note'''
 Unmounting a 3.5&quot; floppy disk is done for you automatically.
 There is no need to “Change read-write mode”, because the read-write tab on the
 floppy disk itself controls whether it is ''writable'' or not.
== Quick help ==
'''Question: How do I format a 3.5&quot; floppy?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Right-click the “Floppy disk” icon on the Desktop, then click “Format Floppy disk”.

'''Question: I have an Imation SuperDisk floppy drive. Why does clicking on the Floppy icon not do anything?'''&lt;br/&gt;
The Imation SuperDisk is not an ordinary floppy drive. It is treated as a hard disk drive. Follow the instructions in the Imation LS-120 SuperDisk section.

= Using an Iomega Zip disk =
The [[w:Iomega Zip disk drive|Iomega Zip disk drive]] was very popular in the 1990s. It has been somewhat superseded by the CD-RW and the USB flash drive. However, Iomega Zip drives, and their media, are still easy to find and often useful. The usual capacity of Iomega Zip media is 100 or 250 Mb.

There are three varieties of Iomega Zip drive: internal, parallel, and USB. The internal and parallel varieties are older and are no longer made. The USB variety is newer and is still being made today.
 '''Note'''
 Iomega measures its disk capacities in megabytes where 1 megabyte = one million bytes.
 This is less than the conventional definition where 1 megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes.
 Knoppix uses the conventional definition.
 Therefore a “Zip 100” disk has an actual capacity of 98,078 kilobytes according to Knoppix.
== Using an external USB Iomega Zip drive ==
The external USB Iomega Zip drive is available in 100 Mb, 250 Mb and 750 Mb versions. The 750 Mb version also supports USB 2.0 for higher transfer speeds. Knoppix uses its built-in USB Mass Storage driver to support the external USB Iomega Zip drive. To copy files [[w:onto an external USB Iomega Zip drive|onto an external USB Iomega Zip drive]]:
#With the computer turned off, plug the Zip drive into a USB socket.
#Insert a valid PC formatted Zip disk into the drive.
#Start Knoppix, but specify text mode at the command prompt. For example, enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=uk dma 2&lt;/code&gt;
#Knoppix will start up, but then stop before loading KDE.
#Press Enter on the keyboard to wake up the command prompt. Type this command, then press Enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebuildfstab -u knoppix -g knoppix&lt;/code&gt;
#You should see the activity light on the front of the drive come on, and you should hear the drive work.
#Switch to graphics mode with this command:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;init 5&lt;/code&gt;
#After KDE loads, you will see an icon for the Zip drive on the Desktop. Assuming you have no other SCSI drives, the icon will be labelled “Hard disk partition [sda4]”.
#Click the icon for the Zip drive.
#Wait while the device is mounted.
#Wait while the “''Konqueror''” file manager starts up.
#The files on the Zip disk will be displayed.
#Right-click the Zip drive's icon.
#Click “Change read/write mode”.
#Click “Yes”.
#Drag and drop the files and folders to be copied into the Zip disk's window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The files and folders will be copied.
#Close all the Zip disk's open windows.
#Right-click on the Zip drive's icon.
#Click “Unmount”.
#The green triangle will go away.
#It is now possible to take the Zip disk out of the drive.
 '''Note'''
 Hot-plugging the external USB Iomega Zip drive is not supported.
 This means you need to have the drive connected before you start Knoppix.
 You can't plug the Zip drive into the computer when it is already running
 and expect an icon for it to appear, as you can with USB flash drives and
 other USB external hard drives.

== Using an internal IDE Iomega Zip drive ==
The internal IDE Iomega Zip disk drive is like an internal hard drive, but with removable writeable media. Knoppix uses its built-in ATAPI (AT Attachment Packet Interface) driver to support the internal Iomega Zip drive. Typically the maximum disk capacity is 100 Mb. To copy files [[w:onto an internal Iomega Zip drive|onto an internal Iomega Zip drive]]:
#With the computer turned off, insert a PC formatted Zip disk into the Zip drive.
#Start Knoppix in the usual way.
#You will see an icon for the Zip drive on the Desktop. Assuming there are no other SCSI drives in your computer, the icon will be labelled “Hard disk partition [sda4]”.
#Click the icon for the Iomega Zip drive.
#Wait for a moment while the Zip disk is mounted. A green triangle will appear indicating that the drive is in use.
#Wait while the “''Konqueror''” file manager starts up.
#The files on the disk will be displayed.
#Right-click on the icon of the Zip drive.
#Click “Change read/write mode”.
#Click “Yes”.
#Drag and drop the files you want to copy into the Zip drive window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The files will be copied.
#Close the Zip drive's windows.
#Right click on the Zip drive icon.
#Click “Unmount”.
#The green triangle will go away.
#It is now safe to take the Zip disk out of the drive.
== Using a parallel port Iomega Zip drive ==
The external parallel port Iomega Zip disk drive is the oldest kind of Zip drive. It was marketed for its high capacity, speed and portability. It is fully supported in Knoppix. Everything needed to use it is included in Knoppix, however, a “helping hand” is needed. To copy files [[w:onto an external parallel Zip drive|onto an external parallel Zip drive]]:
#With the computer turned off, connect the Zip drive to the computer's parallel (printer) port. Connect the Zip drive to the mains and turn the Zip drive on.
#Insert a valid PC formatted Zip disk into the drive.
#Start Knoppix, but at the boot prompt, specify text mode. For example, enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=uk 2&lt;/code&gt;
#Knoppix will start up and then stop before loading KDE.
#Press Enter on the keyboard to wake up the command prompt.
#The next step is to enable the Iomega parallel Zip drive support. Look at the underside of the drive. The date of manufacture should be printed there. If your drive was made before 31 August 1998, enter this command and press Enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;modprobe ppa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your drive was made after 31 August 1998, type this and press Enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;modprobe imm&lt;/code&gt;
#If successful you will be rewarded with lines like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;imm: Version 2.05 (for Linux 2.4.0)&lt;br/&gt;imm: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 16 bit&lt;br/&gt;imm: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use PS/2&lt;br/&gt;imm: Communication established at 0x378 with ID 6 using PS/2&lt;br/&gt;scsi3 : Iomega VPI2 (imm) interface&lt;br/&gt;  Vendor: IOMEGA    Model: ZIP 250           Rev: K.47&lt;br/&gt;  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02&lt;br/&gt;Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi3, channel 0, id 6, lun 0&lt;br/&gt;SCSI device sdb: 196608 512-byte hdwr sectors (101 MB)&lt;br/&gt;sda: Write Protect is off&lt;br/&gt; sda: sdb4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that the Linux kernel has found the Iomega external drive on the parallel port. In this example, the drive is called “sda”, which means it is the first SCSI drive.
#Type the following command and press Enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebuildfstab -r -u knoppix -g knoppix&lt;/code&gt;
#Finally type this and press Enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;init 5&lt;/code&gt;
#KDE will start up. You will see an icon for the Iomega Zip drive on the Desktop. Assuming you have no other SCSI drives, it will be labelled “Hard disk partition [sda4]”.
#Click the Zip drive icon.
#Wait for a moment while the Zip drive is mounted.
#Wait while the ''Konqueror'' file manager starts up.
#The files on the Zip drive will be displayed.
#Right-click on the Zip drive's icon.
#Click “Change read/write mode”.
#Click “Yes”.
#Drag and drop the files and folders you wish to copy into the Zip drive's window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The dropped items will be copied.
#When you have finished copying, close the Zip drive's windows.
#Right-click the Zip drive icon.
#Click “Unmount”.
#The green triangle on the Zip drive icon will go away.
#It is now safe to take the Zip disk out of the drive.

= Using an Imation LS-120 SuperDisk =
The [[w:Imation LS-120 SuperDisk|Imation LS-120 SuperDisk]] drive crosses laser technology with the floppy disk. “LS” stands for “Laser Servo”. Imation SuperDisk media has a capacity of 120 Mb. The Imation LS-120 SuperDisk was quite popular in the 1990s. For example, many computers made by Gateway came with a SuperDisk drive fitted as standard. Today, the SuperDisk drive is no longer made, but the 120 Mb media is still available.

The SuperDisk drive is an IDE device, like a CD-ROM drive. It does not use the conventional floppy drive interface. However, the SuperDisk drive is backwards compatible with 1.44 Mb floppy disk media.

Knoppix uses its built-in ''AT Attachment Packet Interface'' driver to support the ''SuperDisk'' drive. ''Knoppix'' uses SCSI emulation to treat the ''SuperDisk'' drive as a SCSI device. However, because of the way the drive works, it is not automatically detected so a little “helping hand” is needed. To copy files [[w:onto an Imation LS-120 SuperDisk|onto an Imation LS-120 SuperDisk]] drive:
#Insert an LS-120 disk or conventional floppy disk into the SuperDisk drive.
#Start Knoppix in the usual way.
#Right-click anywhere on the Desktop.
#Point to “Create New”.
#Click “Hard Disk”.
#A window for the new device will appear.
#On the “General” tab, replace the words “Hard Disk” with a suitable name. For example, enter “LS-120”.
#Click the “Device” tab.
#In the “Device” drop-down box, choose /dev/sda, assuming there are no other SCSI devices in the system. Knoppix treats the SuperDisk drive as a SCSI device. 
#Click “OK”.
#The new device will appear on the Desktop.
#Click the icon for the SuperDisk drive.
#Wait while the device is mounted.
#Wait while the ''Konqueror'' file manager starts up.
#The files on the disk will be displayed.
#Right-click on the icon of the LS-120 drive.
#Click “Change read-write mode”.
#Click “Yes”.
#Drag and drop the files and folders you want to copy into the SuperDrive's window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The items will be copied.
#Close the SuperDisk's windows.
#Right-click on the SuperDisk's icon.
#Click “Unmount”.
#The green triangle on the drive's icon will go away.
#It is now safe to take the disk out of the drive.
== Quick help ==
'''Question: Why does it say “Do not format” on the LS-120 disk?'''&lt;br/&gt;
All LS-120 disks are factory formatted. Simply deleting all the files on the disk will put it back to factory fresh condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Connecting to a network =
Knoppix has built-in support for many Ethernet network cards. As a rule, if the computer has a network card, Knoppix will be able to support it (except the very old, or the very new).

Well supported cards include 3Com, Realtek, NE2000 compatible, Intel and many others. However, some Broadcom cards, found in certain Dell PCs made after the year 2000, do not work with this version of ''Knoppix''.
== Automatic setup ==
If you have a supported network card, Knoppix will attempt to configure it automatically during startup. This is for you if you have a server which manages your local area network. To check to see if it worked:
#Click the Konsole icon in the Panel (bottom row, 6th from the left).
#Type this command and press Enter at the end of the line:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt;
#This says the first Ethernet interface (eth0) has been given the Internetworking Protocol (IP) address “192.168.1.18”. If the Ethernet card has been given an IP address, it means the card is working.&lt;br/&gt;To double-check the connection, find out the IP address of another computer on your network. For example, suppose another computer has the address 192.168.1.1. Type this command and press Enter, replacing 192.168.1.1 appropriately:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ping 192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt; Press Ctrl + C on the keyboard to cancel pinging.

== Manual setup ==
If there is no server on your network, you will need to configure your network card manually.
#Click the Knoppix menu in the bottom left corner.
#Point to Network/Internet.
#Click Network Card Configuration.
#You will be asked if you want to use DHCP broadcast.
#Click “No”.
#You will be asked to enter the IP address that you want to give to the first Ethernet interface. You need to know an IP address that is free on your network. You can't use an IP address that is already in use, or both computers will not be able to communicate.
#Enter the IP address that you want to give to the card.
#Click OK. Follow the prompts to complete the setup process.
== Quick help ==
'''Question: There is no “eth0”, why not?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Check the network cables. If there is a DHCP server on your local area network, make sure it is running. Click the “''Knoppix''” menu, choose “Root Shell” and enter:
 /etc/init.d/network restart
 pump -i eth0
Try configuring your network card manually. If it still won't work, it may mean your network card is not supported.

= Using a network server =
Knoppix can copy files to the following types of network file servers:
*File Transfer Protocol ([[w:FTP|FTP]]) servers.
*[[w:Windows Server|Windows Server]] Message Block (SMB) servers.
*UNIX Network File System ([[w:NFS|NFS]]) servers.
== Copying to an FTP server ==
To copy files [[w:onto a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server|onto a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server]]:
#Click the ''Konqueror'' icon in the Panel.
#The ''Konqueror'' file manager will come up.
#To log in to the FTP server anonymously, type the following on the address line. Replace “server” with the IP address of the server you want to connect to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ftp://server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ftp://192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt;
#If you need a username and password to log in to the FTP server, type the following on the address line. Replace “''username''” and “password” with your ''username'' and password. Replace “server” with the address of the FTP server you want to connect to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ftp://username:password@server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;ftp://phil:mypass@192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will connect to the FTP server at 192.168.1.1 with the username “''phil''” and password “''mypass''”.
#The files on the FTP server will appear.
#Drag and drop the files you want to copy to that window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The files will be uploaded, as long as you have permission to write files to the server.
== Copying to a Windows file server ==
To copy files [[w:onto a Microsoft Windows file server|onto a Microsoft Windows file server]]:
#Click the ''Konqueror'' icon in the Panel.
#Wait while ''Konqueror'' starts up.
#Type the following on the address line. Replace “server” with the hostname or IP address of the Windows file server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;smb://server/&lt;/code&gt;
#Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;smb://192.168.1.1/&lt;/code&gt;
#The public shares on the server with the IP address 192.168.1.1 will be displayed. The workgroup name is detected automatically. If a username and password is required, replace “''username''” and “password” below with your ''username'' and password. Replace “server” with the IP address of the server you want to connect to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;smb://username:password@server/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;smb://phil:mypass@192.168.1.1/&lt;/code&gt;
#This will connect to the Windows file server at the IP address 192.168.1.1 with the username “''phil''” and password “''mypass''”.
#Drag and drop the files you want to copy into the server's Konqueror window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#The files will be copied, provided you have access permission to the Windows file server.
== Copying to an NFS server ==
To copy files [[w:onto a Network File System (NFS) server|onto a Network File System (NFS) server]]:
#Click the Knoppix menu in the bottom left corner.
#Click “Root Shell”.
#Type the following command and press Enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/portmap start&lt;/code&gt;
#The port mapping service will be started. The portmapper is needed to access NFS servers.
#Enter the following command, again pressing Enter at the end of the line. Replace “server” with the IP address or ''hostname'' of your NFS server. Replace “/export” with the name of the shared directory on the NFS server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;mount server:/export /home/knoppix/tmp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, to mount the shared directory “/home” to the local directory “/home/knoppix/tmp”:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;mount 192.168.1.1/home /home/knoppix/tmp&lt;/code&gt;
#The NFS export should be mounted.
#Click the “Home” icon in the Panel.
#The files in the Knoppix home directory will be displayed.
#Click the “''tmp''” folder.
#The shared directory on the NFS server should appear.
#Drag and drop the files you wish to copy into this window.
#Click “Copy Here”.
#Given that you have the appropriate file permissions on the NFS server, the files will be copied.

= Connecting to the Internet =
The main ways to get connected to the [[w:Internet|Internet]] are:
*Through an Ethernet gateway, router or local area network.
*Through an external serial modem.
*Through a PCMCIA serial cardbus modem.
Knoppix is designed first and foremost for wired Ethernet networking. This gives you the best chance of success. Meanwhile, the following connection methods may not be so easy with Knoppix:
*Most internal PCI dial-up modems.
*Most external USB broadband modems.
*Most wireless (802.11) PCI and PCMCIA cards.
*Some PCMCIA modem/network combination cards.
*AOL and Compuserve.
The above methods tend to rely on proprietary software that requires Microsoft Windows. Even if the proprietary software were available for Linux (which it sometimes is these days) it cannot be distributed with Knoppix due to licence constraints.
== Broadband ==
A [[w:broadband|broadband]] Internet connection lets you download at up to ten times the speed of a conventional modem. It also lets you make and receive voice calls on the same line at the same time. The technical name is ''Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line'' (ADSL). To use ADSL broadband Internet over a conventional phone line with Knoppix, you need:
*A telephone line which has been “activated” for ADSL.
*An account with an ADSL-enabled Internet Service Provider. This means any ISP that offers a standard broadband service.
*A ''microfilter'' for each standard analogue device (such as telephones, fax machines, and ''dialup'' modems).
*A supported Ethernet adapter in your PC or laptop (see the section “Connecting to a local area network”).
*An ADSL router. These popular, inexpensive devices combine a broadband modem with an Ethernet router/gateway, giving “instant Internet”. The single-port variety is for one computer. Multi-port versions let several computers share the same broadband Internet connection.&lt;br/&gt;
To make the connection:
#Make sure the Ethernet cable from the ADSL router is connected to the computer's Ethernet adapter.
#Start Knoppix. It should detect the network card, and then obtain an IP address automatically from the ADSL router.
#If you have not already done so, use a web browser to visit the ADSL router's configuration page. To learn about the web browsers included in ''Knoppix'', see the later section, “Browsing the World Wide Web”. Enter the necessary information on the configuration page to make the connection to your ISP.
#You're done! As long as the “upstream” connection to the Internet is working, you will be connected to the Internet.
 '''Note'''
 The diagram above shows a typical setup for the UK.
 It may vary from country to country depending on regulatory requirements.
 What is most important is that filtering must be done correctly.
 The ADSL modem must never be subject to filtering, while every other device on the telephone line must be filtered.&lt;br/&gt;
 The term “broadband” can also mean Internet provided by cable and other high speed Internet connections (including wireless options).
 These connections may or may not be usable in Knoppix.

== Dial-up ==
[[w:Dial-up|Dial-up]] Internet is the older, slower way to access the Internet. To connect this way, you need an account with any standard Internet Service Provider (not AOL or Compuserve) and one of the following:
*An external serial [[w:modem|modem]]. This type of modem connects to the computer's serial port (called COM1 or COM2 under DOS). No special driver is needed to operate this type of modem, so  compatibility with ''Knoppix'' is excellent. For example, the “''Sitecom'' External V92 Serial Modem” works perfectly.
*A PCMCIA Cardbus modem. A PCMCIA Cardbus modem is effectively an external serial modem. In general, the cheaper the card, the better. For example, the “''Sitecom'' 56Kbps Fax Modem PC Card” works perfectly with ''Knoppix''.
*An internal ISA modem. Like the external modem, this type of modem needs no special driver to make it work. That is why old ISA modems are useful.
There are two main ways to make a dial-up connection. The recommended way is to use “K Point to Point Protocol” (KPPP). The alternative, in case KPPP doesn't work, is the “Worldvisions Dialer” (WVDial).
=== Connecting using KPPP ===
#Click the Knoppix menu in the lower left corner.
#Point to “Network/Internet”.
#Click “Modem ''Dialer''”.
#The “KDE Point-To-Point Protocol” ([[w:KPPP|KPPP]]) program will start.
#Click “''Setup''”.
#Click the “Device” tab.
#If your modem is plugged into the serial port called “COM1” in Windows, set “Modem device” to /dev/ttyS0. If it is plugged into the port called “COM2” in Windows, select /dev/ttyS1. If you have a PCMCIA ''Cardbus'' modem, select /dev/modem. If you have an internal ISA modem, select /dev/ttyS0 first; if that doesn't work, try up to /dev/ttyS3.
#Click the “Modem” tab.
#Click “Query modem”.
#You should see a response from the modem. If not, go back to step 7 and try another modem device setting.
#Click the “Accounts” tab.
#Click “New”.
#Click “''Dialog setup''”.
#In “Connection name” enter a name for the connection ''eg'' “test”.
#Beside “Phone number”, click “Add”.
#Enter your Internet Service Provider's dial-up access number. If you don't know, ask your Internet Service Provider. Click OK.
#Click OK. This will take you back to the accounts screen.
#Click OK again.
#Enter your login ID and password. Again, if you don't know what they are, ask your Internet Service Provider.
#Click Connect.
#You should hear the modem work.
#In a few moments, the KPPP window should shrink down to the Taskbar. It should then read “00:00” on the ''Taskbar''. This indicates your time ''online'' in hours and minutes. Congratulations, you have connected to the Internet successfully.
#To disconnect, click the KPPP button in the Taskbar.
#The KPPP window will come back up.
#Click Disconnect.
#The phone call will be ended.
==== Quick help ====
'''Question: It says “The PPP daemon died unexpectedly!”'''&lt;br/&gt;
Check your username and password.

'''Question: I know my username and password is correct but it still says “The PPP daemon died unexpectedly”.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Go to /etc/ppp/peers/kppp options.txt and change #noauth to noauth (ie Delete the #). 

If that still doesn't help, try another modem.

'''Question: I tried another modem and I still can't connect.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Sorry, it seems that KPPP doesn't work with all ''ISPs''. Luckily, there is an alternative. The “''Worldvisions Dialer''” is included with ''Knoppix''. For an example of how to use “''wvdial''”, see:
 [http://support.real-time.com/linux/dialup/wvdial.html http://support.real-time.com/linux/dialup/wvdial.html]

'''Question: Can I use an internal PCI modem?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Not usually. As noted in the “Identifying hardware” section, most internal PCI modem cards need special software not in ''Knoppix''.

'''Question: I have a PCMCIA combo Ethernet modem card, but the modem function doesn't work.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Sorry, with some combo Ethernet and modem PCMCIA cards, only one part works. Usually the Ethernet works and the modem does not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Common web browsers =
Once you have an Internet connection, Knoppix has several different ''web browsers'' built in. A web browser is a program for using the [[w:World Wide Web|World Wide Web]], one of the Internet's most popular services.

==Konqueror==
Konqueror is a web browser and file manager, which uses the [[w:KHTML|KHTML]] layout engine to render content. The WebKit layout engine used in Safari and Chrome browsers is based on KHTML.

When starting Knoppix for the first time or with default settings into the K Desktop Environment (KDE), Konqueror will start automatically and will display a local HTML page introducing Knoppix.

To invoke Konqueror later on in KDE, click [[w:Konqueror|Konqueror Web Browser]] on the Panel.

==Gecko-based browsers==
The [[w:Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla Application Suite]], then just known as Mozilla, has been a mainstay in earlier versions of the Knoppix CD until Knoppix 3.8. Mozilla has not been included since that version in favor of Mozilla Firefox. Mozilla and Firefox are both available on the Knoppix 4.0 DVD.

===Mozilla Application Suite===
Mozilla is a whole, integrated, configurable, sophisticated and extensible Internet application suite. To invoke it in KDE, click the “Mozilla Browser” button on the Panel.

On modern hardware, the [[w:Mozilla Web Browser|Mozilla Web Browser]] may take longer to start than Konqueror in K Desktop Environment (KDE), because Konqueror and KDE share the same toolkit and other technologies. On slower computers with limited RAM memory, Mozilla may be more responsive when run from a simple window manager and not from a desktop envrionment.

===Mozilla Firefox/IceWeasel===
[[:w:en:Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], a fast, light browser, replaced Mozilla proper. Firefox 1.0.3 was included in Knoppix 3.8.2 and has remained the primary browser ever since. Unlike Mozilla, which is a whole application suite, Firefox 1.0 had an advantage with speed and responsiveness.

Mozilla Firefox 2.0 later turned out to be comparably less responsive than SeaMonkey 1.x &amp;mdash; a fork and descendant of Mozilla, that was still based on original Mozilla technologies, which had matured in 2001/2002. Firefox 2.0 also requires more in-depth customization than SeaMonkey to make it more responsive and less resource-hungry.

The Mozilla Firefox package was later changed to [[w:IceWeasel|IceWeasel]], a version- and source-compatible fork of Mozilla Firefox. The change was borne out of a naming and trademark dispute with Mozilla.org and developers of Debian (on which Knoppix is based).

Since at least Knoppix 6.0.1, IceWeasel has by default included the [[w:NoScript|NoScript]] extension, which protects against web attacks.

==Small browsers==
*For a minimal web browser, click K menu -&gt; Internet -&gt; [[w:Dillo|Dillo]].
*For text-only web browsing (yes, really), click K menu -&gt; Internet -&gt; Lynx. Then hit the letter G (for Go). You will be prompted to enter the web address that you want to visit. Type the web address that you want, then press Enter. The web page will be loaded.

= Email =
Knoppix has several different ''[[w:email|email]] clients''. An email client is a program that lets you send and receive Internet email. Here is how to set up the [[w:KMail|KMail]] email client in Knoppix:
#Click the K menu in the bottom left corner.
#Point to “Internet”.
#Click “''KMail'' (Mail Client)”.
#The KMail mail program will be loaded.
#Click the “Settings” menu.
#Click “Configure ''KMail''”.
#The KMail configuration screen will appear. On the left side, ensure that “Identities” is selected. Click “Modify”.
#Enter your real name, organisation and email address, then click OK.
#Click “Network”.
#Click “Remove”.
#Click “Add”.
#Make sure “SMTP” is selected, then click OK.
#In the “Host” box, enter the ''hostname'' of your Internet Service Provider's outgoing SMTP ([[w:Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]]) server. If the SMTP server requires authentication, check the “Server requires authentication” box and enter your username and password for sending mail.
#Click OK.
#Click the “Receiving” tab.
#Click “Add”.
#Select the type of incoming mail server you have. Most Internet Service Providers use POP ([[w:Post Office Protocol|Post Office Protocol]]). Some provide IMAP (Internet Message Application Protocol).
#Click OK.
#Enter your login and password for receiving your email. Enter the server which provides your incoming email in the “Host” box.
#Click OK. This takes you back to the “Configure ''KMail''” screen.
#Click OK again.
#To see if you have new mail, click the “File” menu, then “Check Mail”. Or click the “Check Mail In” button on the toolbar. KMail will look for your new messages.
#To write email, click the “Message” menu, then “New Message”. Or click the “New Message” button on the Toolbar.
#When you have finished writing, click the “Message” menu, then “Send”. Or click the “Send” button in the Toolbar.
 '''Important'''
 Knoppix will not let you accidentally run Linux programs received by email.
 Program files must be given ''execute permission'' before they can be run by double-clicking on them.
 This gives excellent protection against would-be “email viruses”, while still letting you open ordinary document attachments easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Printing =
Knoppix has [[w:built-in support|built-in support]] for hundreds of popular printers. Parallel and USB connections are supported. The best supported inkjet printers are HP and Epson. Many Canon and a few Lexmark printers are also supported. On the laser front, all greyscale Postscript and most greyscale Printer Control Language (PCL) laser printers work.

However, some printers do not work with Knoppix. The printers that do not work tend to be cheap Lexmark inkjet printers, and very low cost colour laser printers. Colour laser printers work if they are fully Postscript or PCL compatible. Unfortunately, very low cost colour laser printers tend not to be compatible with either. They are therefore completely incompatible with Knoppix.

To [[w:set up a printer|set up a printer]] connected by a USB or parallel cable:
#Click the Knoppix icon in the Panel.
#Point to “Configure”.
#Click “Configure printer(s)”.&lt;br/&gt;
#Wait for a moment while the KDE “[[w:Printing Manager|Printing Manager]]” starts.
#Click “Add”.&lt;br/&gt;
#Click “Add Printer/Class…”.
#The welcome screen of the “Add Printer” wizard will appear.
#Click Next.
#Select “Local printer”, then click Next.&lt;br/&gt;
#Select the port that your printer is on. If your printer is connected to the computer's parallel port, select &lt;code&gt;Parallel Port #1 (/dev/lp0)&lt;/code&gt;. If you have a USB printer, select &lt;code&gt;USB Printer #1 (/dev/usb/lp0)&lt;/code&gt;. Click Next.&lt;br/&gt;
#Select the manufacturer and model of your printer. If you cannot find your exact printer model in the list, try the nearest available. For example the HP PSC 1200 driver works with the HP PSC 1350, even though the HP PSC 1350 is not in the list. Click Next.&lt;br/&gt;
#This screen appears if Knoppix knows of more than one driver that can operate your printer. Usually the first or the recommended option will be fine. Click Next.&lt;br/&gt;
#Click the “Test” button to print a test page on your printer. After a short pause, your printer should start working.
#When the [[w:test page|test page]] has finished, click Next four times until you get to the “General Information” screen. Enter a short name for your printer, then click Next.&lt;br/&gt;
#Click Finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;
#The Printing Manager will be displayed again. You may now print from all the applications included in Knoppix. When you exit Knoppix, the printer setup will be lost. However, there is a way to save the setup. See the later section, “Finding permanence”.
The test page [[w:paper size|paper size]] is US Letter by default. If you are using A4 paper, the test page won't print all the way to the bottom of the page. This is normal.

= Scanning =
Knoppix has [[w:built-in support|built-in support]] for some scanners. Scanning in Knoppix is simple, if you are lucky enough to have a fully compatible scanner. Scanner support is provided by a program called “[[w:Scanner Access Is Now Easy|Scanner Access Is Now Easy]]”. If your scanner is fully supported, you don't have to do any setup at all. To [[w:test a scanner|test a scanner]] using Knoppix:
#Click K menu.
#Click Multimedia.
#Click XScanImage.
#If the scanner is detected, the device name will be shown at the top of the window. For example, if you have an Epson Perfection 1260 USB, it will say &lt;code&gt;Plustek:/dev/usbscanner&lt;/code&gt;.
#Assuming your scanner is detected, click “Preview Window”.
#Click Acquire Preview.
#The image that the scanner sees will be shown.
#Lasso the area to be scanned using the mouse.
#Click “Scan”.
#The marked area will be scanned to an image file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Playing Audio CDs =
Knoppix has a built-in player for ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' music CDs. Unlike data CDs, audio CDs don't need to be mounted in order to be played. The ideal is to have two CD drives in your computer – one for the Knoppix CD, and one for the [[w:audio CD|audio CD]] that you want to play. If you only have one CD drive, refer to “If you have only one CD drive” in the “Advanced startup options” section.
#Click K Menu.
#Point to Multimedia.
#Point to Sound.
#Click [[w:KsCD|KsCD]] ([[w:CD Player|CD Player]]).
#The CD player application will appear.
#Put the audio CD in the drive that is not occupied by Knoppix.
#Click the big “Play” button in the KsCD window to begin.&lt;br/&gt;
#The audio CD will be played.
If your CD-ROM drive is wired to the sound card, you will hear the music through the speakers attached to the sound card. If you can't hear anything, plug your speakers or headphones into the audio out socket on the front of the CD drive. Then adjust the volume level using the volume control on the front of the CD drive.

When you close KsCD, it will “dock” into the System Tray in the bottom right corner of the screen. To get it back again, click its icon in the System Tray.
 '''Note'''
 Some audio CDs are designed not to work on a computer CD-ROM drive. They should be clearly marked.
 They may also not work on some non-computer CD players such as in-car players.&lt;br/&gt;
 If you are not satisfied with your audio CD, return it to the shop and ask for a refund.
 It is simply cheaper and easier for the seller to give you your money back than argue.

= Playing DVD movies =
Knoppix has a [[w:built-in player|built-in player]] for DVD movies. This section will help you test a DVD-ROM drive for DVD movie playing. It is best to have two CD drives – one CD drive for the Knoppix disc, and one DVD capable drive for the movie disc you want to play. If you have just a single DVD drive, refer to “If you have only one CD drive” in the “Advanced startup options” section. You also need a reasonable graphic cards with hardware acceleration that is supported by Knoppix. For example, the ATI Rage 128 AGP card works perfectly. 
== What is DVD? ==
DVD stands for ''Digital Versatile Disc''. It was originally called ''Digital Video Disc''. A DVD disc can contain data, audio or video. DVD Read Only Memory (ROM) drives are backwards compatible, so they can read the older Compact Disc media.
== DVD movies in Knoppix ==
Knoppix 3.3 has a limited DVD player application. It can play &quot;unencrypted&quot; DVD movie discs, such as home videos, but it can't play most commercial DVD movie discs. Knoppix 5.1 has a full DVD player which can play commercial DVD movie discs, given extra software that has to be downloaded separately. It is best to have two CD drives: one drive for Knoppix, and one DVD capable drive for the movie disc.
== Playing DVDs in Knoppix 3.3 ==
#Click K Menu.
#Point to Multimedia.
#Point to Video.
#Click Xine Media Player.
#Wait for a moment while “[[w:Xine|Xine]]” starts up.
#The Xine player application will appear.
#Put the disc in the DVD drive that is not occupied by Knoppix.
#Click the “DVD” button in Xine.
#If the DVD is unencrypted, and the region check is passed, the movie should begin playing.
#If it says “Error reading NAV packet”, most likely this means the DVD is encrypted and so it cannot be played. Try another disc.
# If you need to change the region, click the Xine Setup button. When you hover the mouse pointer over the “Setup” button, a blue spanner icon will appear in the Xine display, and a “Setup window” tooltip will appear. Click the “Input” tab. Under “Region that DVD player claims to be”, choose the region number that you want. For example, choose “2” for United Kingdom (Europe). Click Apply, then Close. This change affects only the Xine software. It will not alter your DVD drive, and it will not affect any other DVD movie playing software that you may have.
== Playing DVDs in Knoppix 5.1 ==
Knoppix 5.1 has the magical ability to add extra software on the fly. This is handy, because playing most commercial DVD movie discs requires installing an extra package.
# Click &quot;Knoppix&quot; menu in the Panel (bottom row, 2nd from the left).
# Click &quot;Set password for root&quot;.
# Enter a password of your choice. This is only a temporary password. It will be forgotten when you exit Knoppix.
# Click OK, re-enter the password, click OK again.
# Start the Konqueror web browser. 
# Visit http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdvdcss/1.2.9/deb/
# Click &quot;libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb&quot;
# Click &quot;Open with KPackage&quot;.
# Click &quot;Install&quot;. It will ask to confirm to install package &quot;libdvdcss2&quot;, click &quot;Install&quot;.
# When KPackage has finished installing, click &quot;Done&quot;, then close KPackage.
# Insert the DVD movie disc.
# The disc will be auto-detected. Choose &quot;Play DVD with Kaffeine&quot;.
# Follow the steps and the DVD movie will be played. Notice that you can skip freely. Where many DVD players annoyingly refuse to fast forward and skip to the film, here you can. Much better. :-)
# When you exit Knoppix, the temporary installation of &quot;libdvdcss2&quot; will be discarded.

'''Question: Why is libdvdcss not just included in Knoppix?'''&lt;br/&gt;
“Xine Media Player” and &quot;Kaffeine&quot; have not been authorised by the “DVD Copy Control Association”. Getting authorisation is expensive and would introduce licencing constraints. To get around that, the necessary third-party component &quot;libdvdcss&quot; is a separate download.

'''Question: It says “Error reading NAV packet”.'''&lt;br/&gt;
The movie is probably encrypted. Knoppix cannot play it without libdvdcss.

'''Question: How do I know if a DVD is encrypted or not?'''&lt;br/&gt;
You don't. There is no official label. The presence (or not) of a &quot;region code&quot; is a guide but not definitive. The only way to find out is to try it and see if it works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knoppix has [[w:built-in support|built-in support]] for many sound cards. Well supported cards include Soundblaster compatibles, Creative Soundblaster Live, C-Media 8738, Intel i810, Ensoniq, Crystal Soundfusion and the Via 82c series of sound cards.
= Testing sound in KDE =
#Click K Menu.
#Point to Settings.
#Click Control Center.
#Wait for a moment while the “KDE Control Center” starts.
#On the left side, click Sound &amp; Multimedia.
#Under Sound &amp; Multimedia, click Sound System.
#On the right side, click “Start ''aRTs'' server on KDE ''startup''”.
#Click Apply.
#Click Test Sound.
#You should hear the KDE startup sound.
= Testing sound in XMMS =
To play the built-in demonstration music file:
#Click the CD-ROM icon for your Knoppix CD.
#Click the “Demos” folder.
#Click the “Audio” folder.
#Click the “''opensource.ogg''” file.
#Wait while the “X Multimedia System” application starts.
#The demonstration song will play.&lt;br/&gt;
If the demonstration song does not start automatically, click the “Play” button (bottom row, second from the left, in the XMMS window).
= Volume controls =
To adjust the sound [[w:volume level|volume levels]]:
#Click K Menu -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Sound -&gt; [[w:KMix|KMix]] (Sound Mixer).
#The main volume control is on the far left. Move the slider up for louder and down for quieter.&lt;br/&gt;
To learn what each slider does, hover the mouse pointer over the icon at the top. A little yellow label will appear, such as “Microphone”.
== Muting ==
The green spots are called the “[[w:mute|mute]] buttons”. The mute button turns on and off output from the corresponding channel. Light green means on, dark means off (muted). All the channels are on by default.
 '''Note'''
 The microphone channel has no output, since it's only used for recording (input).
 KMix gives the microphone channel a mute button anyway.
 The mute button on the microphone channel has no effect.
== Closing KMix ==
When you close KMix, it goes into the System Tray which is in the bottom right corner of the screen. To get KMix back again, right-click its icon in the System Tray, then click “Show Mixer Window”.
== Quick help ==
'''Question: I can't get KMix to start by clicking in the K menu.'''&lt;br/&gt;
KMix is already started. Right-click its icon in the System Tray (bottom right corner of the screen), then click “Show Mixer Window”.
= Sound recording =
This explains how to test sound [[w:recording|recording]] through your sound card. You need a microphone plugged in to the “Mic” socket on your sound card.
#Bring up the KMix window. If KMix is already running, right-click its icon in the System Tray, then click “Show Mixer Window”. If KMix is not already running, click K Menu -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Sound -&gt; KMix (Sound Mixer).
#Click the red button at the bottom of the Microphone channel. This sets KMix to record from the Microphone channel. You can only record from one channel at a time.
#Click K menu -&gt; Multimedia -&gt; Sound -&gt; [[w:Audacity|Audacity]].
#Wait for a moment while the “[[w:Audacity|Audacity]]” application starts up.
#To start recording, click the large red circle (record) button.
#The waveform of the sound from the microphone will appear while it is recorded.
#To stop recording, click the yellow square (stop) button.
#To hear the result, click the green triangle (play) button.
Audacity is a multi-track sound recorder. Each new recording that you make is stored in a new track. This lets you overlay sounds on top of each other. To get rid of a recorded track, click the small X on the left side next to the words “Audio Track”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible for the X Window System, the K Desktop Environment, or an individual application to &quot;freeze up&quot;. This section explains what to do if that happens.

== Getting rid of an individual application ==

The most common situation is to have a program that just doesn't seem to want to go away. Even when you click the close button on its window, it still won't disappear. To get rid of it:

# Press Ctrl+Alt+Esc on the keyboard.
# The pointer will change into a skull and crossbones.
# Point anywhere inside the window that you want to get rid of.
# Click the left mouse button.
# The errant program will be killed.

== Restarting the X Window System ==

If many programs or your entire graphical environment seems stuck, you can try to restart the X server entirely.

Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace kills X. The display manager should bring it back up again.

An alternate way to restart X in Knoppix is to:

# Press Ctrl+Alt+F2.
# Type this command, then press Enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;init 2&lt;/code&gt;
# You will see the message &quot;X Window System shut down&quot;. This will also end the K Desktop Environment and all its open applications.
# Then enter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;init 5&lt;/code&gt;
# The X Window System will be restarted. The KDE desktop will appear again as it did when you first started Knoppix.

''“The box said that I needed to have Windows 98 or better… so I installed Linux.” -- LinuxNewbie.org ''
== Overview ==
Knoppix lets you store personalised settings, document files and system settings on a disk. This saves you from having to set up Knoppix from scratch every time you run it.

'''Important:''' The functionality described in this article is available only until and including Knoppix 5.1.1 (CD release) and 5.3.1 (DVD release), as all versions of Knoppix since 6.0 don't have it anymore.

Knoppix 6.x releases require saving ''all'' of the CD or DVD contents to non-optical media (hard disk, flash drive, memory card), from which to boot the system up. Note that some computers are not configured or able to run operating systems off USB-connected drives or memory cards; some other systems won't boot from very large external storage items. The boot order is configured from the BIOS, access to which may be restricted in some situations (typically computers at and supplied by workplaces).

== Creating a persistent Home directory ==
Personalisation is what makes your computer yours. Personalised settings include ''application preferences'', for example, your favourite KDE background wallpaper. ''Documents'' are the files that you create using ''Knoppix'' applications, such as graphics and word processed document files. Personalised settings and documents are stored in a special place called your ''[[w:Home directory|Home directory]]''.

Knoppix lets you keep your Home directory on another disk. This is called creating a ''persistent Knoppix home directory''. It allows you to use a personalised Knoppix account everywhere you go. For example, you can sit down at one computer, do some work, go to another computer, and carry on working.

This works best with a USB hard drive stick, also known as a USB flash drive. These marvellous little gadgets give you hundreds of megabytes of storage, in a space no bigger than a key fob. A USB flash drive is the ideal companion to a Knoppix CD. To create a persistent Home directory on a USB flash drive:
#Insert your USB flash drive.
#Wait for a moment while the drive is detected.
#A new hard disk partition icon will appear on the Desktop.
#Note the name of the new icon. For example, if there are no other SCSI drives in the computer, it will be labelled “Hard disk partition [sda1]”.
#Right-click on the USB flash drive icon.
#Click “Mount”.
#Right-click on the USB flash drive icon again.
#Click “Change read/write mode”.
#It will ask if you want to make the partition writeable.
#Click “Yes”.
#Click the Knoppix menu in the Panel.
#Point to “Configure”.
#Click “Create persistent KNOPPIX home directory”.
#Click “Yes”.
#Choose the partition that corresponds to your flash drive. In this example, /dev/sda1 represents the flash drive.
#You will be asked if you want to encrypt the file that will be created on the flash drive. This is optional, so click “No”.
#Enter how big in megabytes you would like your Knoppix home directory to be. For example, enter “100” for 100 megabytes. Imagine you have a 256 Mb flash drive. This will create a 100 megabyte file on the flash drive, leaving 156 Mb free for other files.
#Click OK.
#Wait while Knoppix prepares the flash drive. If the flash drive has an activity light, you will see it working for a few moments.
#You will be asked if you want to use the entire partition. Click “No”. This will leave existing files on the flash drive alone.
#Wait while Knoppix completes the setup process.
#Knoppix will tell you what you need to type at the boot prompt to use the persistent Knoppix home directory on your flash drive. Make a note of what it says, then click OK.

You must reboot for the change to take effect. Shut down Knoppix and restart. At the boot prompt, type the following command, replacing “sda1” as appropriate:
 knoppix home=/mnt/sda1

During startup you should see a message like this:
 Mounting /mnt/sda1/knoppix.img as /home/knoppix...
 /home/knoppix mounted OK.

This means it worked. The USB flash drive will now be used for the home directory of the “knoppix” user.
 '''Important'''
 With a persistent home directory on a flash drive, the flash drive will be in use all the time.
 Do not take the flash drive out until you have shut down Knoppix.
== Saving system settings ==
Saving system settings is called making a ''Knoppix configuration archive''. This stores settings that are saved in the system-wide configuration directory, not in the home directory. For example, it allows you to save your printer setup, so you don't have to do it again next time. To save the system settings:
#Click the Knoppix menu on the Panel.
#Point to “Configure”.
#Click “Save KNOPPIX configuration”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Saving system settings 1).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Select the system settings that you would like to store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Saving system settings 1-2).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
'''Personal configuration.''' If you have a persistent Knoppix home directory, you do not need this. If you do not have a persistent Knoppix home directory, this option covers the personalised settings you have made in programs like the KDE Control Center, and your personalised settings in applications such as AbiWord. It does not include document files, such as saved word processor files. It also does not include cache files from web browsing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''All files on the Desktop.''' If you have a persistent Knoppix home directory, you do not need this. If you do not have a persistent Knoppix home directory, select this option to save the new disk icons or program icons that you may have created on the Desktop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''Network settings.''' If you have a persistent Knoppix home directory, and all you are doing is using the KPPP dialler to connect to the Internet via a modem, you do not need this. KPPP configuration is saved as part of your Knoppix home directory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The network settings saved by this option include Local Area Network (LAN), manually configured dial-up networking (modem), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) settings. For example, if you have set up your network card manually, select this option to save the configuration for next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''Graphics subsystem settings.''' This saves settings for the “X Window System” (the graphics display). For example, if you specified a certain screen resolution when you started Knoppix, this option will save that setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''Other system configuration.''' This option saves the printer setup and all other system-wide settings.
#Click OK.
#Select the device that you would like to save onto. For example, assuming you have a USB flash drive, and there are no other SCSI drives in the system, choose /mnt/sda1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Saving system settings 2).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Click OK.
#Wait while the archive is created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Saving system settings 3).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#If it worked, it will say, “Creation of the KNOPPIX configuration archive was successful”. It will tell you the command to use at the boot prompt to load the saved settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Saving system settings 4).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Click OK to exit.
To load the saved settings next time you start Knoppix, use the “''myconfig''” parameter at the boot prompt. For example, assuming you saved the archive to “/mnt/sda1”, at the boot prompt enter:
 knoppix myconfig=/mnt/sda1

If it works you will see something like this near the end of the startup messages (Ctrl+Alt+F1):
 Checking /mnt/sda1 for KNOPPIX configuration file...
 Found, now executing /mnt/sda1/knoppix.sh

= Overview =
This section explains the bootup options for Knoppix. Use these options to fine-tune Knoppix for your hardware and speed it up.
= Enabling DMA =
The first and foremost way to make Knoppix run faster that almost everyone can use is to [[w:enable DMA|enable DMA]]. It stands for Direct Memory Access. It improves the speed of hard disk drives and it can also help CD-ROM drives. DMA is not supported on all computers, so Knoppix turns it off by default. To enable DMA, add 'dma' to your boot command, for example:
 knoppix lang=uk dma
To [[w:test the speed|test the speed]] of the hard disk drive, click the Knoppix menu, choose “Root Shell” and enter:
 hdparm -t /dev/hda
Replace “''hda''” with the device name of your hard drive appropriately. After a pause of about 3 seconds, you will get a little report that will tell you how fast your hard drive reads data. DMA makes a pretty big difference. For example, look at these sample test results:
{| border=1
!Drive
!Without DMA
!With DMA
|-
|Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM IDE
|8.5 MB/sec
|26.8 Mb/sec
|}
= If you only have a single CD drive =
Knoppix takes over your CD drive and you can't eject it during your session. What if you want to use the CD drive for something else? For example, you may want to create CDs using a CD-ReWritable drive. If you only have one CD drive, this will be a problem.

Luckily, there is a solution. It is possible to run Knoppix from a hard drive or RAM, freeing up the CD drive for other tasks.
== Transferring to a hard disk partition ==
[[w:Transferring to a hard disk|Transferring to a hard disk]] partition means copying the CD contents onto a hard disk. This is called “copying the CD image”. Once this is done, Knoppix starts in the normal way but from the hard drive instead the CD-ROM drive.

This gives improved performance, because hard disk drives are generally much faster than CD-ROM drives. It also frees up your CD-ROM drive for other tasks. It does not affect the existing files on the hard drive. All it does is use up hard drive space, which can be reclaimed later.

To transfer to a hard disk partition, you need:
*An MS-DOS, FAT or Linux formatted hard disk partition.&lt;br/&gt;NTFS (native Windows NT/2000/XP) partitions cannot be used.
*At least 700 Mb free space on the partition.

At the boot prompt, enter this command. Replace “device” with the device name of the hard disk partition that you want to use.
 knoppix tohd=device

For example, suppose you have Windows 98. You probably have Windows installed on the first partition of the primary master IDE drive. In this case, use:
 knoppix tohd=/dev/hda1

Knoppix will start from CD, copy itself to the specified device and then continue loading from there. You can then take the Knoppix CD out of the drive.
== Re-using an existing image ==
You only need to copy the CD image to the hard disk once. Next time, you can [[w:read back from the hard disk|read back from the hard disk]], without having to copy the CD image again.

At the boot prompt, enter this command. Replace “device” with the device name of the hard disk partition where the Knoppix CD image is located.
 knoppix fromhd=device

For example:
 knoppix fromhd=/dev/hda1

Knoppix will start from CD, pick up the CD image from the specified device and continue loading. You can then take the Knoppix CD out of the drive.
== Deleting the image ==
In Windows, remove the “KNOPPIX” directory from the hard drive using Windows Explorer. This will give back the hard drive space occupied by the CD image.
= Transferring to RAM =
If you have 828 Mb or more of RAM, you can copy the Knoppix CD image to RAM. After an initial wait, transferring to RAM gives dramatically improved performance, and the Knoppix CD is not needed. You need 828 Mb of RAM because the first 700 Mb is used for the CD image. The remaining 128 Mb is used for the system and applications.

At the boot prompt, enter this command:
 knoppix toram

Knoppix will start from CD, transfer the CD image to RAM, and continue loading. Once transfer to RAM has completed, you can take the Knoppix CD out of the drive.
= More hardware options =
These options let you fine-tune Knoppix for your particular hardware. They can be combined in any order. For example, to start Knoppix with the US language/keyboard, a wheel mouse, a screen resolution of 800x600 and Direct Memory Access (DMA) enabled for hard drives, type this at the boot prompt:
 knoppix lang=uk wheelmouse screen=800x600 dma

Knoppix assumes you have a laptop. It starts up with PCMCIA (credit card adapter) interface support enabled by default. If you have a desktop computer, rather than a laptop, you can improve performance slightly by typing the “''nopcmcia''” option at the boot prompt. For example, to start the computer with the US locale, a wheel mouse, a screen resolution of 1024x768, and no PCMCIA:
 knoppix lang=us wheelmouse screen=1024x768 nopcmcia
= If you have less than 128 Mb RAM =
After loading the kernel and the base system, Knoppix looks to see how much RAM is left. The kernel and the base system takes about 20 Mb of RAM. The remainder is called free RAM, or available RAM.

''Knoppix'' checks to see if there is a Linux ''swap partition'' available. You may have a swap partition if you have previously installed Linux on the hard disk. If so, ''Knoppix'' will use the existing swap partition automatically.

If there is less than 80,000 Kb free RAM, ''Knoppix'' will prompt you to create a ''swap file''. A swap file lets you use part of the hard disk as if it were RAM.

This trick lets you run Knoppix in full, even when you have less than 128 Mb RAM. For example, it is possible to run Knoppix successfully on a computer with only 64 Mb of RAM. However, you pay a performance penalty, because swap is much slower than physical RAM.

To [[w:create a swap file|create a swap file]], you need a hard disk with at least one partition that is formatted with the FAT filesystem. NTFS formatted partitions cannot be used.
#Start Knoppix in the usual way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (If you have less than 128 Mb RAM 1).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#You will get a message that says, “There are only ''X'' Kb of RAM available in your computer”.
#Press Enter.
#Knoppix will search for an available FAT formatted partition. If there is more than one, Knoppix will choose the ''last'' available partition. You will be asked if you want to create a swap file on the partition that Knoppix has selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (If you have less than 128 Mb RAM 2).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, choose “Yes”, then press Enter.
#You will be asked how big a swap file you want to create. You need a swap file that is large enough to take the free RAM + swap file total to at least 80,000 Kb.
#Type the size of the swap file you wish to create. In this example, it says there is 49,152 Kb of physical RAM free. The suggested swap file size of 60 Mb will bring the free total to 108 Mb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (If you have less than 128 Mb RAM 3).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Press Enter.
#Wait for a moment while Knoppix creates the swap file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (If you have less than 128 Mb RAM 4).png|none|thumb]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Press Enter to continue loading Knoppix.

:'''Tip'''
:Next time you start Knoppix, it will detect and use the swap file automatically.
:To remove the swap file and reclaim the disk space it occupies, exit Knoppix, start Windows, then delete the file called “''knoppix.swp''” using Windows Explorer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Alternatives to KDE =
Knoppix has six alternative ''desktop managers''. These let you run the X Window System on a computer that doesn't have enough RAM for KDE. They also save loading time, because they load much more quickly.
== Ice Window Manager ==
A small and fast window manager in the Microsoft Windows style.
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Ice Window Manager 1).png|524px|none|thumb|Ice Window Manager screenshot]]&lt;/div&gt;

== Window Maker ==
A simple and elegant window manager with a very solid feel.
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Window Maker 1).png|524px|none|thumb|Window Maker Window Manager screenshot]]&lt;/div&gt;

== Fluxbox ==
Similar in style to Window Maker.
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Fluxbox 1).png|524px|none|thumb|Fluxbox Window Manager screenshot]]&lt;/div&gt;

== Xfce ==
Xfce stands for “The Cholesterol Free Desktop Environment”.
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Xfce 1).png|524px|none|thumb|Xfce Desktop Environment screenshot]]&lt;/div&gt;

== Lars Window Manager ==
An alternative window manager. In Lars Window Manager, almost everything is done with the keyboard instead of the mouse. Lars Window Manager is designed for programmers that spend most of their time working with text.
&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Lars Window Manager 1).png|524px|none|thumb|Lars Window Manager screenshot]]&lt;/div&gt;

== Tab Window Manager ==
[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Tab Window Manager 1).png|524px|thumb|right|Tab Window Manager screenshot]]
:''See also: [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm]]''
TWM is designed to use as little RAM as possible. If you start Knoppix on a computer without enough RAM to run KDE, it will run Tab Window Manager instead.

In '''Knoppix 5.0.1''', the twm menu is missing, but a command line (console) window does start. With a capable computer (at least 256 Mb RAM), the easiest shortcut to an app launcher is KDE's Kicker. Invoke it like this:
 $ '''kicker &amp;'''
^ The dollar sign &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; is the default sign of the command line; the ampersand &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; serves to separate Kicker from the console to free it up for other uses. The screenshot to the right shows the same method with The GIMP.

TWM does not appear to be included in CD versions of Knoppix 6.0 or later, as these have solely defaulted to LXDE. That won't run with any efficiency in computers that have less than 256 Mb of RAM memory.
{{clear|both}}

= Starting an alternative window manager =
once knoppix has loaded you can go through the configuration options, to switch between various window manager(except beryl).

Use one of these commands at the boot prompt.
 knoppix desktop=icewm          # IceWM
 knoppix desktop=wmaker         # Window Maker
 knoppix desktop=fluxbox        # Fluxbox
 knoppix desktop=xfce           # Xfce
 knoppix desktop=larswm         # Lars Window Manager
 knoppix desktop=twm            # Tab Window Manager
 knoppix desktop=beryl          # Beryl with kde

For example, to start Window Maker in the UK locale:
 knoppix desktop=wmaker lang=uk 
== Accessing disks and partitions while outside KDE ==
You may have noticed there are no desktop disk icons when you are using an alternative to KDE. Luckily, you can still use KDE's disk management tools, even when you are outside KDE. For example:
#Start Knoppix into Window Maker.
#Click the “''XTerm''” icon, which is on the right hand side, second from the top. Enter this command:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;kdf&lt;/code&gt;
#Wait while “''[[w:KDiskFree|KDiskFree]]''” starts.
#Right-click the icon of the disk or partition you want. Click “Mount”. Right-click the icon again, then “Open in file manager”.&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Knowing Knoppix (Accessing disks and partitions while outside of KDE 1).png|691px|center|none|thumb]]
#The files on the disk or partition will be displayed.
 '''Important:''' KDiskFree mounts in '''read-write''' mode, not read-only.

== Text mode ==
Text mode is the fastest way to start Knoppix. Text mode is meant for those who are familiar with the UNIX command line interface. There are many excellent books on the subject, such as “Sams Teach Yourself UNIX in 24 Hours”.
=== Starting ===
To start Knoppix in text mode, enter this at the boot prompt.
 knoppix 2

For example, to start with UK keyboard/language, with DMA for faster hard disk access, and without PCMCIA because you're not working on a laptop computer, enter:
 knoppix lang=uk dma nopcmcia 2
=== Leaving ===
Enter this command to exit Knoppix:
 halt
=== Localisation ===
Text mode is called “runlevel 2”. When started in text mode, ''Knoppix''  uses the “C” locale. The C locale is defined as the “default” locale for applications, meaning that their strings are displayed as written in the initial code, without passing through a translation lookup. Just plain old ASCII. Literally, the “C” locale turns off localisation.

To enable localisation, specify the locale that you want to use with the “lang=” option. For example, enter this at the boot prompt to load Knoppix in text mode with the UK regional settings:
 knoppix 2 lang=uk
=== Adjusting the keyboard layout ===
To switch to a UK keyboard layout, type this and press Enter:
 [[w:loadkeys|loadkeys]] uk
The keyboard map will be changed to UK layout.
=== Accessing disks and partitions ===
Use the “mount” command. For example, to mount the first partition on the primary master IDE hard drive:
 cd /mnt
 [[w:Mount (computing)|mount]] hda1

The files on the device &lt;code&gt;/dev/hda1&lt;/code&gt; will be mounted to &lt;code&gt;/mnt/hda1&lt;/code&gt;. To view the files on the partition:
 cd hda1
 ls

The files will be displayed. To learn more about navigating and copying files in text mode, refer to a UNIX manual or text book.
 '''Important'''
 Disks and partitions are mounted '''read-write''' by the mount command.
=== Identifying hardware ===
Use these commands to get hardware information:
{| border=1
!Command
!Shows
|-
|[[w:lspci|lspci]]
|PCI devices
|-
|[[w:lsusb|lsusb]]
|USB devices
|-
|&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/cpuinfo&lt;/code&gt;
|Processor information
|-
|&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/meminfo&lt;/code&gt;
|Random Access Memory details
|-
|&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/scsi/scsi&lt;/code&gt;
|SCSI device information
|-
|[[w:dmesg|dmesg]]
|Kernel messages
|}

== Programming books ==

I beg to differ. The [[Wikibooks:Computer_science_bookshelf]] quite clearly states that every programming languages has it's own book. It would not make sense to have a single book for all the programming languages. There are so many programming languages out there that there is also a [[Programming languages bookshelf]] for them.

There is, however, also a language independent book called [[Computer_programming]].

Besides, [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] is only &quot;proposed policy&quot;&quot; - if it became fixed a loot of books would need to be renamed.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 06:35, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

=== bookshelving policy overhaul ===

However, [[Wikibooks:Computer science bookshelf]], as with all other bookshelves, is severely outdated (mainly due to a bookshelving policy overhaul).  [[Programming languages bookshelf]] is also not among the canonical list of [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves|bookshelves]] as they merely lead to sections of the same book and thus acting as a table of contents page for one book (which itself violates [[WB:NC]]).  Although [[WB:NC]] is proposed policy, it is only so because the details of whether to use &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot; as the sole delimiter still needs to be resolved - in all other aspects it is enforced.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 07:19, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Contributer ===

Change the policy and 30 odd books become 1 - good way to alianate the contributors. Remember: Wikibooks is done by humans - and humans have feelings. And you are going to hurt those feeling big time when you degrade there work from ''book'' to ''section'' with a stroke of a policy-pen.

In this respect anouncing your new policy right here on &quot;Book of the Month&quot; - where hopes are high - was just perfect to get the maximum effect. That is: if hurting other peoples feelings was your aim.

Or are you going to help us in changing 204 pages + 20 odd Template + 3 Categories from &quot;Progamming:Ada:*&quot; into &quot;Ada programming/*&quot; before the end of the month so we can continue to run on &quot;Book of the Month&quot; without you objecting?

And I am shure that 99% of all Programming:* contributors think the same: Programming:* is a bookshelf not a book and they are woking on books not sections.

PS: [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] had a run in August and July and [[Programming:C]] in June - without your objections - so why now.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 08:23, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

==== merely enforcing policy ====

I am not trying to alienate contributors, but merely enforcing [[WB:NC]].  One of the biggest outstanding problems is that our policies are not being enforced or ignored altogether, which we are trying to address.  Why is that [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] is allowed to exist any longer than it has, instead of being merged to [[Programming:C plus plus]]?  It's because [[WB:FP]] isn't being enforced.  Why is it that [[General Chemistry]] contributions continue to break [[WB:NC]]?  Because they are not being enforced.  Even [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] isn't safe.  Wonder why in the past nominations on VFD lasted upwards of 6 months without any action, even though a consensus existed?  That's right, no enforcement.

And it's not just that they are not enfoced, in some cases they '''do not even exist'''.  Why is it that there is no policy on how bookshelves are to be managed?  Why is it that there is no policy on having a consistent book style across multiple books?  Why is it that there is no policy on book title pages?

As for [[Programming]] in general, the style of naming books originated in a (since long rejected) idea of having each book in a separate namespace.  However, creating new namespaces would mean having to modify the MediaWiki software, and it was rejected for that reason.  The good parts about that idea, ie. using &quot;:&quot; as a separator for content that is more graph-oriented, was moved to [[WB:NC]].

In short, I am not trying to alienate contributors, and this is not something that has been unilaterally implemented (see the various policy overhauls that have been suggested by [[User:Aya]]).  Obviously timeframes are inconvienient for many books and book authors to conform to [[WB:NC]] and other policies, and it's going to be a while before existing modules are moved to that effect.  I am not trying to invalidate the nomination of [[Programming:Ada]] or any other section of [[Programming]], but if they are meant to be separate books, then it should follow [[WB:NC]] and not be named as to imply that they are merely sections of a larger book.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 23:36, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

===== policy =====

I confess I misunderstand the [[WB:NC]] - having seen programming first I thought it is Bookshelf:Book:Chapter.

I am fully in favor of enforcing policy and I can live with &quot;Your book got the wrong name - change it&quot;.

I will [[Programming:Ada:Contributors_lounge#New_Name_needed|talk to the other contributors]] and our readers to agree on a new name for [[Programming:Ada]]. Prehaps you would like to join.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 06:11, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

: On the other hand, policies are hardly fleshed out.  Perhaps you would like to join existing discussions and pitch in with your ideas. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 07:59, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

: Programming:Language links have been lying around in the Main Page and in Bookshelves as books for a long time. It is a bit harsh to claim they are not books but sections, precisely on this page. They are books, because their authors have decided them to be so. Whether they are not following a naming policy is another matter. I was the first one to claim for subpages, but never thought they would turned back on Programming:Ada as a stone law. Let's take calm on this and don't allow this discussion to affect the Programming:Ada and Programming:C -/- -/- nominations. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:12, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== August 31, 2005, 00:00 UTC ... ==

... has passed 14:00 hours ago - So what happens next? Or was actualy meant: &quot;August 31, 2005, 24:00 UTC&quot; - which is the first minute of the next day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Giant cell tumors&lt;/b&gt; of the bone are uncommon bone tumors which represent around 4-5% of primary bone tumors and 18% of all benign bone lesions. They are interesting in the fact that their classic radiographic appearance is easily identifiable.

Giant cell tumors can either be benign or malignant, although the majority of them are benign. Radiographically, benign versus malignant tumors are difficult to distinguish. In most patients, the tumor has an indolent course, but repeated local recurrence of the tumor does happen. Approximately 5% of giant cell tumors are defined as malignant. Malignancy usually occurs as the result of malignant transformation after radiation therapy.

These tumors are slightly more common in females, with 50-57% of cases occurring in females. The general age range for giant cell tumors is 20-40 years old. Approximately 85% of tumors occur in the long bones, namely the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius. Another location typical of giant cell tumor is the spine, particularly the sacrum. Spinal involvement is typically in the vertebral body, although its location is variable.

Clinical presentation is nonspecific, and it usually is pain at the tumor site. Pathologic fracture occurs around 10% of the time. Local mass effect can cause a range of symptoms, for example, from posterior expansion into the spinal canal.

== Radiology ==


Spinal involvement is less specific, and vertebral body destruction and collapse can be identified. As described above, the most common location for giant cell tumor is in the vertebral body.
&lt;br&gt;

CT: Imaging findings are similar to that of the plain film.

MRI: Heterogeneous low-to-intermediate T1 and T2 signal for the solid portions of the tumor. Hemosiderin can be seen in 60% of the tumors. Cystic areas are of the typical high T2 signal, and fluid levels can be identified within the tumor. As is typical for MRI, it is helpful in determining the extent and local involvement of the tumor.

Bone scan: Homogeneous uniform uptake, nonspecific.

== Treatment ==

Typical treatment for giant cell tumors is curettage and packing of the lesions. The main complication is local recurrence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Etiology==

&lt;b&gt;Enchondromas&lt;/b&gt; are benign cartilaginous neoplasms that originate in the medullary canal of tubular bones, believed to result from growth of residual benign cartilage rests displaced from the physis.  They are often incidental findings, occurring in just under 2% of the population based on autopsy series.

Approximately half of all enchondromas occur in the tubular bones of the hands and feet, with others are found in the metaphyses of other long bones.  They rarely occur in the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and axial skeleton.

==Radiology==

Radiographically, enchondromas appear as geographic, mildly expansile, lytic lesions, which may lead to mild cortical thinning.  The zone of transition is narrow, although it can be lobular.  A cartilaginous matrix (rings and arcs) is often present, less often in lesions occurring in the hands and feet.  There is no cortical break through or host response in the absence of fracture.  Enchondromas are usually monostotic, although multiple lesions can occur in the feet and hands.  On MR, they have typical signal characteristics of chondroid lesions with low signal on T1 and very high signal on T2 (due to high water and mucopolysaccharide content).

==Differential Diagnosis==
Enchondromas are usually easy to characterize.  However, other diagnostic considerations include:

Hands and feet: epidermoid inclusion cyst, giant cell tumor, aneurismal bone cyst, simple bone cyst, and fibrous dysplasia.

Other sites:  infarction, chondromyxoid fibroma (rare, generally lacks matrix, and favors the proximal tibia).

The more difficult diagnostic dilemma is distinguishing enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcoma.  The latter are usually larger, occur in less typical places, generally occur more proximal, and may have deeper and more pronounced endosteal scalloping.  More importantly, local pain related to the lesion is always concerning for malignancy.

==Complications==
Pathologic fracture and malignant transformation (the latter is rare in enchondromas of the feet and hands).

==Related Diseases==
Related disorders:

[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Ollier disease|Ollier's disease]] is a rare developmental disorder characterized by enchondroma formation in the metaphyses and diaphyses of multiple long bones, typically unilateral and involving one extremity.  Ollier's disease is not hereditary or familial.  It usually presents early with deformed epiphyses.  The enchondromas of Ollier's disease may have different radiographic manifestations than those of classic enchondroma with striated lucency and densities and most have some chondroid matrix.  Risk for malignant transformation is believed to be around 10-25%.

[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Maffuci syndrome|Maffuci's syndrome]] is defined as multiple enchondromatosis with soft tissue and visceral hemangiomas.  Patients with Maffucci's syndrome are believed to be at far greater risk for malignant transformation than those with Ollier's disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook is concerned with explaining the concepts of computer graphics to a non-technical audience. Most books on computer graphics are written from the perspective of a programmer who is attempting to complete an implementation of some algorithms, be they a computer game, a ray-tracer, or an animation system. 

In contrast, this Wikibook seeks to explain the concepts of computer graphics to someone who has no intention of implementing anything and only a basic level of math knowledge (and patience). Such a reader might be an artist who seeks to better understand the systems he uses to produce his art or video game content, someone who is attempting to get started in computer graphics but has no previous experience, or perhaps just a curious person who would like to know more about the graphics that increasingly make up the media we experience. 

Since we are starting at the very beginning, our first step will be to define the problem that the techniques of computer graphics attempt to solve. So to begin our discussion, we shall make a first (clumsy) attempt at explaining the problem by saying that '''the main problem in computer graphics is how to create a desired image'''. 

Given the number of different reasons people want to create images, a statement that encompasses all of computer graphics must necessarily be vague. In order to give a better sense of what we are trying to understand, we'll discuss some specific problems that computer graphics attempts to solve. 

One of the most common uses for computer graphics is the creation of an image that looks like a photograph from real life, but portrays something we could not actually take a picture of. For example, we might want to create an animation for a movie that portrays an alien creature or location, or we might want to create an architectural rendering to get an idea of what the final building will look like. We'll call this type of computer graphics '''photo-realistic'''. Typically there is a significant amount of time available for creating these images, and so the techniques often attempt to capture the properties of lights and surfaces as accurately as possible, at the expense of time needed to compute the image. 

Another common use for computer graphics is the creation of images very quickly so that they can be used in an interactive animation; the application of these algorithms that most people are familiar with is computer games. As a user controls their character, we want to create a series of images very quickly (hopefully 30 per second or more) that respond to their inputs. We'll refer to this type of computer graphics as '''real-time''', or '''interactive'''. We might want these images to look as realistic as possible, but the fact of the situation is that if we have more time to devote to computation, we can create better results. Thus, real-time computer graphics is usually concerned with techniques for creating the best-looking picture possible with the very short amount of time available between frames.

There are many other applications for computer graphics as well. We might be interested in automating a complex picture that we could make by hand for convenience, or we might be interested in creating an image that is abstract or random in nature. In fact, there are many applications of computer graphics that fall somewhere in-between the two extremes presented above, such as medical imaging and visualization systems. However, for an introductory text, it will suffice to present the two main techniques that are mixed and matched for the desired results in practice.

In the text that follows, we'll begin by attempting to understand the concepts of pixels and how computer represent color, which is the format for what computer graphics algorithms output. After that, we'll consider how we represent the input data that programs in computer graphics use, the 3D objects that get rendered. With these basics out of the way, we'll then delve into the techniques of photo-realistic and real-time rendering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Ollier's disease&lt;/b&gt; 


Ollier's Disease is a rare condition in which benign tumors form in developing bones and prevent proper bone growth. It is also known as Multiple Enchondromatosis. The condition was first described by French surgeon Louis Ollier (1830-1899).

In individuals with Ollier's disease, benign tumors called enchondromas form in the cartilage cells of the long bones, usually o­n o­ne side of the body, preventing cartilage production, calcification and growth. As a result, bones 

o­n o­ne side of the body are shorter than o­n the other. The difference in length continues to increase until bone growth is completed, typically at adolescence. Other bones can be affected including, but not limited to pelvic, rib and skull. The bones are also more prone to fractures. 

These tumors can become malignant (cancerous)in the form of chondrosarcoma. Therefore, periodic bone scans are recommended to detect possible malignancies early, and so limit the extent of the damage. Although the exact cause of Ollier's Disease is not known, it is believed to be a random spontaneous mutation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first thing we'd like to understand is what a digital image &quot;is.&quot; This work being primarily concerned with the generation of digital images (and computers being digital, we have no other alternatives within the field of computer graphics), understanding what those are will be essential to understanding the intuition of many algorithms that follow. Most of those algorithms approach the complexity of computer graphics by working backwards from the final form of the digital image as a way to reduce the scope of the problem.

When you look around the world, light from the world comes into your eyeballs and is focused on an area on the back of your eye which is covered with millions of little cells. These cells are sensitive to various aspects of light, like color and brightness, and react with the light so that a signal is sent to your brain about which cell saw what sort of light, and your brain creates a complete picture from all these constituent pieces of information. 

Unsurprisingly, we attempt to capture images by a similar, though man-made process. A film camera acts very much like an eye, in that light is taken in through the lens, and focused on a surface covered with millions of similarly light-sensitive elements. However, these elements are chemically treated grains of film instead of retinal cells. When the light comes into contact with the chemicals on the film, it causes a reaction that changes the structure of those chemicals, and in so doing records the information about what kind of light came through. The film can later be processed to create a print-out that replicates those colors using the information on the film. 

A digital camera works very much the same way, except that instead of placing a chemically-treated strip of film behind the lens, an array of light-sensitive semiconductors is used instead. These elements convert the information about the light they interact with into numbers encoded to represent light. Thus, we can consider a digital image to be a set of data which provides information about the light used to create a particular image. 

In fact, since a digital image is really just a collection of numbers, the concept exists outside the realm of photography as well; we could in theory consider any stream of numbers, properly formatted and in digital form, to be a digital image. '''The key technique of computer science is that of creating such a dataset purposely, element-by-element, without the use of any photographic equipment or actual light of any sort to base the image on.'''

Small cakes made with a primary ingredient, mixed with batter, and fried, are found in many American cuisines. &quot;Corn fritters&quot;' and &quot;apple fritters&quot; are well known. Fritters may use regular flour, cornmeal, or a mix. In a good fritter, the taste of the primary ingredient should predominate and not be overwhelmed by the taste of the batter. New England clam cakes, Maryland crab cakes, and Philadelphia scrapple are essentially varieties of fritter.

In Canada a fritter is a variety of holeless doughnut with apple flavoured ones being the most popular.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nominative case ==

=== Nominative case vs. Accusative ===

The nominative case is what is used for the subject of the sentence, e.g. what is acting.  This is in contrast to the accusative case, which is used for the object--what is acted upon.

For an English example, we will use the following sentence:

*I pet the dog.

In this example, '''I''' is the subject so it is put into the nominative.  '''The dog''', on the other hand, is put into the accusative because it is the object.

English does not alter or mark nouns to express case, but rather requires that a strict word order be used (Subject/nominative, Verb, Object) when building sentences from which a noun's case can be automatically inferred.
For example, in the following sentences:

*The dog bites the man.
*The man bites the dog

'''The dog''' in the first sentence must be the subject (and so in the nominative case), as it precedes the verb and object (in this case '''the man'''). In the second sentence, word order is reversed and so are the roles of the nouns in turn.

Finnish, however, does not depend on word order the way that English does to express the case of a noun.

== Accusative case ==

The accusative is the grammatical case used to mark the direct object of a verb.

----

=== Exercise Number One ===

Make both singular and plural accusative forms of the following nouns.

# '''lehti'''
# '''mökki'''
# '''ranskalainen'''
# '''tuuletin'''
# '''alus'''
# '''vaaka'''

----

=== Exercise Number Two ===

Please translate the following short English sentences into Finnish. You must use accusative.

1.&lt;br&gt;
'''I saw the cottage.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I saw the cottages.'''&lt;br&gt;

2.&lt;br&gt;
'''I noticed the name.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I noticed the names.'''&lt;br&gt;

3.&lt;br&gt;
'''I brought the key.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I brought the keys.'''&lt;br&gt;

4.&lt;br&gt;
'''I heard the piece of news.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I heard the news.'''&lt;br&gt;

5.&lt;br&gt;
'''I read the newspaper completely.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I read the newspapers completely.'''&lt;br&gt;

6.&lt;br&gt;
'''I saw the Frenchman and the Swede.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I saw the Frenchmen and the Swedes.'''&lt;br&gt;

7.&lt;br&gt;
'''I bought the computer and the carpet.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I bought the computers and the carpets.'''&lt;br&gt;

8.&lt;br&gt;
'''I saw the building and the statue.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''I saw the buildings and the statues.'''&lt;br&gt;

----

=== Exercise Number Three ===

Translate the following sentences into English. Pay attention to the difference between accusative and partitive and tell which is used.

1. '''Ammuin linnun.'''&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Ammuin lintua.'''&lt;br&gt;

3. '''Katsoin elokuvaa.'''&lt;br&gt;
4. '''Katsoimme elokuvan.'''&lt;br&gt;

5. '''Luitko sanomalehteä?'''&lt;br&gt;
6. '''Luin sanomalehden.'''&lt;br&gt;

7. '''Kuuntelimme pitkän puheen.'''&lt;br&gt;
8. '''Kuuntelimme pitkää puhetta.'''&lt;br&gt;

9. '''Onko teillä rahat?'''&lt;br&gt;
10. '''Onko hänellä rahaa?'''&lt;br&gt;

11. '''Tarvitsen paperia.'''&lt;br&gt;
12. '''Tarvitsen paperit.'''&lt;br&gt;

13. '''Korjasin uudet tietokoneet.'''&lt;br&gt;
14. '''Korjasin uusia tietokoneita.'''&lt;br&gt;

----

=== Exercise Number Four ===

Please translate the following sentences into English. Some nouns are in partitive and some in accusative.

# '''Ostin kilon omenat.'''
# '''Ostin kilon omenoita.'''
# '''Talot ja aidat on maalattu.'''
# '''Taloja ja autoteitä on korjattu tällä alueella.
# '''Hain tavarat. Sitten otin mukaani viivaimen ja muutamia työkaluja.'''
# '''Näin työpaikallani ruotsalaiset ja norjalaiset joista kerroit. Näin siellä myös aitoja espanjalaisia.

== Partitive case ==

Partitive is used always in singular if:
-We are talking about a material (water, air, metals, food etc.) and it doesn't work as subject of the sentences.
-After numbers different from 1 (for example: two cars -&gt; 2 autoa).
-With some verbs
-When the object is general

----

=== Exercise Number One ===

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{}}&quot;
| '''1. Three books.'''
| '''6. Four litres.'''
|-
| '''2. Five euros.'''
| '''7. 500 citizens'''
|-
| '''3. Eight years.'''
| '''8. A half kilo.'''
|-
| '''4. A hundred trees. -'''
| '''9. Many tons'''
|-
| '''5. A lot of money.'''
| '''10. 0.25 kilometres.'''
|}

----

=== Exercise Number Two ===

Make both singular and plural partitive form of these nouns.

An example:
'''talo''' -&gt;   
'''taloa'''(singular), '''taloja'''(plural)

# '''kissa'''
# '''kenkä'''
# '''kirja'''
# '''ovi'''
# '''kello'''
# '''työ'''
# '''raha'''
# '''ihminen'''
# '''kone'''
# '''Nieminen'''

Translate then these sentences into Finnish.

* '''I mean the book.'''
* '''I mean the doors.'''
* '''I am using a machine.'''
* '''I wear a hat.'''

----

=== Exercise Number Three ===

* '''Talo'''
* (minun) taloani, (minun) talojani
* (sinun) taloasi, (sinun) talojasi
* (hänen) taloansa, (hänen) talojansa
* (meidän) taloamme, (meidän) talojamme
* (teidän) taloanne, (teidän) talojanne
* (heidän) taloansa, (heidän) talojansa

# '''katto'''
# '''takki'''
# '''lehti'''
# '''kenkä'''

----

=== Exercise Number Four  ===

Many verbs put the following noun in partitive form. Please make grammatically correct sentences by using the given words (a verb, a possessive pronoun, and a noun) and translate into English. An example:

*'''Tarkoitan - sinun, koti -&gt; Tarkoitan kotiasi''' (I mean your home)

1. '''Tarkoitan - sinun, työ'''&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Katson - sinun, hattu'''&lt;br&gt;
3. '''Tarvitsen - sinun, apu'''&lt;br&gt;

4. '''Tarkoitan - minun, elämä'''&lt;br&gt;
5. '''Käytän - minun, tietokone'''&lt;br&gt;
6. '''Tarkoitan - minun, osoite'''&lt;br&gt;

7. '''Tarvitsen - hänen, apu'''&lt;br&gt;
8. '''Käytän - hänen, avain'''&lt;br&gt;
9. '''Kuuntelen - hänen, puhe'''&lt;br&gt;

10. '''Tarkoitan - meidän, tehdas'''&lt;br&gt;
11. '''Korjaan - meidän, tietokone'''&lt;br&gt;

12. '''Katselen - teidän, kokoelma'''&lt;br&gt;
13. '''Ihailen - teidän, alus'''&lt;br&gt;

14. '''Käytän - heidän, tuuletin'''&lt;br&gt;
15. '''Rakastan - heidän, tytär'''&lt;br&gt;

----

# '''He has got many computers.'''
# '''They always use the backdoor.''' (backdoor = takaovi)

----

=== Exercise Number Seven  ===

# '''Juon kahvia, syön kakkuasi ja luen kirjojasi.'''
# '''Tarkoitan kaikkia kaupunkimme rakennuksia, en vain tuota rakennusta.'''
# '''Tarkoitan omaa taloani enkä sinun taloasi.'''

# '''Kotiimme saa tulla!'''
# '''Jalkaani koskee ja silmiini särkee.'''

----

=== Exercise Number Eight ===

Some nouns in partitive in the following sentences have errors. Try to spot and correct them as fast as possible!

# '''Luin yhtä elektroniikkalehtiä ja joitakin aikakauslehteä.'''
# '''Hän joi oluttaa ja söi kahta pihveä.'''
# '''Rakastan sinoa ja kauniitasi kasvotasi.'''
# '''Katsoin kääretä ja sen koristellisiä kuvioita.'''
# '''En voi sietää hänen virheitän ja kummallisuuksinan.'''

== Essive case ==

The essive or case carries the meaning of a temporary state of being, often equivalent to the English &quot;as a...&quot;.

In the Finnish language, this case is marked by adding &quot;-na/-nä&quot; to the stem of the noun.
Example:
* &quot;lapsi&quot; -&gt; &quot;child&quot;
* &quot;lapsena&quot; -&gt; &quot;as a child&quot;, &quot;when (I/he/you) was a child&quot;.
* &quot;lapsina&quot; -&gt; &quot;as children&quot;, &quot;when (we/you'all/they) were children&quot;

In Finnish, it is also used for specifying times, days and dates when something happens. For example:
* &quot;maanantaina&quot; -&gt; &quot;on Monday&quot;
* &quot;kuudentena joulukuuta&quot; -&gt; &quot;on the 6th of December&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The GUIDE Toolbox provided by MATLAB allows advanced MATLAB programmers to provide Graphical User Interfaces to their programs. GUIs are useful because they remove end users from the command line interface of MATLAB and provide an easy way to share code across nonprogrammers. In addition by using special compilers the mathematical ability of MATLAB seamlessly blends in with the GUI functionality provided. Just to provide an example, assume you are writing a nonlinear fitting system based on the levenburg marquardt algorithm. Implementing a same GUI in VC++ would take at least a month of effort. But in MATLAB with the existing nlinfit function the time for such an endeavor would be hours instead of days.

The figure shows an example of a simple GUI created with the GUIDE toolbox, it takes as input two numbers adds them and displays them in the third textbox, very simple but it helps illustrate the fact that such a GUI was created in minutes. The first section we need to understand is the concept of a callback

==CallBack==

A callback is a functions executed whenever the user initiates an action by clicking for example on a button or pressing a key on the keyboard. Programming a callback is therefore the most important part of writing a GUI. For example in the GUI illustrated above, we would need to program a callback for the button '''Add'''. This is provided as a callback in the code. The code is provided below and illustrates how to write a simple callback.

&lt;font color=#666666&gt;% --- Executes on button press in pushbutton1. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
function pushbutton1_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles)&lt;br&gt;
% hObject    handle to pushbutton1 (see GCBO)&lt;br&gt;
% eventdata  reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB&lt;br&gt;
% handles    structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA)&lt;br&gt;
n1 = get(handles.edit2,'string');&lt;br&gt;
n2 = get(handles.edit1,'string');&lt;br&gt;
S = str2double(n1) + str2double(n2);&lt;br&gt;
set(handles.edit3,'String',num2str(S))&lt;br&gt;


In this piece of code I get the numbers as strings from the edit boxes and then convert them into numbers using the str2double function provided in MATLAB. I then set the string for the other edit box as the sum of these two numbers. This completes the simple example of a GUI needed to add two numbers. To illustrate a more complex example I show how a simple exponential function can be plotted and you can change the function's parameters. With a little bit of imagination you could make it plot any arbitrary function you enter. To make the example even more complex I have two GUIs, one is the control GUI and the other is the plotting GUI, this allows the user to program some of the more complicated functionality expected out of the modern GUI systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Monopoly/Header|title=STRATEGY}}
Monopoly involves a substantial portion of luck with the roll of the dice to determinine whether a player gets to own key properties or lands on squares with high rents. Even the initial misfortune of going last is a significant disadvantage because one is more likely to land on property which has already been bought and therefore be forced to pay rent instead of having an opportunity to buy unowned property.

There are, however, many strategic decisions which allow skilled players to win more often than the unskilled. The fundamental strategic point is that securing monopolies (all the properties in a colour group) is the way to amass wealth, but monopolies arise more through trade than through chance.  In a standard six-player game, there is a fair probability that none of the players will be able to buy all of one colour group without trading. If no monopolies emerge by chance, and the players do not trade, it is rare for anyone to be eliminated. The game could last indefinitely with the $200 for passing Go, thus keeping the poorer players from going [[Monopoly/Official_Rules#Bankruptcy_and_Resignation|bankrupt]].

Since monopolies are the key to victory, and monopolies arise by the exchange of property from one player to another, a well-played game of Monopoly is from start to finish a game of trading, negotiation, and diplomacy as well as the occasional well-timed &quot;tactical dirty trick&quot; (such as creating a building shortage).

==Trading and blocking==

Players must be aware of the strategic value of each property at any particular time, considering who needs it to complete a monopoly and which properties in that group are as yet unowned. As soon as two players between them own all the properties in two colour groups, they are likely to make some sort of bargain whereby each of them obtains a monopoly because, if they are the first to be able to build houses and hotels, they each have a much better chance of winning.

==Cash management==
Apart from property trading, the most important strategic decisions involve cash management. There is great pressure to acquire properties and to build houses and hotels as soon as possible in order to collect large rents. On the other hand, a player who does not have the cash to pay a large rent may be forced to tear down houses, getting only half the invested cash back. It can be as dangerous to build as it is to refrain from building.

Furthermore, holding cash is important when unowned property is landed on and must be auctioned, as well as important when there is a shortage of houses and the remaining houses are auctioned.  Being cash poor can lead to frustration when another player gets a good deal in an auction in which you cannot compete. Also, holding cash allows one to cut favorable deals with a player who is cash poor. For example, a player who would be forced to undevelop his property to pay a large rent might decide to sell some other undeveloped property for cash, even though he would normally be reluctant to trade property for anything other than property. If only one player has significant cash reserves, that player has considerable negotiating leverage.

Because of the importance of cash, many players treat any ungrouped property they own primarily as a cash source through which they can develop their monopolies. Holding unmortgaged and undeveloped property is rather similar to holding a cash reserve because mortgaging is relatively inexpensive. To de-mortgage a mortgaged property costs only 10% more than the cash received for mortgaging whereas to rebuild a house one has torn down costs 100% more than the cash received for tearing it down.

Another thing to be considered when it comes to cash is that a player is not required by the official Monopoly rules nor the ''Official Tournament Rules'' to disclose to opponents how much cash he or she has. This is important because in many situations opponents can take an advantage when estimating how much cash the other player has. For example, a player may be more willing to trade an opponent the final property in a color group (thereby giving that opponent a monopoly) if the player sees that the opponent doesn't have enough cash to place buildings on that monopoly.

While the route to victory in Monopoly is clearly to build houses and hotels to take maximum rent, a player is unlikely to be able to acquire a complete set of properties in a game with four or more participants, except by trading. It is therefore very useful to be able to determine which colour groups are more valuable.

The overall value of any property is determined by a combination of four factors:
# Buying cost (not usually important as players can't choose where they land and players usually buy everything they land on)
# House/hotel cost
# Rent charged
# Position on the board (visitation frequency)

The first three factors are obvious: valuable properties have a better ratio of expenditure to return. The fourth factor is more interesting because it determines how often players will land on each property and thus pay rent to its owner. In recent years, computer simulations have allowed a probabilistic analysis of the frequency with which each square is visited during the average game.

For instance, the Jail square is the most commonly visited space in the game because of the &quot;Go to Jail&quot; square, the chance and community chest cards directing a player there and the rule that a throw of three successive doubles also sends a player there. Combined with the fact that a player is most likely to throw 6, 7, or 8 when moving away from Jail than he is to throw 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 or 12, this means that the overall probability of visiting an orange property is far higher than that of visiting a light purple/pink property, for instance. Similarly, because there are only two properties in each of the dark blue and dark purple/brown sets, these sets are visited correspondingly less often, although Boardwalk does have a chance card.


===Best improvable properties===
Among improvable properties (properties that can have houses or hotels built on them), the ''orange'' set is far superior to any other: It is visited quite often (it is located at a moderate distance after the Jail square), and property costs are relatively cheap, and the prospect of collecting damaging rents without too much investment is excellent.

The runner-up for best improvable properties is the ''red'' set&amp;mdash;statistics demonstrate that while the orange are landed on more often ''as a group,'' Illinois Avenue ''(Equivalent Property in U.K. Edition = Trafalgar Square)'' is landed on most often as a single entity. In addition, it catches many people who happen to overrun the orange properties on their way out of jail.

As a general rule, the second colour group on each side of the board has a far better cost-to-value ratio because the houses and hotels cost the same as the first colour group but yield higher rent. The major exception to this strategy is the red group over the yellow group for the reasons outlined above.

===Other improvable properties===
Similarly to red, the ''light purple'' set gets many landings from people leaving jail but not getting very far.  The ''light blue'' set, on the other hand, receives many hits from people coming from the Go square.  The ''dark purple/brown'' set is far inferior; though inexpensive, is often skipped and collects little rent. The ''yellow'' set doesn't get nearly as many hits as the reds, but they can dominate later in the game. The ''Green'' set is very expensive, although with hotels it will collect the most income. The ''dark blue'' set has only two properties, so they are landed on less often than the other sets; however, their high rents can often cripple other players. A player who uses these relative values as a guide to trading ought to do better than chance in the long run.

==Tactics==
* The most likely number to roll is 7 (given that you are using two dice each with 6 faces). As you depart from 7, the probabilities decrease piecewise. In other words, the probability of rolling 6, or 8, is slightly less than 7; the probability of rolling 5 or 9 slightly less, still, until you reach 2 and 12, with the least probabilities. Use this information to predict where both you or your opponents will land on their next roll. If an opponent is approaching a street you own, the best property to build an extra house on is the one located as close to seven spaces distant from his as possible.

* Early in the game when many properties are unowned, it is a disadvantage to be in Jail. A player should pay the fine and get moving with an eye to landing on unowned property or at least passing Go. Later in the game, when properties are highly developed, it can be an advantage to be in Jail so as to avoid paying high rents. At that stage it is better to refuse to pay the fine and to attempt to roll doubles.

* The average income a player receives from one round of the board is $170. This includes rent earned, rent paid, money from Go, fines and rewards.

* When landing on the Income Tax square, a player is not allowed to calculate his assets before deciding whether to pay $200 or 10% of his assets.  However, there is a simple rule of thumb that works well in practice.  Since players start with $1500 and collect $200 for passing Go each time, it is generally better to pay 10% until passing Go for the third time.  Barring exceptionally good or bad fortune, the third time past Go is the time when a player's assets exceed $2000, and once above $2000, a player is not likely to dip below until late in the game when he has paid some drastic rents and is on the verge of elimination.

* The increased rent for houses takes a long time to pay off the initial investment if there are only one or two houses per property.  Starting with the third house, rents rise dramatically and pay off the investment correspondingly faster.  If a player owns two colour groups, it is much better for them to put three or four houses on each property in one group (leaving the other group undeveloped) than it is to put two houses everywhere.  Similarly, it is unwise for a player to deeply mortgage themselves to develop a monopoly unless they can build to at least the third house.

* If there is a shortage of houses, players should consider buying the last houses rather than buying hotels because each hotel built returns four houses to the bank for other players to use.  When there are no houses in the bank, no one else can build houses.  Also, players with hotels can't easily convert them to cash in this situation; they would have to strip an entire colour group of its hotels to raise money since buildings must be removed evenly from a colour group and because the hotels cannot be exchanged for houses since there are no houses in the bank. The owners of inexpensive monopolies should be particularly eager to use this tactic to prevent the owners of expensive monopolies from fully developing.

* Occasionally, when there is a housing shortage, it can pay to tear down houses on one colour group to immediately build them on a different colour group.  However, if another player declares an interest in buying the houses you have torn down, you will have to outbid that player for them, so this tactic pays off only when you are buying the torn down houses for expensive properties anyway, and you have much cash, and the other likely bidders are cash poor.

* If the game is deadlocked with players holding properties of different color groups, the railway stations and utility properties can prove to be a great source of income. A crafty player who is able to acquire all four railroads collects $200 every time another player lands on them. In addition, the railroads are very frequently landed on as one is located on each side of the board and the presence of chance cards which directs a player to a certain railway station.. This can prove to be a real thorn to other players, as the $200 rent robs them of their $200 collected from passing the GO Square. Even in games with monopolies being developed, this can severely hinder an opponents cash flow in developing their monopoly, sometimes forcing them to tear down houses or mortgage other properties. The utility properties are not as universally useful. In games with four or more players, they can be a cost-efficient way of collecting rent if the player owns both utilities and monopolies have yet to be established. Their value however, drops considerably if monopolies have been fully established, the player only owns one of the set or in a game with only two or three players. 
 
* In a game with many players, it is advantageous to make trades even if you are &quot;getting the short end of the stick&quot; because the trade will be a burden for your opponents.  For example, there is a four-player game and player 1 is going to trade with player 2.  They are going to give each other properties so that each will then have a monopoly.  The space that player 1 will get is worth a little less than the space he is going to give player 2.  Should he go ahead and trade?  Yes.  Let&amp;#8217;s say that player 1 is trading away a space worth 4 units in return for one worth 3 units.  Although he will net -1 units initially, the other two players in the game (players 3 and 4) will be forced to pay for player 2&amp;#8217;s newly acquired monopoly.   This will offset the -1 unit disadvantage of the trade.  In other words, player 1 is getting the advantage because the trade, although initially bad for him, will hinder the other 2 players in the game.  When in doubt, it is usually best to go ahead and trade (if not for any other reason, just to keep the game moving.  Many games are ruined because all four players are stuck in a [[w:stalemate|stalemate]], refusing to trade anything).

*When building houses in a colour group, a player should usually build the first house of a level of houses on the last property of the colour group. The second house of the level should be usually built on the first property of the colour group, unless the colour group is the light-blue or orange colour group. The same applies to hotels (which, for practical purposes, can be considered as five houses or four houses when the standardized ''Rules for a Short Game'' are used). This tactic is based on the fact that usually the rent [[w:mathematical expectancy|mathematical expectancy]] (the average of the expected rent) is higher when houses are built in that order.

::Example for the light-purple colour group:

{| border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4 align=center
| Step || Property 1 || Property 2 || Property 3 
|-
| 1 || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || House 
|-
| 2 || House || &amp;nbsp; || House
|-
| 3 || House || House || House
|}


*A player should always be diplomatic with players because, especially at the end of the game, opponents who are likely to lose can take revenge of players who are likely to win and make them lose against other players who are also likely to win. For example, let us say there is a player who cannot pay his debt without making trades; but, because of his situation of being likely to go bankrupt in the next few turns anyway, sells all his properties at a relatively low price to an opponent other than the creditor of that debt. Then the player who gets the properties is also likely to form complete colour groups with the newly acquired properties and is likely to defeat the creditor of the debt. Such a player who decides who wins or loses the game is sometimes referred to as a &quot;king-maker&quot; because that player decides who gets &quot;crowned&quot;.

*An interesting strategy when the auctioning rule is in play is to carefully monitor the cash flow of the other players when you are buying property.  Generally early in the game, when players are busy buying properties, they get rather low on cash rather quickly.  This is normally not that bad since the rents for properties are of minor value in the beginning, but you can turn this situation in your favor.  When you land on a property, instead of buying it from the bank at the price listed, you can take advantage of the fact that the rest of the players have little money and decide to auction instead.  By doing this you can actually buy properties for less than the assessed value (the value listed on the board).  Doing this can give you a substantial tactical advantage by increasing your assets without spending as much money and gain money earning properties as well.  This can be risky however, as other players may try to outbid you anyway by mortgaging properties or &quot;pull a rabbit out of their hat&quot; and come up with some cash you didn't notice earlier (like hiding a $500 note under a stack of $1 notes, for instance).  This strategy works best if you are in a cash-strong position when the other players have small amounts of cash and when there are fewer players in the game, especially just two players.

The example used for building houses in a color group is unclear.  The example is misleading because makes it seem as though Property 2 ends up with only one house while Property 3 has three houses.  Obviously that is impossible because you cannot build unevenly.  Please fix this.

I thought everyone knew that the orange properties were the most valuable on the board. They are most likely to be landed on due to their position in relation to the jail, they are affordable to develop.
anyone who gets a monopoly on this set early has won the game.

We recognize and name certain broad categories of color, like &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;yellow,&quot; but it is very difficult to formalize the notion of color so that you could observe, say, a blouse of a given color and then describe it to a friend so that they would have exactly the same picture in mind. 

Nonetheless, for computer graphics to work, we must be able to come up with just such a description. In fact, we must go further than that and create an encoding for colors so that we can represent them in digital form as numbers. Fortunately, it turns out that light lends itself to such an encoding. A full treatment of color, including the properties of light that it represents, the way the eye perceives it, and the range of different representations for it is not important at the moment (see the useful links below for more detailed information). 

For our purposes, it will be adequate to note that most colors we need to deal with can be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue intensities. That is, we will represent a color as three values: the intensity of red light in a given color, the intensity of blue light in a given color, and the intensity of green light in a given color. We call each of these component colors '''channels''', and we call this system of color representation the '''RGB color space''' (or just '''RGB'''). 

If we devote one [[w:byte|byte]] for each type of color, then we can represent 256 different levels of intensity for each component color. In this scheme, when a given value is at its maximum (255), this is the brightest, most intense amount of that color that we can represent, and when it is at its minimum (0), this is the lowest amount of that color we can have contributing to the color. 

Colors that are not one of the component colors can be represented by the correct combination of the component colors. For example, we can represent purple by setting the red and blue components to high levels, and while leaving the green component low or equal to zero. 

A very important thing to understand in computer graphics is that when all three color components are all equal to the same value, the resulting color is a shade of gray. Specifically, when all three components are at the maximum level (255, 255, 255), we perceive the combined color as white, and when all three components are at the minimum level (0,0,0), we perceive the combined color as black. 

It is also worth noting that our choice of one byte per color channel is fairly arbitrary. Other systems of representation use fewer or more possible values per color channel. Having three color channels of 256 possible values each results in about 16.7 million colors, but in real life we perceive many, many more. For example, if we have to represent a smooth transition from black to bright red (due to shadow, let's say), we would find that having only 256 discrete colors in between the two would result in visible &quot;bands&quot; of color if we were really concerned about image quality. Thus, computer graphics professionals in film production often allow tens of thousands of possible values for each of the three color channels. On the opposite end of the spectrum, to allow older computers to operate more efficiently, programmers would sometimes only allow 32 possible values for each of the red, green, and blue components. Even with only a few thousand colors to choose from, surprisingly realistic images could be represented.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Monopoly/Header|title=HOUSE RULES}}
The game of Monopoly has many variations, even in the rules. Many casual Monopoly players are surprised and disappointed to discover that some of the rules they are used to are not actually part of the [[Monopoly/Official Rules|official rules]].  Some of these house rules include the following.

==Free parking cash==
A very common house rule is to have a ''pool'' of cash based at the ''Free Parking'' space (or in the centre of the board, since there is more room there).  A player who lands on Free Parking collects the cash, and the pool is restarted.  The pool may be built in several different ways, for example:

* by sending Jail fines to the pool
* by paying the fines and taxes on the Community Chest and Chance cards into the pool rather than to the bank
* by placing a predetermined amount of money from the bank into the pool at the beginning of the game and whenever it is emptied (for example, a $500 bill, the largest currency amount in the game)
* by requiring every player who passes Free Parking without landing on it to pay in a specified amount
* by paying income and luxury tax/super tax to the pool
* some people play by a rule where $500 or $686 ($686 = $500 + $100 + $50 + $20 + $10 + $5 + $1) is put in the pool at the start and the first lucky person to land on it gets the money. After that, $500 or $686 may be put in there every time it is emptied.
* some people place the final unsold property into the pool as soon as the penultimate property has been purchased, and it must be won by whoever lands on Free Parking. Any player who lands on the property in question while it is in the pool may not buy it. One variation of this is to have players pay the base rent price for landing on that property into the pool to ensure a larger reward for whoever lands on Free Parking.
*some people put &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; cards into Free Parking when used instead of returning them to the Chance or Community Chest piles.

==Go and movement==
* According to the official rules each player receives $200 for passing Go.  However, due to the chance and community chest cards which instruct players to advance to Go and collect $200 - a popular house rule is that you collect $200 for landing on Go plus $200 for actually passing Go.  Therefore, it is common to pay someone $400 for landing directly on Go: $200 for actually landing on Go plus the $200 as an advance for their next move when they literally pass Go. Some house rules award a player $300, $400, or some other bonus for landing exactly on Go, instead of the aforementioned $200.
* A player must either completely travel around the board (having collected $200 by passing Go) or roll the dice a certain number of times before he is allowed to purchase property - landing on a property or station space has no effect during that time, while other squares function as normal.
* No players may purchase property before all players have passed Go at least 5 times.
* No players may purchase property until ONE player has passed Go. This rule is similar to the one above but makes the game go a little faster. This rule and the one above are good with games with 5 or more players.
* Players are allowed to &quot;take a chance&quot; when they land on a Chance square. They have the option 1) to draw a chance card, or 2) to do nothing and sit freely on the square.  No choice is given, however, when landing on a Community Chest square; the player ''must'' draw a card from the appropriate deck.
*If a player lands directly on Go, he or she has the right to not collect their $200 and instead move their game piece to any place on the board.
*If a player does not specifically ask for their money from &quot;Go&quot; then then they may not collect after their turn is over. 
If you advance to a property you may not tax or force another player to pay

==Snake eyes==
When someone rolls two ones (or move two spaces) they get a cash bonus; reported variations of this house rule award $100, or $500, or $1000, or one of each bill from the bank (for a total of $686, or if you make $1000, $1686), or even five of each bill ($3430, or with $1000 bills, $8430).

==Rents and auctions==
The original folk game of Monopoly was played in 1910 as an auction monopoly derived from The landlord's game. Auctions were very much a part of Monopoly until 1930s when the Quakers of Atlantic City eliminated auctions from Monopoly and assigned fixed prices on the board. Jesse Raiford made the fixed prices of Monopoly found on sets today.   

Some house rules omit the auction rule.  That is to say, when a player lands on an unowned property and elects not to purchase it (or in some cases, merely doesn't announce an intention to purchase it before the next player rolls the dice), the property remains unowned, rather than being auctioned among the players. 
Others opt for the opposite extreme. When a player lands on a property, they may only choose between engaging in a public auction for the property or passing. This serves to deplete cash reserves and to force players into making more strategic decisions.

Some house rules disqualify an owner from collecting rent while in jail.  This allows reprieve for other players landing on an expensive property with houses or a hotel during the time a player is incarcerated.

In contrast to the official rules whereby the owner of a landed-on property has until the beginning of the ''second'' following player's turn to demand rent, in many circles the rule used is that the owner must demand rent before the very next player rolls, or even before the same player (having rolled doubles) rolls again.  Further, some rules may claim that if a player lands on somebody's property on a roll of doubles, he/she is not &quot;staying the night&quot; and therefore does not need to pay rent.

Some people play by a rule where if the one who landed on the property does not win the auction, he pays the rent to the winner.

== Mercy rule ==
When a player reaches a certain level of wealth determined by the players, that player automatically wins. When that happens, you have an option to get $1000 or to get all the lots of any group that isn't owned by any of the players.

==Trades and negotiations==

According to some home rules no property trading happens until all properties are owned by someone. At this point, play stops and a flurry of trading proceeds until all players are satisfied.
Trades may be made regardless of a players turn in the game. 
If you are trading property for money and try to cheat the other player by giving him wrong bills but stated an amount you will be sent to jail for three turns and must pay double to get out of jail. You must then pay the player the correct amount.

==Property improvements==

A common house rule is to exclude the requirement of owning all properties of the same colour before being able to buy houses.

Another common house rule is to ignore the amount of available houses the bank possesses allowing players to build them indefinitely. One way to keep track of this amount of houses is to only place them on one property, signifying that amount on all properties of that color group.

Some house rules allow a player to build a hotel directly, even if there's not enough houses in the bank (one hotel equals five houses). This way a building shortage only affects poor players.

Another common house rule allows players to build on a certain property ''only'' when they land on it. Combined with the requirement that properties in a colour group be developed equally, this makes development very slow as it can only be done one house at a time.

According to some house rules, you are able to buy houses and hoard them in order to prevent others from winning

==Property dealing==
At the start of the game, players will draw numbers from a hat, and can choose which set of properties he or she will buy. The next player will go, and the railroads and utilities are treated as properties.
For example, during a 3 person game:
Person #1 chooses Boardwalk and Park Place&lt;/br&gt;
Person #2 chooses the railroads&lt;/br&gt;
Person #3 chooses Atlantic, Ventnor, and Marvin Gardens&lt;/br&gt;
Person #1 chooses Indiana, Illinois, &amp; Kentucky Avenues&lt;/br&gt;
Person #2 chooses States, Virginia, and St. Charles Place&lt;/br&gt;
Person #3 chooses the utilities&lt;/br&gt;
Person #1 chooses Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues&lt;/br&gt;
Person #2 chooses Pennsylvania, Pacific, and North Carolina Avenues&lt;/br&gt;
Person #3 chooses New York, Tennessee, and St. James Place&lt;/br&gt;
The remaining property set (Connecticut, Vermont, and Oriental) is split between the 3 players.

==Original rules for a short game (60 to 90 minutes)==

The official Monopoly rules allow five rules changes for this short game.

# During preparation, the banker shuffles and deals three Title Deed cards to each player. These are ''free''---no payment to the bank is required.
# You need only ''three'' houses (instead of four) on each lot of a complete color-group before you may buy a hotel. Hotel rent remains the same. The turn-in value is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house less than in the regular game.
# If you land in jail ''you must exit on your next turn'' by a) using a &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; card if you have (or can buy) one; or b) rolling doubles; or c) paying $50. Unlike the standard rules, you may try to roll doubles and, if failing to do so, pay the $50 on the same turn.
# The penalty for landing on Income tax is a ''flat $200'' (i.e., the option to pay 10% of cash on hand is removed). The UK version of the game, as well as newer American versions, make Income Tax a flat tax anyway.
# The game ends when ''one player'' goes bankrupt. The remaining players value their property: a) cash on hand; b) lots, utilities, and railroads owned, at the price printed on the board; c) any mortgaged property owned, at one-half the price printed on the board; d) houses, valued at purchase price; e) hotels, valued at purchase price including the value of the three houses turned in. The richest player is then declared the winner.

===Other short games (unofficial rules)===

One way to shorten the game is to play for a predetermined amount of time. When the time limit is reached, the winner is the one with the greatest assets in cash, property, and houses. This method is used for tournament play.

Another way to create a shorter game is to randomly distribute a predetermined number of property cards before the start of the game.

A third way is to play until all have gone around the board a certain number of times.

Another way to end the game fast is to place an unused token on the board, every time the dice rolls 1 the token will move one space, 2 if the player rolls a double, once the token has gone around the board , the game is over and whoever has more money, wins.

==Capitol hill variation==

The origin of the capitol hill variation came from an attempt&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playagaingames.com/games/monopoly/capitol_hill/&lt;/ref&gt; to add house rules that would make it more difficult for a player to establish a monopoly.  It would also provide players who have emerged out of the early phases of the game at an asset disadvantage to level the playing field through simulated “government support.”  These rules were originally intended to add to the game optional rules that would simulate anti-trust, labor, and welfare governmental regulations, but other rules have been used.

Rule additions or modifications appear in the form of bills, and the collection of bills from which a player can sponsor are located on the “docket.”  The docket is agreed upon by players prior to the start of the game.  The particular set of bills on the docket can vary with individual house rules, but usually at a minimum, they contain rules that simulate anti-trust, labor, and welfare regulations.

A sample docket could contain any or all of the following bills:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%;&quot;
|-
! width=&quot;50&quot; | Bill No.
! width=&quot;150&quot; | Title
! Impact of the Bill
|-
| HB 1
| Asset tax
| Players, upon passing “GO,” pay 2% of assets, less a deductible.  The deductible is contingent upon the number of players.  For 2 players it is $1,900; for 3 players it is $1,425; for 4 players it is $1,150; for 5 players it is $950; and for 6 players it is $825.
|-
| HB 2
| Amnesty day
| Each player receives one free rent landing at the expense of the property owner.
|-
| HB 3
| Mortgage integrity act
| A mortgage call is initiated after each third consecutive roll of doubles.
|-
| HB 4
| Fair labour act
| (1) For each player, the income amount received for passing “GO” is increased from $200 to $300; and (2) houses and hotels cost double to build.
|-
| HB 5
| Rental income tax
| 10% of all rent collected is redistributed to non-improved property owners.
|-
| HB 6
| &quot;And is more&quot; act
| Amends the square “$200 or 10% of assets” to “$200 and 10% of assets”.
|-
| HB 7
| Int'l refugee, migrant, and displaced workers protection act
| Decreases the supply of houses and hotels by 50%.
|-
| HB 8
| Bankruptcy relief act
| In lieu of declaring a total bankruptcy, debtors may opt for a structured settlement for debts owed.  In order to do this: (1) debtors liquidate all assets and pay all debts to creditors to the fullest extent possible; (2) go to jail for three turns or until the player rolls doubles; and (3), upon release from jail, collect $1,000 from the bank.  Debtors may only file for relief under this Act once every 7 turns.

===General play===

Standard Monopoly rules apply except when a player lands on either Free parking or Go.  When a player lands on either Free Parking or Go, the player, in lieu of collecting any funds to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, the player may instead opt to “go to Capitol Hill” to &quot;lobby&quot; for additions or modifications of certain rules of the game.  

If the player chooses to go to capitol hill, he or she selects a bill to sponsor.  After reading the bill aloud, the sponsor asks if anyone would like to join the caucus to support the bill.

The sponsor and the other caucus members then pay a fee to the bank to attempt to pass their legislation.  If the caucus members represent a majority of the players then each player pays $200.  Otherwise, each caucus member pays $500.

===Passing legislation===

The sponsor rolls both dice.  If this roll results in a &quot;majority vote&quot; the legislation passes.  The required roll to establish a majority vote depends upon the number of players in the caucus:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! No. Players &lt;br&gt; in Caucus
! Majority Vote &lt;br&gt; Roll Requirement
|-
| 1
| 7+
|-
| 2
| 6+
|-
| 3
| 5+
|-
| 4
| 4+
|-
| 5
| 3+
|-
| 6
| 2+
|}

===After passing the bill===

After passing a bill, all non-caucus member players must pay to the Sponsor $100.  Bills go into effect immediately after they are passed.

===Repealing a law===

It’s important to note, all laws, once enacted, can be repealed through the same process of enacting any other bill.

==Miscellaneous==

* '''Six railroads:''' the two utilities are treated like additional railroads. They cost $200 to buy and can be mortgaged for $100. The rent for five railroads is $300 and for six railroads is $400. (An &quot;Advance To Nearest Utility Card&quot; can either be removed from the deck or changed to &quot;Advance to Nearest Railroad and Pay owner twice the rental...&quot;)
* '''Travelling railroads:''' whenever a player lands on a railroad, the player may choose to move his or her token to any other railroad owned by the same player. The player must pay rent even if he or she does not choose to travel. A player may travel on his or her own railroads for free. A player may not travel on unowned railroads. Travel is across the board, so a player does not get $200 for passing Go when he or she travels from Short Line to Reading Railroad. The owner of the railroads may not prevent the player from traveling. A player may travel to or from a mortgaged railroad. (NOTE: If a player travels from a mortgaged railroad to an unmortgaged railroad, he does not have to pay rent.)
* '''Borrowing money from the bank:''' at any time a player may borrow $500 from the bank. Until the loan is paid off, the player will only receive $100 when passing Go, as interest. A player may not pay off the loan until he has passed Go at least once since borrowing the money. If you go bankrupt the creditor inherits your debt. Anyone who inherits a debt cannot pay it off until he has passed Go once since inheriting that debt.
* '''Jailing cheaters:''' if a player is caught cheating by the other players, he or she must go directly to jail. They don't pass go or collect $200.
* '''Mississippi bankruptcy:''' before a player (referred to as &quot;the dealer&quot;) rolls the dice, there is a betting round, in which, starting from the dealer's left and moving clockwise around the table, each player (other than the dealer) is given the option of betting by placing money on one or more unowned properties around the board and/or on Free Parking. After the betting is completed, the dealer continues with his or her turn, and if the dealer rolls doubles, then the bank doubles all the money on the board. If the dealer rolls snake eyes, then the bank pays out 10 dollars for each dollar down. If the dealer lands on a property that has money on it, then as long as the player who put money down, put down at least 10% of the cost of the unowned property, then that player has purchased the right to bid in an auction for the property against the dealer and any other player who had put down at least 10% of the cost of the unowned property on that property. Also, those players' tokens are then moved directly to that property, without passing Go, without collecting $200. Bidding begins at the property's original cost.  Players who lose an auction have to pay the winner rent. If none of the players bid on the property, then the property remains unsold, and no money changes hands. A player who wins an auction, if he or she has completed a set, does not have the option of building houses on said property, even if it is his or her turn, until after the losing player or players have paid their rent. If a player puts down money on Free Parking and the dealer lands on Free Parking, then the player's token is moved to Free Parking (without passing Go, without collecting $200). After the dealer's turn is completed, play continues to the dealer's left and the next player to roll the dice becomes the new dealer.
* '''Mulitiple-board:''' if you have multiple Monopoly boards of different versions (ie. Original, dotcom, NHL, Canadian, Star Wars, etc.) you can overlap the corners of the boards with free parking above free parking or go above go.  Each board will overlap at most two opposite corners.  You need different versions so you know which properties belongs to which board.  Starting money is $1500 per board in play.  Rents for Utilities are 1: 5x roll, 2: 10X roll, 3: 15X roll, 4: 20X roll etc.  Railroad rents keep doubling: 1: $25, 2: $50, 3: $100, 4: $200, 5: $400, 6: $800, 7: $1600 8: $3200, etc. Play proceeds around the outer edge of the row of boards, so when you reach an overlapping square, you turn to the left.  When being sent to Go, or Jail you advance to whichever on would next appear in your travels.  When advancing to a specific railroad, utility or other property it is conceivable to pass by several Go spaces on your way depending on how many boards are in play.   Houses and hotels built, must be from the pieces available for that board. If you're playing with the free parking cash optional rule, there is a pot for each board, and you collect the pot for the board you were on when you rolled the dice to land on free parking.  Game time may be quite long or quite short - depending on whether one player manages to collect many of the railroads as large numbers of railroads are the quickest way to put an opponent out of the game!

A version of multiple-board Monopoly exists with different rule variations than those above. First, the &quot;Go&quot; spaces of the two boards overlap, effectively creating one &quot;Go&quot; space shared by both boards. Railroad rents max out at 200$ as in a standard one-board game. So a player having 5 or more RRs still receives only $200 rent per RR (but obviously his chances of getting rent are greater). Utilities work similarly: Rent maxes out at 10x the roll, even if a player has three of more utilities. Also, if a player lands directly on &quot;Go,&quot; he may choose to travel onto either board the following turn. This also applies at the beginning of the game when all tokens are on &quot;Go.&quot; But, players must announce before the roll which board they will advance onto. Keep in mind that if a player does not land directly on &quot;Go&quot; he must advance onto the next board as normal. If playing with the Free Parking reward, the money is pooled into one kitty which is won by landing on either of the two Free Parking spaces. As for building properties, one must have the complete color monopoly (i.e. an Orange monopoly means SIX oranges). However, if a player has a monopoly on only one board, he may build up to 2 (TWO) houses on the properties until he obtains all six properties (or, in the case of Mediterranean/Baltic (Old Kent and Whitechapel) ( &amp; Park Place/Boardwalk (Park Lane/Mayfair), all 4 properties). Once a 6-property monopoly is obtained (usually via trades), the player may build more than 2 houses. Houses of their respective boards are kept separate (32 houses, 12 hotels ''per board'').
Upon going to jail, the player goes to the jail on the board from whence he came. A player can never advance to the other board's jail. Regarding cards which require movement (excluding &quot;Go To Jail&quot; cards), the player must follow the instructions and move around the boards normally. So if a player hits the Boardwalk/Mayfair-side Chance and must move to Illinois Ave/Trafalgar Square for example, he moves to the other board's Illinois Ave/Trafalgar Square.
**Not noticing when someone lands on your property ** The person that lands the property doesn't have to pay**</text>

== Clean-up? ==
This page looks really ugly to me. Who am I, though? All the same, would anyone want to try to make it more legible, or would anyone want me to attempt it? There are, I think, too many &quot;Some house rules...&quot;. If there's another way to put it, I'll be glad to clean it up myself. -- [[User:D. F. Schmidt|D. F. Schmidt]] 09:22, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

:On Wikipedia this was originally a very brief section that was then split out of the main Monopoly article, so it's not written in an instructional way. I'm sure there will be some clever way to organise them together into groups. I've made a start on this, but feel free to improve on it. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:57, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

==Thoughts for Consideration==
Unlike the author of the book, THE MONOPOLY BOOK c. 1974, Maxine Bradley who claims that Monopoly is perfect and does not need any changes or improvements and that bedtime story that Darrow invented the game of MONOPOLY I believe the following: 

Because Elizabeth Magie invented two games 
a] the Landlord Game and 
b] the basic monopoly game circa 1903 [see Arden DE Woolery board with the letters showing the groupings of the properties to form a monopolies ... that this was the starting point of what I call &quot;folk monopoly&quot; .. it was played extensively through the years until about 1932. There are several things which Dr. Ralph Anspach uncovered in his case of Anti-Monopoly versus General Mills, the owner of Parker Brothers in 1974.  
In 1983 the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed that the game of &quot;folk monopoly&quot; was played in the early 1920's and 1930's by various persons of different schools and towns and was unsuccessful patented because it was public domain. Dan Layman's Finance game is the monopoly/Finance game developed in 1932. he taught this game to Ruth Hoskins who took the game from Indianopolis back to 
Atlantic City in December 1930 and this version evolved into the reknown game of MONOPOLY under Hoskins Raifords Harveys thrashing many hours the rules, the fixed prices,'the street names where most of the members happened to live on'... they all wanted to honor someone on the team ... Raiford's prices match up so nicely balanced out  Raiford's cloth was spelled correctly with &quot; MARVEN Gardens&quot; but Charles Todd's cloth was misspelled as &quot;MARVIN GARDENS&quot; .. Charles Darrow copied Todd's errors and then marketed the game as MONOPOLY...  [Compare that with the unemployed story of Darrow sitting down on a table and remembering all the street names as the old Parker Brothers story was told]
After Darrow presented this game to Parker Brothers, PB knew the game was in the public domain and made a corporate decision to privatize the game by applying for a patent and receiving it and getting rid of the cmpetition through lawsuits and secret deals pulled FINANCE, INFLATION, Landlord Game etc. off the market until Dr. Ralph Anspach was sued... 

Having said the above story we can now say to all you folks. Let's revive the continued evolution of the folk game of monopoly with house rules and add ons and other things... in 1985 there was a little book
put out called BEYOND BOARDWALK AND PARK PLACE ... Changing the utilities to Railroads and buy at double the list price ... or put it up for auction .. on thinking about this one, you can now understand the folk game of monopoly could easily be revived ... 

Re: The strange rule of $500 in the middle for landing on Free Parking. 

The Landlord's Game Patent of 1904 shows the square of Central Park Free sharing its space with the Poorhouse... is one I can trace to the patented rules of the game which states 
Public Park [Central Park Free? DL]: A player may stop is the &quot;Public park&quot; without paying anything.
 
Poorhouse: If at stay time, a player has no money with which to meet expenses and has no property upon which he can borrow, He must go to the Poorhouse and remaun there until he makes such throws as will enable him to finish the round. 

The printed version of 1910 now redated to 1906 states 

Rule 10 - CENTRAL PARK is supposed to be maintained by public funds, therefore a player may stop in it, without paying anything.

Rule 12 - Poor House - If anytime a player has not enough money to pay his expenses, and cannot borrow any [see rule 16] or cannot sell or mortgage any of his property, he must go to the POOR HOUSE, where he remains until his next turn. THEN He throws again AND MOVES OUT IF HE CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THE MOVE.

New Ideas for consideration:
 
When a player lands on a mortgaged property he pays 1/2 the rent owed on the property to the BANK. For example if someone has a mortgaaged property renting for $20 the bank collects $10 from the renter and the person mortgaging it collects NOTHING. If you are the one who mortgaged it you must pay $10 as well if you land on it. You also Mortgage the houses on the property rather than sell them at 1/2 the purchase price to the bank before mortgaging the property... For example if New York Avenue has a hotel sitting on it the bank would collect $ 500 rent from any player including the owner who mortgaged it in the first place. Any player may elect to buy the mortgaged property as follows:

Proper deed card   $100

4 houses $50 each  $200

1 hotel $50

Total $350 plus $ 35 or $385 to get the property unmortgaged.

Thus this player may wind up with a single property with a hotel on it regardless of whether he owns the other two colour properties in the series. 
 
Add Cards in Chance/Community Chest as follows:

1 or 2 cards each  0f  &quot;Builders On Strike - All property owners pay $10 to the Bank extra to build new houses. Effective until all players pass GO.&quot;

Up to 4 cards each of &quot;Bank Foreclosure - Give up 1 property or 1 House or Hotel to the bank immediately&quot;

1 or 2 each of &quot;Bankruptc - hand All properties to the Bank and Restart from Go with $1000&quot;

With these cards comes one more rule - to leave the game permanently you must be bankrupted by a player, not the card itself It also is possible to go bankrupt even though you may have houses on the property and don't owe money to anyone and have to start all over with a 2nd chance.

By adding these ards to Both Chance and Community Chest will mamke a more interesting game to play.

== Building properties ==

&quot;According to some house rules, you are able to buy houses and hoard them in order to prevent others from winning&quot;

Don't read this part- This is the entire purpose of the game and I don't see how it could be considered a house rule. Unless Someone can point me to a rule saying you cant buy and keep properties this should be deleted or moved to strategy or something.


EDIT: I've just realized they were saying houses, not properties. This is still not really AGAINST rules but it does fit here better than I originally thought. [[User:Washyleopard|Washyleopard]] ([[User talk:Washyleopard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Washyleopard|contribs]])</text>

:''Fritzlein was the only contributor, posted on date shown in his sig.''

How/where would it be appropriate to discuss the proposal to move this page to Wikibooks?  I oppose the article being moved.  Perhaps there is no perfect place for the rules of Monopoly to live, but in my opinion this article is more encyclopedic than it is book-like.  It is not a &quot;how to play Monopoly article&quot;; it doesn't even make sense by itself.  A browser of Wikibooks would get nothing from it if we excised it from Wikipedia and dumped it there.  It exists independently as an article only because someone thought the main Monopoly encyclopedia article was too long and wanted to chop that article into smaller pieces.  The text still makes some sense as an extension of the Monopoly article which can be read or skipped at one's pleasure, but as a stand-alone Wikibook it would be totally orphaned.

The beginning tag challenges one to re-write the article to make it more encyclopedic.  I would challenge anyone who moves it to Wikibooks to make it at all book-like.  It would be great if there were a Monopoly Wikibook, and I hope someone writes one some day, but cutting and dumping won't make that happen.  It's like the janitor saying &quot;This footstool doesn't belong here with these wooden chairs,&quot; and therefore moving the footstool into a room with lots of benches.  What has been achieved?

As you can see I feel strongly about this.  On the other hand, I don't like edit wars, and I don't want to express my opinion by reverting changes that someone else makes.  Is this the type of thing that gets talked about and/or voted on? Thanks in advance.  --[[w:User:Fritzlein|Fritzlein]] 22:59, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Rules rewrite ==

Here is a rewritten version of the rules I plan to use to play the UK version of Monopoly. I believe I have improved the format but have extracted some rules from the official USA website and removed some statements I thought to be superfluous.

OFFICIAL RULES

One player becomes the Banker, who distributes assets from the Bank to the players. Each player receives £1500, divided as follows: two £500, two £100, two £50, six £20, five £10, five £5, and five £1. The Bank has 32 houses and 12 hotels, but never runs out of money. If necessary, the Banker can create more money to give to players.
 
Basic Rules

If the player lands on an un-owned property, he may buy it for the price listed on that property's space. If he agrees to buy it, he pays the Bank the amount shown on the property space and receives the title deed for that property. If he decides not to buy it, the property is auctioned, and the bidding may start at any price. The highest bidder wins the property and pays the Bank the amount bid and receives the property's title deed. Railroads and utilities are also properties.

If the player lands on an un-mortgaged property owned by another player, he pays rent to that person, as specified on the property's deed.

If the player lands on his own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens. 

A player wishing to sell an unimproved property at any time for cash must put the property up for auction to allow all players equal opportunity to purchase it. The property transfers to the highest bidder after payment. Properties traded for other properties involving cash are not subject to auction.

If the player lands on or passes Go he receives £200 from the bank. A player cannot receive any &quot;Go&quot; money if he forgot to get it when passing.

Two or more players making a deal, or &quot;alliance&quot; against any other player is strictly prohibited. There are no &quot;immunities&quot; in the game of Monopoly.

Doubles

A player who rolls doubles takes another turn after completing the first one (unless he was in Jail). If he rolls doubles again, he takes a third turn after completing the second. If, on the third turn, he rolls doubles again, he does not take that turn and goes to jail.

Jail

If the player lands on the Go to Jail square, he must move his token to Jail (without passing Go). If the player has a Get Out of Jail Free card he wishes to use or can buy one from another player, he moves his token to the &quot;Just Visiting&quot; part of the square.

If the player lands on or passes Go he receives £200 from the bank, unless he is going directly to Jail either by landing on &quot;Go to Jail&quot;, drawing a Chance or Community Chest card directing the player to Jail or rolling three sets of doubles in a row. 

If the player lands on Jail he is &quot;Just Visiting&quot; and does nothing. However, if a player is directed to go to Jail by a card, or from having landed on the Go To Jail square, or by virtue of having rolled doubles three times consecutively, their turn ends immediately, they do not collect £200 salary in that move since they must move their piece directly to Jail. They can get out by paying a £50 fine, using a &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; card, or by rolling doubles. If a player refuses to pay the fine and fails to roll doubles, he loses his turn. If you succeed in throwing doubles you immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw. 

If a player in Jail refuses to pay the fine three consecutive turns, and each turn fails to roll doubles, the £50 fine is assessed anyway (he may not use a &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; card after failing to roll doubles the third time), and he moves the number of spaces on his last unsuccessful roll. While in Jail the player may buy and erect a House, sell or buy property, and collect Rent, even though they are in Jail.

Properties, Rents, and Construction

Properties are arranged in &quot;colour groups&quot; of two or three properties. Once a player owns all properties of a colour group (a monopoly), the rent is doubled on all unimproved lots of that colour group, even if some of the properties are mortgaged to the Bank, and the player may purchase either one to four houses or one hotel (which is equivalent to five houses) for those properties (as long as all properties of that colour group are not mortgaged to the bank), which raise the rents that must be paid when other players land on the property. The properties in a colour group must be developed evenly, i.e. each house that is built must go on the property in the group with the fewest number of houses on it so far. In other way of speaking, the number of houses of any properties of a same colour group must not be different to the other properties by more than one.

A hotel may be built on a colour group only after all properties in the group have four houses. A player purchases a hotel by paying the price of an additional house, and returning the four houses on that property to the bank in exchange for a hotel. If there are not enough houses in the bank for a player to build four houses on each property before building a hotel, the player may not skip directly to buying a hotel by paying the full price at one go.

The bank has a fixed supply of 32 houses and 12 hotels. If more players decide to build more houses at the same time than there are houses in the bank, the houses are auctioned off one at a time to the highest bidder. This rule favours the owners of expensive properties, for which the houses cost more in the first place, because the auction price of a house is not tied to the value of the property on which it will be placed.

At any time a player may, to raise cash, return hotels and houses to the bank for half their purchase price. If there are sufficient houses in the bank, hotels may also be &quot;broken down&quot; into a number of houses for the corresponding percentage of their purchase price. For example, hotels in one colour group may be replaced by two houses each, and for each hotel thus broken down, the player receives half the cost of three houses.

Loans / Mortgages

If a player does not have sufficient funds to pay off a rent or fee assigned by certain cards, he or she may take a loan from the bank by mortgaging one or more properties for half the property price. If a house is on a property to be mortgaged, you must first sell the house or houses to mortgage. A property does not collect rent while mortgaged and may not be developed.

To de-mortgage a property a player must pay &quot;interest&quot; of 10% in addition to the mortgage price. Whenever a mortgaged property changes hands between players, either through a trade, sale or by bankruptcy, the new owner must immediately pay 10% interest on the mortgage and at their option may pay the principal or hold the property. If the player holds the property and later wishes to lift the mortgage they must pay the 10% interest again as well as the principal.


There's four people active watching this page.  Could one of you review the recent changes to this page for accuracy? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:23, 26 March 2010 (UTC)


What happens if you need to break down a hotel, but there arent enough houses to do so.
for example, say there are only 3 houses left, does that mean you cannot sell the hotel back at all?

== Incorrect terms and new money distribution. ==

&quot;If the player lands on The Dojo, Metro or Guns and Ammo, he or she must pay the Bank the amount on the square unless otherwise stated by a card. (these are in place of Tax items)
If the player lands on a Beast Mode or Rooftop square, the player takes a card from the top of the respective pack and performs the instruction given on the card.&quot;

These seem like terms for a monopoly spinoff and I don't know why they would be on this wiki which unless I am much mistaken is for the original game.

Second, I have a newer version of the game and they have changed the original distribution of money to include only one 500, more 100s and 50s and less 20s which makes more sense for use in game as nothing costs over 500. I'm not at home though so I cant say the exact distribution. I don't think the current numbers should be changed but perhaps we could add reference to the new distribution.

== Spelling ==
There's bad spelling of &quot;porperties&quot; in the last sentence. I spent some time trying to find why I cannot simply press &quot;edit&quot; as in other pages and now gave up.
Is this page blocked?

There were numerous errors in the Wikipedia article that were in direct conflict with the official rules published by Hasbro (http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/monins.pdf), and numerous confusing statements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preparation ==
To begin with, each player selects a token. Then they place their token on the Go space on the board, only when his/her first turn to move arrives. One player becomes the Banker, who distributes assets from the Bank to the players. Only the player in question can use their money, money can only be lent via the Banker or by the player mortgaging an asset, money cannot be lent by another player. Each player receives two $500, four $100, one $50, one $20, two $10, one $5, and five $1. The Bank has 32 houses and 12 hotels, but never runs out of money. The Banker keeps his assets separate from those of the Bank. The Banker cannot get extra money. When you pass GO you receive $200. With the dice if you roll doubles (two of one number) you can roll again.

== General ==
Each player, in turn, rolls both dice and then moves forward (clockwise around the board) the number of spaces indicated by the sum of the numbers rolled.  Action is then taken depending on the space on which the player lands:

* If the player lands on an '''unowned property''', he or she may buy it for the price listed on that property's space.  If he or she '''agrees''' to buy it, he or she pays the '''Bank''' the amount shown on the property space and receives the deed for that property. If he or she decides not to buy it, the property is auctioned, and the bidding may start at any price. The highest bidder wins the property and pays the Bank the amount bid and receives the property's title deed.  Railroads and utilities are also properties.
* If the player lands on an unmortgaged property owned by another player, he or she pays rent to that person, as specified on the property's deed.  It is the property owner's responsibility to demand rent, and he or she has until the beginning of the ''second'' following player's turn to do so.
* If the player lands on his or her own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens.
* If the player lands on Luxury Tax/Super Tax, he or she must pay the Bank $100 (in some editions of the game, only $75).
* If the player lands on Income Tax he or she must pay the Bank either $200 or 10% of his or her total assets (cash on hand, property, houses and hotels).  In some editions of the game, this is a flat rate of $200.
* If the player lands on a Chance or Community Chest, the player takes a card from the top of the respective pack and performs the instruction given on the card.
* If the player lands on the Jail space, he or she is &quot;Just Visiting&quot; and does nothing.  No penalty applies.
* If the player lands on the Go to Jail square, he or she must move his token directly to [[#Jail|Jail]].
* If the player lands on or passes Go in the course of his or her turn, he or she receives $200 from the Bank. A player has until the beginning of his or her next turn to collect this bonus.

If a player does not have sufficient funds to pay off a rent or fee, he or she may take a loan from the Bank by mortgaging one or more properties, sell houses back to the Bank for half the purchase price or sell property deeds to other players in the game.

Players may not loan money to other players, only the Bank can loan money, and then only by mortgaging properties.

If a player skips another player's turn and is caught, the turn is transferred back to the player whose turn was skipped.

==Doubles==
When doubles are rolled, the player picks up the dice and moves again. However, while house rules may vary, the official rules state that you DO land on the square the dice led you to on your roll, and you must pay the price or, should you so choose, buy the property in question. After the third roll of doubles, rather than landing on the square the dice led you to, you immediately go to jail and thus do not enact the appropriate action of landing on that square.

== Jail ==
A player can be directed to jail in three ways: by landing on the Go to Jail space, by drawing a &quot;Go to Jail&quot; Chance or Community Chest card or rolling three doubles.  In any of these cases, the player moves directly into jail, without collecting the $200 for passing Go.

A player in jail remains there until he/she does one of the following:
* opts to pay a $50 bailout to the Bank, or spend a &quot;Get out of Jail Free&quot; card, before rolling the dice
* rolls doubles.
* fails to roll doubles on his/her third turn in jail, in which case the $50 charge is levied anyway (the player may not use a &quot;Get out of Jail Free&quot; card in this situation)
In any of these cases, the dice rolled on the turn on which the player leaves jail are played out.  However, in the second case, the power of the doubles is &quot;used up&quot; by bailing the player out of jail, and so he/she does not get an extra turn.  On the other hand, if the player rolls doubles in the first case, the extra turn is still granted.
The rules state that you pay for the spot you are on before heading to jail
.
While in jail, a player may still collect rent, and buy houses/hotels.&lt;ref&gt;Monopoly 2007 Instructions -- Hasbro (http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/00009.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties, Rents, and Construction==
If a player lands on property he may buy it at the listed price. If the player refuses to buy it, the Bank sells it at auction to the highest bidder. Any player, including the one who refused to buy it in the first place, may bid on the property. Properties are arranged in &quot;color groups&quot; of two or three properties. Once a player owns all properties of a color group (a monopoly), the rent is now doubled on all unimproved lots of that color group, even if some of the properties are mortgaged to the Bank, and the player may purchase either one to four houses or one hotel (which is equivalent to five houses) for those properties (as long as none of the properties of that color group are mortgaged to the Bank), which raise the rents that must be paid when other players land on the property.  The properties in a color group must be developed evenly, i.e. each house that is built must go on a property in the group with the fewest number of houses on it so far. In another way of speaking, the number of houses of any properties of a same color group must not differ by more than one.  For example, houses in a group may be distributed (2,3,2) or (0,1,1) or (4,4,3), but not (1,2,3) or (0,4,4).

If a property is owned by a player and another player lands on the property and the owner does not realize it before the second following player rolls the dice then the player does not have to pay the owner. (In older games, the player had to realize it before the next player's turn).

You may have up to 1 Hotel or 4 Houses. 5 Houses are equal to 1 Hotel.
House prices should be on the property cards.

A hotel may be built on a color group only after all properties in the group have four houses.  A player purchases a hotel by paying the price of an additional house, and returning the four houses on that property to the Bank in exchange for a hotel.  If there are not enough houses in the Bank for a player to build four houses on each property before building a hotel, the player may not skip directly to buying a hotel by paying the full price at one go.

The Bank has a fixed supply of 32 houses and 12 hotels. If more players decide to build more houses at the same time than there are houses in the Bank, the houses are auctioned off one at a time to the highest bidder.  This rule favors the owners of expensive properties, for which the houses cost more in the first place, because the auction price of a house is not tied to the value of the property on which it will be placed.  It is not possible to buy more houses than there is available in the Bank. This could stop people buying hotels in the future!

At any time a player may, to raise cash, sell hotels and houses back to the Bank for half of the purchase price of the houses.  If there are sufficient houses in the Bank, hotels may also be &quot;broken down&quot; into a number of houses for the corresponding percentage of their purchase price.  For example, hotels in one color group may be replaced by two houses each, and for each hotel thus broken down, the player receives half the cost of three houses.  Also, properties with no houses or hotels may be mortgaged for half of the property price.  A property does not collect rent while mortgaged and may not be developed.  To de-mortgage a property a player must pay interest of 10% in addition to the mortgage price.  Whenever a mortgaged property changes hands between players, either through a trade, sale or by bankruptcy, the new owner must immediately pay 10% interest on the mortgage and at their option may pay the principal or hold the property.  If the player holds the property and later wishes to lift the mortgage they must pay the 10% interest again as well as the principal.

Sharing the ownership of any property is not allowed. 

For a street repairs card, the player must pay for every house and/or hotel they own on the board.&lt;!-- not every H&amp;H on the board, see http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=744803 --&gt;

===Railroad and Utility Rent===
The rent a player owes for landing on a railroad varies with the number of railroads the owner possesses.  The rent is as follows:
Charge $25 if one owned, $50 if two owned, $100 if three owned, $200 if all owned by the same owner. If you get a chance card and it says advance to the nearest railroad, you may either buy it if unowned or if owned by the other player you must pay double what you would normally pay.

For utilities, after a player lands on one to owe rent, they must roll the dice again to determine the rent amount. The rent is 10 times the amount rolled if the both are owned, or 4 times if not. One player does not have to posess both in order for the rent to be 10 tmes the amount.

&lt;!--[[Image:Monopoly Stock Exchange 1992 box.jpg|frame|right|cover of the 1992 Chessex edition, out of print but still stocked by some stores.]]--&gt;
The goal of this section is to provide the definitive guide to 1936 Stock Exchange addon, including cards and such that can be printed out to replicate the features of the original game as closely as possible. These will likely be offered in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format.

Note that 1992 edition produced by Chessex has some differences; additional content for it will be covered [[Monopoly/Stock_Exchange#1992_Updated_Version|here]].

==Rules for Stock Exchange==

===Components===
The following are required to play Stock Exchange:
* rule sheet (what you're reading now, printable versions also available)
* one Stock Exchange board space (see [[#Printable Content|Printable Content]] below)
* a full set of Advance to Stock Exchange cards to be inserted in the Chance and Community Chest decks (see [[#Printable Content|Printable Content]] below)
* thirty stock Shares, five each of the six different companies (see [[#Printable Content|Printable Content]] below)

===Setup===
The Stock Exchange is what was the Free Parking square in standard Monopoly. Place the Stock Exchange space on it and fold the flaps underneath; some tape to join the two flaps to each other will make it more sturdy and able to be added and removed at will.

The number of Advance to Stock Exchange cards used varies according to the number of players to ensure the element of luck and randomness is common enough.

* 2-3 players: 5 cards each deck
* 4 players: 4 cards each deck
* more than 4 players: 3 cards each deck

''Please note'': In the 1936 instructions, only 3 cards were added to each deck.

===Landing on Stock Exchange===
When a player lands on the Stock Exchange, he has the option of buying from the Bank one* Share of Stock in any Company he chooses, paying the Par Value Price printed on the Stock Certificates. If a player wishes to buy, he pays the bank for the Stock and receives a Stock Certificate in the company he selects. If the player declines this option, the Banker immediately offers this stock option for sale at Auction and sells it to the highest bidder.

===Buying Stock===
Original purchases of Stock can only be bought from the Bank, &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; Share at a time, when a player lands on the Stock Exchange. Stock can be mortgaged at one-half the Par Value Price, or can be sold to any player as a private transaction for any amount that the owner can get.

===Dividends===
Dividends are payable by the Bank to all shareholders upon any token landing upon the Stock Exchange, in accordance with the list printed on the Certificates held by the owner.

It is an advantage to own the entire block of Stock of a Company, as the Dividends increase considerably with the amount owned in any one Company.

===Integration with Monopoly===
The Stock Exchange space replaces Monopoly's traditional Free Parking. Insert the additional cards in the appropriate decks, and proceed with the game in accordance with the rules as per usual. Note that the &quot;You get $45 from sale of stock&quot; card is now treated as an &quot;Advance to Stock Exchange&quot; card.

===Customizing the Game===
* some players like to be able to purchase one or two Shares of Stock at the same time. This may be done if agreeable to all players before starting the game.

==1992 Updated Version==
In addition to the &quot;Advance to Stock Exchange&quot; cards, special Chance and Community Chest cards affecting particular stocks are included. Also, American Motors is renamed '''Acme Motors''', as at the time of its reissue, there was an ACTUAL car company with the older name (American Motors was later absorbed into the Dodge Motors company). Otherwise, this version of the game was functionally identical to its 1936 predecessor.

A replica of the 1936 version of the Stock Exchange corner square is available as a PDF replica. 

The stock certificates have been replicated as of September 2006.

For making your own stocks (five copies of each), the table below provides the ''Par Value'' (purchase price), the dividend payments for levels of ownership, and the ''Loan Value'' (mortgage value).

In addition, there should be three &quot;Advance to Stock Exchange&quot; cards added to both the ''Chance?'' and ''Community Chest'' decks. The &quot;From Sale of Stock You Get $45&quot; Community Chest card can either be removed or treated as an additional &quot;Advance to Stock Exchange&quot; card. A [[:Image:Monopoly_Stock_Exchange_Chance_Community_Chest2.pdf|set]] of these cards are available for printing as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that we have covered the basics of how we represent images and colors, we can combine that information into a more detailed picture of how a digital image is represented. We noted before that a digital image is just an array of color values, and now that we know a bit about how colors are represented as numbers in the RGB color space, we can combine that information to get a more detailed picture. 

As you might expect, the digital representation of an image is simply an array of these triples of RGB values. Specifically, an image can be thought of as a rectangular grid of these color values. If we are dealing with an image we wish to be 800 by 600 pixels, then we would have an array which had 800 RGB color values across the width of the image, and 600 RGB color values down the length of the image. 

As you might expect, it is convenient to reference any given pixel by its (x,y) coordinates. In this coordinate system, (0,0) is the upper-left-most pixel, and (width, height) is the lower-right-most pixel, where width and height represent the width and height of the image, of course (using the above example, they would be 800 and 600 respectively). Thus, as you move horizontally across the image the x values increase, while the y values increase as you move ''down'' the image, which can be counterintuitive at first. 

This a fairly arbitrary organization (in fact, in some image formats, (0,0) is the lower-left-most pixel, as you might expect from the familiar Cartesian coordinate system), but it is the one we will assume throughout the book, and it is the most widely used organization in practice. There is a practical benefit to using this organization from the perspective of a computer designer, but the computer graphics programmer rarely sees the benefit from it. That benefit is this: when a computer monitor displays an image, it sweeps a beam of light, left to right, top to bottom across all the pixels on the monitor. Thus, as the image is being sent to the monitor, it makes the most sense to give it what it draws first first. 

It is also worth noting that it is easy to convert from one representation to another. For example, if you wish to think of the screen as having the familiar coordinate system, then you could simply write your code the way you like and then reorder the rows later on, before it is displayed to the screen. Another alternative would be to replace each y coordinate you wish you access by (height-y). Thus, when you try to access what you think of as the bottom row of the screen (y=0), you will instead access (y=800-0=800), which is the bottom row of the screen as the computer monitor thinks of it. In the end, the pixels have to go in one direction or another, and this is a familiar and commonly used format. 

In the computer's memory, the image is laid out in this very direct fashion, as one contiguous block of memory. Each pixel is assigned enough space for the three numbers representing its color components, and the first pixel in the image (0,0) is the first pixel in the memory block. At the next highest memory address is the next pixel in the row (1,0), and so forth. Eventually, the last pixel in the memory block is the one which is considered to be in the position (width, height). 

As an example, let us say that we have an image in memory which is 800 by 600 pixels, the first pixel of the image is at memory address 100, and the size of each RGB component is given by r. Then the r bytes at address 100 are the pixel at (0,0), the r bytes at address 100+r are the pixel at (1,0), and the r bytes at address 100+2*r are the pixel at (2,0). If we wish to access the pixel data for the pixel at (5,5), we need to access the r bytes at 100+5*width*r+5*r. That is, we need to add to the base address the number of bytes in the first 5 rows (5*width*r), plus the number of bytes into the row that that pixel is at. In general, we can access the pixel (x,y) in memory by accessing baseAddress+y*width*r+x*r. This formula is not important to remember, but it is important to understand that the image data in memory is not two dimensional, it is one dimensional and we only give the data a two dimensional organization by how we interpret it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Monopoly/Header|title=BEYOND BOARDWALK AND PARK PLACE RULES}}
These rules are adapted from the book of the same name.

Richard Hutton and Noel Gunther, ''Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place : the Unauthorized Guide to Making Monopoly Fun Again''. Toronto/New York: Bantam Dell Publishing Group, December 1986, ISBN 0553343416 (Paperback)

The goal of these rule changes is to decrease the ready money onhand and thus make properties available to more players. The luck of the game, one of its greatest criticisms, is significantly reduced.
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;
==Mortgages==
There are no mortgages. If a player needs cash and must get it from a property, they must either sell to the bank (for half the listed price) or sell or trade it to another player.

==Sales and auctions==
The purchase price of all unowned properties is doubled—for example, Boardwalk/Mayfair now costs $800. This prevents players just rolling the dice and buying anything they happen to land on. If the player chooses not to buy it, it ''must'' be '''immediately''' auctioned.

Auctions start at half the traditional listing price (not the doubled price) plus $10. Boardwalk/Mayfair's printed price is $400, so bidding opens at $210.

The player who declined its purchase may make the first bid or pass, and bidding then moves clockwise around the table. Players can either increase the bid (by a ''minimum'' of $5) or pass. Once each player has decided to pass on their current bid, the last bidder gets the property. They must then pay the agreed price regardless of whether they have the cash available; if they do not, traditional money-generating practises may be used (selling or trading properties). However, if the player finds himself unable to gather sufficient funds even after selling everything they own, they are declared bankrupt and are out of the game. This prevents players overbidding and then evading the debt in whole or in part.

==New railroads==
The two utilities are treated as railroads. The price changes from $150 to $200, just like any other railroad. Cards directing players to move to the nearest railroad will still apply to the original four railroads.  The card representing &quot;Advance to the Nearest Utility&quot; (formerly paying 10 times the roll of the dice) is instead treated as moving the token to the nearest &quot;utility&quot; railroad and paying twice the rent due.

The new rent breakdown for railroads is:
* 1 railroad  ... $ 25
* 2 railroads ... $ 50
* 3 railroads ... $100
* 4 railroads ... $200
* 5 railroads ... $300
* 6 railroads ... $400

Players may decide to change the last two values to have doubled ownership benefits like the originals did, thus being $400 and $800 respectively; this alteration of the guidelines above would make a rail baron an even more serious enemy than the six-railroad rules already do.

==Building, rents and improvements==
Players who own a complete color set '''do not''' have to build evenly. A player can choose to buy three houses and place them all on one property.

OPTIONAL: this was not covered in the book, but a potential alternate rule is that they must still wait until they have a full set of houses before being able to buy hotels, thus making uneven building only for housing.

Players ''must'' do any building improvements at the start of their turn ''before'' rolling the dice.

When in Jail, players cannot build or bid in auctions, and collect only half rent. This encourages getting out of jail as quickly as possible, as opposed to the official rules which encourages players to stay in jail to avoid landing on opponents' properties while still collecting rent on their own.

One dollar ($1) bills are ''removed from the game''. All rent is rounded up so that the last digit is 5 or 0. For example, St James Place/Bow Street with $14 rent would instead collect $15; Mediterranean Avenue/Old Kent Road with $2 rent would instead collect $5.

Doubled rents (on undeveloped properties in a monopoly) are rounded ''after'' doubling, not before. For instance, an undeveloped St James Place/Bow Street with $14 rent would double to $28 rent in a monopoly, so would under these rules round up to $30; an undeveloped Mediterranean Avenue/Old Kent Road with $2 rent would double to $4 rent in a monopoly, and would thence round up to $5.  (Mediterranean Avenue/Old Kent Road is the only property unaffected by the &quot;doubling&quot; rule under the new rounding rules, since the pre-doubling and doubled rents would both be $5.)

When not in debt to either another player or to the bank, a player may declare &quot;voluntary bankruptcy&quot;. This may happen only once per game. The player returns all money, property, housing, and Get Out of Jail Free cards to the bank. He is then given $800 cash and the purple/brown properties, Mediterranean Avenue and Baltic Avenue (Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road). If owned by another player, that player has no choice in the matter; they are given $120 compensation for each plus $50 per house and $250 per hotel that was erected on the properties before the sellout.

Any payment to the bank ''not'' for purchase of property or housing is put into the &quot;kitty&quot; in the centre of the board. This is collected either when landing on Free Parking or as instructed by a GO card.  (In a variation that has helped keep the game more competitive, only half the amount - rounded up - goes into the kitty. For instance, on Luxury Tax, $40 would go into the kitty, and $35 would go to the bank.)

When a player lands on Income Tax they may calculate what 10% of their assets would come to ''before'' choosing which payment method to use.

As well as cash, property, and held cards, several new things are tradable: free rides (not having to pay rent when landed on), properties with strings attached (for example it will never be sold to a certain player), properties with permanent free rides available, and promises of rewards or protection from the outcome of future card draws.

Players can also counter-offer deals underway, and can even offer absolution from rent in advance for a decided sum up front.

When in Jail, players cannot improve properties, bid in auctions, or collect rent. This encourages players to exit jail as fast as possible, but can be utilized with a bit of strategic thinking.

===Go cards===

When landing on Go, the player collects $200 ''and'' must draw a Go Card. These new cards were invented exclusively for the book.

The twelve cards read as follows:
* You decide to take up golf. Pay each other player $25 for private lessons.
* The railroads announce a special youth fare. Deduct 50% from the rent the next time you land on someone else's railroad.
* Advance to Free Parking and collect the kitty. Pay each other player $50 as a tip for parking your car.
* You marry one of your tenants. Collect $25 from each other player as a wedding gift.
* You've been elected sheriff. Send another player to Jail.
* The railroads run late-- again. If you own any railroads, pay every other player $50 as a refund for poor service.
* Your renovations pay off. Collect an additional $50 in rent from the next player to land on one of your properties.
* The city condemns one of your buildings. Sell one building back to the bank at one-half the price you paid for it.
* You win a night on the house. The next time you land on anyone else's property, you are excused from paying rent.
* You hold a party to curry favor with community leaders. Pay $25 to the kitty to pay for the curry.
* Your friends honor you as Tycoon of the Month. Collect $50 from each player.
* Your brother-in-law becomes president of the bank. The bank will contribute $100 to your final bid in the next auction.

==Optional rules==
The book also provides a number of optional rules. 

* Build without owning the complete color set.
** You have to pay $100 to the kitty for each building, and the buildings cost twice the list price. However when selling back it is still at half their old value.

* Once per game, a player can choose to buy a property ''without landing on it'' by paying triple its list price.

* Mortgages are once more allowed but each time a player passes Go there is a 10% penalty, the aggregate cost of their mortgaged properties.

* A player can build houses during their turn only ''after'' rolling the dice.

* Players can trade during an auction.

* Trades can affect a player's right to bid.

* Auctions have no minimum bid price set.

* The first bidder may name any starting price.

The voluntary bankruptcy rules can also be tweaked.
* If six players are left, the player receives $700
* If five players are left, the player receives $750
* If four players are left, the player receives $850
* If three players are left, the player receives $950
* If two players are left, neither can declare voluntary bankruptcy.

* Each player has the option ''once per game'' to voluntarily send themselves to jail.

These rules (except the kitty) make for more interesting trades and a potentially shorter game.

The voluntary bankruptcy rule allows a losing player to get back into the game, whereas otherwise they would be taken out and have to sit and watch to see who wins. Voluntary bankruptcy lets players' final bankruptcies be closer together.

It is probably advisable to put the $1 bills back in the game so as not to slow things down with mathematical calculations.

Starting cash could be limited to $1000-$1200 as seen fit.

These adjustments to the above will create a much faster game (not quite as fast as the traditional rules) and most games will still see many players own at least one Monopoly.

==Summary==
We have often found that Monopoly becomes much more competitive - AND interesting - when these rules are applied (although we use only the &quot;normal&quot; new rules, with the exception of putting half of taxes, fees, etc., into the kitty).

I first picked up this book back when I was in college, and three of us tried to convince our friend across the hall to play with the new rules.  He didn't want to play, preferring the old way, but we talked him into it - and he won!  The next evening, we talked him into playing the new way again - and he won again!  The next evening, HE came to OUR room asking to play the new way!

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Upon reaching the castle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] hands the new students over to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. In an anteroom, the students nervously wait to be sorted into school Houses. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|Ghosts]] passing through the anteroom make Harry even more nervous. Professor McGonagall then leads them into the Great Hall, and in turn, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] calls out which House each student is assigned to. There are four Houses, each with specific characteristics. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]] is filled with ambitious, cunning witches and wizards. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ravenclaw House|Ravenclaw]] is home to the most intelligent. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]] houses only the brave, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hufflepuff House|Hufflepuff]] is where the most fair and honest go. It is Harry's turn, and he sits on the stool and the Sorting Hat is placed on his head; the Hat suggests quietly that Harry's intelligence, talent, and his urge to prove himself could make him great. But Harry balks when the Hat suggests Slytherin, so it instead places him in Gryffindor House. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] also are Sorted into Gryffindor, as well as: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], the boy who lost his toad; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]]; and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], who is mentioned in the US editions as being a &quot;tall, black boy,&quot; but is not described in the book's British editions. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is sorted into Slytherin. Neville later tells Harry that his family had believed he had no magical power at all until he was able to survive being dropped out of a window.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] then makes a few eccentric prefatory remarks, and the feast begins. During the feast the Gryffindor House ghost, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], appears. The older students know him better as Nearly Headless Nick, due to his partially severed neck that barely tethers his head to his body.  As Harry scans the teacher's table, his scar throbs with pain when he sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] teacher, scrutinizing him. One additional Dumbledore announcement catches Harry's ear: ''&quot;this year, the third floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.&quot;'' Harry asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] if Dumbledore is serious, and Percy replies that he must be.

As Percy leads the first-year Gryffindors on a convoluted path through the castle's many corridors, the wall paintings' occupants comment on the passing students. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]], a Poltergeist, briefly harasses them. Eventually they reach the entrance to Gryffindor tower, guarded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|a portrait of a fat lady]]. Percy gives the password (&quot;''Caput Draconis''&quot;), and everyone heads into the common room and to their dormitories. During the night, Harry dreams about Quirrell's turban and Malfoy turning into Snape. By the next morning, Harry has forgotten the dream.

== Analysis ==

Hogwarts castle and its four Houses, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Gryffindor are introduced; we are also served our first taste of the rather eccentric Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (who Harry thinks might be slightly mad), while Harry's scar may be acting as a barometer to the passing scene. Harry's fame in the Wizarding world is also further shown through the other students' excited responses to his name being called out for Sorting.

The Sorting ceremony is arguably the most important school rite that Hogwarts students participate in. It not only determines in which House they will spend their entire seven years at Hogwarts, but it reflects much about who they are and generally indicates what direction their lives may take. They will also be affected by others in their own House. These affiliations will build life-long alliances, as well as create ongoing rivalries among the Houses, though these are generally friendly; there is, however, a particular competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, two Houses that will symbolize themes of good and evil in the series, and which path, light or dark, a character chooses to follow. The four Houses are distinct and represent the individual school founders: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]]. All had varying talents and differing views, and students with similar characteristics to the founders are usually sorted into the House that best reflects those traits. The Hat sees abilities in Harry, cleverness, determination, and ambition that align with Slytherin, and could lead him to greatness, something no one has ever told Harry or that he considered about himself. Some students, like Harry, do appear to have traits suitable to more than one House, and the Sorting Hat mulls over where it should place him. Already dismayed by his connection to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], Harry immediately resists Slytherin, a House he knows is associated with Dark Wizards, as well as unpleasant students such as Draco Malfoy. 

Although the Sorting Hat apparently favors putting Harry in Slytherin House, he is, of course, equally well suited to Gryffindor, which is noted for nobility and bravery, and, in many ways, seemingly opposite to Slytherin. Also, Harry's parents were both Gryffindors. Harry has certainly shown he is noble, and has already demonstrated much courage in his young life, first by standing up to the Dursleys, then by entering a strange, unknown world, and now, as he challenges the Sorting Hat. Rather than passively waiting for it to make its selection, he specifically requests not to be sorted into Slytherin. Most students probably never question or oppose which House they are assigned, and though the Hat senses Harry's talents are suitable to Slytherin, it never forces a choice on him. Instead, it entices Harry by wondering where it should place him. Harry's request shows his growing ability to consider all options and make his own decisions based on that. Even if fate has decreed that he is to one day challenge Voldemort, Harry possesses the power to affect that fate by his own design. This trait is re-emphasized in the next book and throughout the series. After some negotiating, the Hat places him in Gryffindor. It should be noted that Harry never actually requested to be in Gryffindor or the other Houses, rather he chose not to be sorted into Slytherin, a House that, to him, represents a dark path. 

Despite its dark reputation, Slytherin House is not inherently evil, nor are all its students so unpleasant as Draco Malfoy and his cronies. However, that particular House does represent certain characteristics, such as ambition, power-hunger, shrewdness, slyness, etc., that Dark Wizards apparently possess in abundance. Like Harry, all Slytherins have a choice as to how they will utilize these traits and whether they will follow a light or dark path. Later in the series, a Slytherin character becomes Harry's ally.

Dumbledore's stern warning that &quot;this year&quot; the third-floor corridor is off limits, in addition to the package Hagrid delivered, indicates that unusual, and possibly sinister, events may be unfolding at Hogwarts. The break-in at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] may be related, though Harry cannot be certain; it caught his attention purely because he had visited Gringotts a little over a month ago. Harry is beginning to tie these clues together, already suspecting that whatever Hagrid took from Gringotts is what is now being guarded on the third floor. The pain in Harry's scar when Professor Snape looks at him also convinces Harry that Snape is somehow connected to all this. Harry's keen observation and inquisitive nature are becoming apparent here, and throughout the series, he will continually need to piece information together to solve even bigger puzzles, often risking his life in the process. However, his conclusions are sometimes wrong or will lead him in the wrong direction, while his immaturity, bias, and innate stubbornness often prevent him from considering more reasonable alternatives.     

Ideas are also presented on how the Wizarding realm differs from the Muggle world in which Harry had been trapped until now. Understanding how Wizard society operates here is not only appropriate for Harry's age (11), but also the details are presented in a comprehensible manner suitable for someone at that age level who is suddenly thrust into a magical world that they never knew existed. For instance, when the banquet food appears on the plates, Harry never considers who prepared it or how it got placed there. That curiosity and the resultant understanding comes in about another three years.

Harry's dream is foreshadowing this book's main plot line. The reader still knows too little to interpret this dream, but may understand that there is some connection between Quirrell's turban and the pain in Harry's scar.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The byplay between Harry and the Sorting Hat becomes more germane in the second book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], and later in illustrating the differences between Harry and Voldemort. While the Hat recognizes qualities in Harry that were unknowingly bestowed on him by a connection between him and Voldemort, it is ultimately Harry exercising his independent choice and free will that leads to him being assigned to Gryffindor. It is interesting to consider whether or not the Sorting Hat would still have considered Slytherin for Harry if this connection between him and Voldemort had never existed. 

As noted in the above analysis, not all Slytherins are evil. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Horace Slughorn]], a Hogwarts teacher who first appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], is also a Slytherin. He becomes Slytherin's House Head after Professor Snape apparently defects to Voldemort's side. And though Slughorn possesses many typical Slytherin traits, he always follows a light path, rejecting Voldemort's beliefs, and aligns himself with Dumbledore and Harry.   

It is learned later in the series that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], Harry's godfather, was also sorted into Gryffindor, even though his family is primarily sorted into Slytherin House and some are or were affiliated with Lord Voldemort. We do not know whether Sirius, who rejected his family's pure-blood beliefs and eventually became estranged from them, chose not to be placed in Slytherin, though we will learn that he stated a preference for Gryffindor before his own Sorting. It is possible that he, like Harry, refused the Sorting Hat's initial placement, but equally it is possible that the Hat placed him in Gryffindor of its own accord.

We are meant to believe that the exploding pain in Harry's scar is because Snape is staring at him. It is true that Snape is displeased to see him; at that distance, Snape can only see the resemblance between Harry and his father [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]]. We learn later that James and Snape were in the same year at Hogwarts, and they were bitter antagonists. The pain in Harry's scar is because Voldemort, then riding on Quirrell's head, is either looking at Harry through Quirrell's turban, or is using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]] to observe the room, and has just detected Harry.

Harry's scar did not hurt when he first met Quirrell in the Leaky Cauldron, nor did Quirrell's skin burn when they shook hands there (see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|The Man with Two Faces]]), because he was not wearing the turban at the time, and hence Voldemort was not possessing him from the back of his head. Quoting from the text, at the welcoming feast, &quot;Harry spotted Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from from the Leaky Cauldron. ''He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.''&quot; (Emphasis ours.) This implies that this is the first time Harry has seen him wearing a turban.

We will learn later that the same Gringotts vault that Hagrid removed the small parcel from is the one reported as being recently broken into, which of course only adds to the mystery. We should note that Harry's visit to Gringotts is actually further in the past than it currently feels. It was on Harry's birthday, July 31, that Hagrid took Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], and we read about the break-in at Gringotts on the Hogwarts Express, on September 1; the entire month of August falls between the two occurrences.

Harry's dream may actually foreshadow events in the entire series, rather than in just this book. It could also be an unconscious attempt by Voldemort to influence Harry's actions using Legilimency, as he will in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. While this is neither confirmed nor refuted by later events, it is unlikely that Voldemort was consciously using Legilimency; Voldemort started deliberately using Legilimency on Harry after he learned there was an existing connection [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|at about Christmas]] in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. We do learn later in the series, however, that Harry gains the ability to tune into Voldemort's thoughts at will without the Dark Lord being aware. This may be an early incident where neither Harry nor Voldemort are aware it is happening.

There is also half a timeline contradiction in this book. At Nearly Headless Nick's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|deathday party]], commemorating the five-hundredth anniversary of his death, in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', his death is stated to have been on 1492-10-31. However, in this chapter, Nearly Headless Nick states that he has been dead for nearly 400 years. It is assumed that this is an error by the author, which was changed in later editions by having Nick say that he has been dead for nearly 500 years.

As mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8#Greater Picture|the Greater Picture section]] for that Deathday Party chapter, Nearly Headless Nick's death date can determine a timeline for the entire series, leading us to all the book's specific dates. However, this timeline is not critical to this series plot or events, as it only affects the interactions between events in the books and the Muggle world, which are few.

The other teachers' reaction to Dumbledore's announcing the School Song has led many fan sites to question whether its failure to appear in subsequent volumes was due to the teachers rebelling against it. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=104 The author has said] that &quot;Dumbledore called for the school song when he was feeling particularly buoyant, but times are becoming ever darker in the Wizarding world.&quot; It is also true that the School Song, which was entertaining when we heard it initially, would not be equally so if it was re-introduced. This also may be the reason that we so seldom are present at the Sorting, to keep the Hat's annual song from becoming tedious.

=== Connections ===

*Harry's resisting the Sorting Hat's initial placement will be the reason for Dumbledore's later making one of the series' major guiding aphorisms. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], Dumbledore will say, &quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot; This will be demonstrated again, first in the person of James Potter as revealed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], and then later in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], this time about Dumbledore himself.</text>

== Synopsis ==

{{spoiler}}
Almost ten years have passed since baby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], now nearly 11 years old, was left with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys]]. Harry has grown into a skinny boy with unruly black hair, and green eyes hidden behind round glasses. And he has a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. The Dursleys' living room is filled with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley's]] photographs, while there are none of Harry, who sleeps in a spidery cupboard under the staircase.

One morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] awakens Harry, ordering him to cook breakfast. Today is Dudley's birthday, and everything must be perfect. The kitchen table is loaded with presents. The overweight Dudley is a bully who enjoys punching Harry, though he is rarely able to catch him. Dudley enters the kitchen, and is about to throw a tantrum after counting one fewer present than last year. Petunia only narrowly averts the tantrum by quickly promising to buy Dudley two more presents that day, thereby bringing the total to 39.

The Dursleys are taking Dudley to the zoo for his birthday, but they learn that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]], their cat-obsessed neighbour who usually watches Harry, has broken her leg and is unavailable. They discuss what to do with their nephew, while Dudley wails that he does not want Harry to come along. However, Dudley's friend, Piers Polkiss, arrives and the Dursleys are left with no other option than to let Harry join the expedition. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] sternly warns Harry that if any &quot;funny business&quot; occurs he will be in the cupboard until Christmas. (Strange things seem to happen around Harry, and the Dursleys refuse to believe he did not cause them.)

Uncle Vernon becomes angry when Harry mentions dreaming about a flying motorcycle. The zoo goes well at first, and Harry even gets some ice cream. In the reptile house, Harry has a conversation with a large boa constrictor. When Dudley pushes Harry aside so he can see the snake's strange behaviour, the glass enclosing the snake exhibit vanishes. The snake slithers out, thanking Harry and saying that it will go to its natural environment in Brazil.

In the car, Dudley and Piers greatly exaggerate their snake encounter, claiming it attacked them. Back home, a furious Uncle Vernon sends Harry to his cupboard, saying he will not be allowed to have any meals for a week. As Harry lies inside, thinking, he remembers faint images of a flashing green light and pain in his forehead. He also recalls how occasionally, when he is out with the Dursleys, odd-looking people seem to recognize him.

== Analysis ==

It is immediately clear that Harry is unlike other boys, a fact not only known to Vernon and Petunia, but one they are uncomfortable with. The abusive Dursleys have treated him as little more than a slave, showing him no affection, or even the slightest respect. Despite this ill-treatment, however, Harry is neither timid nor bitter, and is generally cheerful and kind, unlike his cousin Dudley, who is being shaped into a cruel, egotistical bully by his parents' overindulgence, and whose name reflects his personality (a dud). Harry's early traits show the admirable attributes which are so vital to his destiny. 

Harry's magical talents are seen burgeoning here, as he makes the glass partition at the zoo disappear and converses with the snake (the latter is explained more fully in this book's successor, ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''). The author has said that this uncontrolled magical ability is normal for wizard children who are still unable to control their powers. Like other Muggle-raised wizard children, Harry knows nothing about these talents, likely making their effect even more disturbing and potentially harmful to those around them. Strangely, however, Harry hardly seems frightened by these bizarre incidents, and only casually questions them. This suggests that he innately accepts magic, and perhaps has an unconscious awareness about his true wizard nature. His enforced isolation from the wizardly world and much of the muggle world also gives him little reference as to what is considered &quot;normal&quot;, though this would probably change as he matured, eventually realizing he is quite different from other people.

Harry has also started experiencing residual memories about his parents' deaths, though he was told they were killed in a car crash. The flying motorcycle in his dream is obviously the one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] used to transport him to the Dursleys, and the green flash he recalls, though as yet unexplained, is also likely linked to those events. Harry will almost certainly experience more memories about that fateful night as he matures.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The scene with the snake could foreshadow events in the next two chapters. Harry and the snake are both prisoners, cut off from the world they truly belong: Harry, stuck with the Dursleys, is isolated from the Wizarding world, just as the snake, captive in the zoo, is prevented from living in the Amazon jungle. Also, both having been raised away from their true homes, lack knowledge about their native worlds. Each in turn is released from their prison, and heads toward an unknown future, somehow believing that it must be better than what they are leaving behind.

We learn here about Harry's ability to speak to snakes, a fact that becomes important in future books. A wizard who is able to speak to snakes is called a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parselmouth|Parselmouth]], and the language itself is called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]. Being Muggle-raised, Harry does not know just how rare this ability is, and is dismayed to learn that it is linked with the descendants of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], a wizard who is seen as an originator of the extremely prejudiced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|system of beliefs about Blood purity]]. It will be a plot point in two later books, also, that Harry is not conscious of whether he is speaking and hearing English or Parseltongue.

The speaking with snakes, and the disappearing glass, are only the latest manifestations of Harry's magical background; we have also, in this chapter, read about flying to a rooftop to avoid a beating from Dudley's gang, hair that grew back overnight, and a jumper (sweater) that shrunk impossibly when Aunt Petunia was trying to fit it onto Harry. While it seems that these early magical signs could be the trigger that puts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s great plan into action, we must recall that Harry is about to turn 11. It is when magical children turn that age that they are invited to attend [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], which they begin the September that follows their eleventh birthday. The author has stated that Hogwarts is the only Wizarding school in the United Kingdom, thus every magical child will receive the opportunity to attend when he or she reaches 11. Not all children do attend; some, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]], who we will meet later in the series, likely would never have entrusted the established school system with their children. Others may attend a school in another country. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], Harry's future nemesis, mentions that he almost went to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], a school hidden somewhere in Eastern Europe, and a place Harry will likely wish Draco had attended.

It should be noted that Harry, in this chapter, produces the same effect as a Vanishing Spell, a spell that isn't taught until fifth year, and does so without a wand. Harry also demonstrates wandless magic in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]] insults [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]]. The common factor in these events, along with the earlier manifestations of magic, was that Harry was in a highly charged emotional state. From this, it is easy to infer that wandless magic is associated with strong emotional feelings.

As the story progresses, Harry's personal qualities, as well as his flaws, are continually seen as he matures into a young man. Whereas Harry develops into a well-rounded person, the Dursleys are always depicted as rather two-dimensional, uncaring, and unpleasant characters, whose faults are deliberately exaggerated in order to contrast Harry's good nature with the  worst in human attributes.

Although Harry has no idea yet that he possesses magical powers, he is beginning to realize that he has some unusual abilities that other children lack. From later conversations Harry has with Muggle-born wizard children, it appears that their families were generally unaware the Wizarding world existed until their child was old enough to attend Hogwarts. The parents, who probably realized their child was somehow different, generally are quite shocked upon learning they have a magical offspring. It is unknown why Muggle parents are apparently never told about the magical world prior to their child's eleventh birthday. At least some Muggle-born magical children may show no overt magical ability until they are older, and therefore remain undetected by the Wizarding community. Harry, however, discovers that the Dursleys have always known that he is a wizard, and not only deliberately withheld this information, but attempted to suppress his magical ability. Harry also learns his parents were wizards and were murdered, rather than killed in a car crash as the Dursleys told him. Harry will discover even later that Aunt Petunia knows far more about the Wizarding world than she has ever let on, even to her husband. 

Under the pretext of explaining why the Dursleys fear leaving Harry home alone, we learn how he previously used magic before knowing he was a wizard, basically in self-defence. This story is a contrast to the tale in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] of how the young boy, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] (later known as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]), used his powers to terrorize other children prior to learning he was a wizard. This comparison between the two characters adds another layer to the good vs. evil theme.

Mrs. Figg, who like many characters in this series is introduced by name before being seen in person, is the Dursleys' odd neighbour who occasionally watches Harry. Although she appears to be an unlikeable person, she is actually tied to the wizard world (though she has no magical powers), and works for Professor Dumbledore, helping to guard Harry. She is also a member of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]], Dumbledore's secret organization that fights Voldemort. Another character, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]], who is Vernon's sister, is also mentioned by name in this chapter. Unlike Mrs. Figg, she actually is very unpleasant, as will be seen in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' where she has a small, but pivotal role in one chapter.

*Sirius Black's flying motorcycle, initially seen in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|previous chapter]], is very likely the motorcycle that Harry dreams about.
*The green flashes in Harry's dream likely also are the wand flashes of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] killing Harry's mother and attempting to kill Harry.
*Harry's ability to talk to snakes will form a major plot point in the next book, ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''. It will also be key to Harry understanding an episode at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/House of Gaunt|the Gaunt shack]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], and will be the technique used to open a locket in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 19|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Harry's being unaware of whether he is speaking English or Parseltongue will be key to an episode in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] as well. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Ron is able to use Harry's Parseltongue ability to open the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], repeating from memory what he once heard Harry speaking.
*Mrs. Figg [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|will turn out]] to be tied to the Wizarding world, not only knowing about Harry's situation, but having the job of monitoring Harry's progress and reporting problems to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]].</text>

== Synopsis ==

{{spoiler}}

BOOM! The loud knocking continues outside the door.  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] rushes in with a rifle as the door is smashed in. A huge man with a bearded face enters. He twists Uncle Vernon's gun barrel like a pretzel, sits down and wishes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] happy birthday, then gives him a squished cake. The giant makes himself at home, starts a fire, and makes tea and cooks sausages. He introduces himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Hagrid is dismayed that the Dursleys revealed nothing to Harry about his past or about his parents, and furious that Harry was told that his mother and father died in a car crash. Hagrid explains that Harry is a wizard, a very famous wizard. He presents Harry his letter, now addressed to him at the shack. The letter invites Harry to attend [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

Hagrid sends an owl to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] saying he found Harry and will be taking him to get his school supplies. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] begins ranting and Harry learns that she and Uncle Vernon have always known about his past. Hagrid tells Harry about a Dark wizard named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] (though Hagrid seems to have enormous difficulty saying the name, apparently afraid), who ten years ago (when Harry was only one-year-old) tracked down and murdered Harry's parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]]. He also tried to kill Harry, but failed, and left Harry the scar on his forehead. When asked what happened to Voldemort, Hagrid tells Harry no one is certain, but something happened to him (on the Hallowe'en night he tried to kill Harry) that drove him into hiding.

Harry questions whether he is really a wizard, but Hagrid asks whether he ever made things happen when he was angry or scared. Harry remembers things he had done, most recently the boa constrictor, and smiles. Uncle Vernon interrupts, saying Harry is not attending a magic school. Harry is angry that his aunt and uncle knew he was a wizard, as were his parents, and that they lied about how James and Lily died. Vernon refuses to pay, then insults Albus Dumbledore, calling him &quot;some crackpot old fool&quot;. Hagrid, infuriated, uses his umbrella (apparently containing his wand) to give [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] a pig's tail. The Dursleys scramble into the other room, terrified. Hagrid asks Harry to avoid mentioning to anyone at Hogwarts that he performed magic, as he is forbidden to use it, though he was allowed to use some only while on his mission to retrieve Harry. Hagrid explains that he was expelled from Hogwarts during his third year, though he changes the subject when Harry questions him further. It is late, and Hagrid says they have much to do the next day. At that they go to sleep, Hagrid on the couch, Harry under Hagrid's huge coat on the floor.

== Analysis ==

Without realizing it, Harry has reached the most significant milestone in his life thus far: his 11th birthday. Hagrid's arrival on that day not only liberates Harry from his miserable existence, it has given him knowledge about himself that, though he may have realized later, he never had imagined before. He is also empowered to stand up against the abusive Dursleys&amp;mdash;forever altering their relationship; from here on, his life will never be the same. Now Harry is empowered to make choices that will determine his destiny. He alone decides whether to stay with the Dursleys or attend Hogwarts, leaving behind the Muggle world where he subconsciously felt he never belonged. By choosing Hogwarts, Harry shows his budding maturity and independence, and also a new ability to chart his own life's course. Later in the series, Harry develops a reluctance to put his faith into the unknown, but this time he unhesitatingly believes this is his true path, and that nothing could be worse than what he already must endure. He trusts Hagrid to lead him on those first tentative steps. Harry is livid that his aunt and uncle hid the truth, as adults often do to protect children, though the Dursleys' were entirely spurred by hate and resentment, rather than any attempt to shield a child from something unpleasant or hurtful. The obstinate Dursleys' refusal to allow Harry to attend Hogwarts is clearly intended to deny him what they know he wants most. Even though the Dursleys detest Harry's presence, and his departure would alleviate much unwanted responsibility for his care, they want to keep him at home purely to be spiteful, though Petunia may have an additional reason. This time, however, the choice is Harry's alone, and he opts to leave the Muggle world (and the Dursleys) behind, though we expect he will periodically revisit Privet Drive, at vacations and other times when the school is closed, until he reaches adulthood.

As an astonished Harry learns about his true past and how his parents actually died, we learn more about what happened the night Lord Voldemort came to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]]. We sense the dread most wizards feel for Voldemort, or even the terror his name alone evokes, despite his being defeated ten years before. This lingering apprehension seems to indicate that the Wizarding world may still be uncertain that Voldemort is truly dead and whether he can or will return. Harry lacks this fear, perhaps because he was never conditioned to it like other Wizards have been over the years. Instead, he comes to consider Voldemort as his foe, but not an invincible one.

A central theme to these books is prejudice, divisiveness, and fear of the unknown. This chapter, particularly Petunia's tirade, shows a biased view from the Muggle side of the Muggle/Magic divide toward anything that is seemingly strange or different. The Dursleys' behaviour is also a classic example showing how human ignorance and fear tend to go hand-in-hand. In a vicious circle, their ignorance perpetually causes them to be frightened by magic, while that fear prevents them from developing a better understanding of it. In contrast, Harry's willingness to accept his magical nature when the evidence is presented, as well as his intuitiveness regarding his abilities, clearly indicates his open-minded intelligence.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

This chapter briefly mentions Hagrid's expulsion from Hogwarts, which is an important plot element in the next book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']].

Hagrid's fear to speak Voldemort's name aloud will be echoed throughout the series, with people referring to him as, &quot;the Dark Lord,&quot; &quot;you-know-who&quot;, &quot;he who must not be named&quot;, as well as other variants. This dread, though constant, is greatly reinforced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the seventh book]] when Voldemort places a taboo on his name, such that anyone uttering it is immediately detected and subjected to reprisals. The taboo is generally aimed at those fighting him, as they are among the few who dare speak his name, and most specifically at Harry Potter, who has become public enemy number one under Voldemort's new regime. While only speculated, it is possible that a similar taboo could have existed during Voldemort's initial reign, and that it engendered a fear of his name among the Wizarding populace. By contrast, Harry is also known by a different moniker, &quot;the Boy Who Lived&quot; (and later, &quot;the Chosen One&quot;), though none in the Wizarding world fear using his real name.

Petunia's tirade is meant to show how Muggles' fear and disdain what they are unable to fully understand. While this becomes a recurring theme in the series, Petunia's reaction is actually motivated by jealousy that her sister, Lily, was a witch, while she is not. After Lily received her Hogwarts letter, Petunia also desperately wanted to attend, but lacking any magical ability, she was forced to remain behind in the Muggle world. To console herself, she became convinced that Lily was a freak and the Wizarding world, and anything or anyone tied to it, is &quot;abnormal&quot;, and she resolved to be as opposite from that as possible; she has since inflicted her bitter resentment and animosity onto Harry, and her refusal to allow her nephew to attend Hogwarts is a feeble attempt to deny him what she was unable to have. Fortunately, it is Harry's decision alone as to whether or not he will attend the school. 

By learning his own true nature, Harry has taken the first step on the path leading to his eventual destiny. He will continue on it throughout the series, with some occasional setbacks.

=== Connections ===

*Petunia's hatred of her sister and fear of magic is introduced. It will reappear in each book in turn, though less pronounced than here, until finally the reason is revealed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|the final book of the series]].

*Hagrid's fear of mentioning Voldemort's name will be echoed by Ron in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 20|We will discover there, also,]] the reason for that fear.

*This is the first instance where we actually see the Wizarding mail system, owl post, being used. This recurs throughout the series.

*The facts behind Hagrid's expulsion will be laid out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 15|Shortly after that,]] we begin to understand why Dumbledore rejected the reasoning that resulted in Hagrid's expulsion, and now trusts him with important school-related errands.</text>

== Synopsis ==

{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] awakens to an owl furiously pecking at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s coat, demanding payment for the newspaper it just delivered. Hagrid sleepily tells Harry to give the owl five [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Knuts]], the odd-looking bronze coins stuffed inside the coat's pocket. Harry places the coins inside a small sack tied to the owl's leg and it flies off. Soon after, Harry and Hagrid set off for London, using the same boat Vernon hired to get to the island. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]] (non-magical folk) stare at Hagrid, scrambling to let him and Harry pass. Riding the Underground to central London, Harry and Hagrid finally arrive at an establishment called the Leaky Cauldron. Harry notices that Muggles seem oblivious to the pub in-between two other businesses. Harry suspects that only Hagrid and himself can see it.

Upon entering the dark and rather shabby pub, Harry is greeted enthusiastically by its excited patrons. Hagrid introduces Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Quirrell]], the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructor, who appears timid and nervous. Harry and Hagrid exit into a small courtyard behind the Leaky Cauldron. While Harry reflects on peoples' reaction to him, Hagrid taps the wall bricks with his umbrella; a hole appears, growing bigger and bigger, forming an archway. They enter into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], the wizard commerce district.

Harry and Hagrid walk past the many magic shops and down the street to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]], the wizard bank. At Gringotts, Hagrid produces a vault key, and a note authorizing him to enter another vault on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] behalf. After a high-speed cart ride with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] the Goblin (making Hagrid queasy), they reach Harry's vault, which is filled with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|wizard money]] (galleons, sickles, and knuts). Hagrid helps Harry draw enough for school supplies and expenses, and educates him on the wizard monetary system. After another cart ride, Hagrid removes the sole item inside vault #713, a small grubby parcel. Hagrid asks Harry to say nothing to anyone about this package.

Back on the surface, Hagrid helps Harry buy school supplies. In Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions shop, Harry meets another first-year Hogwarts student, a snobbish boy who espouses allowing only the finer Wizarding families to attend Hogwarts. Before introductions are exchanged, Harry leaves to buy books, a telescope, and a cauldron. For his birthday, Hagrid buys him a snowy owl that Harry names [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]. Finally, they stop at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander's]] to purchase a wand. Mr. Ollivander, who remembers every wand he has ever sold, says Harry will know when he finds the right one. After trying out many wands, Harry picks up one made from holly; sparks flare from its tip&amp;mdash;this is Harry's wand. Mr. Ollivander says it is brother to the wand that gave Harry his scar. Each wand's core contains one of only two tail-feathers ever donated by a particular [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]].

== Analysis ==

Just as Hagrid carried Harry to the Muggle world on a flying motorbike, now the gentle giant whisks him away, first by boat, then by underground rail to Diagon Alley in central London. Transportation vehicles, particularly trains, become important symbols running throughout the series. The Hogwarts Express, the train that Harry will soon ride to Hogwarts for the first time, is the means that continually shuttles him back-and-forth between the Magical and Muggle worlds, at least until he is an adult. It is rarely a smooth ride between these two realms. Other magically enhanced vehicles will come to represent Harry's escape from danger or turmoil, and his growing independence, as well as his overall journey through the series.

The parallel Wizarding society that we and Harry are introduced to seems to share more similarities than differences with the Muggle world Harry is about to leave behind. Magic alone is apparently inadequate to provide for all wizards' needs, and they therefore have their own highly-organized commerce and social infrastructure that includes a bank, retail shops, government, penal system, mass media, an educational institution, and so on. Wizards actually seem to function much as Muggles&amp;mdash;they have jobs to earn a living, buy what they need from stores, marry and raise families, and celebrate the same traditions and holidays, such as Christmas, Hallowe'en, Easter, etc. Harry quickly encounters a more negative similarity, however, when he meets Draco Malfoy, the snobbish boy in the shop, who soon becomes Harry's primary nemesis, just as Dudley is in the Muggle world, and who represents the deep class divisions and prejudices within wizard society. This becomes a major theme in the series. Even Draco's name portends this unpleasant relationship: Draco is, of course, Latin for &quot;dragon&quot; and Malfoy can loosely be translated as &quot;bad faith&quot; in French. What is quite different from Muggles, apart from magic, is the mythic beings inhabiting this clandestine world. Here we meet Goblins, and hear about Phoenixes, Dragons, Unicorns, Hags, and Vampires. This is our first intimation that these mythological creatures may have a real, parallel existence. 

Wizards have secretly co-existed alongside the Muggle world for centuries. To reflect this side-by-side (and occasionally intersecting) existence with humans, the author has cleverly named the wizard business district Diagon Alley (diagonally). Its seedy, dark underbelly is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] (nocturnally), where many Dark wizards ply their trade or otherwise engage in unsavory or illegal activities. These dark and light areas come to represent themes of good and evil that permeate the series. 

And as secret as the wizard world is kept, some Muggles, such as the Dursleys and the Grangers, need to know that it exists, while a few even marry into it, sometimes unknowingly; it is revealed later in the series that the incumbent British prime ministers communicate as needed with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], the wizard government. It should also be assumed that wizard banking must somehow be connected to human commerce so that Muggle parents can exchange their British currency for wizard galleons and sickles to buy their magical offspring basic Wizarding necessities. Fortunately, Harry has no need to exchange currency, his parents have left him a small fortune stored in Gringotts Bank. This, combined with his magical talent and celebrity, will make for a potent combination that aids Harry throughout the series. Harry, however, remains generally unaffected by wealth and fame, caring little for material possessions and shunning the spotlight; he will, however, be able to use his new-found inheritance to bolster his independence, provide all his own needs, and further distance himself from the Dursleys' control, though, unfortunately, he must remain bound to them until he is a legal adult.  

Harry is amazed by Diagon Alley, but also that everyone knows who he is and that he is so readily accepted and respected by other wizards. He has been famous almost since birth, an apparent hero to an entire population, though unaware of why, or even of his own fame. Having been treated his entire life as if he barely existed, Harry's reaction to this attention is mostly astonishment at being acknowledged, and embarrassment, feeling he has done nothing special to deserve the adulation. To readers, who still lack any knowledge of why Harry is so famous, his being treated as a &quot;hero&quot; may seem premature, but this label might actually presage future events, as well as designating what he may or may not have already accomplished. We will also contrast Harry's behavior with another character who constantly thrives on and seeks out fame in the next book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']].

Harry remains curious regarding what Hagrid removed from vault #713. While it is unknown yet what the packet contains, there are clues that it must be valuable. Hagrid's behavior suggests this, with the deliberate care and secrecy he shows when retrieving the package, and by his asking Harry to mention nothing about what he has seen. Also, there being nothing else inside other than the packet indicates it is probably a high-security vault protecting only that one item. Storing nothing else in it prevents anyone from having a reason, other than this particular object, to access the vault. Any break-in attempt would reveal what a thief was after.

As Harry learns about the wizarding world, so too does he discover more about his parents, his own past, and his relationship to Voldemort. Harry's wand plays an integral part in this relationship. A wand is a wizard's most important possession; without it, it is nearly impossible to perform magic. Ollivander tells Harry that the wand chooses the wizard, and a unique bond is indeed created between it and its owner; this ability to choose the wizard indicates wands may be somewhat sentient. The wood type and the core material apparently also play a part in this bonding process. Harry's wand, for example, is holly, a wood traditionally thought to repel evil, while a Phoenix is associated with purity and resurrection.

Harry learns that the wand destined to be his has a connection with Voldemort's wand; this seems to disturb him somewhat, as he shivers when Ollivander tells him that the core of his new wand and the core of Voldemort's wand came from the same phoenix. This fact tells the reader that there is a present connection between Harry and Voldemort, not just a past connection, and may foreshadow Harry's destiny. It also represents the darker, sinister side to what had initially seemed to readers like a magical paradise; the wizarding world actually may be far more dangerous than the unhappy Muggle one Harry is leaving behind.

The &quot;small, grubby parcel&quot; that Hagrid removes from the vault is the titular [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone (US: Sorcerer's Stone)]], which will be central to this book's plot. Harry, with his limited classical education, is unable to understand why this Stone is so prized, but a classmate, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], will explain it to him.

Hagrid marvels at the things Muggles have come up with in order to live without magic. The reader who is paying attention will note that with a very few exceptions (indoor plumbing, for example, and artificial illumination in some cases), the Wizarding world is not using any technology at all more recent than the invention of the printing press. It is uncertain why wizards have chosen to keep these older ways of doing things. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] later comments that the magical field around Hogwarts is so strong that technology simply doesn't work; this cannot be the reason that Wizarding households avoid technology, because technology still works perfectly around strong wizards like Harry and Hermione in their Muggle homes. It is possible that wizards feel that magic is more reliable than technology, or, especially in a certain segment of the wizard population, it may be a point of pride to avoid anything Muggle-made.

Harry's humility is shown here. While this character trait continually serves him well, it becomes masked by his unique position as &quot;the Boy Who Lived&quot;. Harry will thwart Voldemort repeatedly, until gradually, he comes to believe that only he can accomplish certain feats regarding the Dark Lord. Close examination will reveal that while he somewhat accepts his designation as a hero, he never capitalizes on his status; rather, it becomes an increasing obligation (and burden). Late in the series, the Ministry of Magic publicly begins calling him The Chosen One, as it attempts to exploit him in a weak and misguided effort to show the public they are actually doing &quot;something&quot; to fight Voldemort. Despite being thrust into the limelight in this manner, Harry avoids exploiting his fame for personal gain, instead shunning it to continue the near-impossible mission fate has tasked him with, lending further evidence that he is destined to become the classic hero.

It is mentioned that Ollivander's window display contains only a single wand on a cushion. We discover later, notably in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], that Voldemort has been hunting artifacts belonging to the four Hogwarts Founders to make into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. It has been speculated that the wand in Ollivander's window might be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]]. While this may seem related to Ollivander's disappearance in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', the lost Ravenclaw artifact, a Diadem (tiara), was actually found and made into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] by Voldemort, many years before he encountered Harry.

Griphook, the Goblin, and Mr. Ollivander, the wand maker, are introduced here. Both will play significant roles in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. Ollivander's claim that, &quot;The wand chooses the Wizard&quot; is a key plot point in the larger story, and particularly significant in book 7. It is possible that Harry's wand, related to the one the Dark Lord owns, chose him because it recognized Voldemort's soul shard that Harry carries within him, though no one, not even Voldemort, knows it exists.

Harry and Voldemort's wands are considered &quot;brothers&quot; even though they are different woods. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=18 According to the author], Harry's wand is holly, a wood traditionally believed to repel evil. Voldemort's wand is yew, a long-lived tree that also represents death and resurrection. What bonds them are their identical magical cores: Phoenix tail feathers. A Phoenix is a mythical bird that repeatedly dies by bursting into flames, then is reborn from its own ashes. Harry will learn that the particular Phoenix who donated only these two feathers is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], Dumbledore's animal familiar. Fawkes saves Harry's life in the next book, and also heals his wound in book 4. The provenance of the magical core within his wand becomes vitally important in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

=== Connections ===
* It is revealed here that Harry's wand and Voldemort's are brothers, having cores made from the only two feathers provided by one particular phoenix, later identified as Dumbledore's animal familiar, Fawkes. The effect of Harry's and Voldemort's wands being brothers will be seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], and explained as being the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem effect]] in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|later chapter of the same book]]. Issues arising out of the two wands being brothers will drive one of the many subplots in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].
*The Philosopher's Stone, of course, will power much of this book. It will be mentioned again [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 21|in the final book]]. During the discussion of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] will argue that the Resurrection Stone is clearly impossible, and so must be a misinterpretation of the Philosopher's Stone, which they know exists.
*We find out that Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped; we also learn that the pieces, apparently still functional, are hidden in his umbrella. Hagrid using this umbrella to perform magic is seen again in the next book.

== Synopsis ==

{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is finally released from the cupboard after being punished for the boa constrictor episode. The summer holiday has started and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] and his friends harass Harry daily, enjoying their favorite sport, &quot;Harry Hunting&quot;. Dudley has been accepted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]'s old public school (US: private school), Smeltings, whereas Harry will be going to a local comprehensive (US:public school), Stonewall High.

In July, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] takes Dudley shopping for his school apparel. The next morning Harry finds his aunt dyeing Dudley's old clothes grey, to make Harry a &quot;school uniform&quot;.  As everyone sits down for breakfast, the mail arrives. Harry and Dudley have a short argument over who must retrieve the mail. Harry loses. Picking up the mail, Harry sees a letter addressed to him:

:''Mr. H. Potter''
:''The Cupboard under the Stairs''
:''4 Privet Drive''
:''Little Whinging''
:''Surrey''

Harry has never received a letter before and is unsure who sent it.  The envelope is a thick, heavy, yellow parchment with a strange wax seal on the back. Uncle Vernon snatches the letter from Harry as he tries to read it. Vernon is shocked by the letter's content and immediately sends Dudley and Harry from the kitchen so he and Petunia can discuss it. Dudley and Harry listen to the conversation through the keyhole and the gap under the door, and overhear them decide to ignore the letter.

Uncle Vernon moves Harry into Dudley's second bedroom, but day after day, more letters arrive for Harry, now addressed to him in, &quot;The Smallest Bedroom&quot;, despite Vernon's attempts to block them. Vernon refuses to allow Harry to have the letters. On Sunday, when Uncle Vernon is certain no post will be delivered, letters begin streaming from the fireplace. Deciding enough is enough, Vernon packs everyone into the car, and drives all day to a run-down hotel on some small town's outskirts. The next day &quot;about a hundred letters&quot; arrive at the hotel addressed to Harry. Next, Uncle Vernon finds a rickety old shack on a rocky island off the coast, accessible only by boat. As they settle in for the night, Harry stares at Dudley's watch, counting down the minutes to midnight and his eleventh birthday.  A storm is raging, but Harry thinks he hears something else outside the shack. Just as he counts the final second to his birthday a huge BOOM shakes the shack. Something is pounding on the door.

== Analysis ==

Harry is astounded to receive a letter formally addressed to him. Having been treated as a non-entity his entire life, this is among the few times he has been singled out as an individual, though he is unable to fathom who could have sent it or why. He becomes even more determined to learn the letter's contents and its sender's identity. Harry has little idea that unknown persons have already determined that he will indeed receive his letter, whatever it takes and despite the Dursleys' feeble attempts to prevent it. When the letters begin arriving non-stop and en masse, Harry, even with his limited worldly knowledge, must suspect that this is hardly a normal occurrence, though he is certainly unable to explain just what is happening. By now, he, and we, suspect that there is some extraordinary magical means underway here, though it is still unknown just what that is.  

Uncle Vernon’s panicked attempts to block, then outrun, the letters are not only futile, but analogous to those who ignore facts and deny reality. Avoiding unpleasant truths, and the belief that refusing to admit something must therefore mean it is untrue, is a common human weakness. While this can provide some immediate, though short-term comfort, like the letters bursting from the fireplace, the truth tends to return and strike you full force in the face. Unfortunately, this is a lesson Vernon Dursley resists learning, as determined denial and brutish ignorance are key components to his character. As the Dursleys frantically attempt to hide, an enjoyably tense, moody atmosphere builds, almost as if Harry's true identity and destiny are rushing toward him, no matter how hard and far the Dursleys try outrunning it. In an almost Gothic-type setting, on a remote island, in the dark night, and amid a raging storm, the tension mounts until &quot;BOOM!&quot; it slams into the door&amp;mdash;the truth finally catching the Dursleys; nothing in their lives, or Harry's, will ever be the same again.

As mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]], there are a few places in the series where days and dates do not line up. We have already seen that this book covers events largely in 1991 and 1992. The Dursleys leave Privet Drive for the hotel on Sunday, leave the hotel and drive to the island on Monday (Dudley complains because he is missing The Great Humberto on TV), and so Harry's birthday falls on Tuesday. However, July 31, 1991 is a Wednesday. This trivial error does not truly affect the story in any way, and is included here more as a curiosity than as something for the scholar to concern himself with.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Readers can see how far the Dursleys will go to appear normal to their neighbors and avoid drawing attention to themselves, although their actions are anything but ''normal''. Their obsessive need to maintain this facade is why they often hide Harry in his room, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 1|including when they are entertaining guests early in the next book]], and it is also the reason they never carry out their threat to throw him out of their house after the dramatic events at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|beginning of Harry's fifth year]].

The Dursleys' trait of attempting to eliminate unpleasant truths by ignoring or denying them, which we see in this chapter, is not, it should be noted, restricted to Muggles. We will see the same behaviour in the Wizarding world throughout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] will use the same technique to try to refute the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

It is interesting to note that Vernon's actions during this chapter and the next are a reasonable depiction of someone suffering a stress-related nervous breakdown. Vernon has spent ten years trying to suppress the knowledge that Harry is a wizard, and now sees that effort crashing down around him as the letters from the Wizard world start appearing. And here, we see the author's sense of humour showing, as she has Vernon using a piece of fruitcake as a hammer, and has letters appear inside eggshells.</text>

== Synopsis ==

{{spoiler}}

Back [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|at the Dursleys']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] must wait out the month before leaving for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] agrees to take him to London only because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] also has an appointment with a surgeon to have his pig's tail removed. The Dursleys leave Harry at the station, unable to find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform 9¾]] where his train is supposed to leave.

Spotting another apparent wizard family, Harry tags along to the Hogwarts Express platform. This family, who recognize him, are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|the Weasleys]], and Harry meets three of the four Weasley children currently attending Hogwarts: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], also a first-year, who shares a compartment with Harry. ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]] and so rides in the prefects' compartment.) Ron tells him about Chocolate Frogs, and the enclosed Famous Wizard cards in each package; Harry gets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s card, among others. Ron also mentions that there was a break-in at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]; Harry is interested after his own recent trip there.

During the train ride, various other students stop by the compartment to introduce themselves to the famous Harry Potter. A shy boy named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] comes by, searching for his toad, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], a rather bossy girl, arrives shortly after, helping Neville search for Trevor. She appears disdainful when Ron's attempt to cast a spell fails, causing the two boys to take a dislike to her. Later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], the boy Harry met in Madam Malkin's shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], stops by, flanked by his two friends, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Malfoy attempts to coerce Harry into an alliance; that fails, partially because Malfoy bad-mouths the Weasley family, who are poor. The three try to steal the snacks Harry bought, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], Ron's pet rat, stops them by attacking Goyle. Finally, Hermione returns, saying the train is about to arrive at Hogwarts, and they should change into their school robes.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Station]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] appears and shepherds the first-years to small boats that carry the students across the lake to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts castle]].

== Analysis ==

Harry's journey to a new life and an unknown future officially begins aboard the Hogwarts Express. Although he is required to periodically return to the Dursleys' home until he is of legal age, Harry's emotional ties to his erstwhile family and the Muggle world are now forever severed; it is likely that Harry will rarely, if ever, completely re-enter his former Muggle life once he becomes an adult, permanently leaving it, and his family, behind. On the train, Harry makes many new friends, though most seem drawn by their curiosity to meet someone so famous, and likely leaving Harry a little uncomfortable that everyone already knows so much about him, while he knows nothing about them. Ron and Harry, being the same age, immediately bond, and Ron, generally unimpressed by Harry's celebrity, provides information about wizards, while Harry is able to share much about Muggles. Harry, feeling insecure and stressed, confides in Ron his worries of being the worst in the class, but Ron helps ease his misgivings. Ron will continually guide Harry (and later Hermione) about general wizard society. Harry is also reacquainted with Draco Malfoy, the snobbish boy from Diagon Alley, and meets his equally unpleasant companions, Crabbe and Goyle. By spurning Draco's offer of friendship, if it can be considered that, Harry becomes Draco's primary enemy at Hogwarts. Draco's condescending manner toward Ron and his family also gives us a closer glimpse into the lineage-related prejudice which plagues the Wizard world, and which Hagrid had mentioned in passing after Harry's encounter with Draco. This apparent prejudice being introduced so early in the series suggests strongly that it may be a major factor in full story arc.

Hermione Granger, making her first appearance in the series, is portrayed as a true grind – a girl whose &quot;know-it-all&quot; attitude is off-putting and will win her few, if any, friends, though she is likely far less confident than she hopes to appear. Harry and Ron instantly dislike her, though not as they dislike the anti-Trio&amp;mdash;Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle&amp;mdash;who they immediately despise for good reason.

Hermione's rigid, rule-abiding personality gradually mellows during the series; little do Harry and Ron realize how integral she will soon become to their lives, particularly Ron's. The characters' ongoing maturation, especially Hermione and Ron, and to a slightly lesser extent, Harry, significantly helps make the overall story so compelling and realistic. And while Ron finds Hermione extremely annoying and about as opposite from his personality as anyone could be, he has little idea that he has just met his one true love; their road to romance will be difficult, however.

Albus Dumbledore's &quot;Famous Wizards&quot; card is the key that provides a crucial clue to the riddle that needs to be solved during this book. While much of what Harry reads on Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card will prove important to this book, it becomes even more significant in book 7. In an almost stunning amount of interconnection between the first book and the last, we discover that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], mentioned on Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card, was an influence on the young Dumbledore, and has a pivotal, though not central, role in the series' final book.

It is a little curious as to just why Draco Malfoy attempted to befriend Harry. Draco is already well versed in his family's &quot;pure-blood&quot; ethos, and presumably knows that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] was somehow felled by the famous Harry Potter. Whatever Draco's true motive was, it is never revealed, though it is interesting to consider what might have transpired had Harry accepted Draco's offer of friendship, and whether this would have affected his decision not to be sorted into Slytherin.

Harry's interest in the break-in at Gringotts Bank may foreshadow the episode where he, Ron, and Hermione successfully break into that very bank in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', to steal one of Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]] that is stored in the Lestrange's vault.

Also, Ron's beloved pet, Scabbers, will turn out to be something quite different than a mere rat, but readers should perhaps note here how he acts to prevent Draco and his companions from stealing Harry's and Ron's snacks.

=== Connections ===
*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 11|Later in this book]], Hagrid will mention that the &quot;small, grubby parcel&quot; that he had taken out of Gringotts was the business only of Dumbledore and &quot;Nicolas Flamel&quot;. Dumbledore's Famous Wizards card mentions that Dumbledore and Flamel had been working on the Philosopher's Stone. Harry will make this connection when Neville Longbottom gives him another copy of Dumbledore's Famous Wizards card [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 13|later still]].
*The connection between Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, who is also mentioned on Dumbledore's Famous Wizards card, will be expanded in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. The duel with Grindelwald, and Dumbledore's treatise on the twelve uses of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon's]] blood, will be mentioned in passing also. The treatise on the twelve uses of dragon's blood will also be mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']].
*The break-in mentioned here will be expanded upon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 8|in a later chapter of this book]]. It will be mentioned again as Harry plans to break into Gringotts himself, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 24|in the final book.]] It will be partly because of this earlier break in that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] will agree to help them.
*This is our first view of Scabbers, who will be a pivotal character in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']].</text>

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] first few days at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] are trying indeed, and the students constantly staring at him makes him nervous and uncomfortable. The huge castle is convoluted, and Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] repeatedly get lost on their way to class, making them late, or they are caught as they are accidentally about to enter forbidden areas, putting them (on their first day at Hogwarts) on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|the caretaker, Argus Filch's]] bad side. And the lessons are difficult.

Harry meets his teachers: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]]. He also has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], though of course he has met them before.

At breakfast on Friday, Harry receives his first owl post message, from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], inviting him to tea after class. Harry then attends his first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], a double-length class shared with Slytherin first-years. Class does not go well, with Snape singling Harry out, and ridiculing him for his limited magical knowledge. Snape, who apparently dislikes Harry's celebrity status, is continually harder on Harry than even the other Gryffindors in the class. In particular, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] melts the cauldron he shares with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]], Snape unjustly holds Harry partly responsible and penalizes Gryffindor House one point.

When Harry (and Ron) arrive at Hagrid's hut for tea, Harry finds a clipping from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] mentioning the Gringotts Wizarding Bank break-in. Hagrid refuses to discuss it, and Harry concludes that the burglarized vault was the same one Hagrid emptied during their trip to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

==Analysis==

Many Hogwarts teachers are introduced, at least those who become substantial characters in this and future books. While most teachers are delighted to have Harry Potter in their classes, Snape, hardly impressed, singles out Harry to unfairly ridicule or reproach him. This becomes an ongoing occurrence throughout the series, and it appears here that Snape's behavior is fueled by his resentment over Harry's fame. This idea is reinforced in the next book, where Snape's negative reaction to a celebrity teacher is also seen. Only later is it learned why Snape resents Harry so much, and their mutual animosity grows throughout the series.

In Harry's conversation with Hagrid, we can see Harry's natural urge to understand and investigate, a quality that will equip him to solve (with help) the many mysteries put before him throughout his seven-year story. This innate curiosity may be leading him to the forbidden third-floor corridor, determined to discover what lies hidden within, though his attempt to open that door in this chapter is apparently purely accidental. 

Meanwhile, Harry's first days at Hogwarts are somewhat stressful as he copes with a new environment, unwanted fame, and his discomfort over other students constantly staring at him. Overall, though, he is happy, and there is no other place he would rather be: hero-worship, unwelcome as it may be, is a form of acceptance, and is far better than what he receives at home. In addition to adjusting to his new magical life and struggling a bit with his studies, he also learns more about wizard society as he becomes acquainted with his classmates. His initial impression may have been that all wizards were pretty much alike, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], gave an early indication that at least some social differences exist. Harry quickly learns more about wizard backgrounds, and that some, like the Malfoys and the Weasleys, are pure blood, while others are half-bloods like Harry, whose father was a pure-blood Wizard while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]] was a Muggle-born witch like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], with no magical family. Seamus Finnigan is also considered a half-blood, with one magical parent (his mother), and the other (his father) a Muggle. Neville Longbottom is pure-blood, though his family feared he had no magical ability whatsoever until the ability appeared later in his childhood. Even among pure-blood families there are class differences, as seen by how the Malfoys consider the Weasleys inferior because they are poor and have different views regarding Muggles and Muggle-born wizards. At Hogwarts, all students are treated equally, regardless of what their individual backgrounds are, and they are supposed to be judged solely on talent and performance rather than their lineage and connections. There are, however, wizards, mostly Slytherins, that believe &quot;pure&quot; bloodlines are superior to mixed ones, and some, like the Malfoys, advocate that only the old, pure-blood wizard families should be allowed to attend Hogwarts and study magic. These prejudicial beliefs become an increasingly prominent theme throughout the series.

The exact date that Gringotts was broken into is also learned; the clipping on Hagrid's table states it occurred on 31 July, the same day Harry was in Diagon Alley. It is from this that Harry concludes that the thief was after Hagrid's &quot;grubby little parcel&quot;.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Snape's ongoing dislike for Harry is a main feature throughout the series. Harry's first-ever Potions class with Snape actually foreshadows events in the upcoming books. In his introduction, Snape says he can teach the students to, &quot;brew fame, bottle fortune, and even stopper death.&quot; (The US book has a slightly different wording; see below.) This scene's many connections, as described below, to later parts of the series, had led many fans to speculate, following the events in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|the sixth book's conclusion]], that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and Snape conspired to fake Dumbledore's death. In fact, the potion mentioned had been used in that book, though we do not discover that until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|late in the final book]]; Snape had prevented or delayed Dumbledore's death caused by his touching a cursed ring. The discussion of aconite or monkshood, and the associated Draught of Living Death, reappear in the sixth book, first when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] has Harry's class brew this potion, and possibly (in the US edition only) atop the Astronomy tower, when Dumbledore attempts to convince [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to switch sides, and tells him that can make Draco and all his family appear to be dead. (The reader should note that there is no immediate connection to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane Potion]] that appears in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''; that is a completed potion, and apparently a complex one, while the Wolfsbane mentioned here is a potion ingredient.) The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]] that Snape asks Harry to describe will play a small role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 22|the fourth book]], and a much larger one in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 18|the sixth book]]. 

In the book's British and Canadian versions, Snape's wording in the scene mentioned above, &quot;and even stopper death,&quot; is somewhat ambiguous; some readers have suggested that it means placing death in a bottle. This seems overly simplistic, as poisons are so common, both in the Muggle and Wizarding worlds, that they hardly merit mention. The more likely meaning is to prevent Death from acting, stoppering it inside a bottle. In the US / Scholastic version of the books, this phrase appears instead as &quot;and even put a stopper to death.&quot; As we learn later in the series, the US version of Snape's speech is better aligned with his actual meaning, though many editors feel that the original British wording is more elegant.

Harry and Ron constantly getting lost shows the castle's magical qualities and its overall enormity. Hogwarts harbors countless secrets, many that become important later in the series. Because the castle is so confusing, Harry, Ron, Neville, and Hermione will later end up in the third floor corridor; escaping Filch, they enter that corridor by accident, and will thereby learn something very important to the overall story.

Although Neville says his family believed he might have been a &quot;Muggle&quot;, a more accurate description would be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|&quot;Squib.&quot;]] Without specifically mentioning yet what exactly they are, the author appears to be dropping a hint regarding their existence in wizard society. It will be learned later that Squibs are born into wizard families, but through some genetic quirk, lack any magical ability. In addition to the pure-bloods, half-bloods, and Muggle-borns noted in the above &quot;Analysis&quot; section, Squibs are yet another, though tiny, division within that social order. They are polar opposite to Muggle-borns, born into a family that they are completely different from. Unlike Muggle-borns, who are identified early on and brought into wizard society, Squibs are often treated as outcasts, and encouraged to integrate themselves into Muggle society. Having been raised in a purely magical household, however, a Squib would likely find it difficult to adapt to Muggle society, and have the additional burden of hiding their wizard affiliations.

Readers also learn later that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]], Harry's odd [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] neighbor, and Mr. Filch, are both Squibs who function within the Wizarding world despite lacking magical powers. Neville's family employed extreme lengths to coax out any magical powers he might possess, most likely fearing the social stigma that having a Squib family member, particularly a pure-blood one, generates. As extreme (and downright silly and dangerous) as their attempts were to prove otherwise, it finally resulted in Neville showing that he is indeed a wizard, though it initially appears his magical ability is rather weak. However, this changes as the series progresses, mostly due to Harry's patient efforts.

Ironically, Neville's family may have created his problems, though their intentions were good. It will be learned that Neville's parents, who were [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors (Dark wizard catchers)]], were tortured into insanity by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Neville's relatives may have applied strong memory charms to alleviate Neville's painful recollections about this traumatic event. Unfortunately, these charms, applied too strongly or liberally, can damage a wizard's mental and magical abilities, perhaps permanently, particularly in one so young. Another character, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], later in the series, will suffer a similar affliction after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]] casts a powerful memory charm on her to erase some very damaging information, though he, unconcerned about inflicting lasting injury, probably used little restraint. Neville's and Bertha's similar conditions suggests there may be some similarity in their causes.

Considering the connections between Harry and Neville, revealed in the fifth book, it is interesting to note that they are polar opposites: while Harry's Muggle family tried to &quot;squash the magic out of him,&quot; the Longbottoms tried to force-feed Neville magic. We will find out that, according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]], it could have been either Neville or Harry who would end up facing Voldemort; it might be interesting to speculate, as Harry does later, what would have happened had Voldemort thought that Neville, being pure-blood wizard, was the infant the prophecy referred to. 

The social stigma associated with having a Squib relative is mentioned two other times. In speaking about his own family, while aboard the Hogwarts Express in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Ron says he has a relative who is an accountant, but his family rarely mentions her. And we will see, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Dumbledore's sister]] was hidden from the neighbours due to her mental affliction, the immediate, though incorrect, assumption by others was that she was a Squib.

===Connections===
One episode in this chapter is particularly heavily freighted with connections going forward in the series. Harry's first Potions lesson contains the following statements by Snape:
* &quot;... and even stopper death.&quot; This likely refers to the potion that Snape will use to preserve Professor Dumbledore's life when he runs afoul of the curse in the ring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] (revealed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]).
* &quot;... the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Draught of Living Death|Draught of Living Death]].&quot; Preparation of this potion appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], where it is used as a device to show the superiority of the marginal notes in the textbook Harry is using over the standard text. While the UK / Canadian version of the book does not include this passage, in the US / Scholastic edition, Dumbledore, bargaining with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|late in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], mentions that if Draco wants to hide from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], it is possible to make him and his entire family seem dead. While the technique is never mentioned, it is quite possible that it includes this potion.
* &quot;As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite...&quot; possibly foreshadows the arrival of Remus Lupin in the third book. 
* &quot;Where would you find a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|bezoar]]?&quot; A vital part of an antidote Harry is brewing in Potions class in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 22|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], it is noteworthy because Harry, agitated by the proximity of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], forgets it. A bezoar constitutes Harry's entire answer to an antidote quiz in Potions class [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], and reappears shortly after that where Harry uses it to save Ron's life.

Other connected events include:
* When Harry and Ron are caught by Filch trying to get into the forbidden third-floor corridor, it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], chancing to pass by, who extracts them from Filch's clutches. We will learn later in this book that Quirrell has been trying throughout the book to get to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Stone]] that was hidden under that passageway.
* We are here introduced to Snape's hatred of Harry, and of Gryffindor House to a smaller extent. The reasons are not explained until far later in the series, but this hatred will be a constant background throughout the series.
* The break-in at Gringotts, which we read about in the clipping on Hagrid's table, was also discussed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 6|a week earlier]], and we learn here that it occurred immediately after the vault in question was cleared. This leads us to believe that it was the vault that Hagrid had cleared [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|a month earlier]], when he and Harry visited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] and Gringotts. It is worth noting that Harry meets Professor Quirrell in the Leaky Cauldron on that occasion, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|we will later be led to believe]] that it was Quirrell who broke into Gringotts. It will be mentioned again as Harry plans to break into Gringotts himself, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 24|in the final book.]] It will be partly because of this earlier break in that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] will agree to help them.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

It is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|the school's]] second week of classes, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is dismayed that flying lessons are also shared with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin House]]. Because he has not yet learned to fly, Harry knows he will be ridiculed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who is as well-loved by Harry as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|cousin Dudley]].

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville's]] grandmother has sent him a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Remembrall|Remembrall]], a device to help him remember things. Draco attempts to steal it during breakfast, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall's]] arrival interrupts him. At the flying lesson, Neville falls off his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]], injuring himself. The instructor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]], takes him to the hospital wing, ordering everyone else to remain on the ground. Spotting Neville's dropped Remembrall, Draco grabs it and takes off on his broom to place it in a tree for Neville to fetch later. Harry flies after him, discovering that he has a natural talent for flying on a broomstick. Draco, to avoid a mid-air conflict, hurls the Remembrall away, but Harry dives and catches it mid-air, just inches above the ground. He is immediately accosted by Professor McGonagall, who has been watching from her office. She drags him away, apparently in disgrace, but to his surprise introduces him to the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team captain, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], saying Harry is the new Seeker.

Later, surprised that Harry has avoided being expelled, Draco challenges him to a Wizard's Duel in the trophy room at midnight. Harry accepts, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] volunteers to be his second. As Harry and Ron sneak out later that night, circumstance adds Neville and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to the party, though both Harry and Ron are unhappy that they are tagging along. Hermione, particularly, is unwelcome, as she keeps nagging Harry and Ron in an attempt to prevent the duel. Reaching the trophy room, they hear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] approaching. Evidently Draco never intended to show up, but instead informed Filch that students would be there after hours. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] sees the students sneaking away, and yells that students are out of bed. The students run off, diving into the forbidden third-floor corridor. They evade Filch, but find their hiding place is occupied by a huge, ferocious three-headed dog. They escape back to the common room, where Hermione mentions that the dog was atop a trap door, apparently guarding something. Harry concludes the dog must be guarding the same package [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] retrieved from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]].

== Analysis ==

This is among the happiest chapters, at least initially, in Harry's early school career. We saw how he felt displaced – apart from the natural dislocation he feels being in a new school and a strange new world, Harry copes with sudden celebrity, and the associated ongoing feeling that he is somewhat a fraud. This is compounded by his seeming inability to perform magic with the same natural fluidity that many of his peers demonstrate, such as Hermione, who seems to know anything that can be learned from a book, while Harry muddles along. Harry is also concerned that his years among Muggles, particularly ''those'' Muggles, may have crippled his magical abilities – most other students have had magical upbringings and come equipped with an understanding that he lacks. However, Harry seems to overlook that Hermione, and other students, also grew up in Muggle households, with no more magical background than he has; Hermione, who has a stable home life, may just be more confident, plus she is an avid book learner, giving her a greater initiative and confidence to use her abilities than Harry.

Imagine Harry's joy to discover that flying on a broomstick is something magical that he can do, not only naturally and well, but better than anyone else in the class. Compound this with the discovery that his father was also a talented flier, that he no longer has to attend flying classes with the Slytherins, that the school will be providing him with a top-quality broom for Quidditch matches&amp;mdash;by dinner time, Harry could likely fly from sheer joy, without a broom.

Harry is also showing a growing independence by his tendency to break rules, almost from his first day at Hogwarts, as demonstrated by his ignoring Madam Hooch's command at the flying lesson that all students remain on the ground during her brief absence. Harry also sneaks out after curfew to meet Draco for their duel. This rule-breaking attitude may partially stem from his disdain for the Dursleys, who have constantly abused their authority to torment and unfairly punish Harry when he does nothing wrong, while Dudley is continually spoiled, despite his abysmal, bullying behavior. And even though Harry's nature is showing a certain disregard for authority, it is never motivated by rebellion or to engage in mischief; he instead feels justified if he believes his actions serve some noble purpose, such as retrieving Neville's Remembrall or upholding his honor by dueling Draco. In this instance, Harry's breaking the rules and demonstrating his natural skill at flying is rewarded rather than punished. This may serve to reinforce his tendency to ignore restrictions which he feels are unjustifiable.

Ron's following Harry to the Trophy Room for the midnight duel is the first time we have seen Ron breaking rules. We expect that, given the relationship between Harry and Ron, any further rule breaking by Ron will be from following Harry's lead rather than by Ron's own initiative. In contrast, Hermione, to Harry and Ron's continued annoyance, is the boys' polar opposite, memorizing and obeying every school rule, though rarely considering the logic behind them. While Hermione does nag at the other two when she catches them breaking regulations, we have not yet seen her report them to anyone. We do not yet understand why Hermione seems to have attached herself to Harry and Ron, but it could be surmised that she is trying to protect Gryffindor's reputation against the two troublemakers in her year group who may possibly lose House points due to their activities.

The wizards' duel, which may appear somewhat arbitrary, is a natural progression and says much about Harry's, Ron's, and Draco's characters; Draco has been humiliated, and therefore must have his revenge. And for Draco, betraying Harry (and, peripherally, Ron) to Filch would be as satisfying as defeating him, if he could, in a duel. It also lessens the risk he will be further humiliated – what if Harry actually beat him in a duel? Getting Filch to do his dirty work increases the chance that Harry will suffer, while effectively shielding Draco from the consequences, if any. Draco's cowardice is also glimpsed here, and it later lands him in more trouble than he can imagine. Unlike Draco, Harry shows courage and integrity by honoring his agreement to meet Draco at the appointed time. Ron also shows bravery and loyalty by offering to act as Harry's second. Not even Hermione's bossy threats will stop either boy from going, and, after getting herself locked out of Gryffindor, she instead resigns herself to tagging along, ostensibly to monitor their actions, but likely intrigued as well. Hermione's obsession with rules, and her threats to report the two boys, seem more bluff than actual substance, showing that her peers' opinions about her overrule her need to obey authority. Throughout the series, Hermione, though disapproving, will rarely interfere with the boys' activities, and her curiosity often compels her to trail along, and, eventually, join in. Regardless, neither Harry or Ron want her there, though her presence proves beneficial.

This scene also provides further evidence that there is a mystery for Harry to investigate. Harry already suspects that the grubby little package Hagrid brought back to Hogwarts is tied to the break-in at Gringotts. The students' midnight foray may have led them in the right direction to find it, if they come to believe that its necessary. Once again, Harry's rule breaking pays off when Hermione's keen observation notices the trap door in the third-floor corridor that the fierce, three-headed dog is apparently guarding.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The trap door under the three-headed dog is one among Hogwarts' many secrets foreshadowed in the previous chapter. The guarded hatch poses a huge question that needs to be answered: &quot;What is under the trap door?&quot; If the dog is guarding Hagrid's parcel, then one must question what else might lie beneath the the castle's floors. Hogwarts holds many secrets for Harry to discover in this and also later books. Like the castle's shifting staircases, Harry must navigate a dangerous and ever-changing path before finding the answers.

The reader should remember that, at this point, Harry has no need to worry about what is in the parcel, or how it is guarded. The fact that it is likely under the trap door that the dog is guarding is an interesting bit of information, but of no use to Harry. However, over the course of this year, Harry's curiosity will drive him to try and find out exactly what was in the parcel, and he will determine that it is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] of the book title. At the same time, Harry will gradually become aware that others are seeking the Stone, either for their own benefit or in the hopes of re-animating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], and will attempt to warn the authorities of his worries. The authorities, notably Professor McGonagall, will disregard his warnings, and Harry will conclude that he alone can save the Stone. It is arguable whether he has reached the correct conclusion; however, in the end he will act and will successfully keep the Stone safe.

Although Harry's fears that his difficult Muggle upbringing has permanently damaged his magical abilities are generally groundless, this belief is not entirely invalid. Whatever their backgrounds, pure-blood, half-blood, or Muggle-born, young witches and wizards do have varying talents and levels of proficiencies, and these can be affected by their respective histories. Neville Longbottom, a pure-bred from a powerful wizard family, is particularly weak in magic. But rather than lacking talent or ability, he has been emotionally (and possibly physically) crippled by events in his life that are at least as traumatic as Harry's; this similarity of background becomes a factor that bonds the two boys. Harry is probably experiencing some early difficulties for similar reasons, as well as being insecure and new to magic, though he quickly overcomes these obstacles and catches up to his classmates; Neville, who may have been impaired by his well-meaning family's memory charms to alleviate trauma over his parents' tragic fates, will take longer to progress, though he does eventually develop into a competent wizard.

Hermione retreats from her threat to report Harry and Ron, and she will continue to overlook their constant rule-breaking in future books, even after she is appointed as a Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]]. The only time she actually reports their activities to a teacher is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 11|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]. In that instance, she reports Harry to Professor McGonagall, not for any rule breaking, but because she was legitimately concerned for Harry's safety. Both Harry and Ron react angrily, however, shunning her for months, deeply hurting Hermione, and nearly ending their friendship permanently.

=== Connections ===

* This is the first time we hear of a &quot;Wizard's Duel.&quot; The concept of a Duel is reintroduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|the second book]], and plays important roles in the battles in future books, particularly Harry's and Voldemort's interactions in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|the fourth]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|seventh books]], especially with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem phenomenon]] appearing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']].
* Draco chooses Crabbe as his second. This suggests that he believes Crabbe to be the more powerful wizard, and so albeit by a tenuous chain of circumstance, may foreshadow the fact that Crabbe will die in the last book, and the way he dies.
* This is also the first time we see the Trophy Room. At this time, the location of the duel may seem unimportant, but the location serves as a puzzle piece Harry uses to solve the mystery he pursues in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']].</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

The next morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] receives a long, thin package in the morning post. The attached note warns him against opening it at the table, that it is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]], and is signed &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor M. McGonagall]].&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]], already dismayed that Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] apparently escaped his plan to have them expelled, arranges to find out what is in the package. Discovering it is a broomstick, he informs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], but is further dismayed that not only does the staff know the rule prohibiting first-years to have broomsticks has been waived for Harry, but that they have given their approval.

That evening, Harry heads to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch pitch]] to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]]. Oliver explains the game's rules and does some basic practice with Harry. After this, Oliver has the team practicing three evenings a week.

On Hallowe'en, Professor Flitwick decides the class is ready to practice the floating spell ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]]) that they have been learning. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] annoys Ron by correcting how he enunciates the incantation; then, challenged by Ron to demonstrate it, is the first to successfully levitate her feather. Ron later tells Harry that Hermione is unbearable, which is why she has no friends. Hermione, overhearing this, runs crying into the girls' bathroom.

During the Hallowe'en feast, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] bursts into the Great Hall, hysterically shouting that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|Mountain Troll]] is loose in the dungeons. As students are shepherded back to their common rooms, Harry and Ron remember that Hermione is still in the bathroom, and dart off to warn her about the Troll. On the way, they see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] apparently heading to the forbidden third floor corridor. Harry and Ron, seeing the troll approaching, lock it into a room, only to discover they have locked it in the girl's bathroom with Hermione. They dash in to rescue Hermione, and the Troll attacks the Trio. Frightened, Ron yells out the first spell that comes to his head, Wingardium Leviosa. The Troll's club floats into the air, then crashes down on its head, rendering the creature unconscious. Upon the teachers' arrival, Hermione lies to Professor McGonagall to protect Harry and Ron, saying it was her idea to try to defeat the Troll, and that Harry and Ron arrived just in time to save her. Professor McGonagall reprimands Hermione and deducts five points from Gryffindor, but awards Harry and Ron five points apiece for defeating the Troll. From here on, Hermione is Harry's and Ron's friend.

== Analysis ==

Harry receives great joy from his flying ability. That he has received a world-class racing broom, which we see him put so lightly through its paces, is very heartening for him. Flying and Quidditch are quickly becoming his centering point; he can retreat to the air or the pitch when things become too confusing or stressful to bear.

Hermione's personality begins to change in this chapter, and we see her transforming into a more sympathetic character whereas, previously, she was an annoying, two-dimensional goody-two-shoes grind who seemed on target to become yet another Harry nemesis. Another character could have allowed Harry and Ron to be punished when they were actually trying to help, but Hermione immediately steps in to protect them by assuming the blame, lying to Professor McGonagall. Slowly, she is learning that sometimes rules must be broken in order to make things right; we can see there is hope for her. Harry and Ron are so surprised by Hermione's generous act that they immediately lose their past animosity for her. This is also the first time the three work together and successfully combine their skills, indicating how powerful and vital this friendship will become in the greater story. The &quot;Trio&quot; has been born.

Once again, Harry has broken the rules, believing it is justified&amp;mdash;to save Hermione. However, even though he and Ron only wanted to warn Hermione, their good intentions overruled their logic and judgment when, rather than inform a teacher or a prefect that a student is in danger, they instead take it upon themselves to alert Hermione about the Troll. The situation turns far more serious than they anticipated when, running headlong into the creature, they are forced to subdue it; Ron, despite his lagging confidence in his own abilities, shows budding magical talent and quick thinking here when he conjures the charm (and remembers how to pronounce it correctly) to disarm and disable the Troll.

McGonagall once again rewards Harry (and Ron) for his actions, which may reinforce his future decisions to disregard rules. To readers, with the full picture in front of them, McGonagall punishing Hermione, who is quite plainly the innocent party, seems unfair; but we must recall that the only information McGonagall has is what Hermione has told her, that she had deliberately tried to take on the troll by herself.

Harry, meanwhile, is even more suspicious about Snape after glimpsing him sneaking away, and suspects that he set the Troll loose, probably as a diversion so he could enter the forbidden corridor. That Snape is later seen limping could be evidence that the three-headed dog blocked him from entering the corridor. Considering the many magical charms and spells in place to secure Hogwarts castle, it is indeed questionable as to just how a Troll could have penetrated those protective barriers, making it seem unlikely that it merely wandered in. The Troll not only reinforces the notion that the Wizard world is a dangerous place and is filled with fearsome creatures, but that Hogwarts itself is vulnerable; this may foreshadow more sinister threats invading the castle later in the series.

According to JK Rowling: &quot;When we were editing 'Philosopher's Stone' my editor wanted me to cut the scene in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione fight the troll. Although I had accepted most of the smaller cuts he wanted me to make I argued hard for this one. Hermione, bless her, is so very annoying in the early part of 'Philosopher's Stone' that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron.&quot; [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=8 Reference]

Harry becomes quite attached to his Nimbus broom, as it is among the first wizard-related objects he ever owns, and flying is not only what he is becoming best at, but it also gives him immense joy. A devastating moment [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 9|in the third book]] is when his broom is destroyed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]. Throughout the series, he will be periodically deprived of flight, causing him distress. We will see, in future chapters, that Harry places reliance on one magical artifact or another, rather than believing in his own strength as a wizard. In this and the next book, Harry will apparently come to believe that all his flying skill can be attributed to the broom, and destruction of the broom will leave him apparently thinking that he may never fly again. After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Harry will similarly begin to believe that all his strength against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] depends on his wand.

Hermione suddenly becomes more sympathetic and likable when, grateful that Harry and Ron saved her life, she lies solely to protect them, accepting the punishment on their behalf. This is a key hint showing how her caring and thoughtfulness becomes essential to the Trio's success across later years. The bond between the Trio, first formed here, is arguably the most important relationship in the entire story. 

Although Harry suspects Snape set the Troll loose into the castle, it was actually Professor Quirrell, who wanted to sneak into the forbidden corridor and steal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] that can restore Voldemort's body. It will be learned that Quirrell provided a Troll as one of the dungeon security devices that protects the Stone. Quirrell later tells Harry that he has a particular talent with Trolls. Given Quirrell's known facility with these creatures, his panicked reaction at the feast must have seemed suspicious and out-of-character to Snape, who suspected Quirrell was creating a diversion so he could enter the third-floor corridor. Snape attempted to head him off, getting his leg bitten by &quot;Fluffy,&quot; the three-headed dog, in the process. One must also assume that Dumbledore's suspicions were raised by this, as Dumbledore certainly knows Quirrell provided a Troll to defend the Stone. This perhaps explains why, in Snape's memories [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|seven years later]], we see Dumbledore suggesting that Snape keep an eye on Quirrell. We do not know if this memory was made before or after this chapter's events.

As formidable as Hogwarts always seems, the Troll in the castle is only the first time that we see the school's security being breached. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], Harry's fugitive godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], slips into the castle at night, apparently through a hidden passageway, and ostensibly to attack Harry, but actually for another reason. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], aided by Draco Malfoy, are also able to secretly enter the castle through a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]] connected to its twin in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]], a shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]], resulting in a major battle between the invaders and the Hogwarts staff, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] there are two ways seen into the castle or its grounds. In addition to the tunnel to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]] which is first seen in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', a new secret passageway is formed leading to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|establishment]] from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], where the revived Dumbledore's Army has been hiding out. This is how the Trio, and later, Harry's allies, enter the castle shortly before the final battle with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. The One-Eyed Witch tunnel that Harry uses in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' to sneak into Hogsmeade, will, by book 7, have been discovered and closed off. Also, Voldemort and his Death Eater army assault Hogwarts near the book's end. Though the faculty temporarily fend them off, the protective charms surrounding the castle are eventually broken by the enemy.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] season starts in November, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is lucky to have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] as his friend&amp;mdash;the extra practices are cutting into his homework time, and only Hermione's help gets him through it. Also, she has become a bit more relaxed about rules, so when she, Harry, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] are out in the courtyard one day, she bends the rules to create a small wizard fire to keep them warm. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], seeing them there, confiscates the book Harry was reading, ''Quidditch Through the Ages'', on a flimsy pretext that library books cannot be taken outside. 

That evening, Harry decides to ask Snape to return the book. Hoping to catch him with other teachers so as to defuse his anger, he peers inside the staff room. There he sees Snape with a bad leg wound, being tended by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], and talking about something with three heads that apparently injured him. Snape notices Harry and, enraged, orders him out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione jointly concur that his injury was caused by the three-headed dog in the forbidden third-floor corridor, but only Hermione doubts that Snape would attempt to steal anything. Both Harry and Ron are convinced he would.

The following morning is Harry's first Quidditch match, which is against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]]. The match proceeds well, until Harry's broom starts acting strangely, apparently trying to buck him off. Hermione notices that Professor Snape is staring fixedly at Harry and muttering, and concludes he is jinxing it. To stop it, she runs across the stands, knocking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] over in the process, and sets Snape's robes on fire, thus breaking his concentration. Slytherin scores five times while everyone is distracted by Harry and his cursed broom. Regaining control, Harry dives for the pitch, in the process running into and nearly swallowing the Snitch, and winning the match.

After the match, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discuss recent events with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in his hut. Hagrid voices disbelief that Snape would jinx Harry's broom. Harry mentions that Snape had apparently run afoul of the three-headed dog, which Hagrid accidentally identifies as &quot;Fluffy&quot;. Hagrid later mentions that whatever he is guarding, &quot;that's between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] an' Nicolas Flamel —&quot;, thus accidentally providing another clue to what the object being guarded is.

== Analysis ==

As with any school, sport plays an integral part in student life. At Hogwarts, that sport is Quidditch, and it serves as both a unifying force and a divisive element. Students are bound by their enthusiasm for the game, but their Houses also compete against one another to win the Quidditch Cup, as well as the House Cup. Though these rivalries are generally amicable, Slytherin and Gryffindor have always been particularly competitive, and occasionally openly antagonistic. Slytherin's Quidditch captain, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]], actually uses the incident with Harry's broom as a means to score more points for his team, showing just how devious and exploitative Slytherins truly are. The rivalry between these two Houses is so pronounced that it is likely to be central to the series somehow.

Meanwhile, Hermione's newly-formed friendship with Harry and Ron continues to develop and strengthen, and her intelligence and generosity are already proving useful. Initially it is the small (comparative to what comes later) matter of helping Harry with his homework when he becomes overwhelmed with the extra Quidditch practices, but she moves swiftly and decisively to protect Harry when she sees that his broom has been tampered with during the game, putting his life in danger. Her quick-thinking and fast actions become even more important to the Trio later in the series.

The jinxed broom seen during the game indicates that someone has malicious intentions against Harry, and it certainly seems obvious, at least to Harry and Ron, that this person is Snape. Even Hermione has abandoned her naive view that teachers can do no wrong and agrees that it must be Snape who seeks the Stone. Hagrid adamantly disagrees with the Trio that Snape, or any Hogwarts professor, could be involved in a plot against the school or its students. Hagrid's blind faith in Hogwarts and its teachers is noble, but it is simplistic, and almost child-like, though it should be remembered that Hagrid is privy to school information that we and the Trio are not. We, however, have seen that Snape appears to have a particular interest in the forbidden third-floor corridor, the trap door, and perhaps what lies beneath it.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The rivalry between Slytherin and Gryffindor becomes a metaphor for themes of good vs. evil in the series and the battle that is to come, as Wizards either align themselves with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] or choose to fight him and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. While Gryffindor represents Voldemort's opponents and Slytherin his followers (perhaps including Snape), both Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff Houses symbolize how many in the Wizarding world become complacent or ignorant to the evil that gradually and insidiously creeps in and takes hold as they go about their usual business, barely noticing, and finally adapting themselves to whatever the resulting outcome is. Divisions will also be formed within Harry's own House, Gryffindor, later in the series, as Harry's claim that the Dark Lord has returned is endlessly disputed, and his fellow House-mates take sides either for or against him.

The name Nicolas Flamel may trigger some interest among those who recognize it. Mentioned in a number of places, including ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' by Victor Hugo, Flamel was a 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century alchemist who is supposed to have found or created the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. Streets in Paris are named after him and his wife, and the house he lived in is now something of a tourist attraction. Despite much excavation of the house after his death, no trace of the Philosopher's Stone or any of the gold supposedly made with it was ever found.

As can be seen here, if the Trio has a weakness, it is a tendency to become stubbornly fixated on a single-minded thought; their determined belief that Snape has malevolent intentions could have had nasty consequences at the Quidditch match had luck not favoured them. Hagrid is their opposite in this, adamantly believing that a Hogwarts teacher could never be involved in anything evil, particularly if it involves a student or the school. The truth lies somewhere in-between, and several teachers throughout the series will be involved in sinister plots.

In what has been hailed as one of the better displays in this series' interconnectedness, Harry catching the Snitch in his mouth will become an important plot point in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|the seventh book]].

There is one timing issue in this chapter, which perhaps adds to the mounting suspicion on Snape (as opposed to Quirrell). As Hermione is rushing along the teacher's row to reach Professor Snape, she knocks Professor Quirrell over; but then &quot;It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.&quot; Thirty seconds is a long time when attempting to counter a jinx or doing something requiring intense concentration; so for thirty seconds, Snape is trying to halt a jinx that has already been interrupted, because Quirrell was knocked over and was no longer conjuring it. It is possible that the author may have been employing hyperbole here, and actually meant something closer to five seconds, which would be more reasonable all around. This was resolved in the film version by having Snape notice that he was on fire after approximately two seconds.

=== Connections ===

* Harry's catching the Snitch in his mouth in his first ever Quidditch game will be connected to the final volume of the series.
**On his death, Dumbledore bequeaths this Snitch to Harry to transfer something to Harry without the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] knowing about it; Dumbledore likely guesses that the Ministry will examine all his bequests. Knowing that the Snitch is charmed with &quot;flesh memory&quot; to identify the Seeker that caught it, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour]], watches when Harry holds the Snitch to see if Dumbledore has used that to pass something to Harry, circumventing the Ministry. The Snitch does not react to Harry's hand, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|after the Minister for Magic has left]], when Harry presses it to his mouth, the Snitch reveals a message.
**When Harry sets forth to meet his doom, he again puts the Snitch to his lips and says, &quot;I am about to die.&quot; It opens to reveal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]] that provides Harry the means to summon the support he needs to complete his task.
* Hermione's possibly-unique ability to conjure fire, seen twice in this chapter, will be used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|later in this book]]. With the possible exception of Hagrid [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|earlier]], we do not see any other witch or wizard doing this.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

Now that they have the name &quot;Nicolas Flamel&quot;, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] spend all their spare time in the library, trying to learn who he is. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is annoyed when he hears about their pastime. Despite searching for a fortnight, however, they have found nothing by Christmas break, when Hermione leaves for the holidays. Ron and his brothers are staying at Hogwarts because their parents are visiting their older son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], in Romania. Harry is staying because Hogwarts is more home to him than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] ever could be. 

On Christmas Day, both Harry and Ron receive gifts. Harry's wholly unexpected gifts include a hand-carved flute from Hagrid, a single 50 pence piece from the Dursleys, a box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione, a sweater and some home-made fudge from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], and an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] from an anonymous sender. The note with the cloak says that it belonged to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]], and advises him to &quot;use it well.&quot;

The Christmas feast is very merry, including various magical accessories and truly amazing amounts of delicious food. Following dinner, Harry remembers the Invisibility Cloak, and, obedient to Hermione's parting adjuration to keep searching, decides to explore the library's Restricted section for Flamel. The first book he selects, however, screams when opened, causing Harry to break his lamp, and alerting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]. On the run from Filch and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], he enters a room containing a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|mirror]]. His reflection shows him amidst a crowd of people that he realizes are his parents and relations – not the Dursleys, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]], his father, and a crowd of people that seem to be his other magical relatives.

Excited, Harry shows Ron the mirror, so he can see Harry's parents. Instead, Ron sees only himself wearing a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy's badge]], and holding the Quidditch Cup. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]] apparently can sense them under the Cloak, which keeps Ron from visiting again, but over the next few days Harry keeps returning to the mirror until he is surprised by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. Dumbledore identifies the mirror as the Mirror of Erised, and explains that it shows &quot;only the deepest desire of our hearts&quot;. When asked what he sees when he looks into it, Dumbledore claims that he sees himself holding a pair of socks, which Harry suspects is untrue. Dumbledore says he is going to hide the mirror, and asks that Harry not seek it out again.

== Analysis ==

Family has recently become important to Harry: being raised by the Dursleys, who barely mask their contempt for him, Harry barely understands how loving families interact. Recently, though, exposure to Ron and the Weasley family has given Harry some idea how these relationships work, and what having people care about him is like. He is truly touched when Mrs. Weasley, knowing he would receive few, if any, gifts, sends him Christmas presents.

Once again, Harry feels justified to ignore the rules, sneaking into the library's restricted section under his Invisibility Cloak to search for information about Nicolas Flamel. Finding none and interrupted by Filch, he is inadvertently detoured into a room containing a magical mirror. Rather than uncovering information about Flamel, Harry has instead discovered much more about himself. He is amazed and puzzled by the images reflected in the Mirror of Erised, seeing for the first time what his parents and other relatives were like in life. Having lost James and Lily when he was still an infant, he has no recollections about them. 

Transfixed by his parents' images, Harry continually returns to gaze at the mirror until Dumbledore finally intervenes. The kind Headmaster explains that rather than showing what someone's outer self looks like, the mirror actually reflects what lies buried within, their deepest desires. Erised is &quot;desire&quot; spelled backwards (thus mimicking the properties of a mirror). What Harry desires is a loving family life, his lost mother and father restored to him. Although this loss has created a huge void in his life, it is blank, containing no memories or images to draw upon. Now Harry can begin to fill that void somewhat as he learns more about his family and starts exploring his feelings and his place in the world. While dwelling on his loss does cause him pain and grief, it also creates love and yearning, showing that Harry's emotional self is multi-faceted; his emotions alone never completely rule or control Harry, nor is his tragedy used as a reason to vent anger and hate at others. Budding logic and intellect help temper his feelings, though, at this age, he is still driven by his impulses. Dumbledore's timely intervention prevents Harry from endlessly dwelling on hopeless dreams and lost opportunities rather than actively living his life.

Already having the family that Harry lacks, Ron's desires are obviously quite different. Feeling unremarkable and always overshadowed by his talented older brothers, when Ron peers into the Mirror, he sees only himself, as Quidditch captain and Head Boy, standing completely on his own accomplishments. Unlike Harry, however, he does not feel compelled to continually return and stare at the Mirror's reflection, partially fearing being caught, but also resigned to knowing what it is he wants while believing he can never attain it.

Harry and Dumbledore's relationship is also established here, as until now there has been little significant interaction between them since Dumbledore left baby Harry on the Dursleys' door step ten years earlier. Not only has Dumbledore remained distant in the story, but he has been portrayed as being rather enigmatic and eccentric. Harry even considers that he might be a touch mad. Dumbledore is truly an enigma, and even by wizard standards he seems odd. It is doubtful that he has ever had much direct interaction with students, being a lofty and somewhat aloof authoritarian figure, and it has been unclear yet just what his role will be in the book. He is, however, a kind, gentle, and humorous man, and rather than reprimand Harry, Dumbledore steps beyond his Headmaster role to gently guide the young boy with helpful, almost fatherly, advice, understanding that Harry's needs are unique among the students. Their relationship will likely continue to grow beyond student and teacher from here on.

Of note, the mirror's entire inscription reads, &quot;Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi&quot;. When those words are read backwards, the inscription is: &quot;I show not your face but your heart's desire&quot;. We can safely expect that the Mirror of Erised will play a role elsewhere in the book, though exactly what that role will be, and how the Mirror's peculiar function will be important, it is too early to tell.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry's desire to have an ordinary, peaceful life surrounded by family is something that follows him throughout the series and helps drive many of his actions. Although he can never be reunited with his parents, he does eventually acquire the loving family he so deeply craves. Ron also sees his heart's desire, to become Hogwarts' Head Boy and Gryffindor's Quidditch team captain, winning the Quidditch Cup. While Ron never becomes either Head Boy or Quidditch captain, he is later appointed as a Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]], and wins a spot on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper, his playing skills instrumental in Gryffindor's winning the Quidditch Cup. While the mirror shows that what we desire may be more than can ever be achieved, it is always possible to attain much that makes for a successful and satisfying life. 

After asking what Dumbledore sees in the mirror, Harry thinks he has just asked a very impertinent question; much later in the series, Harry concludes that Dumbledore's answer was not entirely truthful. It is revealed much later, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that Dumbledore's desire is the same as Harry's – to be reunited with his departed family, especially his mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] and sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]].

Dumbledore has rarely had close relationships with Hogwarts students. Though Harry will become an exception, there is another student, also an orphan and a talented wizard, that Dumbledore also paid closer attention to, though not in the same way as with Harry. That student's name was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], and he eventually adopted the name [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

It is unknown who returned the Invisibility Cloak to Harry until the book's end, when it is revealed it was Dumbledore. However, that raises a large question. When Harry is caught at the Mirror of Erised, Dumbledore mentions that he does not need a cloak to be invisible. Invisibility can be created by a spell, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disillusionment|Disillusionment charm]], that Dumbledore probably excels at. Also, the note to Harry reads that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] &quot;left&quot; the Cloak in Dumbledore's possession shortly before he died. However, it is learned later that Dumbledore actually asked James if he could borrow it. Why, then, would Dumbledore have wanted James Potter's Invisibility Cloak? It would seem that he has no need for it, after all.

This last point is particularly interesting, as the author mentions that it is a [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=23 peculiarly never-asked question]. It is a key plot point in the series' final book, as the Cloak is one of the titular [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. It should be noted that the author employs a technique to conceal that this is even a question. The Invisibility Cloak's previous ownership is separated in the text from Dumbledore's statement that he does not need one, by several exciting events, even though they happen in the same chapter; the admission that it was Dumbledore who had been keeping the Cloak for the intervening decade is several chapters ahead. Separating the three parts of the paradox removes the immediacy that makes it a question the reader thinks about.

Dumbledore's interest in this Cloak will be echoed again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 10|the seventh book]]. Harry will be reminded of it when he reads Lily's letter to Sirius, in which Lily mentions Dumbledore having borrowed James' Invisibility Cloak. Harry, now knowing how the Disillusionment charm functions, only then wonders why Dumbledore would have been interested in it. While we have, by this time, seen the Disillusionment Charm at work, we similarly have not wondered about this point, because of the author's skill at concealing the question.

On a side note, Harry's gift from Hagrid will also be of use later in this book: we will learn that Fluffy, the fierce three-headed dog guarding the trap door mentioned earlier, will fall right asleep if he hears a little music. It will seem that the flute, or possibly a recorder or something like one, will be the only musical instrument any of the Trio have access to.

=== Connections ===
* The Invisibility Cloak, introduced in this chapter, will play a large part in the rest of the series. As mentioned, it will turn out to be one of the three Deathly Hallows in the seventh and final book. It is noteworthy that Dumbledore here mentions that he does not need a cloak to become invisible; combined with the revelations later that he had borrowed the cloak from Harry's father, it is clear that the author had intended the Cloak to be something significantly out of the ordinary by this point in the first book.
* We see here Harry's longing for information about his family. While this is not so much a connection as illumination of Harry's character, it warrants mention because it will be a major concern for Harry through the rest of the series.
* Harry's speculation in the final paragraph of the chapter, that Dumbledore might not have been telling the truth about what he sees in the Mirror of Erised, will be revisited in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|the final book in the series.]] Harry will then guess that Dumbledore's &quot;heart's desire&quot;, what he sees in the mirror, is the same as what Harry sees: his own family, reunited.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] practice is picking up again as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the team prepare for an upcoming match against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hufflepuff House|Hufflepuff]]. Harry is horrified to learn that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] will be refereeing this match, as are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] when he tells them.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], his legs jinxed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to stick together, tumbles into the Gryffindor Common Room through the portrait hole. Hermione frees his legs, and Harry encourages Neville to stand up to Draco, then gives him a chocolate frog. Neville hands back the card inside the package, and Harry sees that it is an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] card. Harry suddenly recalls that it was on that card that he saw Nicolas Flamel's name: ''Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for defeating the dark wizard, Grindelwald, in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.'' Mentioning Alchemy reminds Hermione that the library book she checked out says Flamel is now 665 years old. Further discussion leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione to conclude that the mysterious package Hagrid brought to the school is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. Eternal life and all the gold you could want. No wonder Snape wants it, they think...

Harry decides to play Quidditch even with Snape refereeing. During the game, a fight breaks out in the stands between some Gryffindors (notably Ron and Neville) and Slytherins (led by Draco Malfoy). The match lasts only about five minutes, as Harry spots and catches the Snitch before Snape can do more than award one penalty to Hufflepuff.

After the match, Harry sees Snape enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Using his broom, he is able to hover close enough to eavesdrop on Snape and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]. Their conversation confirms Harry, Ron, and Hermione's belief that the mysterious package is the Philosopher's Stone, and leads them to conclude that Quirrell is the only thing standing between Snape and the Stone.

== Analysis ==

This chapter largely serves as reinforcement. 
* Harry gives Neville the Chocolate Frog because Neville was jinxed by Draco Malfoy. This again demonstrates Draco's disdain for rules and for Gryffindors. It also shows Neville's relative magical incompetence and his emotional insecurities. Harry has to encourage him to stand up for himself.
* Snape's refereeing the match further displays his dislike for Gryffindor House in general, and Harry in particular. As seen by how swiftly Harry ends the match, Harry is quickly learning that the best strategy is to just avoid Snape as much as possible.
* The revelation of who Flamel is, and what he is known for, introduces the uniquely valuable titular artifact, and solidifies Harry's belief that there is an object that needs that sort of heavy guard.
* Harry's overhearing the conversation between Snape and Quirrell supports Harry's belief, and thus also Ron's and Hermione's, that Snape is plotting to steal the Philosopher's Stone, and that poor, weak Quirrell is trying to stop him.

The only major plot advance is that we learn the Philosopher's Stone is not only being guarded, but also sought. A clue is given to its usefulness by us being told how old Flamel is. Clearly, part of the Stone's function has something to do with prolonging life. Hermione's description of the Stone's function explains why Flamel has managed to live for so long, and makes it more likely that the Stone is, in fact, what [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] brought to Hogwarts and what is being so carefully guarded, though it is still unclear at to just why, after so much time, this object suddenly needed to be so securely guarded.

It should be mentioned that there was a real Nicolas Flamel who lived at about the time suggested. [[w:Nicolas Flamel|Nicolas Flamel]] was born probably in the early 1330's, about 660 years before the time of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' (1991-92). He and his wife Perenelle have made many other appearances in popular culture, notably in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' by Victor Hugo.

Harry notices that he seems to be running into Snape far more frequently than usual. He wonders if Snape knows that he, Ron, and Hermione have learned about the Philosopher's Stone, and he has the horrible feeling that Snape can read minds. Harry has felt this to a greater or lesser degree before, but this is the first time he has expressed that thought this clearly, even to himself. This will be a recurring concern for Harry, and will come to full fruition in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 24|the fifth book in the series]], where we are told about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|legilimency]].

Readers revisiting the series might wonder why Snape does not use his mind-reading ability on Quirrell. We can only speculate that there might be a code of ethics around Legilimency that discourages use of the ability on other wizards. It is also possible that in self-protection, Voldemort has strengthened Quirrell's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|ability to avoid legilimency]]. If there is discouragement of use of legilimency on other wizards, why does Snape still use it on Harry? Snape, as one of Harry's teachers, and given Harry's physical immaturity, may feel that as he is acting more or less ''in loco parentis'', he has the right to inspect Harry's mind on occasion. It is also possible that Snape's hatred of Harry leads him to overstep the bounds of propriety.

Once again, Harry's single-minded and biased view of Snape's character twists his perspective on events he witnesses, so that he can only see one possible interpretation. In this particular case, what Harry overhears in the Forbidden Forest is that Snape and Quirrell are at odds. Harry has already decided that it is Snape who seeks the Stone, and allows this conversation to support his conclusion. In fact, as we will find out, Snape is attempting to prevent Quirrell from seeking the Stone. This persistent prejudice towards Snape will come back to haunt Harry as the larger story reaches its climax.

We do not yet have any idea that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is still around, apart from Hagrid's earlier comment that he thinks Voldemort was &quot;too evil to die&quot;. We will, however, receive a large hint in that direction shortly, when a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] tells Harry about the uses of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorn]] blood.

=== Connections ===
* In this chapter, we have the first indication that Harry believes Snape can read his mind. We will see that Harry suspects this again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], and it will be made explicit in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where it will be revealed that Snape is a master legilimens. Snape will use legilimency openly on Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], and may be attempting it at one point in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 30|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] seems stronger than the Trio had expected, as Fluffy remains alert and growling behind the door.

With only ten weeks left until final exams, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] starts laying out timetables for studying, and insisting that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] do likewise. So they are studying in the library when they see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] removing a book from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]] section. Asked directly about Nicolas Flamel and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], he promises to tell them something about it, but not in the library; students are not supposed to know about it.

At Hagrid's hut, they learn that the Stone is protected by Fluffy, as well as enchantments created by Professors [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Sprout]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], Quirrell, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], and... [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. This is alarming as, of course, it is  Snape who wants the Stone. Adding to the confusion, Hagrid has won a Dragon's egg from someone at a pub in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade village]], and he intends to hatch it, even though it is illegal to own one, and despite living in a wooden hut—a decidedly unsafe place to rear a fire-breathing creature.

In due course, the egg begins to hatch, and Hagrid invites Harry, Ron and Hermione down to witness it. A baby Dragon emerges that Hagrid names Norbert. Unfortunately, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who is spying on them through Hagrid's window, also sees it. Now they must somehow conceal the hatchling before Malfoy tells Professor Dumbledore. Harry suddenly has an idea: Ron's brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]] works with Dragons in Romania. Maybe he can find Norbert a home. Though Hagrid is unhappy to lose Norbert, he finally agrees to the plan, as does Charlie, who arranges for his friends to pick up Norbert.

Ron suffers a dragon bite while helping Hagrid with Norbert, and ends up in the Hospital Wing. Draco Malfoy, visiting to bait Ron under the guise of comforting him, borrows a book, which Ron later remembers contains Charlie's response. Draco is waiting when Harry and Hermione carry the crated Norbert to atop the Astronomy Tower where Charlie's friends are waiting to collect him. Hidden beneath the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], Harry and Hermione observe Professor McGonagall catch Draco, who is penalized twenty House points and given detention. Harry and Hermione, still safe beneath the Cloak, arrive at the tower and send Norbert off. As they head back to the dormitory, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] catches them - in their excitement, they left the Cloak behind in the tower.

== Analysis ==

At first glance, this chapter seems to have little purpose in the book – Norbert is introduced and sent away all in one chapter and never re-appears in the series, except occasionally Hagrid gets to missing him, and there is a mention in passing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|the seventh book]]. It does serve to introduce us to dragons, however, and provide a little information about them. While Norbert is never seen again, other dragons will appear in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' and ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.'' And though Norbert may seem (to Hagrid) a cute, cuddly hatchling, the fully-grown, flame-spewing dragons seen in the later books are fierce and deadly creatures. 

Generally, this chapter's purpose is largely preparatory. Firstly, it partially emphasizes that protecting the Philosopher's Stone has become more urgent. The Trio quite firmly believes, and with reason, that it is Professor Snape who seeks it. Knowing that Snape was involved with installing the guardian spells for it, they are certain that he must know enough about those spells to make his way through them.

Another purpose is setting up the scene in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], in the next chapter. Without detention, there would be no reason for Harry to have to go into the Forest, and no way for him to witness the events that occur there.

Thirdly, it sets up the final scene in the book. As we have not reached that yet, it will not be discussed here, except to say that a victory is sweeter if it follows, and reverses, a defeat.

Finally, this chapter shines a light on Draco Malfoy and also Hagrid. Draco discovered an advantage that he holds over Hagrid and the Trio, knowing Hagrid is engaged in something illegal and aided by the Trio. Rather than report this to the authorities, he instead remains silent, using this information to torment Ron in the hospital wing, and exploiting the situation to gain an additional advantage. This is classic Slytherin deviousness and ambition, though in this instance, Malfoy's actions later backfire on him and he also receives detention.

Hagrid, meanwhile, is emerging as a pivotal character who is increasingly important to Harry and the story. Hagrid is the one person among Hogwarts' teachers and staff that becomes like family to Harry. Though Harry grows closer to Dumbledore as the series progresses, they will always maintain a mentor/student relationship, while Harry and Hagrid develop a true familial bond. Hagrid is portrayed as a gentle, though somewhat uncouth, giant, who is unfailingly loyal to Dumbledore and Hogwarts; he is also a rather naive man-child who lacks a mature and sophisticated thinking process. Though he is Harry's protector, his simplistic, two-dimensional views often prevent him from accurately analyzing situations or predicting any possible dark or dangerous consequences related to them. This occasionally results in his giving faulty advice to Harry. Like many in the Wizarding world, Hagrid becomes blind to the approaching evil, and he fails to consider that malevolent forces are being unleashed within Hogwarts. From his viewpoint, Hogwarts is impenetrable, every teacher is entirely good, and Dumbledore's power is unlimited. We also see Hagrid's deep love for all animals, wild or domesticated, huge or tiny. His belief that all creatures can be tamed if treated gently often blinds him to their unpredictable and potentially lethal natures, as seen with &quot;Fluffy&quot;, the ferocious three-headed dog, and now Norbert, a baby dragon. Just how he could secretly raise an illegal, fire-breathing animal that will likely torch his hut and grow to an enormous size never seems to occur to Hagrid when he hatches the egg. Instead, he is only focused only on the moment and on having obtained something he has always desired. This inability to foresee that a small, vulnerable, motherless hatchling will grow into a fierce, uncontrollable beast, becomes a metaphor for how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], also an orphan, was able to rise to power.

As mentioned in the Analysis section, this chapter also is significant in setting up the final scenes in the book. Having been involved in losing Gryffindor a huge number of House Points, as Harry will be in the next chapter's opening pages, how much sweeter is it that he is also instrumental in winning them all back, and more?

We will, of course, find out later that Snape is actually trying to protect the Stone... but even for those who are in on the secret, this is thin reassurance, because Quirrell is also responsible for one of the barriers to entry.

We learn here that Fluffy, one of the barriers to entry, is Hagrid's responsibility. This might seem a bit premature, as Hagrid is not the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher, and so we might expect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] might be more likely to have provided Fluffy. However, Hagrid is, even now, Keeper of Keys and Grounds, and so is necessarily familiar with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] and its denizens. It is possible that Fluffy was something of a joint effort, with Kettleburn taking care of him after Hagrid retrieved him from the Forest. Professor Kettleburn, however, is not mentioned, so we can only speculate as to his involvement.

Norbert is mentioned in passing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the seventh book]]. Hagrid and Charlie happen to be together at the Weasley home, and Hagrid inquires about Norbert. Charlie says they are calling her Norberta now. Charlie explains that they know Norberta is a female because they are more fierce. 

In this chapter we also see Harry's willingness to break rules if he believes he has a good reason. This ability to think independently will be useful in later years as increasingly more daunting tasks are put before him.

* The only connection we see in this chapter is a very minor one, as Norbert is mentioned in passing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] hauls [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], their House Head, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] is also there for wandering the halls so late. Neville's insistence that he was only going to warn Harry leads Professor McGonagall to conclude that Harry and Hermione fabricated the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] story to lure [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] out after hours, solely to get him detention. All three receive detention and are deducted House points. (Malfoy has been similarly punished.) In one night, Harry's actions have bumped Gryffindor to the bottom in House points. He resolves to avoid doing anything that will cost Gryffindor more House points.

Sometime later, Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Draco are escorted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] hut for their detention. Hagrid says something in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] has been killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]]. They separate into two parties, to follow a wounded Unicorn's blood trail. Hagrid, Harry, and Hermione form one party, and Draco and Neville, with Fang (Hagrid's boarhound), are the other. Hagrid's party meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ronan|Ronan]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]]. Ronan makes a few remarks about astronomy, then is joined by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bane|Bane]], another Centaur, who also comments on astronomy. After leaving the Centaurs, Hermione sees red wand sparks; Hagrid runs off to investigate.

Neville, panicked, ignited the sparks after Draco had deliberately frightened him. Hagrid, figuring Harry is harder to scare, re-groups Harry with Draco and Fang, taking Hermione and Neville. After about an hour, Harry and Draco find the Unicorn, dead. Harry hears a slithery noise, and a hooded figure appears and starts drinking the Unicorn's blood. Malfoy and Fang run off, while the hooded figure advances on Harry, whose scar is now searing with pain. A Centaur, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], suddenly appears and chases the hooded figure away. He warns Harry that the forest is dangerous, and offers him a ride back to Hagrid. Ronan and Bane gallop alongside, angry that Firenze allows a human to ride him &quot;as if he were a common mule&quot;, and also for interfering with the heavens' portents. Firenze responds that he will fight the evil, even alongside humans if he must, then gallops off with Harry. 

Firenze explains that Unicorn blood will keep a person alive, &quot;even if you are only an inch from death&quot;, but it will be a cursed half-life, causing Harry to wonder why that would be better than death. Firenze says the hooded figure may be waiting for something stronger to restore him to full life. Harry realizes this must be the Elixir of Life, a product of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], and concludes that the hooded creature is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], who is probably only partially alive, as Hagrid speculated back in July. They reach Hagrid, who lets the students return to the castle. Harry tells Ron and Hermione what has been happening overnight, and they suspect that Voldemort is now just waiting for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] to get the Stone, and then will reappear to kill Harry.

There is one final surprise: as Harry reaches his bed near dawn, he finds his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], neatly folded, with a note reading: ''&quot;Just in case.&quot;''

== Analysis ==

For their punishment, Harry and the others must enter the aptly named Forbidden Forest, an ominous prospect despite Hagrid's presence. Students are rarely allowed to venture in here, for good reason, and only when they are closely supervised. Dark, dangerous, and foreboding, these ancient woods contain many secrets, as well as mysterious, deadly creatures dwelling within. And while a forest contains abundant life, death is always lurking nearby, as seen by the slain Unicorn. We can guess that the Forbidden Forest will continue to play at least some role later in the series, but it is suggested here that Voldemort may still be alive, if only just, and could be utilizing its resources to sustain his life until he is able to fully restore his body.
 
Rowling also uses the forest, the Centaurs, and the Unicorn to convey powerful symbolic meaning and imagery, as well as instill fear and danger. In literature and western mythology, forests can represent many things including the unknown, a wild spirit, a realm of birth, death, and resurrection, nature's secrets, and even the spiritual world. Unicorns symbolize purity, feminine chastity, morality, and other similar attributes. Harry, pure and innocent, has just entered a dark, frightening place, and he lacks any knowledge about it or its dangers. This parallels his journey into the Wizarding world, another unknown domain filled with unseen perils. Along both paths, Harry often struggles to find his footing, occasionally stumbling as he moves forward. The hooded creature lapping the Unicorn's blood is likely tied to the Dark Lord, and this may foreshadow Harry's possibly confronting Voldemort later in the story, and throughout the series. While in the forest, Harry encounters death firsthand. And not just any death, but a creature that represents all that is good and pure has been slain by something entirely vile and evil. Ironically, this malevolent being can only survive by drinking its innocent victim's blood. It was, we believe, this same evil that murdered Harry's parents, and the slain Unicorn may portend that even more virtuous and pure-hearted victims will fall prey to it. 

The Centaurs that Harry encounters in the Forbidden Forest are particularly interesting. These mythological beings, half-human, half-horse, often symbolize mankind's dual nature, with its lower, savage animalistic side frequently in conflict with higher reason and morality. This struggle between good and evil will be seen throughout the series, not only in the two warring factions headed by Voldemort and (apparently) Dumbledore, but also within individual characters who must choose to follow either a light or a dark path, sometimes struggling between the two. And though the Centaurs are able to see, dimly, into the future, their predictions are so vague and abstract as to be nearly nonsensical, at least to humans. They comment several times that the planet Mars is bright, but do not expand on their understanding of this phenomenon. Mars, being the Roman god of war, may hint at a future conflict, probably involving wizards; the Centaurs' calm reaction to this suggests that they also do not believe that they share this fate.

More specifically, the Centaurs seen here provide us small tidbits about their beliefs regarding humanity and Wizard-kind. In particular, the three Centaurs clearly show that deep divisions exist among them, with Ronan and Bane advocating shunning humans altogether, while others such as Firenze are willing to set aside their opinions about &quot;inferior races&quot; for the general good of all. Firenze has apparently created a rift within his herd by rescuing Harry and threatening to fight evil alongside the humans, indicating that he understands better than anyone that this growing evil may affect all magical creatures, not just wizards. The Centaurs have apparently foreseen and agree that Harry Potter will play some integral role in this approaching conflict.

Another interesting point is Harry's Invisibility Cloak being returned to him, apparently by the same person who gave it to him at Christmas. Recall that Harry and Hermione left the Cloak atop the Astronomy Tower. The Tower is used fairly frequently, as Astronomy students do their practical work there; it is reasonable to assume that a class convenes there on most clear nights. Wizards being subject to the same foibles as any other human, it seems unlikely that a student would have returned it to Harry. More likely a teacher who is either frequently on the Astronomy Tower during daylight, or else is singularly aware of recent events occurring in the school, found and returned the Cloak to Harry, knowing it was his. This person must be a teacher or staff member, as a student would have been unable to obtain the Cloak from Harry's father originally. We can, however, rule out Professor McGonagall, as the accompanying message's handwriting differs from McGonagall's writing on the note included with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Harry's broom]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 10|September]]. While it is true that the note's handwriting is never specifically described, it is likely that Harry would have noticed, and commented on, any difference from the note that had accompanied the Cloak in December. While we are beginning to suspect that the &quot;oddly spiky&quot; handwriting might be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s, Harry believes himself to be too insignificant to merit such attention from the school's Headmaster, and so dismisses the possibility.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We learn shortly that the unidentified figure that killed the Unicorn is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Quirrell]]. His actions are entirely under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] control, and show that the Dark Lord will stop at nothing to regain his power. He has no remorse for killing the Unicorn, and indeed, has none for causing others' deaths. Given that he has splintered his soul and stored the pieces in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], Voldemort is no longer quite human. While his later physical appearance reflects his inhumanity, we should bear in mind that Voldemort's facial features are likely something he chose: as the self-proclaimed Heir of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]], and having a great affinity for snakes, Voldemort likely modeled his new self on a serpent, though he did not always resemble one, even after he started creating Horcruxes.

The Centaurs shun wizards and their affairs, though Hagrid, being only part-human, is an exception. They also never harm &quot;foals&quot;, as they call human children, considering them innocent beings, though they prefer avoiding them. Human adults, however, are subject to attack should they run afoul of any Centaur, as does [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. Dumbledore is perhaps the only human the Centaurs respect. It also appears that Firenze has a greater understanding about events foreseen through the stars and planets, perhaps realizing that the coming conflict will affect all creatures in the magical world, not only humans. He is concerned enough that he vocalizes his intentions to the other Centaurs that he will help fight this growing evil. The Centaurs do agree that Harry Potter is an integral part in whatever is approaching. Firenze's continuing involvement in human events eventually causes his herd to banish him, barely escaping with his life. In the final confrontation with Voldemort, the other Centaurs will finally join the battle, fighting Voldemort and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] alongside humans and the other magical creatures.

=== Connections ===
The following items are included because the Centaurs' personalities, which are first seen in this chapter, are necessary for their occurrence. We cannot know to what extent this was planned, of course.
* Firenze will be banished from the herd because he accepts a job from Dumbledore, teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]] after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sibyll Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] is sacked by Dolores Umbridge in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. Firenze's willingness to be employed by a human, teaching Centaur divination to humans, clearly reflects his willingness to work against the oncoming darkness despite the herd's distaste for what Centaurs consider an inferior species.
* Later in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Bane and Ronan will again make an appearance, this time saving Harry and Hermione from Umbridge. Their reactions at this time clearly reflect the distaste for Humans that we see them exhibit in this chapter, magnified by intervening events. This distaste will also shift somewhat to Harry and Hermione, who the Centaurs no longer consider to be such &quot;innocent foals&quot; after Hermione manipulates the herd into helping her and Harry.
* Finally, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we see that Firenze has been fighting alongside the human defenders of Hogwarts, even taking a significant wound while doing so. Ronan and Bane will [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|eventually]] join the battle, with the rest of the herd, under pressure from Hagrid. The behavior of all the Centaurs is entirely true to their personalities as shown in this chapter.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

End of term exam time comes, with both written and practical tests. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] cannot figure out how he was able to take exams while worrying that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] was about to burst through the door and kill him. With the exams' end, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are relaxed, though Harry is not; his scar is hurting more than ever, indicating danger is approaching.

Harry suddenly realizes that he must check something with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] - he needs more detail about where Hagrid got the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]]'s egg. Dragon eggs are not exactly something that one idly carries around, after all. Hagrid, when confronted, does not know what the man he won the egg from looked like, he kept his hooded cloak on. Hagrid also told this stranger that Fluffy, the three-headed dog, would calm right down if he was played a bit of music.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione, realizing that someone knows how to get past the three-headed dog, run to tell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] informs them that he has been called away to London. They try to trail [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], but fail. Harry resolves to go down the trap door as soon as the Gryffindor common room clears; Hermione and Ron immediately elect to go with him.

As they prepare to leave, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] notices them and attempts to block their departure, refusing to allow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]] to lose any more House points. Hermione regretfully puts him in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|full body bind]]. Under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], they leave the common room and make their way to the third-floor corridor where they find the door is already open. Using the flute that Hagrid gave him, Harry plays Fluffy to sleep, then they jump down the trap door, into a crop of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Devil's Snare|Devil's Snare]]. Hermione, recognizing what it is, but needing to be prompted by Ron, neutralizes the plant. From there, they enter a chamber with what looks like flying birds but is actually keys. They can only escape by catching the right key using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomsticks]]. Naturally, Harry manages this with Ron's and Hermione's assistance. The next trap is a gigantic and violent wizard chess set. Ron brilliantly navigates them across the board by winning the game, but he is injured. After checking his condition, Harry and Hermione then pass on through a chamber in which there is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|Troll]] that is, luckily, already knocked out. They move on to the next challenge, a logic puzzle, which Hermione solves. However, only one can proceed further, and Harry sends Hermione back to help Ron and summon help. Harry enters the last chamber. Someone is there, but it is not Snape.

== Analysis ==

The Trio is starting to work together, and we see them deriving strength from their combined talents. Each plays a vital role in reaching the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], whereas, one alone, and even two, would have likely failed. Hermione's magical ability and intellect allowed the three to escape the Devil's Snare and she solved the logic puzzle; Harry's flying talent was required to catch the key; and Ron's strategic skills were needed on the Wizard's Chess board. Notably, however, they were not simply taking turns. Ron had to prompt Hermione into conjuring a light to evade the Devil's Snare, and Harry needed Ron's and Hermione's help on the brooms to corner the key.

It was mentioned earlier that certain staff and teachers provided the protection for the Stone. In order, that would be: Hagrid (Fluffy), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] (Devil's Snare), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] (charmed keys), Professor McGonagall (wizard chess set), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] (as we will shortly find out, the troll), and Professor Snape (potions for the logic puzzle). While we have been told that Professor Dumbledore has also contributed, his magical protection is unseen yet.

Neville's opposing the Trio is the first occasion where we have seen him evince any bravery whatsoever. Until now, he has seemed ineffectual, magically weak, and at the mercy of the passing scene. It certainly seemed questionable that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] placed him in Gryffindor, a house known for bravery. But Gryffindor also represents nobility, as well as courage, and the Hat apparently detected both those traits within him that, here, we see for the first time when he opposes the others. His opposition is futile, to be sure, but he believes he is protecting his House from losing more points due to what he feels is the Trio's inappropriate actions. This chapter marks a milestone in Neville's maturation, and his bravery and noble nature are gradually becoming more overt. Whether or not his magical ability can also progress remains to be seen, however.

One small point deserves notice here: It is mentioned in passing that Harry has trouble sleeping because, &quot;he kept being woken by his old nightmare.&quot; Only twice have dreams been mentioned previously in this book. The first, Harry's vision of a flying motorbike from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|the early chapters]], is by no means a nightmare; Harry seems to recall it as being exciting. The other dream mentioned dates back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|Harry's first night at Hogwarts]], and it is mentioned there that he had forgotten the dream by the next morning. So it would seem we are unacquainted with Harry's old nightmare, and there is no immediate explanation for this discrepancy.

=== Logic puzzle ===

The logic puzzle Hermione solves is interesting, in that we see the question, and the solution, but not the initial setup. The solution, as determined by Hermione, is that the smallest bottle will move you forward, and the one at the right end of the line will take you back. Clearly, from the arrangement of the bottles and the associated clues, it is possible for Hermione to determine which potion is which. Is it possible, from the clues and Hermione's solution, to work backwards and determine what the arrangement must have been? In fact, it does not, as the third clue is based on the bottles' sizes, which we are not told; however, it does refine it to one of two possible setups, both of which are uniquely solvable from the clues provided. 

There are seven differently-shaped bottles on the table in front of them, and the puzzle text is:

''Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,''&lt;br/&gt;
''Two of us will help you, whichever you would find.''&lt;br/&gt;
''One among us seven will let you move ahead,''&lt;br/&gt;
''Another will transport the drinker back instead.''&lt;br/&gt;
''Two among our number hold only nettle wine,''&lt;br/&gt;
''Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.''&lt;br/&gt;
''Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,''&lt;br/&gt;
''To help you in this choice we give you these clues four:''&lt;br/&gt;
''First, however slyly the poison tries to hide,''&lt;br/&gt;
''You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;''&lt;br/&gt;
''Second, different are those who stand at either end,''&lt;br/&gt;
''But if you would move onwards, neither is your friend;''&lt;br/&gt;
''Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,''&lt;br/&gt;
''Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;''&lt;br/&gt;
''Fourth, the second left and the second on the right,''&lt;br/&gt;
''Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.''

Is this enough to determine the initial arrangement of bottles? Let us say that B is the potion that allows you to go back, F is the potion that allows you to move forward, W is wine, and P is poison.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
  |From the Poem, we know that there are 3 P's, 2 W's, 1 B, and 1 F. Let us start blank.
  |_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_
|-
  |We know from Hermione's solution that B is the farthest to the right.
  |_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;B
|-
  |From the 2nd clue, we learn that neither end can be F, so the furthest to the left must be B, W, or P. It cannot be W, since there is always Poison to Wine's left, from clue 1, and there is no spot to the left of the leftmost. As we know where B is already, we also know that it cannot be B. Therefore, it must be P.
  |P&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;B
|-
  |Clue number 1 tells us that each of the two bottles of wine has poison to its left. If wine is not the second bottle, then we have the following choices for the remaining two P and the two W:
  {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
   |P P W P W _ B || P P W _ P W B || P _ P W P W B
   |}
Clue 4 rules out all of these choices, because in none of them does the sixth bottle match the second. Additionally, it rules out the possibility that the second bottle is the Forwards potion, as there is only one bottle of F and so if it is in position 2, it will not match what is in position 6. So the second bottle must be wine.
  |P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;B
|-
  |Now, we know that &quot;''second left and second on the right''&quot; are the same from clue number 4, so the second from the right must also be wine.
  |P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;B
|-
  |And now, apply clue number 1 again &amp;mdash; poison to the left of the wine.
  |P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;_&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;B
|-
  |At this point it becomes indeterminate as we can't see the sizes of the bottles to allow clue 3 to help us. The two solutions are equally likely, but whichever of the two is the &quot;dwarf&quot;, the smallest of the lot, will be the Forward bottle, that being the only one not yet determined.
  |P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;F&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;B&lt;br/&gt;P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;F&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;W&amp;nbsp;B
|}

Given this arrangement, we note that clue 3, &quot;neither dwarf nor giant holds death,&quot; means that the giant must be one of the two wine bottles, as from Hermione's solution we know that the Back potion is a smaller bottle, and the Forward potion is the smallest. 

So, starting from the arrangement above, Hermione sees that the &quot;giant&quot; in clue 3 is either 2 or 6, meaning the largest bottle must be wine, back, or forward potion. Clue 4 tells her that 2 and 6 are both not poison, therefore they must both be wine, as there is only one of forward potion or back potion; and clue 1 tells her that 1 and 5 must both be poison.

As both wine bottles have been identified, and clue 2 says that 7 must be different from 1 but cannot be Forward, and we know that 1 is Poison, the only option available is that 7 is Back. 

With three of the four non-poison bottles identified, and none of them the &quot;dwarf&quot; mentioned in clue 3, it is easy to determine that the smallest bottle must be Forward, and the one remaining unidentified bottle, neither dwarf nor giant, must be poison.

The analysis above assumes it is somehow possible to tell from which side the line of potion bottles is to be viewed, since the definition of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; depend on it. From the written description of the room &quot;... just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line,&quot; it is entirely possible the table was in the middle of the room and could be viewed from either side. However, Hermione &quot;walked up and down the line of bottles&quot; rather than around the table while contemplating the puzzle, which would suggest the bottles are only accessible from one side, as they would be if the table were pushed up against a wall. It is possible that Hermione simply assumed that the bottles were to be referred to only from the side of the room where she and Harry entered, and was staying always on that side of the table to ease her own thinking. It would, of course, be possible to affix the poem to the table so that the order of bottles is fixed relative to the poem; however, we are told that the riddle is on a scroll that Hermione can carry around. We have to assume some form of standard reference as to where the leftmost and rightmost bottles are, as the puzzle must be solvable. However, the fact remains that Hermione was lucky that the wizard who had already passed through had not made some trivial rearrangement of the bottles that would have invalidated the entire puzzle, and Harry was lucky that the same wizard had left any of the &quot;go forward&quot; potion for him.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

This chapter is almost pure action; there is very little here that is carried forward to further books. However, the following points should be mentioned.

Until now, Neville's courage has been deeply buried as he has quietly endured a family tragedy that few know about. Neville's increasing strength, bravery, and magical ability will, by the seventh book, result in him becoming a leader in an underground resistance to a Dark organization.  

Hermione here shows some concern for Ron; it is impossible to judge, at this early stage, if this is the starting point for their eventual relationship that develops in books six and seven, but one could speculate that a seed has been sown.

One additional point should be raised concerning &quot;Harry's old nightmare,&quot; which is mentioned though never explained. Harry will be subject to recurring nightmares in later books, notably visions of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|duel in the cemetery]] after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cedric's Death|death]], and later under the malign influence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. However, we have not yet been told of any recurring nightmares, so the mention of such in this chapter may be an error, or may simply be premature.

== Synopsis ==
Note: This chapter ties up many plot threads in a rather short space. In order to explain the necessary high points, the synopsis (and the following analysis) must be relatively long.

{{spoiler}}

The man in the final chamber is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Quirrell]]. But a changed Quirrell, no longer twitching, stuttering or timid. He tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] possessed him while he was traveling abroad. Quirrell claims he was a foolish man until meeting Voldemort, who showed him that there is no good or evil, only power, and those too weak to seek it. Quirrell is quick to point out that being seen as poorly skilled, particularly alongside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], is a very effective disguise. Snape was suspected of creating all the mischief that Quirrell was responsible for, such as enchanting Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 11|the Quidditch match against Slytherin]] – apparently Snape was working a counter-charm, and it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] knocking Quirrell off his feet that interrupted the jinx. Quirrell also admits to having a particular talent with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|trolls]], having set one loose into the dungeons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 10|at Hallowe'en]] as a diversion, so he could see what was guarding the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Stone]]; he was thwarted by Snape, however.

Now, all that stands before him is the final obstacle guarding the Stone, which Harry recognizes as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]]. While examining the Mirror, Quirrell mentions that Snape was at school with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]], and that they hated each other, which is why he dislikes Harry, though Snape never wanted him dead. He also says that &quot;his Master&quot;, which apparently means Lord Voldemort, is with him wherever he goes. When Quirrell is unable to decode the Mirror's secret, a voice tells him to, &quot;use the boy&quot;. Quirrell stands Harry in front of the mirror, and Harry sees himself removing the Stone from his pants pocket, then discovers that it is actually in his pocket. He tells Quirrell that he only sees himself winning the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/House Cup|House Cup]] but the mysterious voice says he is lying and demands to speak to Harry face-to-face. Quirrell demurs, but eventually removes his turban to reveal Lord Voldemort's face on the back of his head. Voldemort orders Quirrell to seize Harry, but Quirrell's skin burns and blisters when he touches Harry. As Quirrell is about to perform a deadly curse, Harry grabs his opponent's face, leaving Quirrell in too much pain to utter the incantation. By now, the pain in Harry's scar is so intense that it renders him unconscious.

Harry awakens in the hospital wing; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], who arrived at the Chamber just in time to save Harry from Quirrell, is standing nearby. He tells Harry that the Stone has been destroyed, and Nicolas Flamel and his wife, Perenelle, will die, but they have enough time left to get their affairs in order. &quot;After all,&quot; he says, &quot;to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; Dumbledore agrees with Harry that Voldemort is still out there, possibly searching for another body to inhabit, or looking for some other means to return. Dumbledore refuses, for now, to answer Harry's question about why Voldemort wanted to kill him. He does tell him that Quirrell was unable to touch Harry because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Harry's mother]] died to save him, and a love that strong can provide protection against Dark magic. Dumbledore admits it was he who gave Harry the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] - saying Harry's father left it in his care. Dumbledore also explains that Snape hates Harry because Harry's father saved Snape's life, leaving Snape in his debt, something Snape deeply resents. Dumbledore explains how Harry was able to retrieve the Stone from the enchanted Mirror: anyone who wanted to use the Stone would only see themselves using it, but would be prevented from taking it, while someone who was only seeking it but did not wish to use it, would find it.

After Dumbledore's departure, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are allowed to visit. Harry recounts what happened in the last chamber and what Dumbledore told him. They conclude Dumbledore allowed Harry to fight Voldemort, if he chose, rather than trying to protect him from the Dark Lord.

The next day, Harry has another visitor: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who is in tears because he gave Quirrell the final piece of information he needed to reach the Stone. After Harry calms him, Hagrid remembers he has a gift for him, a photo album, containing wizarding pictures of Harry's parents.

Late in the day, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], the nurse, relents and allows Harry to attend the Leaving Feast. There, &lt;!-- not AFTER much good food --&gt; Professor Dumbledore rises to award the House Cup. Slytherin is in the lead, partly because without Harry playing in the final match, Ravenclaw defeated Gryffindor at Quidditch, and also because Harry lost Gryffindor so many House points in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 14|Norbert debacle]]. &quot;However, recent events must be taken into account - I have some last-minute points to dish out.&quot; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and – surprisingly – [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] have earned between them enough House points to regain the lead and win the House Cup for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]].

Exam results are revealed and Hermione, as expected, has the best marks of the year, while both Ron and Harry have managed decent passes; even Neville has scraped through. Finally it is time for the Hogwarts Express to take students home. Ron and Hermione promise to write, and Ron says he will invite them both to visit him. And though everyone has received notices warning them that no magic is permitted outside school, Harry knows the Dursleys have no idea about that. &quot;I'm going to have a lot of fun with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] this summer...&quot;

== Analysis ==

The story ends on a high note, and Harry has won the battle, but the the reader can see that the war has just begun. Voldemort, though thwarted, has indeed survived, and he will likely attempt other ways to restore his body, biding his time before launching another assault on Harry and the Wizarding world.

Quirrell's comment that there is no good or evil, only power, and those who are too weak to seek it, reflects Voldemort's belief that achieving his goal will justify whatever means he employs to obtain it. That goal, based on his past history, is conquering the wizard realm, and for Voldemort, good and evil truly are non-existent concepts. Instead, there is only his insatiable lust for power and a self-determined right to satisfy it. This also reflects how Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], and Slytherins in general, appear to think and function, seizing whatever they want, whenever they want, and by any means deemed necessary, often taking the easiest and shortest route possible. However, an old axiom states that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Voldemort, already corrupt, is likely to become even more so, probably to where he retains little rationality or sanity. As contrasted by Dumbledore, with power comes responsibility and morality, along with continual cooperation, oversight, and loyalty in order to operate and maintain a stable and productive society. Without it, a state is destined to decay through internal conflict, strife, and greed until it totally collapses. Even if Voldemort can conquer the wizard realm, retaining his power and maintaining an orderly and productive rule while keeping his followers loyal and placated would be an indomitable, if not impossible, task for him.

In this we can see some similarities to Niccolò Machiavelli's 16th century political treatise, ''The Prince'', which advocates that to obtain or maintain power, a prince should adopt a moral public facade while secretly implementing whatever extreme amoral methods are necessary to gain and retain control, without regard to the individual or civil rights. That belief has even been utilized in the modern era by dictators such as Adolph Hitler to fuel his rise to power in mid-20th century Germany. The series' overall theme of good vs. evil, and which path, dark or light, a wizard can and will choose to follow, will seem blurred by Voldemort, who cares about neither. Though his overall plan is yet unclear, he may want to keep his presence concealed and true intentions ambiguous while insidiously plotting to take control. This would make it difficult for Voldemort's opponents to fight him if he has already solidified and entrenched his power structure once he does emerge. While Voldemort apparently cares little for appearances, when he reveals himself, his public persona, rather than a moralistic image, may instead espouse principles and ideals crafted to appeal to those already bent towards his beliefs, or those who have been denied equality under the current wizard rule and can further support the Dark Lord's rise to power. He is unconcerned about what methods he employs to achieve this, and it seems doubtful that Voldemort intends to share power once he obtains it or allow others to reap benefits from his takeover. He will, however, likely have to offer at least simplistic rewards to gain that power, and mete out penalties to retain it.

Clearly the big surprise in the story is that it was Quirrell, not Snape, who was behind the ongoing attacks on Harry. We know Snape and Harry deeply dislike one another, but Harry's animosity had biased him into wrongly believing that Snape was responsible. Harry, still too single-minded and immature, fails to consider that there could be other reasons behind Snape's behavior; Snape's hatred apparently stems from his relationship with Harry's father, James Potter, though the full circumstances are still unknown, nor why Snape would transfer this resentment to James' young son. Snape's antagonism toward Harry is widely known, even among the staff, though Dumbledore seems to discount it somewhat; Snape almost certainly was questioned following the attacks and had been cleared, though Harry apparently presumes that an interrogation never occurred, and does not realize that teachers are unlikely to discuss such matters with a first-year student, even one as directly involved as Harry is.

Life, death, and resurrection are also ongoing themes in the series, and it is reinforced here, though Quirrell's death and the Flamels' impending demise are indirectly shown, unlike the slain [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorn]] seen in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. As Dumbledore explains it to Harry, death is but a gateway to another realm, likely one that is better and more enjoyable than the living world, and it is a natural progression that should be embraced, not feared, though both Voldemort and Flamel apparently do; this may partially explain why some who die, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], become [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghosts]] and remain bound to the living world, rather than moving on to the &quot;other side.&quot; While Voldemort, whose name can be translated from French as &quot;flight from death&quot;, seeks any means to become immortal, Flamel instead chooses to end his life for the betterment and safety of wizard society. Immortality has a high price, and anyone possessing that secret holds the most sought after and valuable prize that many would pay any amount or perform any act, including murder, to obtain. Flamel realizes that the Stone is far too dangerous to exist because innocent people will be killed as others, such as Voldemort, will always seek its power. Flamel opts to destroy the Stone, finally accepting mortality as an inevitable part of living. Even if Voldemort can obtain a new body and immortality, his life will probably always be cursed and incomplete, his shredded soul never fully restored, and unable to attain love and friendship, whose power is incomprehensible to him.

Harry also learns more about his tie to the Dark Lord, his family, and that it was his mother's love for him and sacrificing her life for his that created the magical protection against Voldemort's attack when Harry was an infant. It is this same love within Harry that burned Voldemort when Harry touched Quirrell. This protection will likely continue to play an important role in the story's plot. While Harry has a better understanding regarding his relationship with Voldemort, Dumbledore's refusal to explain why Voldemort wants to kill Harry can only add to Harry's confusion and fears.

There are a few concerns regarding &quot;one of Dumbledore's 'better ideas'&quot;, hiding the Stone in the Mirror of Erised. Dumbledore says that anyone who wanted to use the Stone, would only see themselves using it but would be unable to take it, while someone who was only seeking it but did not wish to use it, would find it. Quirrell reports that he sees himself in the Mirror, giving the Stone to his Master, which seems to fit the requirement of not using it himself. Why did Dumbledore's spell prevent the Stone from being released to Quirrell? This question must remain unanswered, but there are at least two possible reasons. The most likely reason is that Quirrell is simply lying, saying what he thinks Voldemort wants to hear while he actually sees himself amassing piles of Stone-created gold. However, it can be argued that Voldemort can sense falsehoods, as he seems to be able to sense that Harry is lying. An alternate explanation would be that Dumbledore's spell is detecting both Quirrell handing over the Stone and Voldemort using it, and is refusing to release it to Voldemort.

Also, many fan sites have noticed a discrepancy in this chapter. Hermione says that she found Dumbledore in the Entrance Hall as she was on her way to send him an owl. Yet the trap door is located in the third-floor hallway, and the Owlery, we learn later, is high in the castle, on the seventh floor. Why would Hermione head down to the main floor on her way from the third to the seventh floor? One possible answer to this can actually be found in the Harry Potter films, in which we see a large central stairwell in the castle. Combine that with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|earlier warning]] that the stairways like to move, and it is entirely possible that Hermione, emerging from the third floor corridor, would have found herself on the side of the central stairwell away from the Owlery with no staircases leading upwards from there. While descending to access a staircase that would bridge the gap, she might either have needed to go through the Entrance Hall, or else happened to see Dumbledore, below her, as he returned to the castle. This speculation is only intended to quiet a small issue that can hamper the story's enjoyment; it is unsupported by anything in the books.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry survives his second encounter with Lord Voldemort, and what protected him the first time, his mother's love, protects him again, and apparently will continue to do so. We later learn that this protection also requires Harry to live in a home where his mother's blood kin resides (in this case, her sister, Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]]). This is why Harry must return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] each summer, until &lt;!-- maybe hint that 17 is the age of wizarding maturity --&gt; his 17th birthday, as much as he detests being there. On several occasions however, he will be prematurely liberated from his enforced confinement to spend time with the Weasleys.

While Harry has already suspected that Snape has the ability to read minds, we do not yet know whether this is a magical ability. It turns out that it is; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 24|much later]], Professor Snape will be called upon to teach [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] to Harry, at which time we will learn, not only that there is a magical ability to examine the mind's contents ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]]), but also that Voldemort is a master at it. Weakened as he is, Voldemort still seems quite able to read Harry's mind, of determining what Harry sees in the mirror, and that he has obtained the Stone. We will learn, much later, details of the linkage that exists between Voldemort and Harry, here shown by the recurring pain in Harry's scar. Voldemort, however, will remain unsure of the linkage's nature until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|Harry's fifth year]], apparently assuming until that point that the ability to read Harry's thoughts is purely his Legilimency skills.

The seeming hatred between James Potter and Severus Snape is mentioned for the first time here. This features prominently in later books, especially the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|fifth]]. As this apparent hatred is a focal point on which the series' plot turns, we will see it repeatedly over the entire story arc. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|Eventually]], the reason for it is revealed.

A key question driving the series is asked, and left unanswered, for the first time. Harry asks why Voldemort wants to kill him; Dumbledore responds that he must refuse to answer that. We learn later about a prophecy that predicts that either Harry or Voldemort must die, as &quot;neither can live while the other survives.&quot; Dumbledore feels that as a child of 11 years, Harry is still too young to be told this arguably harsh fact. The prophecy will be revealed to Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|in four years]], along with Dumbledore's reasons for withholding it.

Also, Dumbledore voices a philosophy that centers the series: &quot;after all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; This does not, at first glance, seem to be a particularly useful philosophy, but it is the key difference between Voldemort and those who would defeat him. Much of the series revolves around death and the attitudes towards it. Voldemort fears death, so much so that he kills others in cold blood to preserve his own life by creating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Dumbledore, and to a large extent Harry, are prepared to die, if necessary, to destroy Voldemort's great evil. It is the one who is prepared to meet death, on his own terms, who fully masters it; running from death does not avoid it. This, we are told, is why Harry is the stronger Wizard when he confronts and duels Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|near the end of book 4]].

To defeat Quirrell (and Voldemort), Harry had to follow a designated path, containing dangerous obstacles he had to overcome, before confronting the Dark Lord. This same scenario is echoed in the next book, ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', where Harry travels through an underground passage leading to a hidden chamber beneath Hogwarts where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] (Voldemort) awaits. And though Voldemort does not appear in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', Harry (and Hermione) clambers through a secret tunnel leading to the Shrieking Shack where the fugitive and the Dark Lord's supposedly loyal supporter, Sirius Black, has taken Ron.  In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Harry must navigate an enchanted maze filled with riddles and dangerous creatures as part of a Tournament, only to again face Voldemort. Harry is lured to the Ministry of Magic in ''Order of the Phoenix'', where he maneuvers his way through the convoluted halls and mysterious rooms of the Department of Mysteries to confront the Dark Lord's minions, as well as his own destiny in the form of a prophecy. Finally, in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', he travels a dark path through the Forbidden Forest that will lead to his seemingly final encounter with Voldemort. Following a defined, but unknown and dangerous pathway symbolizes Harry's progression through the entire series, and it is the only way he will be able to defeat Lord Voldemort. At each juncture, he has the option to turn back, but instead chooses to move forward; each time he is only able reach the final destination with help from Ron and Hermione, and later, other allies such as Neville Longbottom and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]].

It should be noted that Neville's being awarded House points for showing courage by standing up to his friends, though wholly deserved, may seem like a fluke or even an act of generosity by Dumbledore. However, at the end of Order of the Phoenix, Professor McGonagall will award Neville, along with Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Luna Lovegood, 50 House points for his part in the battle at the Ministry of Magic and for warning the Wizarding world of Voldemort's return. In the last book, he will continue to show exemplary courage, and throughout the series, most notably in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', we will see him and grow into a strong wizard and capable leader.

=== Connections ===
* &quot;After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; This aphorism is applied here by Dumbledore in reference to Nicolas Flamel. While we do not recognize it directly at the time of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|Dumbledore's death]], we will find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]] that Dumbledore had applied it to himself as well. And Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|subsequent realization]] that in order to master Death, one must not fear it, is closely related.
* Voldemort here is seen to have survived his own apparent death. This, of course, sets up the entire seven-book story arc, and will be referred to multiple times throughout the series. The fact that the mechanism depends on fragments of Voldemort's soul being attached to physical objects (&quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]&quot;), and that Harry contains a piece of Voldemort's soul within himself, is not yet known; but the connection between Harry and Voldemort, visible in Harry's scar and known by the pain in that scar, would indicate that the nature of Voldemort's immortality had been largely worked out this early in the series.</text>

Wait...the reason old regulus was killed was because he &quot;got in too deep, and wanted out&quot;. I think that whoever was killed was going to be killed by Voldemort, but ''not because'' of the horcrux. Remember I know that I will be dead ''long before'' you read this. But ''I want you to know'' that it was I who discovered your secret. If it was regulus black, then this is how it happened.
1. Regulus finds out
2. Regulus doesn't dare tell Voldemort, because he would be killed, if he let slip the secret of Voldemort's success.
3. So he tries to slip ot quietly and...
4. Voldemort gets angry, and sends  out a few death eater pals to do him in.
5. Regulus runs for it, taking Kreacher with him to destroy the Horcrux, not knowing there are many more.
6. Regulus uses the house elf, who must obey him, to disapperate them both home, knowing that while Kreacher is suffering, he must obey.
7. He cures Kreacher,who is nonetheless damaged.
8. Here come the death eaters...
9. ...he hides the horcrux, placing the note inside, and...
10. They kill him, leaving the horcrux undiscovered for many years, until the Order clean up the house.

I guess the date of the book being 50 years old and the half-blood prince being Snape is not connected cause Snape is not 50 being in the same year as James and Lilly Potter

:Are there not used book stores? Ginny had old, used textbooks, Snape was equally poor, likely he had a used Potions book. So the book would have had to be '''at least''' 18 years old at this point, but could easily be older.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The writing process is complicated, and often seems loosely defined. According to Webster’s, writing is “ the way you use written words to express your ideas or opinions.&quot; Although we may think of it as little more than arranging letters and words on a page, a few moments' reflection reveals that it is much more than that. On the one hand, writing is an art--we don't say Shakespeare's language is &quot;correct&quot; but rather that it is beautiful. On the other hand, writing is a science--we want the instructions that came with our Blu-Ray player to be accurate, precise, and easy to understand.

Then there is the matter of what makes writing &quot;good writing.&quot; Although we might say that both an instruction manual and a play are &quot;well written,&quot; we appreciate them for different reasons. A play written in the clear, unambiguous language of an instruction manual would not be a hit on Broadway. In other words, writing must be judged according to its context--what is its purpose and audience? Finally, even readers with a great deal in common may not agree about the quality of any particular text, just as people's opinions differ about which bands are really great. We really don't know why people have such preferences and can't make accurate predictions about what they will like or dislike. Simply put, writing isn't simple.

If writing is so complicated and mysterious, can it be taught? Since Aristotle, great teachers have taught complex processes to their students by breaking them into smaller, more understandable processes. Aristotle thought that effective communication skills, like good math skills, can be learned and taught. Math teachers don't teach trigonometry to their elementary students; instead, they begin with addition and subtraction. Everything else builds on those simple processes. No one is born a mathematician. Similarly, while luck certainly plays a role in any successful writer's career, successful writers (or speakers) are not just born into the role--and everyone else is not just fated to flunk English. You can learn to write with substance and style. It takes work, but it is within your power. You have already taken the first step.

Most of what we know about writing is also true of speaking. Aristotle wrote a famous treatise on the subject of effective communication called &quot;The Rhetoric.&quot; This book is meant for speakers; however, teachers and students also have long used it to polish their writing. &quot;The Rhetoric&quot; is still widely read and applied today by people desiring to learn how to speak and write more convincingly to an audience. Your first-year composition course may even have the word &quot;rhetoric&quot; or &quot;rhetorical&quot; as part of its title. Aristotle taught us that rhetoric isn't just about winning arguments. Instead, rhetoric is the ability to determine all the available means of persuasion at our disposal. Ultimately, it's up to you to guess the best course of action, but rhetoric helps you make this a more educated guess.

Compared to speaking, writing is a much more recent phenomenon, and for many centuries it was assumed that the best way to learn to write well was either to pray, entreat the muses, or carefully imitate writings that were already considered great. Eventually, as more people wanted to write, teachers created rules to help them write &quot;correctly.&quot; Unfortunately, this heavy emphasis on correctness and writing with a narrow set of rules did little to improve student writing. Simply knowing how to write grammatically correct prose is important, but it is not enough, by itself, to make writing effective or persuasive. Indeed, too much attention to correctness can result in unintentionally rigid or even comical writing. Legend has it that Winston Churchill grew so irritated at pedants telling him not to end his sentences with prepositions that he said to one of them, &quot;Madame, that is a rule up with which I shall not put.&quot;  

Since the 1970s, writing instructors have been teaching writing not as the following of fixed rules but rather as a dynamic process: a series of steps that writers follow to produce texts.  At first in the '70s, these steps were taught as a somewhat rigid sequence.  Now, however, writing teachers emphasize &quot;recursivity&quot;--moving forward through some steps and then circling back to redo previous steps--as the more natural way that many successful writers work.  In other words, while we still think of writing as a process taking place in a series of steps, we now understand that good writers tend to switch frequently among the different steps as they work. An insight gained while editing one chapter might convince the writer that an additional chapter is needed; as a result, she might start another drafting phase--or even decide to divide one chapter into two or three, and begin reorganizing and developing new drafts.  Likewise, failure to satisfy a publisher--whether it is your boss looking at a pamphlet you've written or a book publisher deciding whether to print and sell your book--might lead the author all the way back to the idea-development or organizing stages. In short, while it is very useful to think of writing as a process, the process is not a clear, always-the-same series of steps.  Instead, it is a sometimes messy, forward-and-backward process in which you strive for simplicity but try to appeal to your audience, create but also organize, enjoy yourself if possible but also follow some rules, and eventually create a product that works.  

If this sounds difficult, it's not--at least, not if you learn a few lessons this book can teach you--and you practice, practice, practice.  The more real writing you do, the more of a real writer you will become.  If you are reading this book, then your first goal likely is to do well in a college (or upper-level high school) &quot;composition&quot; or &quot;rhetoric&quot; class.  In short, you want to learn how to write a good academic paper.  There are a large number of tips and methods this book can show you.  They will work best if, like the writing process itself, you go back and forth between reading this book and doing some actual writing: try some of these lessons out by writing; then return to new lessons or review some of the lessons you've already read to discover what you next can do with what you've written--or with a new writing. Your next goal after learning to write a good general academic paper (or several types, perhaps--some of the most common being a summary, an analysis, an argument or &quot;thesis,&quot; an evaluation, and a research paper) is to write in your specific discipline or major.  Each discipline or major has its own writing style, organizational method, and purpose or goal.  Your major or discipline teachers can help you quite a bit as you learn to apply your academic writing skills to their discipline.  And eventually, your goal is to write for your work--for your future profession.

With each of these types of writing--general academic, specific discipline/major, and future profession--you'll eventually become increasingly successful.  As you learn the types better, you will find--like the experienced journalist on a quick deadline for a story--that often your writing will come more quickly and easily.  However, whenever you have a major challenge in your future as a writer, you will know how to return to the circular or &quot;recursive&quot; steps of the process to develop difficult ideas, explain difficult concepts to your audience, and create pleasure and knowledge in both yourself and your audience because of your writing skills.

== Five Evaluation Criteria ==
There are five criteria we can use to evaluate any piece of writing. These criteria are Focus, Development, Organization, Style, and Conventions. 

'''Focus'''. What are you writing about? What claim or thesis are you defending? This criterion is the broadest, concerned with the context, purpose, and coherence of a piece of writing. Is your topic appropriate for an assignment? Do you stay on that topic or drift off on unhelpful tangents? Have you focused too minutely or too widely? For instance, an essay about the American Civil War in general is probably too broad for most college essays. You might be better off writing about a particular battle, general, or incident. 

'''Development'''. Development is concerned with details and evidence. Do you provide enough supporting material to satisfy the expectations of your readers? A proper research paper, for instance, usually includes many references and quotations to many other relevant works of scholarship. A description of a painting would probably include details about its appearance, composition, and maybe even biographical information about the artist who painted it. Deciding what details to include depends on the intended audience of a piece. An article about cancer intended for young children would look quite different than one written for senior citizens.

'''Organization'''. Organization, often called &quot;arrangement,&quot; concerns the order and layout of a paper. Traditionally, a paper is divided into an introduction, body, and conclusion. Paragraphs are focused on a single main idea or topic (unity), and transitions between sentences and paragraphs are smooth and logical. A poorly organized paper rambles, drifting among unrelated topics in a haphazard and confusing fashion.

'''Style'''. Style is traditionally concerned with clarity, elegance, and precision. An effective stylist is not only able to write clearly for an audience, but can also please them with evocative language, metaphors, rhythm, or figures of speech. Effective stylists take pains not just to make a point, but to make it well.

'''Conventions'''. This criterion covers grammar, mechanics, punctuation, formatting, and other issues that are dictated by convention or rules. Although many students struggle with conventions, the knowledge of where to place a comma in a sentence is usually not as important as whether that sentence was worth writing in the first place. Nevertheless, excessive errors can make even a brilliant writer seem careless or ignorant, qualities that will seldom impress one's readers.

==Stages of the Writing Process==
Although we've mentioned that writers often work recursively--that is, frequently switching between drafting, editing, proofreading, and so on--it is useful to break the writing process into different functions or activities. To that end, we have divided it into eight smaller processes: Planning and Prewriting, Collaborating, Researching, Drafting, Editing, Reviewing, Revising, and Publishing. 

===Planning and Prewriting===
Writers generally plan their documents in advance. This stage, often called &quot;prewriting,&quot; includes everything from making a tentative outline, brainstorming, or chatting with friends or colleagues about the topic. For some writers, the prewriting stage is mostly mental--they think about their projects, but do not write until they are ready to start the actual document. Others plan extensively and map out exactly how they want their document to look when it's finished.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Planning and Prewriting|This chapter]] describes common planning and prewriting strategies and should help you &quot;hit the ground running&quot; when starting out your writing projects.

===Collaborating===
While there is a long history of thinking of writing as a wholly individual act, most workplace compositions (and composing in many disciplines) involve collaboration. If you're working on a collaborative text, this chapter will help you develop a collaboration plan, establish strengths and weaknesses in the group, assign roles, and do what ever else will help in producing a co-authored
text.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Collaborating|This chapter]] offers some helpful tips and strategies for collaborating on documents.
Collaboration is essential to the writing process. It is vital for students to have their work read by others. In writing, the more the better.We profit from the views and suggestions of our readers.

===Researching===
Writers frequently require reliable information to support their documents. A writer's personal opinions and experience are sufficient evidence for many types of documents, but audiences will often demand more. Seeking out the information required to support your writing is called &quot;research,&quot; and it comes in many forms.

One form of research is the interview, in which you call up or meet with someone who has information on the topic you are pursuing. Another type, &quot;field research,&quot; involves travel to places where the topic can be studied first-hand. You might also circulate a survey. These three examples are all part of what is called &quot;primary research&quot; -- research you conduct yourself.

While many writing teachers assign primary research to their students in the process of writing a &quot;research paper,&quot; much of the research that writing at the college level asks you to do is &quot;secondary research&quot; -- exploring other people's writing in the form of books, scholarly journals, newspapers, magazines, websites, and government documents.
 
[[Rhetoric and Composition/Researching|This chapter]] describes different research strategies and provides you with the tools you'll need to properly back up the claims you make in your writing.

===Drafting===
Drafting means writing or adding to a piece of writing--composing it. It may seem like a straightforward process, but can often be made difficult by writer's block or other anxieties.  

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Drafting|This chapter]] describes drafting strategies and how to avoid common pitfalls like perfectionism and writer's block.

===Editing===
You can't edit what hasn't been written. That's why editing comes after drafting. For our purposes, it's important to distinguish between deciding what needs to be improved and actually making the changes. We'll call the decision-making process &quot;editing&quot; and making the changes the &quot;revising&quot; process.

Unlike publishers, who hire professional editors to work with their writers, student writers do most of their own editing, with occasional help from peer reviewers.
 
[[Rhetoric and Composition/Editing|This chapter]] describes macro editing (editing at the level of content and arrangement) and micro
editing (editing at the sentence level), and provides strategies for improving your text.

===Reviewing===
Having other people review your writing is essential to producing the best piece you possibly can. We often don't make the best readers of our own work because we are so close to it. Reviewers, on the other hand, bring valuable perspective we can't get any other way. A reviewer is anyone who is willing to look at your work and provide feedback. You're a reviewer, too -- for others' texts.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Reviewing|This chapter]] explains how to successfully review a document as well as how to make the most of
the feedback you receive from other reviewers.

===Revising===
Revising is making the changes you or your editors determined were necessary during the editing process. Revising is hard work, but it's probably some of the most valuable work you can do to become a better writer. Dive into the task with the willingness to wrestle with your writing and bring out the best in it, and you will learn why revising is often considered the &quot;meat&quot; of the writing process.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Revising|This chapter]] examines the revision process and identifies some strategies that will help you improve your documents and reduce the likelihood of creating even bigger problems. This chapter will also cover proofreading, or carefully scanning a document for typos and other simple errors.

===Publishing===
What's the point of writing if no one will ever read it? Though some of us are content to write diaries or notes to ourselves, most writers desire for others to read and hopefully enjoy or benefit from their documents. This is where publishers come in: They help connect writers to readers. The Internet has introduced countless new ways for writers to publish their own documents electronically, but print publishing is still the preferred avenue for most professional writers. Of course, getting your documents accepted for publication can be a long and frustrating ordeal. We've all heard the stories of now-famous novelists who were rejected time and time again by unimaginative or overly-cautious publishers.
 
[[Rhetoric and Composition/Publishing|This chapter]] describes the print and electronic publishing industry, then identifies strategies that will help you distribute your documents to their intended audience. We will also discuss why so many authors fail to ever secure a publisher for their work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Attractor Basin ==

When discussing global dynamics of cellular automata the word ''state'' is used to describe [[Cellular Automata/Mathematical Model#Lattice, cell and configuration|configurations]].

=== Graphic conventions === 
&lt;br&gt;
The following diagrams/captions are based on the original figure
[http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/wuensche/boa_idea.html ''State-space and basins of attraction'']
on the [http://www.ddlab.org  ''DDLab''] website.
Sub-trees, basins of attraction, and the entire basin of attraction field 
(for cellular automata, random Boolean networks, and discrete dynamic networks in general)
can be computed and drawn with the [http://www.ddlab.org ''DDLab''] software.

&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin state space.png|left|State space]]

The ''state space'' is made of all available states of a cellular automaton. 
It's size is &lt;math&gt; S = v^{n} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the the size of the (finite) lattice,
and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the value-range or alphabet, &lt;math&gt;v=2&lt;/math&gt; for binary systems.
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is one of the states.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin trajectory.png|left|Trajectory]]

The ''trajectory'' &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the [[Cellular Automata/Mathematical Model#Global transition function|global transition function]]. State &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a ''predecessor'' and state &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the ''successor'' of state &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin indegree.png|left|State in-degree]]

If the [[Cellular Automata/Mathematical Model#Global transition function|global transtition function]] is not [[w:injective|injective]], than states may have more than one predecessor ([[Cellular Automata/Preimages|preimage)]]. The ''in-degree'' of the state &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the number of its predecessors. A state may have no predecessors, than it is called ''garden of Eden''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin attractor cycle.png|left|Attractor cycle]]

A ''trajectory'' may encounter a state occurred previously (it must if the lattice is finite), thus it has entered an ''attraction cycle''. A ''point attraction cycle'' has the length of a single cell.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin transient tree.png|left|Transient tree]]

By recursively searching predecessors from a ''root'' state on the attraction cycle (the predecessor on the cycle is excluded) till all garden of Eden states are reached a ''transient tree is constructed. A ''subtree'' can be constructed from an arbitrary state on the tree, the root of the subtree.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin basin of attraction.png|left|Basin of attraction]]

By adding transient trees to each state on the attraction cycle, a ''basin of attraction'' is constructed. Some attraction cycles may have no transient trees, this is especially true for reversible cellular automata.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata attractor basin basin of attraction field.png|left|Basin of attraction field]]

By grouping all the states in the state space into respective basins of attraction, a ''basin of attraction field'' is constructed.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

== Injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity ==

The CA rule is reversible, if the global transition function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:bijective|bijective]] (both injective and surjective).

=== Injectivity of the global transition function ===

&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is injective, there is at most one preimage for any CA configuration.

&lt;math&gt;F: X \mapsto Y \qquad \forall x_1,x_2 \in \Omega \; [x_1 \neq x_2 \Rightarrow F(x_1) \neq F(x_2)] &lt;/math&gt;

So there are no configurations with more than one predecessor.

=== Surjectivity of the global transition function ===

&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is injective, there is at least one preimage for any CA configuration.

&lt;math&gt;F: X \mapsto Y \qquad \forall y \in \Omega \; \exists x [ y = F(x)] &lt;/math&gt;

So there are no configurations without a predecessor (so called Garden of Eden).

It is easy to determine the existence of garden of Eden states for one dimensional CA using De Bruijn Diagrams.

=== Bijectivity of the global transition function ===

&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:bijective|bijective]] if it is both injective and surjective. For any configuration there is exactly one predecessor.

The '''raw diet''' is a diet in which adherents eat nothing that has been heated over a particular temperature, usually 117 or 118 degrees [[Cookbook:Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit]]. The diet therefore consists mainly of uncooked fruits, nuts, and vegetables in their natural state. Raw foodists have however created a wide range of raw products and recipes including ones for cookies, &quot;pasta&quot; and pies. Most raw foodists are [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]], but some also eat [[Cookbook:Meat|raw meat]] and [[Cookbook:Dairy|raw dairy]] products.

The diet has been credited with many health improvements by its adherents, but has also been criticized as being unrealistic and unmaintainable in its purest form. Most people who eat raw do so for relatively short periods (weeks to months) before returning to their &quot;normal&quot; diet. They will periodically return to being raw as a sort of cleanse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The agricultural revolution'''

The conversion of our predecessors from hunter-gatherers to herder-farmers circa 8000 BC is the great dichotomy of the human experience. From that point on, the dominance of our species, at least to the present, was assured. The growing of food crops and the domestication of food producing animals changed human activity overnight, in geologic terms. It is important to note, however, that this revolution took many thousands of years to unfold and never reached large parts of the world.

'''The importance of agriculture'''

Agriculture removed much of the uncertainty in obtaining food. People no longer had to search it out over large areas—they found places where it could be produced in abundant quantities year after year and fixed themselves there. Instead of relying on the environment’s natural bounty, they could direct and manipulate the provision of that bounty. Abundant and dependable food supplies allowed population to grow and set the stage for the rise of civilization.

The human population on Earth two million years ago has been estimated at 100,000. At the beginning of the agricultural revolution this number had risen to perhaps five million, thanks to better adaptation, technology, and abundant resources that became available as the ice sheets receded. By 3000 BC, the time of the first Egyptian dynasty, world population had increased to approximately 100 million. By the birth of Christ, world population was well over 200 million.

'''The beginnings of agriculture'''

Agriculture was a gradual discovery. It is believed that early gatherers first learned the relationship between plants, the foods they produced, and their growing cycle. At some point the gatherers learned how to encourage the plants they depended on and inhibit those of no use. Then came the steps of gathering seeds, planting seeds, and nurturing the plants. By selecting seeds from the strongest and most productive plants for replanting, the early planters interrupted and redirected the process of natural selection to improve the yield of the useful plants. For example, researchers in Mexico have found evidence of the ancient corn plant with only a few kernels that became the much more productive corn plant of ancient America through selection over many thousands of years.

The first domesticated grain is believed to have been a wild wheat that grew in southern Turkey. To domesticate this plant, the early gatherers had to learn how to harvest the grain seeds, extract the wheat kernel, grind it, and bake it, all before they learned how to grow the plant and select it so that it increased in kernel size. Until fertilization or crop rotation were developed, fields had to be moved regularly or placed near a river whose annual floodings brought new soil. All this was a complicated learning process that took time. Less is known about how and when the rice plant was domesticated, but it was clearly as important in Asia as wheat was in the Middle East and corn in America.

The agricultural revolution accelerated as innovations increased arable land, crop yields, and farmer productivity. Land was cleared by grazing or fire. Soil was prepared by digging first, and then plowing. Irrigation insured adequate water. Fertilization and crop rotation increased yields. Specific tools like the sickle, scythe, plow, and hoe increased farmer efficiency.

'''Domestication of animals'''

Dogs were domesticated from wolves perhaps 15,000 years ago in both America and the Near East, but dogs were useful mainly as companions, guards, and hunting aids. The first domesticated food producing animal was probably the goat, a source of meat, milk, and waterproof hides. This breakthrough occurred in the hills of modern Iraq. Domestication of the goat was followed by sheep (meat and wool), cattle (meat, milk, hides, power), horses (meat, milk, transport), pigs (meat and fat), chickens (meat and eggs), and others.

Cattle are considered the most significant domestication. In addition to providing meat, milk, and hides, they were also valuable as beasts of burden. They pulled wagons, greatly improving land transport. They pulled ploughs, greatly improving agriculture. The existence of domesticated cattle is thought to have been primarily responsible for the doubling of population in the Near East between 4000 and 5000 BC.

The process of domestication must have been to obtain young animals, raise them in captivity over enough generations so that they grew less wild and more tolerant of being managed. It is unclear why some animals could be domesticated but not others. Why the cow but not the buffalo? Predators would be unlikely choices for domestication, but the wolf was a predator and so was the cat, which was domesticated much later.

Domestication of animals brought many important advantages. They were dependable sources of meat. Cattle and goats converted grass, of little use to humans, into milk and milk products like cheese. Vast grasslands that could previously support only a few hunters could now support much larger populations of herders. Sheep and vicuñas produced wool each year. Animals could graze on broken lands of little use for farming.

Horses, oxen, llamas, and other animals provided power for pulling, ploughing, and carrying. Military uses were eventually found for onagers, asses, and horses, and to some extent, elephants, although elephants are not considered domesticated. The horse was domesticated first in the north Asian steppes and its use spread from there, probably in the wake of Asian migrations to the south and west. Paleontologists believe the horse evolved in the Americas actually, but went extinct there, perhaps due to hunting pressure.

Mounted Asian barbarians are thought to have overrun the first towns rising in Asia Minor and the Middle East around 6000 BC. The people that were overrun may not have seen a domestic horse previously, much less one on which a warrior could ride.

And speaking of the first towns...

'''Birth of Cities'''

People have always lived in groups; all the way back to primitive fish struggling in the ocean, all our ancestors have lived in some form of community. However, it isn't until around 6000 BC that humans began to settle down in clustered permanent structures to till the land more efficiently; the first cities.

The earliest towns were founded in places where several of many different factors came together to create a favorable spot. Many towns had rivers that ran through or nearby them, providing them a place to gather drinking water from and dump their waste; most had naturally rich soil, promoting intensive farming and allowing a surplus of goods to support non-farmers; some had flat pastures, good for raising a wide variety of animals; a few had valuable resources in the earth nearby, such as valuable metal ores (especially copper, for the first cities), gems, or some other valuabe material; and several were conveniently located between other towns, serving as a welcome stop for trade caravans and growing rich off of the cash they spent.

      <comment>/* How many senses are there? */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Sensation and perception are related but different concepts. '''Sensation''' is the input about the physical world that is produced by our sensory receptors.  '''Perception''' is the process by which the mind selects, organizes, and interprets sensations.  Our eyes see, our ears hear, our hands touch--or do they?  Without interpretation, there is no point to sensation.

==How many senses are there?==
If you asked the person on the street how many senses there were, it is almost certain that you would hear &quot;Five: sight, hear, taste, smell, and touch.&quot;  This is the classical concept of human senses.  However, researchers have identified two more:
* '''Kinesthesia''', which is the sense of position of the parts of the body
* '''Vestibular senses''', which detect gravity, linear acceleration, rotary acceleration, and overall provide balance

Taste and smell are related, and both use receptors located in the mouth and other tissues that line other cavities.

The sense of touch is actually a group of subsenses, which could be better-called the '''somatic senses''' (somatic means &quot;body&quot;). These subsenses include:
* Mechanoreception, which is the perception of pressure or vibration on the skin
* Thermoreception, which is the perception of heat
* Nociception, which is the perception of pain.

==Sensory receptors==
'''Sensory receptors''' are cells that are specialized for the task of ''transduction'', or converting physical energy into neural impulses. There are many different types of sensory receptors, such as:
* Rods and cones in the retina, which transduce light. 
* Cilla in the ear, which transduce sound
* Pressure, vibration, heat, and pain receptors in the skin
* Chemical receptors in the nasal cavities and mouth
* Muscle spindles

==Gestalt Effect==
People have a tendency to see information and sensory images in tiny pieces.  As pieces are sensed they form a larger pattern or picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Saturn's Moon Tethys as seen from Voyager 2.jpg|right|220px|Tethys from Voyager 2]]
Tethys is a moon of Saturn.

==How big is Tethys?==
Tethys is about 1060 km wide.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Tethys has many craters, as well as faults caused by cracks on its icy surface.

There are two types of terrain on the surface. One is made of heavily cratered regions, and the other is made of a dark coloured, lightly cratered belt that extends across the surface of the moon. The light cratering of the region indicates that Tethys was once internally active, causing older terrain to resurface. The cause of the terrain's dark colour is unknown, but recent images of Ganymede and Callisto from the orbiter ''Galileo'' suggest that Tethys' surface might have been formed in a similar manner as these two moons, consisting of  hazy polar caps of unresolved bright ice patches with a darker zone in between.

The largest crater on Tethys is called Odysseus. It is over 400 km wide, almost 2/5 of Tethys' surface! It is quite flat, due to the movement of Tethys' icy crust.

Another interesting feature of Tethys' surface is the Ithaca Chasma. It measures 100 km wide and 3 to 5 km deep. It runs 2000 km long, about 3/4 of the way around Tethys' '''circumference'''. Thwre are two theories as to how it formed. The first is that as Tethys' internal water solidified, the moon expanded and the surface cracked to accommodate the extra '''volume'''. The other theory is that as impact that created the crater Odysseus caused shockwaves that travelled through Tethys and cracked the ice on the other side.

==How long is a day on Tethys?==
One day on Tethys is equal to 1.89 Earth days, or just over 1 day and 21 hours. It takes the same amount of time to finish a single orbit around Saturn. This means that the same side of the moon is always facing toward Saturn

==What is it made of?==
Thethys is almost completely made of water-ice.

==Who is it named after?==
After they were discovered, Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus were named ''Sidera Lodoicea'' (&quot;the stars of Louis&quot;) to honour king Louis XIV. Astromomeers used to call them and Titan as ''Saturn I'' through ''Saturn V''. (Tethys being ''Saturn III''). Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered, in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended to ''Saturn VII''.

The name Tethys was suggested by John Herschel, son of astromomer William Herschel. In 1847, he published ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'', in which he suggested the names the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Cronos (the Greek Saturn), be used.

In Greek mythology, Tethys was a Titaness and sea goddess who was both sister and wife of Oceanus. She was mother of the main rivers of the universe, such as the Nile, the Alpheus, the Maeander, and about three thousand daughters called the Oceanids.

==How was it discovered?==
Tethys was discovered by Giovanni Cassini on March 21, 1684.

== Overview ==

'''''Harry James Potter''''' is the primary character in the book series by J.K. Rowling. Both Harry's parents were magical. His father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]], was the only child born to a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|pure-blood]] wizard family, while his mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]], was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|muggle-born]], meaning both her parents were non-magical. That makes Harry a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Half-blood|half-blood]] wizard. When Harry was one year and three months old, the evil [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] murdered his parents. When Voldemort cast a deadly curse at baby Harry, it rebounded, ripping Voldemort's soul from his body while leaving the infant unscathed except for a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

Harry spent the next ten years living with his neglectful relatives, the Dursleys. On his eleventh birthday, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], the gamekeeper at the magical [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], delivered a letter of invitation to attend the school. Now Harry spends most of the year at Hogwarts with his two best friends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]. Each summer he returns to the Dursleys', an enforced confinement he must endure until he becomes of age at 17-years-old.

Harry's birthday, according to the author, is July 31, with internal evidence giving the year as 1980. This makes him almost a year younger than Hermione, and five months younger than Ron.

Harry's wand is holly with a Phoenix feather core. Holly is believed to repel evil and represents protection, joy, happiness, masculinity, and overcoming anger. Christians believe the holy cross was made from holly. The word holly is derived from &quot;holy&quot;.  A Phoenix is a mythical bird that continually dies by bursting into flames and is then reborn from its own ashes, an act symbolizing resurrection and purity. 

Harry's wand is considered a &quot;brother&quot; to Voldemort's wand. Though they are made from different woods, the Phoenix feather in each came from Fawkes, Albus Dumbledore's animal familiar.

Holly is also part of the Celtic Tree Calendar. Harry's birthday falls within its July 8 - August 4 period, represented by that wood.

=== Etymology === 

The etymology of the character's name is:
* '''Harry''': A diminutive of both Henry and Harold, meaning ''one who has power, a leader or ruler''.
* '''Potter''': A trade/craft name, ''one who makes earthen vessels''.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''Note:''' Harry Potter is the viewpoint character in this series, and thus takes part in nearly all events. Summarizing his role in the books here would, perforce, repeat the book summaries. For a brief overview of Harry's role in the series, it is best to begin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|here]], then proceed to the individual book summaries. The sections below will quickly outline his role.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Harry Potter's parents have just been murdered, and the one-year-old orphan is delivered to his aunt and uncle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Vernon Dursley]], by three wizards, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]]. All three perform magic: Dumbledore quietly extinguishes the streetlamps, McGonagall transforms herself from a cat into a human, and half-giant Hagrid arrives with baby Harry on a flying motorcycle.

Ten years later, we again meet Harry and the Dursleys on cousin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley's]] 11th birthday. Harry's care has been abusive. He is relegated to the cupboard under the stairs whereas Dudley has been given two bedrooms.  Odd things seem to happen around Harry, for which he is often punished, even when he is unable to control it. Harry, though cruelly oppressed, has adapted fairly well to his circumstances. When an owl delivers a letter to Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] forbids him to open it. Soon, hundreds more begin arriving, creating panic in the household. Hagrid appears on Harry's 11th birthday to hand-deliver his acceptance letter to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]&amp;mdash;Harry is a wizard.

Hagrid takes Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], the wizard commerce center hidden within central London, to get school supplies and a wand. For his birthday, Hagrid buys Harry a snowy owl that he names [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]. She becomes his constant companion throughout the series. Harry also learns he is famous. The evil wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], murdered Harry's parents, though he supposedly was killed when his lethal curse rebounded off baby Harry, leaving a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead. Ever since, Harry, the only person known to survive this curse, has been heralded as, &quot;The Boy Who Lived.&quot; 

At King's Cross Station, Harry is left to find his own way to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]] and the Hogwarts Express, the train that transports students to the school. There, Harry meets the Weasleys, a wizarding family, who show him the secret to reaching the platform. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], also 11, becomes Harry's first true friend. On the train, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], a smart but rather bossy first-year girl, introduces herself. Harry and Ron initially dislike her, but they eventually become her close friends.

Harry's first year at Hogwarts is eventful. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] wants to place him in Slytherin House, but Harry rejects this. As a result, the Hat places him in Gryffindor, the same House Ron and Hermione are sorted into. A natural flyer, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team, the youngest Seeker in over a century. At Hogwarts, Harry is guided by the kindly Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' Headmaster, as well as the stern, but fair, Professor McGonagall, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|transfiguration]] instructor and Head of Gryffindor House, and the gentle half-giant, Hagrid. Not everyone supports Harry, however. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] Master [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] instantly dislikes him, and Harry quickly becomes enemies with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], a first-year Slytherin student, after Draco denigrates Muggle-borns such as Hermione, and insults the Weasleys. The Malfoys consider them inferior, even though they are a pure-blooded wizard family. 

While the first book mainly introduces the magical world and its characters, a real quest soon unfolds. Harry suspects that Professor Snape is seeking the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] (known as the Sorceror's Stone in the U.S. editions), a powerful magical object being guarded at Hogwarts. Using the Stone and Dark Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] could possibly resurrect his body. Though Harry believes Snape is Voldemort's accomplice, it is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]. With Ron and Hermione's help, Harry foils Quirrell's plan to steal the Stone for Voldemort.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid promised to write Harry, but when no letters have arrived by mid-summer, Harry's hopes for their lasting friendships appear dashed. One night, Harry is astounded to find a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]] named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] in his bedroom. Dobby warns that it is unsafe for Harry to return to Hogwarts, and admits that he intercepted Harry's letters to trick him into believing his friends no longer cared about him. After Dobby creates a disturbance, Uncle Vernon locks Harry in his bedroom and bars the window. Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] arrive in a flying Ford Anglia and rescue him. Harry happily spends the remaining summer at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], the Weasleys' home. While shopping in Diagon Alley with the Weasleys and Hermione, Harry sees Draco Malfoy and his father at a Dark magic shop, behaving suspiciously.  

At the Hogwarts Welcoming Feast, Dumbledore introduces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructor. Unusual events soon start happening, and Harry begins hearing a strange, disembodied voice. A mysterious bloody message reading, &quot;''The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware,''&quot; appears on a wall, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]]'s cat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]] is found petrified, though still alive. Endless speculation about the Chamber of Secrets and who the Heir might be abounds after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] explains that the Chamber was supposedly created beneath Hogwarts by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] over a thousand years before. Though never found, the Chamber is rumored to house a monster. Suspicion grows that Harry is the Heir, though Harry suspects Draco Malfoy. But as evidence grows against Harry, even he wonders if he is Slytherin's descendant. Tension mounts when students, including Hermione, are Petrified, causing Dumbledore to declare the school is no longer safe. 

Harry and Ron find an old diary once belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]. Though the pages are apparently blank, Harry discovers he can communicate with Riddle's memory stored within the diary. Riddle shows Harry that the Chamber was opened fifty years before, and a student was killed. Hagrid, then a student, was implicated in releasing the monster. Shortly after, Harry's room is ransacked, and the diary is stolen.

A torn-out book page clutched in Hermione's petrified hand suggests the monster is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]], an enormous snake using the plumbing to move throughout the castle. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] is taken into the Chamber, Gilderoy Lockhart is sent to rescue her, however, Lockhart's magical abilities and legendary exploits are a sham. Thwarting his escape attempt, Harry and Ron force him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s bathroom where the Chamber of Secrets' entrance is located; once below, Harry becomes separated from the others and finds Ginny, barely alive in the Chamber. Tom Riddle, who is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], is stealing Ginny's life force to reanimate himself. Releasing the giant Basilisk, he orders it to kill Harry, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]], appears, bearing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]], then blinds the Basilisk. Harry kills the Basilisk with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], which has appeared in the Sorting Hat, and stabs the diary, destroying Riddle's memory and reviving Ginny. Hermione and the other petrified students are cured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]. Harry tricks Dobby's master, Lucius Malfoy, thus freeing the House-elf. Harry suspects it was Lucius who slipped the Diary into Ginny's cauldron while in Diagon Alley, though he lacks proof.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The story unfolds amid a much darker mood as Harry endures yet another dreary summer at the Dursleys. This time he must also suffer [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]], Uncle Vernon's visiting sister, who berates and belittles Harry. The Dursleys neither support or object to her behavior, and it appears they are beginning to fear Harry as he grows older. After Marge makes a few particularly nasty insults about his parents, Harry reacts angrily, inadvertently causing Marge to inflate and float into the air. Harry runs away, catching the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], though he first spies an ominous-looking black dog lurking in the shadows. 

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] intervenes, deflating Aunt Marge and modifying her memory, while Harry is allowed to remain at the Leaky Cauldron until school starts. He is soon joined by the Weasley family and Hermione, who buys a rather strange cat that she names, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]]. It continually attacks Ron's pet rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], infuriating Ron. 

Harry overhears Mr. and Mrs. Weasley discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who escaped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban prison]] with the seeming purpose to murder Harry Potter. Although Mr. Weasley asks Harry not to go looking for Sirius Black, Harry, though confused, is generally unperturbed by these dark events. While en route to Hogwarts, Harry has an unexpected close encounter with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]], an eerie Azkaban guard that is hunting Black, causing him to hear a woman screaming before he faints. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who is riding in Harry's compartment, casts an unknown spell that repels the creature.

At the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, Professor Dumbledore introduces Lupin as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor. He also warns students to avoid the dangerous Dementors that are patrolling Hogwarts and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]] while Black is at large. Hermione, meanwhile, appears to be taking every possible class, even those taught simultaneously, and continually disappears and reappears throughout the day.

After Sirius Black somehow breaks into the castle, Harry learns more about his parents' past and the circumstances surrounding their demise. Twelve years ago, Black, who was James and Lily Potter's best friend, betrayed them to Voldemort and murdered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], another friend. Harry is shocked that Black is his godfather; Harry vows revenge, but during a confrontation with Black and Lupin inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, is exposed as the supposedly-dead Pettigrew. Both Pettigrew and Black are illegal [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]], as was James Potter; Lupin is a werewolf. All four were best friends while at Hogwarts, but it was Pettigrew, not Black, who revealed the Potters' secret location to Lord Voldemort, who then murdered them and attacked Harry. To escape, Pettigrew faked his own death by killing twelve Muggles, framing Sirius Black for the crime. Black, upon learning that Pettigrew was still alive and disguised as Scabbers, escaped Azkaban to kill Pettigrew for revenge. 

After learning the truth, Harry bonds with his new-found godfather and is ecstatic he can leave the Dursleys for good. But Pettigrew, and the truth, quickly slip free, while Sirius is captured by Dementors intending to immediately suck out his soul. Hermione, who has been using a Time Turner to attend multiple classes all year, returns herself and Harry three hours into the past. Retracing their steps, they free Sirius Black, but he becomes a hunted fugitive once again. Harry, sadly, must remain with the Dursleys. Harry's one bright spot: Sirius, as Harry's legal guardian, sends a letter granting Harry permission to visit Hogsmeade Village.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

While Harry is attending the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with the Weasleys and Hermione, hooded figures believed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] rampage through the campground, terrorizing Muggle-born wizards. Voldemort's sign, a skull and snake, hovers in the night sky, though the Ministry discounts his return. 

Returning to Hogwarts, Harry is mysteriously chosen as the fourth Champion in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], an inter-school competition, even though he is underage and never entered his name into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]. In addition to being forced to compete in the grueling contest, Harry is scorned by his fellow students, who believe he cheated to enter, and also Ron, who thinks Harry is vying for attention. Among his peers, only Hermione believes he never entered his own name, and she coaches him for each event. After Harry is nearly killed by a dragon in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]], Ron realizes Harry would not have cheated to enter such a dangerous contest, and the two reconcile. Meanwhile, it is becoming apparent that there may be a plot against Harry.

Harry soon faces an even more difficult challenge&amp;mdash;romance. When he develops a crush on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], a pretty Ravenclaw student, he awkwardly invites her to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], only to learn she is already dating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the other Hogwarts Tournament champion. Harry must cope with his jealousy and disappointment over Cho while struggling with resentment and animosity toward Diggory, even though he knows Cedric is fair and honest. Though competitors, the two boys gradually develop a mutual admiration, and they support and help each other during the Tournament.  

During the final challenge, Harry and Diggory are unexpectedly transported to a graveyard where Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail) instantly murders Cedric. Harry is bound, then forced to witness Lord Voldemort's rebirth in a gruesome ritual using a trace of Harry's blood that nullifies the protective Charm that has safeguarded him from Voldemort. The resurrected Dark Lord engages Harry in a deadly wizards' duel, but Harry, aided by his dead parents' shades that are ejected from Voldemort's wand, escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric's body and announces Voldemort's return. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor &quot;Mad Eye&quot; Moody]], this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, nearly murders Harry, but he is saved by Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall. &quot;Moody&quot; is unmasked as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch, Jr.]], the Dark Lord's faithful servant, who, using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]], disguised himself as &quot;Mad Eye,&quot; then rigged the Tournament to transport Harry to the cemetery. The real Alastor Moody is rescued from a trunk containing a secret compartment. Meanwhile, the Dementors suck out Barty Crouch's soul, making it impossible to verify Harry's story.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

The darkest year yet that Harry has endured in the magical world. After Dementors attack him and cousin Dudley near the Dursleys' home, Harry is secretly escorted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|12 Grimmauld Place]], the new headquarters for the revived &quot;Order of the Phoenix,&quot; an underground resistance movement against Voldemort. An angry Harry is given little information about Voldemort or the Order's plans, causing him to frequently lash out at Ron and Hermione, though they actually know little more than he does. He also has difficulty remaining quiet about the Dark Lord's return, while the Ministry of Magic not only attempts to convict Harry for underage magic, but is also waging a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore, refuting their claims that Voldemort has returned. Consequently, many in the wizarding community doubt Voldemort's resurrection.

Ministry of Magic official and spy, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], is personally appointed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] as Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher, and later High Inquisitor. Umbridge prohibits students from learning defensive spells and works overtime to prevent Hogwarts and the magical world from believing that Voldemort has returned. Students grow rebellious under her ever-growing repressive rule, and Harry forms a secret group called Dumbledore's Army (D.A.) to teach real defensive magic. He also embarks on a romance with Cho Chang, but their differing personalities and her lingering anguish over Cedric Diggory's death soon dooms their relationship. After the D.A. is uncovered, Dumbledore is ousted, and Umbridge assumes full command. The Weasley Twins launch a revolt, causing non-stop mayhem throughout the castle, before spectacularly departing Hogwarts for good on their broomsticks. The teachers do little, if anything, to help Umbridge restore order, who is finally tricked by Hermione and carried off by angry centaurs. 

Through an unknown telepathic connection, Voldemort, seeking a prophecy pertaining to him and Harry that is stored inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], lures Harry into a trap. In a climatic battle, Harry watches in horror as Bellatrix Lestrange murders his godfather, Sirius Black; Harry confronts Voldemort once again, and, this time, Minister of Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] arrives in time to see the Dark Lord before he escapes. Fudge is now forced to publicly acknowledge Voldemort's return. Dumbledore, reinstated as headmaster, reveals more to Harry about Harry and Voldemort's connection.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry's dashed hope to become an Auror is revived when Horace Slughorn joins Hogwarts as the new Potions master. Harry's O.W.L. grades were too low for Professor Snape's advanced Potions class, a required step to becoming an Auror, but Slughorn accepts students with lower scores. Meanwhile, Snape has assumed the Defense Against the Dark Arts post. Harry seemingly excels in potions under Slughorn's tutelage, but he is actually aided by an old textbook belonging to a gifted former student known only as &quot;The Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Meanwhile, as Voldemort's Death Eaters create mayhem in both the Wizard and Muggle worlds, Harry learns his place in the war against the Dark Lord. Convinced that Draco Malfoy has become a Death Eater, Harry suspects he is involved in some sinister plot, though he is unable to prove anything, and Dumbledore appears unconcerned. Ron and Hermione also discount Harry's suspicions, further frustrating him. Unknown to Harry, however, Snape has made an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother, to aid Draco in a secret task for the Dark Lord.

Harry and Dumbledore begin uncovering Voldemort's past by viewing gathered memories stored in a Pensieve. It is only after Professor Slughorn reluctantly yields a hidden memory that Dumbledore determines Voldemort has sheared off six pieces of his soul to make [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], storing them in various common-place objects, including ones once belonging to the Hogwarts founders. Two Horcruxes (Tom Riddle's diary and a Gaunt family ring) have already been destroyed, and Harry and Dumbledore potentially find a third, Slytherin's locket, hidden in a secret sea cave, though it is a fake. At the conclusion, Harry, the Order of the Phoenix, and Dumbledore's Army battles Voldemort's Death Eaters inside Hogwarts castle. Harry suffers a terrible loss when Dumbledore is killed by Severus Snape, who reveals to Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince before escaping with Draco in tow. Vowing to find and destroy Voldemort and his remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledore's murder, Harry announces he is leaving Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione pledge to accompany him on his quest. Harry ends his and Ginny Weasley's newly-formed relationship, fearing Voldemort will target anyone close to him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to embark on Professor Albus Dumbledore's mission to hunt and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Although Harry was entrusted with a dangerous and seemingly-impossible task, Dumbledore left only a few cryptic clues to aid his quest. He also bequeathed the Trio some unusual objects: a Quidditch Snitch and the Sword of Gryffindor for Harry; to Ron, a Deluminator; and Hermione receives a children's book titled, &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; containing a mysterious, hand-drawn symbol next to a story about three brothers. The Ministry of Magic withholds Gryffindor's Sword, claiming it was never Dumbledore's. Realizing the Sword may be able to destroy Horcruxes, the Trio must find it. Though Ginny Weasley tells Harry she still loves him and will wait, Harry, believing his mission could take years, hopes she will find someone else.

As Voldemort's power and domination grows, Harry races to find the Horcruxes, but his loyalty to the late Headmaster falters after he uncovers dark secrets hidden within Dumbledore's past&amp;mdash;he is not the man Harry believed him to be. The Trio's mission is also potentially jeopardized when Harry becomes fixated on finding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|the Deathly Hallows]], three unique magical artifacts mentioned in Hermione's book. They discover that the Hallows emblem was also adopted by the Dark wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to  Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] who Dumbledore defeated in a duel many years before. Each Hallow's existence is plausible: the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] could be Harry's, while the Elder Wand may be the same one Dumbledore captured from Grindelwald. Only the Resurrection Stone seems dubious to Hermione, though Harry hopes it could resurrect his dead parents. Voldemort, meanwhile, seeks the Elder Wand, certain it is an invincible weapon.

Physically burdened by the difficult quest and plagued by growing doubts, Harry's resolve is further tested after Ron, frustrated with the mission's harsh realities, angrily departs. Hermione, devastated by Ron's desertion but loyal to Harry, remains, however. As Harry's faith in Dumbledore diminishes further, Hermione helps him to look beyond Albus' earlier transgressions and see only the good man he became through his deliberate choices and actions. Ron rejoins the group in time to save Harry's life and find the Sword of Gryffindor, destroy the Locket Horcrux with it. 

Harry also seeks revenge against his hated nemesis, Severus Snape, though Snape, like Dumbledore, is also something other than what he appeared to be. Even though Dumbledore is dead, and Harry now questions what Albus' true motives were, an unknown person or persons appears to be guiding the Trio. Now Harry must decide whether he can place his trust into blind faith.

Voldemort's Horcruxes are eventually found and destroyed, but a climatic battle at Hogwarts between the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix and their allies culminates in a final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. Only Harry survives.

=== Later life ===
In a post on her web site, the author has said that at the end of the Second Wizarding War, Harry became an Auror at the Ministry of Magic. In 2007, Harry became the youngest head of the Auror Office at the age of 27. He also married Ginny Weasley and had three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna.

== Strengths ==

''&quot;You are talented, famous and powerful &amp;ndash; everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel.&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Professor Dumbledore to Harry Potter 

Harry is a very clever and powerful wizard. He is most talented in Defence Against the Dark Arts and was one of only twelve students able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level Potions in his sixth-year class. He was also able to cast a corporeal Patronus in his third year a very advanced piece of magic many adult witches and wizards can't perform. Aside from his strong magical skills, Harry is extremely noble and brave, and will do almost anything to protect his friends. Throughout the series he is put into many stressful and dangerous situations, usually keeping a clear head throughout. He is very resilient, remaining strong despite having gone through a tremendous amount of suffering.  He is prone to react emotionally in certain situations, and, as a result, often acts impulsively.  However, he will listen to his friends' more logical and calm advice, particularly Ron and Hermione's, though sometimes reluctantly. Harry has a strong sense of good and evil, and he stands up for what he believes is right. Despite his difficult upbringing and the many hardships he has endured, Harry is remarkably compassionate and good-natured. He is loyal to his friends, and will do practically anything to protect or help them, just as they do for him.

''“I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased.”''
&amp;mdash;Professor McGonagall talking about Harry’s Transfiguration O.W.L 

Although Harry is a true Gryffindor, a House known for bravery and nobility, he shares many traits common to Slytherin and unrelated to Voldemort's soul shard within him. These include cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and a disregard for rules. This is almost certainly part of why the Sorting Hat considered placing him in Slytherin, though it was Harry's desire to be sorted into some other House that resulted in the Hat choosing Gryffindor. A commonly discussed strength, particularly by Albus Dumbledore, is Harry's ability to love, as well as his extremely pure heart. 

''&quot;Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue; resourcefulness; determination; a certain disregard for the rules [...]&quot;'' &amp;mdash; Professor Dumbledore to Harry Potter

Harry excels at flying, either on a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomstick]] or astride magical airborne creatures such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriffs]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]]. This skill translates into a talent for Quidditch, making him the youngest Seeker at Hogwarts in a century. During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], his flying ability is compared favourably to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], then considered the world's best Seeker. In his sixth year, Harry becomes Gryffindor's Quidditch captain.

== Weaknesses ==

Harry is known to &quot;wear his heart on his sleeve.&quot; On many occasions he is unable to hide or control his emotions, especially anger and rage. Among other factors, this makes it difficult for him to master Occlumency. He tends to tackle most situations and problems alone, often rushing in a linear, head-on manner before considering all options and finalizing a strategy. He sometimes finds it difficult to trust others; he generally confides solely to his best friends.  His designation as, &quot;The Boy Who Lived,&quot; and later, &quot;The Chosen One,&quot; makes him feel pressured and unable to live up to the expectations of the Wizarding World.  His desire to prove himself may have helped create a need to be ''the hero.''  This trait has caused him to behave somewhat foolishly, as he did in the Triwizard Tournament's second task (in Goblet of Fire) when he &quot;rescued&quot; the underwater hostages, despite them never being in any danger. This tendency takes a more deadly turn when Voldemort exploits Harry's predictable nature to lure him into an ambush, resulting in Sirius Black's death. 

Though an intelligent and  powerful wizard-in-training, Harry can be academically lazy, usually receiving slightly above average marks in his studies, although he did study reasonably hard for his OWLs and received good results. He achieved &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; in most subjects in which he shows aptitude in, and advanced to NEWT-level in most. One exception is Defence Against the Dark Arts, in which he achieved an &quot;Outstanding,&quot; surpassing even Hermione, which stands as a testament to his extraordinary talent in defensive magic. His Potions ability is apparently better than it appears, as he is able to achieve an &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; grade on his OWL exam; in his sixth year he improves greatly, after finding an old potions textbook in which a talented former student (later revealed to be Severus Snape) has revised many potion-making techniques, and also invented many jinxes and spells.

Harry is noted to have low self-confidence, especially in the first book, where he expresses serious doubt that he could possibly be a wizard. He also worries that he wouldn't fit in, being the &quot;worst in his class.&quot; This lack of self-confidence does reappear, though to a lesser extent, in each successive book, most notably in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', where he's worried that he's not worthy to be in Gryffindor, and in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', when he resists Hermione and Ron's suggestion that he teach Defence Against the Dark Arts, believing he is unqualified. Harry also struggles with a guilt complex; he often blames himself for things out of his control.  For instance, he blames himself for endangering his friends, allowing Pettigrew to escape, and both Cedric's and Sirius's deaths.

While dating Ginny Weasley, Harry fell deeply in love with her, creating her as his &quot;greatest weakness&quot;, as Harry would protect her at the cost of his own life or quest. But by the same token, Ginny could be considered his &quot;greatest strength&quot; as he was fighting for her against Voldemort.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Orphaned as an infant, Harry lacks a true family. The Dursleys, his only blood relations, disdain him, treating him so cruelly that Harry could be expected to cut off contact with them once he is of age. Cousin Dudley does show some remorse over how he bullied Harry and wishes him well when they part company, presumably for the last time, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 3|the final book of the series]]. Rather than family, Harry instead develops close relationships with his Hogwarts school friends, most importantly, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], and later, Ginny Weasley, as well as the entire Weasley clan.

=== Family ===

'''Dudley Dursley'''

Ever since infancy, Harry and Dudley have disliked each other. Dudley commonly bullies Harry and is very shocked when his overlooked cousin turns out to be a wizard. Harry threatens Dudley with his new abilities after the first year of Hogwarts is over, despite being forbidden to actually use magic outside of the school. While he never consciously carries through on any threat to use magic, awareness of Harry's having the ability to perform magic causes Dudley to treat Harry with some reserve. As Harry's power, and thus his self confidence, increases, Dudley's physical fitness and characteristic bullying behavior also increase, and they remain fairly evenly matched so long as Harry remains unable to use magic. The appearance of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] is something of a watershed moment for the relationship, as Dudley seems to recognize that Harry is able to protect him when his muscles are useless. This is further reinforced by Dumbledore's visit in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when Dumbledore points out how the Dursleys have mistreated their own son. Events at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] lead us to understand that Dudley has been trying to resolve matters, but Harry's suspicion of Dudley's motive prevents Harry, and the reader, from recognizing that until immediately before Dudley's final departure from the story.

 
'''James and Lily Potter'''

Harry's parents, James and Lily, who are long-dead, still play an important role in his development as he learns much about them from their close friends and allies. Harry loves his father, but his idolized image of the man he never knew becomes blemished after he unintentionally observes Snape's memories in a Pensieve that shows James' youthful behavior as being less than exemplary, and so unlike Harry's at the same age. Though deeply disappointed, Harry, with others' help, eventually is able to overcome his tarnished impressions about his father, seeing only the good man James chose to become. Though Harry has mostly identified with his father, he comes to understand his mother's influence on him as well, and that his own nature is much more akin to Lily's than to James. Harry has several brief encounters with James and Lily's spirits, who not only protect him (in ''Goblet of Fire'' and ''Deathly Hallows''), but also express how much they love and admire their son.


=== The Trio ===

'''Ron Weasley'''
 
Harry and Ron become best friends after meeting aboard the Hogwarts Express during their first year. Harry becomes so close to Ron and the other Weasleys that he is practically adopted into the family. Molly Weasley comes to love him as a son. Ron often educates the Muggle-raised Harry about the wizard world, while Harry shares much about Muggle life. Harry, unfazed by his own celebrity, notes that it occasionally makes Ron jealous, straining their relationship. Harry's wealth is a stark contrast to Ron's poverty, and this also creates conflict, for Ron at least, who envies Harry's ability to afford anything, though Harry rarely desires material goods and would gladly trade his fortune to be reunited with his parents. During their mission to hunt Voldemort's Horcruxes, Ron becomes frustrated and angry with Harry's seeming indecisiveness, as well as the difficulties of the quest.  As a result, he briefly leaves the group. He returns in time to save Harry, and never again deserts his friend. Their bond is permanently and formally cemented when Harry marries Ginny Weasley, making Ron his brother-in-law.


'''Hermione Granger'''

Hermione not only becomes Harry's other closest friend, but she rounds out &quot;the Trio&quot;, playing an integral part, along with Ron, in Harry's fight against Voldemort. Initially, she is unequal to Ron in Harry's eyes, and both Harry and Ron, upon meeting her, find her annoying and bossy. This quickly changes after she protects them from being wrongly punished, eventually earning her as crucial a role as Ron. Unlike him, however, her trust and faith in Harry never wavers. His faith in her, however, falters after Hermione, who usually turns a blind eye to his and Ron's irregular activities, reports to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] that Harry received an anonymous gift, an expensive racing broom, that could be cursed. Furious, Harry and Ron childishly shun her for months, deeply hurting Hermione, though the rift is eventually healed. In many ways, Hermione and Harry have more in common than Harry has with Ron, both coming from a Muggle background, though Hermione's upbringing has been loving and stable, unlike Harry's. Both she and Harry are an only-child, and this bonds them in ways unlike Harry's relationship with Ron, who has many siblings. Hermione becomes like the sister Harry never had, and vice versa, and their later marrying into the same family further cements this relationship. Hermione is about the only student in book 4 who believes Harry never cheated to enter the Triwizard Tournament, even though Ron initially thinks he did. She also understands Harry's nature better than just about anyone, including Ron, who is slower to mature than either her or Harry, and has far less insight into peoples' feelings. Both Harry and Hermione marry into the same family, further bonding their relationship.


=== Teachers and other adults ===

'''Albus Dumbledore'''

Harry also maintains a close relationship with several adults, including Professor Albus Dumbledore, who is a kindly, though rather eccentric mentor during Harry's Hogwarts' years. Dumbledore, knowing that only Harry can defeat Voldemort, spends much time grooming him for his fateful encounter with the Dark Lord, though Dumbledore withholds crucial information, including that only Harry's death can destroy the Horcrux he unknowingly carries within him. Dumbledore realizes later, however, that by having utilized Harry's blood to resurrect his body, Voldemort has unwittingly provided Harry the protection he needs to survive. Dumbledore also recognized Harry's weaknesses and his need to &quot;go it alone&quot;, and strongly encouraged him to always confide in Ron and Hermione and seek their advice. Harry is devastated by Dumbledore's tragic death in book 6, though he later comes to doubt Dumbledore's true intentions and his mission when unsavory incidents in Dumbledore's past are revealed. However, Harry's bitter disappointment in the late headmaster prevents him from seeing that, unlike Gellert Grindelwald, Dumbledore's youthful foray into magic's Darker side was little more than a brief flirtation filled with idle theories and never-applied beliefs that were ultimately rejected. As with his father, Harry finally understands that it was Dumbledore's deliberate choices in life that made him the great man he truly became.


'''Rubeus Hagrid'''

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is also important to Harry, and, like Sirius Black, he considers him as his true family. Though the gentle giant can be rather naive, unsophisticated, and sometimes lacks insight into other characters and their motives, he always helps guide Harry as he matures and will do anything to protect him. It is often Hagrid's opinion that most affects Harry. Hagrid remains a towering source of strength and protection for Harry throughout the series, and beyond.


'''Sirius Black'''

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], Harry's godfather, also assumes an important mentor role and becomes his true family, though their short-lived relationship tragically ends when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] murders Sirius in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Sirius was a loving and caring godfather, but his long incarceration in Azkaban prison for a crime he never committed stunted his emotional development, making him a sometimes less-than-ideal guardian, treating Harry more as a replacement for his lost friend, James Potter, than as his ward. Hermione points out Sirius' rather reckless behavior to Harry, who, because he loves his godfather unconditionally, is blinded, initially, to Sirius' shortcomings. Harry eventually recognized these faults, but knows that his beloved godfather loved him in return and would have done anything to protect and provide for him; his death devastates Harry, leaving yet another huge void in his life.

=== Other Students ===

'''Cho Chang'''
 
A romance blossoms between Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], a pretty Ravenclaw, though she is still grieving Cedric Diggory, who was murdered at the end of book 4. Her fragile emotions become more than Harry can understand or handle, however, and the doomed relationship cools quickly, though without lasting acrimony.


'''Ginny Weasley'''

Later, Harry falls in love with Ginny Weasley, who the author describes as Harry's &quot;ideal woman.&quot; Ginny had been in love with Harry for some time, though he always considered her as only a friend and Ron's kid sister. As she blossoms into a pretty young woman, Harry begins seeing her differently and becomes jealous when she has other relationships; he fears his chance with her has been lost forever. But Ginny had never stopped loving Harry, and they finally unite in book 6. But their new-found happiness quickly ends, when, to protect Ginny, Harry terminates their relationship as he embarks on Dumbledore's dangerous quest to defeat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], a mission that could last years. Ginny is left heartbroken, and Harry imagines that she may eventually find someone else, though it was extremely unlikely Ginny would ever have even considered being with another man. After the Dark Lord's demise, Harry and Ginny are reunited, eventually marrying and having three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. 


'''Hogwarts Friends'''

Harry also becomes good friends with his other fellow Gryffindor housemates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], who also become strong allies against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, though some may initially doubt him. Having lost their parents to Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry and Neville grow closer throughout the series. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], a rather odd Ravenclaw girl, also becomes a friend and ally, risking her life to help Harry during the Battle at the Ministry in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Harry will come to regard her so highly, that he names his daughter, Lily Luna. Harry also is befriended by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], a Hufflepuff student, a fellow Triwizard Tournament champion, and also his romantic rival after Harry develops a crush on Cho Chang. When students, including Ron, believe Harry cheated to enter the tournament, Cedric supports him. The two aid each other during the Tournament, but Cedric tragically dies when Voldemort orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] (Wormtail) to murder him, as Harry helplessly watches. It is Cedric's murder that enables Harry to see Thestrals, magical creatures visible only to those who have witnessed death.

=== Antagonists ===


'''Draco Malfoy'''
 
Not everyone at Hogwarts is Harry's friend, and many Slytherins despise him. Chief among them is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who becomes Harry's main Hogwarts nemesis. Draco's ever-present minions, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], help him devise new ways to torment and undermine Harry. The Malfoy family are pure-blood wizards and loyal Lord Voldemort supporters, and Draco's and Harry's antagonistic relationship has partially been fueled by the elitist ideology droned into Draco since birth. Though Draco detests Harry and remains loyal to his own family, he never fully embraces his parents' evil, warped beliefs. His deliberate actions at Malfoy Manor in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' protect Harry, who later twice saves Draco's life during the Battle at Hogwarts, even though Draco was apparently attempting to capture him. The two never become friends, instead maintaining a distant, respectful truce in their adult lives.


'''Severus Snape'''

Most Hogwarts teachers like Harry, but he endures an ongoing contentious relationship with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Severus Snape]], Slytherin's House Head and Harry's potions instructor. Snape seemingly despises Harry for his fame, which often results in unfair treatment toward Harry, but Snape actually has a long-held and deep-seated grudge against Harry's father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], who was Snape's bitter antagonist, and, along with Sirius Black, bullied Snape during their Hogwarts school years. Harry's intense dislike for his potions master becomes full-fledged hate and rage when it appears Snape has murdered Dumbledore and re-joined Lord Voldemort at the end of book 6. Despite Snape's ongoing animosity toward Harry and his supposed treachery, he, unknown to Harry at the time, has always acted as Harry's protector, partly motivated by his deep love for Harry's late mother, Lily. Harry must eventually reconcile his antagonistic feelings for his belligerent potions master and secret ally, who, unknown to Harry at the time, is also the &quot;Half-Blood Prince.&quot; Harry had come into possession of the Prince's old potions textbook that contained many revised formulas, as well as new spells, jinxes, and curses handwritten into the book's margins. Within a short period, Harry was inspired by the Prince to learn more about the subject than in all his previous years inside Snape's classroom. After learning the truth about Snape and what he did for him, Harry names his second child, Albus Severus, as a tribute to his fallen potions master, who, he later tells his son, was one of the bravest men he ever knew.


'''Lord Voldemort'''
  
Without doubt, Lord Voldemort has been Harry's most formidable enemy. Voldemort, likewise, considered Harry his most dangerous foe, and became consumed with killing him. Even before Harry's birth, Voldemort feared him, believing in a prophecy foretelling that a boy, soon to be born, was destined to destroy him. When Voldemort made his first attempt to murder the infant, he forever bound himself to Harry by unintentionally attaching a small soul fragment to him, giving Harry similar abilities to Voldemort. This bond, again unintentionally, became even stronger after Voldemort used drops of Harry's blood to resurrect his own body.    &lt;!-- Still more to come. --&gt;

== Analysis ==

Harry's character is the classic literary protagonist known as the &quot;epic hero&quot;. Other such heroes are Hercules, Ulysses, Beowulf, and others seen in mythology, fables, and legends. The epic hero is typically mortal, but often is related or otherwise connected to gods or other divine immortal beings. In Harry's case, his parents were powerful wizards and he may be directly descended from the Peverells, an ancient wizard dynasty connected to the three Deathly Hallows (the Elder wand, a Resurrection Stone, and Harry's Invisibility Cloak). The hero typically possesses no extraordinary powers, but tends to be more talented, courageous, and resourceful than his peers. Traditionally, the hero is charged with a seemingly impossible quest or task that tests his endurance and moral fibre and that saves or benefits others, not himself. He must rely on his own courage, morality, intelligence, and strength to succeed. Though Harry has magical abilities, it does not set him apart from his contemporaries or his foes, who are also wizards. Harry must draw upon his superior bravery, strength, and cleverness, as well as seek help from others, to successfully accomplish Dumbledore's task to destroy Lord Voldemort and his remaining Horcruxes.  

Because the books are mainly told from Harry's perspective, more is known about him than any other character. At best, Harry's treatment by the Dursleys was neglectful. Due to his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley's constant insults and taunts, Harry is somewhat shy, insecure, and has low self-esteem, though he survived the experience with overall good humor. While his parents overindulgence has turned Dudley into a cruel, egotistical bully, Harry's mistreatment seems to have had the opposite effect; he is inherently kind and compassionate to others and has a strong moral center. When Hagrid told Harry he was a wizard, he continually believed it must be a mistake.

Harry has always distrusted his fame and those who may gravitate to him solely to exploit it. He also shuns publicity, though later in the series he utilizes it, unwelcome as it is, to help achieve his objectives. Because Harry has suffered more traumatic events than most, he often feels misunderstood. Some Hogwarts students often ask him about his experiences, wanting to know exciting details, but Harry believes that most have little interest in the reasoning behind it. Throughout later books, Harry increasingly grows irritable, partially from a difficult puberty, but also from being publicly called a liar and constantly prodded for information about Lord Voldemort. Harry's fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts test his patience but also strengthen his bonds with Ron and Hermione, and also Headmaster Dumbledore.

It has been noted numerous times that while Harry bears a strong resemblance to his father, he has the almond shaped green eyes of his mother. 
[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-bostonglobe-loer.html The author has stated] that this is an important fact; it helped to convince [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Horace Slughorn]] to hand over a memory about Tom Riddle to Harry that Dumbledore needed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]. There are [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-cbbc-mzimba.htm indications in other sources] that more is revealed about Harry's eyes in the later books. In fact, this particular physical resemblance to his mother plays an important role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Since Lord Voldemort's return, Harry has been confused on where his life may be headed. Nearly everywhere he goes, some aspect of the Dark Lord and the raging wizard war greets him. Harry's life has been filled with much turmoil and tragic deaths, especially during his fifth and sixth years at Hogwarts. Harry has lost friends, mentors, and family, all amidst the ongoing war's confusion. In many cases, Harry is unsure what to do, where to go, or who he will lose next.

As his sixth year ends, Harry draws many conclusions regarding his future. He knows he must complete what was so innocently started with Lord Voldemort many years before and solve the many mysteries regarding the Dark Lord's power. Either he or Voldemort must defeat the other, just as the prophecy foretold. In ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry is about to embark on a mission that is truly more important than his previous years' accomplishments. As his school years are about to end, if he even returns for his seventh year, Harry will hopefully be able to answer the question: how truly strong is, &quot;The Boy Who Lived&quot;?

According to the author, following Voldemort's defeat, Harry becomes an Auror at age 17 under Kingsley Shacklebolt. He later heads the Auror department in 2007. Note that if Harry did become an Auror in 1998, it must have been within three months of when Voldemort died; therefore, Harry can have had at most three months of school before entering specialized Auror training. Along with his other accomplishments, this may make Harry the first Auror in centuries to have been accepted without taking (and passing) NEWTs.

=== Similarities between Harry and Tom Riddle ===

When reading all seven books, one comes to notice Harry and Tom's similarities:

* Both were &quot;abandoned&quot; at a very young age, too young to properly remember their parents.
* Riddle, the future Lord Voldemort, never knew his mother. He did meet his father, but only sought him out for revenge, killing him. Harry only vaguely remembers both his parents, being too young when they were killed to remember anything more than vague images and fleeting feelings. However, he has been able to connect with them through objects once belonging to his father, such as the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map, his mother's letter, old photographs, and also his parents' friends. He will also meet their spirits.
* Both boys wore second-hand clothes: Harry was given his repulsive cousin Dudley's enormous cast offs, and Tom wore tatty hand-me-downs supplied by the orphanage.
* Both were friendless as children. Harry was kept isolated and denied a normal social life by his aunt and uncle, while Tom expressed his bitterness and loneliness by tormenting the other orphans, frightening them away.
* Both are Parselmouths (wizards who have the ability to speak to snakes). This is less coincidental than it might seem, for Voldemort actually transferred this ability to Harry when attacking him.
* The Sorting Hat almost placed Harry into Slytherin, though Harry asked to be placed in some other House.
* Both boys had followers. Tom gathered them through fear, intimidation, and tenuous promises, while many students gravitated to Harry out of loyalty and a shared cause, but also curiosity and an attraction to his fame.
* They also, as shown in Book One, have brother wands, each wand containing a tail feather from the same phoenix, that is later revealed to be Fawkes, Dumbledore's animal familiar.
* Both boys were unaware they were wizards until about the age of eleven, even though each could make unusual things happen.
* Both Harry and Tom were of great interest to Dumbledore, and both felt their first home was Hogwarts.
* Both achieved greatness in the Defense Against the Dark Arts, however, each for different reasons.
* Both were only-children.
* Both are half-bloods, though that only matters to Tom Riddle. (Note that while both of Harry's parents were magical, Harry's mother was Muggle-born, which by the &quot;pure-blood&quot; definitions makes Harry still a half-blood.)
* Both are rule breakers. Harry, of course, feels justified when he does things like leaving his dorm after hours, entering the Forbidden Forest, and eavesdropping on teachers because he believes it serves a greater purpose. Tom may have engaged in similar activities, but for darker and self-serving reasons, and without benefit of an Invisibility Cloak like Harry; while at school, Tom framed Hagrid for a girl's death, then went on to worse crimes.

There are also differences:

* At his initial Sorting, Harry requested he not be placed in Slytherin. It is unlikely Tom Riddle would have made a similar request, even if he was unaware what his ancestry was.
* Voldemort never has friends, only followers who fear him or hope to gain some reward or advantage. Harry makes many friends: his dorm mates, the Weasley family, and many teachers, especially Hagrid, Remus Lupin, and (the real) Mad-Eye Moody. They support Harry because they share a common belief.
* While both were nominally half-blood, Harry's mother, a witch, was Muggle-born, whereas Lord Voldemort's ''father'' was a Muggle, and incidentally, so was Snape's, which is why he called himself the Half-Blood Prince.
* Harry cares about the people around him, even pitying Draco Malfoy by Book Six. Harry has the ability to love and be compassionate, making him more vulnerable to suffering pain, but also capable of experiencing deep friendship and loyalty that helps guide him to greatness. For Voldemort, love, fidelity, or compassion are unknown and unwelcome concepts.

== Overview ==

'''''Ronald &quot;Ron&quot; Bilius Weasley''''' is the youngest among six brothers and has one younger sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny_Weasley|Ginny]]. Ron comes from a poor but well-respected Wizarding family. The large, close-knit clan is known mostly for their red hair and odd activities. Ron's father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], works for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and has a rather unusual interest in Muggles and Muggle possessions. Ron is looked down upon by some students (mostly Slytherins) for his family's meager finances and their friendliness towards Muggles. In times of need, Ron can count on his two best friends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]].

Ron's birthday is March 1, 1980, according to the author. He turned eleven the year before he started at Hogwarts, making him five months older than Harry and six months younger than Hermione.

Ron has two wands during the series. The first, his brother Charlie's hand-me-down, is ash and Unicorn hair. His second wand, the one that presumably &quot;chose&quot; him, is willow and Unicorn hair. Willow is associated with gaining knowledge, personal growth, healing, and repulsing evil. It can also represent death and mourning. Unicorns symbolize purity, virtue, and strength of mind and body. Though wands typically perform less efficiently for a wizard who was neither &quot;chosen&quot; nor captured it, a wand given to close blood kin, in this case, Ron, will apparently offer its loyalty to its new owner. It is never known if the wand performed better for Charlie.

Ron's two wands correspond to the Celtic Tree Calendar, which is divided into thirteen lunar-based periods, each one represented by a different wood. Ron's March 1 birthday falls within the February 18 - March 17 ash cycle. His new willow wand does not reflect his birth date.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''Note:''' Ron Weasley, while not the viewpoint character in this series, is one of the Trio, and thus is in nearly every part of the story. A summary of his role in the books would, perforce, recap the books. For Ron's full role in the series, it is best to begin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|here]], then proceed onwards. The sections below briefly outline his role.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Ron and the Weasley family first appear at King's Cross Station when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], unable to find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]], approaches them for help. The boys share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, but Ron cannot believe this is the famous Harry Potter until Harry shows him his scar. Harry, fascinated with the Wizarding world, and Ron, intrigued by Muggle life, immediately bond over their differing backgrounds.

During the train ride to Hogwarts, visitors continually drop by Harry and Ron's compartment, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], who is searching for his toad, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]] and, later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], a Muggle-born witch. She acts disdainful after Ron's attempted spell fails, then comments that she has already read all the textbooks. 

Another first-year student, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], and his two sidekicks, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] arrive next. Draco suggests that Harry might be well advised to be their friend, implying the Weasleys are inferior, even though they are pure-blooded wizards like the Malfoys. Draco and his cohorts depart, but Hermione returns and bossily suggests that Harry and Ron should change into school robes. Ron later comments that he hopes she is sorted into a House other than Gryffindor. 

At Hogwarts, Ron, Harry, and also Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor. Harry and Ron are by now close friends, though they avoid Hermione. Ron helps Harry adjust to the Wizarding world and always takes his side. Draco Malfoy, who was sorted into Slytherin House, Gryffindor's main rival, is a constant annoyance to both boys. During an altercation between Harry and Draco during their first flying lesson, Ron cheers Harry on. When Malfoy challenges Harry to a Wizard's duel, Ron volunteers to be Harry's second.   

During the Hallowe'en feast, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|Troll]] has broken into the school. Hermione, who earlier overheard Ron's comment that she is overbearing and has no friends, is still sulking in the lavatory. Ron and Harry rush to warn Hermione, only to find that the Troll has trapped her; Harry and Ron together defeat it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] arrives and wants to punish Ron and Harry, but Hermione lies to protect them, claiming that she went looking for the Troll. The three become best friends, though Ron quickly settles into a &quot;second fiddle&quot; role to Harry and Hermione, following their leads and often relying on them for guidance; Ron, in turn, helps Harry and Hermione, both raised as Muggles, learn about and adjust to the Wizarding world. Ron also feels overshadowed by his five accomplished older brothers, and later, by his talented younger sister, Ginny.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] mentions someone named Nicolas Flamel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione connect it to a &quot;mysterious package&quot; that is evidently being guarded by a three-headed dog (named &quot;Fluffy&quot;) on the forbidden third-floor corridor. Hermione finds a reference to Flamel and identifies the &quot;mysterious package&quot; as the Philosopher's Stone. They are convinced that Quirrell must be protecting it from Professor Snape.

Harry resolves to slip past Fluffy and retrieve the Stone before Snape can steal it. As will become typical, Ron and Hermione insist on accompanying him. When the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Devil's Snare|Devil's Snare]] plant traps them, Ron reminds a panicked Hermione that she can conjure fire to release them. He directs the giant wizard chess set to win through the fourth obstacle, though he is injured. Revived by Hermione, he goes to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], while Harry continues on to find the Stone. At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore awards Ron fifty House points for, &quot;the best game of chess that Hogwarts has seen in many years&quot;. As they reach King's Cross Station, Ron and Hermione both promise to write to Harry during the summer holiday; Ron also promises he will invite Harry for a visit.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Ron re-enters the story when he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|his twin brothers, Fred and George]], arrive in a flying Ford Anglia to rescue Harry from the cruel Dursleys, who have forbidden him to return to Hogwarts and locked him into his room. At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] warmly welcoms Harry, while her sons are soundly chastised for taking the car without permission. Harry stays in Ron's room which is decorated with Chudley Cannons posters, Ron's favorite Quidditch team.

At King's Cross Station in London to catch the Hogwarts Express, Ron and Harry are unable to pass through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters. Having missed the train, Ron decides to fly them to Hogwarts in his father's car, where it slams into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]], breaking Ron's wand. After ejecting the two boys and their trunks, the car wildly drives off into the Forbidden Forest. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] gives both boys detention, while Hermione chastises them for their flamboyant arrival, though other Gryffindors are delighted. Mrs. Weasley, however, is outraged and sends Ron a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]], humiliating Ron while amusing the other students, particularly Slytherin House.

Ron's damaged wand is unable to cast spells properly, even after mending it with Spellotape. When Malfoy calls Hermione a &quot;Mudblood&quot;, a derogatory term, Ron casts a jinx at Draco; but the spell backfires and hits Ron instead, causing him to continually vomit slugs. Hermione and Harry take him to Hagrid for help, but Ron is still heaving slugs while doing detention.

Harry hears a disembodied voice inside the castle, and Hermione and Ron tag along as Harry follows it. They find Mrs. Norris, Filch's cat, petrified, but still alive. A bloody message scrawled on the wall warns that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Ron suspects Malfoy could be the Heir of Slytherin, or knows who is. Hermione suggests using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to find out, and spends the next month brewing it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle's]] bathroom. Harry and Ron then disguise themselves as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. They find Draco Malfoy, who, among other things, says the Chamber was opened fifty years before, resulting in a girl's death, though it is unknown who opened it. 

Harry and Ron also find an old diary belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to, Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle|T. M. Riddle]] 50 years before, though its pages are blank; Ron remembers seeing that same name on a school trophy dated 50 years ago, the same time the Chamber was allegedly last opened. Harry discovers he can communicate with the diary, and it shows how Riddle implicated Hagrid in opening the Chamber and releasing the monster, resulting in Hagrid being expelled. 

Harry hears the disembodied voice again, causing Hermione to dash to the library to research something, but she is found petrified before sharing what she learned. Harry and Ron rush to Hagrid's hut to discuss the Chamber of Secrets, but he is arrested by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], while Dumbledore is removed as Headmaster. While being led away, Hagrid cryptically says aloud, &quot;follow the spiders,&quot; as Harry and Ron huddle under Harry's Invisibility Cloak. Ron, suffering from arachnophobia, bravely follows Harry as he trails spiders into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. There they find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]], a giant arachnid who claims he is not the monster in the Chamber and that Hagrid is innocent. Also, a torn-out page found clutched in Hermione's Petrified hand indicates the monster is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] and uses the plumbing to move around the castle. Harry is certain that Moaning Myrtle's bathroom contains the Chamber of Secrets' entrance, and she is the girl who died. 

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] has been taken into the Chamber, Harry and Ron force Professor Gilderoy Lockhart to Myrtle's bathroom after finding him about to flee the school&amp;mdash;the legendary Lockhart is a cowardly fraud. Harry opens the Chamber's entrance by speaking Parseltongue (snake language). Once below, Lockhart grabs Ron's wand and casts a spell, but it backfires and hits Lockhart, obliterating his memory. Ron, trapped with Lockhart on one side of the resulting rock fall, clears debris while Harry finds the Chamber, battles the Basilisk, and destroys Tom Riddle's diary. Harry returns with Ginny. Hermione and the other Petrified victims are revived.

On the train back to London, Hermione and Ron promise to telephone Harry during the summer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

During the summer, Ron attempts to phone Harry at the Dursleys, but he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] get into a shouting match. Ron later sends Harry a birthday gift, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|pocket Sneakoscope]], a magical device that detects nearby foes. Ron claims it is only a cheap one, but it actually will prove to be quite reliable. After Mr. Weasley wins a contest, the Weasleys spend their holiday in Egypt; Ron sends Harry the ''Daily Prophet'' article and photo of the entire family, including Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.

Ron is reunited with Harry and Hermione in Diagon Alley, and the Trio, and the other Weasleys, head off to buy school supplies. In addition to massive quantities of books, Hermione also purchases an unusual ginger-colored cat she names [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]], who promptly attacks Ron's rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]]. Harry, meanwhile, overhears Mr. and Mrs. Weasley discussing Sirius Black, a fugitive wizard who escaped Azkaban and apparently is intent on killing Harry. The Trio soon learn that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], Azkaban's eerie guards, are hunting Black and will also be guarding Harry and Hogwarts.

At Hogwarts, Ron observes that Hermione is taking many classes, including ones taught simultaneously; she also seems to instantaneously appear and disappear throughout the day, though she changes the subject whenever Ron queries her. In Divination class, Ron sees a dog shape in Harry's tea leaves that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] identifies as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grim|Grim]], a death omen. Curiously, Harry has continually seen a black dog lurking in nearby shadows. 

Tension grows between Ron and Hermione after Crookshanks attacks Scabbers, but they patch things up. After Sirius Black breaks into the castle, Hermione wants Harry to turn in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], a magical document showing every person's location inside Hogwarts and secret passageways into the castle. Harry refuses, weakly arguing that Black cannot be using the tunnels. Ron naturally sides with Harry. Soon after, Harry learns that Black betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, then killed their friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and twelve Muggle bystanders. Incredulously, Black is also Harry's godfather. Meanwhile, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] resumes teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts after a brief absence and cancels a Werewolf essay Professor Snape assigned.

When Harry receives an expensive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt]] broom as an anonymous Christmas gift, Hermione reports it to McGonagall, suspecting it may be cursed and was sent by Black. The broom is confiscated for testing, and Ron and Harry, ignoring the real dangers, are furious with Hermione. They shun her until the broom is returned in the spring, but no sooner have the three made-up, however, than Scabbers goes missing, apparently eaten by Crookshanks. Ron is offended by Hermione's seeming insensitivity. She, however, is massively overburdened by her heavy class load and from helping Hagrid defend Buckbeak, a Hippogriff that Draco Malfoy maliciously claims attacked him. The stress has apparently left her unable to express empathy to Ron, though it hardly excuses her behavior, while Ron and Harry have lapsed on their promise to help with Buckbeak's defense, adding to her burden. 

One night, Ron is jolted awake by Sirius Black slashing his bed-curtains with a knife. Ron's screams rouses Gryffindor House, but Black escapes. Though terrified, Ron, who has increasingly felt overshadowed by Harry's celebrity, enjoys the resulting notoriety. He wonders, however, why Black never harmed him or Harry, despite having the opportunity.

Hermione finally apologizes to Ron about Crookshanks, and Ron and Harry promise to help with Buckbeak's defense, though the Hippogriff is later sentenced to death. Despite Hagrid's warning to stay away, the Trio visit him shortly before Buckbeak's execution at sundown. While there, Scabbers, long thought dead, is found, though he frantically tries to escape. The Trio head back to the castle, but Scabbers breaks free. Ron catches him, but a large black dog appears and drags Ron and Scabbers into a secret tunnel under the Whomping Willow, breaking Ron's leg. Harry and Hermione follow the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack where they encounter Sirius Black, an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]. 

Harry, Hermione, and Ron subdue the physically weak and wandless Black. As Harry is about to avenge his parents, Lupin bursts in and disarms them. Lupin saw Black and another person on Harry's confiscated Marauder's Map. Lupin is one of the &quot;Marauders,&quot; and he, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew created the map durng their school years. Believing he is Black's accomplice, Hermione reveals that Lupin is actually a Werewolf. Lupin says Dumbledore knows, and that as a student, Lupin was confined to the Shrieking Shack during his Werewolf transformations. The Whomping Willow guarded the entrance. Lupin's three best friends, Sirius Black, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], and Peter Pettigrew, learning he was a Werewolf, secretly became Animagi to support him. Lupin claims Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, and he betrayed the Potters to Voldemort and framed Sirius. Black recognized Pettigrew as Scabbers in the ''Daily Prophet'' photo, and vowed to kill him, escaping Azkaban in his dog form. 

Lupin, caught in the full moon and, having forgotten his potion, transforms into a Werewolf and runs off. Sirius is captured by Dementors who intend to suck out his soul. Hermione shows Harry a Time Turner she has been using all year to attend her many classes. Leaving Ron behind in the Hospital Wing, they return three hours into the past, freeing both Buckbeak and Black. With Pettigrew's escape, however, Sirius remains a hunted fugitive. 

The final term passes quickly; Lupin resigns his post while Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, and a relieved Ron passes all his subjects, though he remains revolted by his close association with &quot;Scabbers.&quot; Aboard the Hogwarts Express back to London, a tiny owl delivers a message from Sirius Black saying he is safe; the owl is Ron's to keep (to replace his lost &quot;pet&quot;). Ginny names him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]]. As they part company at King's Cross Station, Ron promises that Harry will soon be hearing from him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

The Weasleys invite Harry, and also Hermione, to attend the Quidditch World Cup. While there, Death Eaters rampage through the campground at night, terrorizing Muggle-borns. Voldemort's sign, a skull and snake, is left hovering in the dark sky. A Ministry official believes a Trio member conjured it, but they are quickly exonerated.  

Both Ron and Harry begin experiencing budding sexuality, becoming more seriously attracted to girls; Ron, more immature and socially inexperienced, as usual, relies on Harry to take the lead, though Harry is having his own difficulties after developing a crush on Cho Chang, a pretty Ravenclaw student. She, however, is already dating Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff, who is not only Harry's romantic rival, but is the Hogwarts' Champion in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, a recently revived inter-school competition. 

Ron and Harry's friendship becomes strained after Harry is mysteriously chosen as the fourth Triwizard Champion, even though he never entered his name into the Goblet of Fire and is under-aged. As Ron struggles to find his own identity, he believes Harry cheated to enter the contest solely for more attention, though Ron seems less concerned about Harry hoodwinking the Goblet than his belief that Harry never told him. Ron fails to realize that Harry actually shuns his celebrity. As the two become estranged, Hermione is Harry's sole supporter among students. It is only after Harry barely survives the deadly first challenge that Ron realizes he would never have cheated to enter, and they reconcile. It soon becomes apparent that there may be a sinister plot to murder Harry.

Ron struggles with other difficulties as he grows romantically interested in Hermione, though he hardly understands his feelings. Their friendship is strained when Ron belittles her efforts to champion House-elves' rights and he become jealous when she is courted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], another Triwizard Champion from Durmstrang Institute.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When Ron is appointed a Gryffindor Prefect, friction develops between him and Harry, who feels slighted by  Dumbledore; it may have been the Headmaster's intent to help Ron develop his own identity apart from Harry's celebrity. Ron is arbitrary with his Prefect duties, however, whereas Hermione, also a Prefect, is exact, causing tension between them as well. Ron is also too intimidated to curtail Fred and George's illegal activities or support Hermione, distressing her even further.

Armed with a new broom from his parents, Ron tries out for Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] Keeper, barely making the team. Much to team captain [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson's]] dismay, Ron's playing skills are a near disaster; only Harry's, and later Ginny's, amazingly good Seeking keeps their losses to a reasonable level. In the final game, however, Ron gains his confidence and plays brilliantly, and Gryffindor wins with a sufficiently large margin to keep the Quidditch Cup.

Ron is also instrumental in urging Harry to secretly teach real [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to students, rather than the deliberate drivel taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], a Ministry spy who is bent on ousting Dumbledore and taking over Hogwarts. Ron attends the first meeting in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]], and every meeting thereafter until the organization, by now called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], is betrayed and disbanded.

Harry recruits Ron, along with Hermione, Ginny, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] when he breaks into Professor Umbridge's office to try and contact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] using the Floo Network. Caught by Umbridge, Ron escapes when Ginny jinxes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]. The group, including Neville Longbottom, find Harry and Hermione, who led Umbridge on a wild-goose chase into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] where she was carried away by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|angry Centaurs]]. The students fly on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic in London]], where Harry believes Voldemort is torturing Sirius. Once there, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the students are ambushed]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], though Order of the Phoenix members arrive in time. In the ensuing battle, Ron is hit by what appears to be a drunkeness jinx, putting him out of action. We see him recovering later in the Hospital Wing, where Umbridge, traumatized by her ordeal with the Centaurs, is also a patient. Ron torments her by making soft &quot;clip clop&quot; hoof sounds.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry joins Professor Slughorn's advanced potions class as a prerequisite to becoming an Auror, Ron tags along, though he has little interest in the subject and apparently still has few, if any, career aspirations.
 
Harry becomes convinced that Draco Malfoy has become a Death Eater and may be involved in some dark task for Voldemort, though Ron, like Hermione, discounts this, believing Draco is just too young and inexperienced. Throughout much of the book, Ron and Hermione are at daggers drawn over Ron's infatuation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]. Despite their strained relations, Hermione, unknown to Ron, helps him win a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, though Ron's athletic potential is still affected by his insecurities. But when Harry fools Ron into believing he slipped a good luck potion into his juice just before a game, Ron performs exceptionally well.  

After Ron nearly dies drinking poisoned mead that was apparently intended for Professor Dumbledore, Hermione becomes so distraught that they end their feud for good. Ron quickly loses interest in Lavender, and Hermione only considers Viktor a friend. However, whatever romantic feelings each may have for the other remains subdued, both apparently too timid to openly express their real emotions. 

Death Eaters invade Hogwarts while Harry and Professor Dumbledore are away; Ron and Hermione, along with D.A. members Ginny, Luna, and Neville, help Ministry Aurors and the Order of the Phoenix battle them. When Harry decides to leave Hogwarts before his final year to search for Lord Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes (soul fragments), Ron, and also Hermione, pledge to accompany him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Ron is among the ''Order of the Phoenix'' members who secretly move Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Escape from Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] a few days before Harry's protective charms expire on his 17th birthday. When Ron fails to arrive at The Burrow after Voldemort's attack, the worst is feared. He soon safely arrives, detained by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]] at one of the safe houses.

Ron gives Harry a book titled, ''Twelve Foolproof Ways to Charm Witches'' for his birthday. The Twins gave him a copy, and Ron requests Harry say nothing to Hermione about it. Harry notices Ron applying the book's techniques to Hermione and his mother, who both seem to respond favourably.

Ron, along with Hermione, has joined Harry's mission to hunt and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. After escaping a Death Eater attack at The Burrow, the Trio flee to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], believing Severus Snape is the only Death Eater who can enter the former ''Order of the Phoenix'' headquarters. The next morning, Harry notices the sleeping Ron's hand close to Hermione's, and wonders if they fell asleep holding hands.

Discovering that Dolores Umbridge has Salazar Slytherin's locket, which is also a Horcrux, the Trio infiltrate the Ministry of Magic to retrieve it. They barely escape with the locket, though Ron's shoulder is badly splinched as Hermione Disapparates them away; he recovers a few days later. The Trio takes turns wearing the locket as they search for the other Horcruxes, but the locket's evil nature seems to exert a greater emotional affect on Ron. As the Trio roam the wintry English countryside, Ron, tired, cold, and used to hot meals and a warm bed, grows increasingly miserable. That Harry has no real plan for locating and destroying the Horcruxes, further irritates Ron. Frustrated with their slow progress and dismayed by the hardships, Ron storms off.

Ron's behavior is deplorable, but he heroically returns. When a mysterious Patronus leads Harry to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] hidden in a freezing pond, he dives in to retrieve it. The Horcrux, sensing danger, chokes him, but Ron arrives and rescues him. At Harry's bidding, Ron destroys the Horcrux with the Sword, though not before it cruelly taunts him. Hermione, still furious over Ron's abandonment, lashes out at him. Ron, unable to desert his friends, had immediately attempted to return, but he was captured by Snatchers (bounty hunters). By the tme he escaped, Harry and Hermione had already moved on. Ron stayed at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]] with Bill and Fleur, and used Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]] to find them. Ron shares valuable information about the ongoing war and warns that anyone speaking Voldemort's name immediatley alerts Snatchers to their whereabouts. He also provides Harry with a wand he captured from a Snatcher, replacing Harry's broken one. 

Ron's return heralds a significant change: he is more confident, self-reliant, and assumes responsibility, often taking the lead in the search. It is Ron who suggests visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]], whose newspaper, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']] publishes truthful stories about Harry. Xeno tells them about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Hallows]], three unique magical artifacts. The Hallows emblem was used by the Dark wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to  Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], who Dumbledore defeated in a duel long ago. Each object seems plausible: the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] could be Harry's, and the Elder Wand has a credible history and may be Dumbledore's. Only the Resurrection Stone seems dubious to Hermione.
 
Harry accidentally speaks Voldemort's name, alerting Snatchers, led by the vicious werewolf, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], who takes them to Voldemort's headquartes at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] spies the Sword of Gryffindor and tortures Hermione to determine its authenticity, then offers her to Greyback, as a reward. Ron is tormented by Hermione's screams, and with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby's]] help, he and Harry escape the cellar and rescue her, safely Apparating to Shell Cottage. 

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] break into Gringotts Bank and successfully steal a Cup Horcrux secured in the Lestranges' vault. The one remaining Horcrux is somewhere inside Hogwarts. The Trio immediately head to the school, where a flourishing guerrilla army has been camping out in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]; Harry, dismayed, never expected to captain a battle against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Ron suggests having everyone search for the Horcrux, now believed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw's]] lost Diadem. 

As Voldemort and his army head to Hogwarts, Ron remembers that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] fangs can destroy Horcruxes. He opens the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] by repeating the Parseltongue words he remembers Harry speaking; Hermione truly admires Ron's cleverness and initiative in this. Ron has Hermione destroy the Cup Horcrux. As the battle is about to start, Ron wants to warn Hogwarts' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]]. Hermione, overcome by Ron's compassion, sweeps him into a passionate embrace, their love for each other finally declared.

Later, Ron helps Harry search for the Ravenclaw Diadem in the Room of Requirement. Ron also accompanies Harry and Hermione to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], where Voldemort and Snape are discussing the Elder Wand. They witnesses Snape's death just after he relinquishes his memories to Harry. 

Ron, who has never experienced real sorrow, suffers a tragic family loss during the fighting. After the victorious battle, Harry gathers Ron and Hermione as he heads to the Headmaster's office to speak with Dumbledore's portrait.

In the epilogue, Ron has become an Auror, like Harry. Ron and Hermione are married and have two children, Rose and Hugo.

== Strengths ==
Ron is generally cheerful, easy-going, and slow to anger. He is often able to give calm, reasonable advice to Harry and Hermione, who can both react emotionally under duress. Ron has the potential to become a powerful wizard, but his insecurities and lack of confidence often cause him to act more as a passive bystander rather than an active participant. This often allows him to observe events from a more objective viewpoint, however, and his keen observations can be astute and helpful to the Trio's activities. When he does comment about something, it is often in a joking manner, perhaps fearing his opinions will be disregarded. Being the only Trio member with an early magical upbringing, Ron has the most extensive knowledge about the general Wizarding realm, often educating Harry and Hermione. This will prove especially valuable when the three undertake Dumbledore's mission to hunt and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes in book 7. 

In contrast to Harry's magical talent and intuition and Hermione's intellectualism and magical attitude, Ron possesses knowledge of the Wizarding world and often provides insight on the background and culture. Although he rarely seeks out adventure or adversity on his own, preferring a regular routine and creature comforts, he always overcomes his doubts and fears to faithfully accompany Harry on his quests. However, he does not partake in these undertakings as readily as Hermione, once abandoning both her and Harry during the quest for Horcruxes. Ron is a true Gryffindor; he can be quite brave when his friends are in danger, and does his best to protect Harry or Hermione should the need arise. He also shows great loyalty to his friends and family and appears more logistically-minded than Harry or Hermione, particularly excelling in Wizard's Chess. During the final battle at Hogwarts (in book 7), Ron devises a clever scheme to destroy a Horcrux that neither Harry or Hermione had considered. Ron also becomes a skilled Quidditch Keeper, though he is extremely susceptible to nerves, causing him to initially be a weak player. Of the Trio, Ron's personality undergoes the most significant change as he matures.  

While Ron may often feel overshadowed by his talented friends and siblings, he was intelligent and capable enough to receive passing grades in seven O.W.L.s, which we believe were six E (Exceeds Expectations) Grade O.W.Ls and an A (Acceptable) Grade O.W.L in Astronomy, and so was able to advance into N.E.W.T classes. He is also able to produce the notoriously difficult Patronus charm and has shown skilled magical proficiency in dueling against older and far more experienced Death Eaters. Ron eventually becomes an Auror, a profession that requires considerable magical talent and extensive training.

== Weaknesses ==

Being the youngest among six brothers, Ron is often lacks self-confidence in his abilities. He feels that his accomplishments are not noteworthy because his older brothers have done so much. Even his younger sister, Ginny, seems to surpass him magically. His friendship with Harry, who receives constant attention and accolades, can also affect his self-esteem, causing occasional jealous bouts over it. Hermione's extraordinary intellect also affects him, usually deferring to her judgment regarding most matters, though Ron does appear to have above-average intelligence and magical ability. Ron occasionally craves attention, partly as he does not receive much in such a large family. 

When Ron was very young, his brothers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], as a prank, turned his teddy bear into a spider. As a result, Ron is now deathly afraid of spiders; despite this, he somehow mustered the courage to follow Harry into the giant spider Aragog's lair, showing he is a true Gryffindor. Ron also displays particular susceptibility and weakness to the Imperius Curse when practicing hexes in Professor Moody's class. 

Hermione characterizes Ron as having &quot;the emotional range of a teaspoon&quot; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], and he does seem to fit this characterization; he repeatedly appears to show little sensitivity to the emotional environment surrounding him. He is slower to mature than either Harry or Hermione, and is usually content to follow their footsteps, seldom taking any initiative for himself. Although intelligent, he, like Harry, is a rather lazy student, and unlike his older brothers, seems uninterested in experimenting with magic. Though he periodically shows the potential to become a powerful wizard, he rarely expands his knowledge or skills beyond what he is currently required to learn. 

Luna Lovegood notes that while Ron can be funny, he is sometimes cruel. This seems particularly true in regards to her. Even though Luna risked her life to help him and Harry in the Department of Mysteries battle, Ron's gratitude seems totally lacking, and he treats her as indifferently as before, even chastising Harry for inviting &quot;Loony&quot; Luna to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party. Ron's insensitivity also extends to many non-human magical denizens, and, like many wizards, considers them second and third-class citizens worth little consideration. Though he never supports mistreating them, he often mocks Hermione for championing House-elves rights, firmly believing they are happy as they are. He later reverses his earlier apathy, much to Hermione's delight and likely due to her influence.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==


'''Harry Potter'''

Throughout the series, Ron's most important relationship, outside his family, is with Harry Potter. Not only is he Harry's first real friend, but also his closest. The two boys immediately hit it off, and Ron, generally unimpressed by Harry's celebrity, helps him adjust to the wizard world. Harry is grateful for Ron's help, and also for being included as part of the Weasley family. The two boys are nearly inseparable, doing practically everything together, though Harry, more assertive, usually takes the lead in their adventures. Their friendship is not without its difficulties, however. While Ron is usually content to bask in Harry's reflected glory, he occasionally feels jealous over his fame and the constant attention it brings, eventually causing a short-lived falling out between the two boys in book 4. In book 7, Ron, frustrated with Dumbledore's mission, Harry's seeming indecisiveness, and unable to cope with the harsh living conditions, briefly deserts him and Hermione, though he heroically returns in time to save Harry's life. These clashes sometimes seem related to Ron's own low self-esteem and that he has much to live up to with five accomplished older brothers, and an equally talented younger sister. Though the attention Harry garners often causes Ron to feel overshadowed and resentful, he fails to realize that Harry's fame is less about his abilities or anything that he deliberately sought. Instead, it was thrust upon Harry by circumstance at a young age. Nor does Harry desire or seek to be a celebrity, and wants only to be recognized for his own accomplishments. Harry does help Ron build confidence in himself, and later tutors him in advanced defensive magic, mostly during the ''Dumbledore's Army'' training sessions, to where Ron becomes quite proficient. 

Harry's inherited wealth can also sometimes be an issue for Ron, who resents his own family's poverty, knowing Harry can afford anything he needs or wants, while he must make do with shabby goods. Even though Harry actually spends little on himself or rarely desires material goods, Ron constantly feels unequal. Ron's pride also refuses to allow Harry to give him anything too costly, while he is able to afford inexpensive gifts in return. When Harry gives the Twins money to start their own joke shop, he secretly arranges for them to buy Ron new dress robes, insisting that Ron believe it comes from them. 

Ron is somewhat upset when his sister, Ginny and Harry start dating, though any boy taking an interest in Ginny bothers him. Ron generally prefers that she be with Harry, as long as they restrain their romance in his presence. Prior to leaving on Dumbledore's mission, Harry ends his relationship with Ginny to protect her from Voldemort. Concerned about his sister's well-being and long-term happiness, Ron sternly warns Harry to avoid giving her any false hopes. Despite these differences, Ron is staunchly loyal to Harry, and he would do practically anything to protect or support his friend. Harry eventually becomes Ron's brother-in-law, further bonding them, making them true family.


'''Hermione Granger''' 

Ron's second most important relationship, and later his most significant, is Hermione Granger. Ron, along with Harry, initially dislikes Hermione due to her bossy, erudite manner, but they become friends in the first book after she protects Harry and Ron from being unfairly punished. Their connection is subtle at first, the bond gradually strengthening, as each successive book reveals more about their budding relationship, though it is not without its obstacles or rancor. Neither is able to openly display their feelings during the first six books, leaving each confused and unsure. They often have large arguments, then reconcile their differences. 

When Hermione becomes involved with Viktor Krum, a Durmstrang student staying at Hogwarts in book 4, Ron is jealous, but still confused about his true feelings. Mostly as retaliation against Hermione, he later has an ill-conceived romance with Lavender Brown, another Gryffindor student. He soon regrets this, mostly due to the silly Lavender's overly cloying personality. Hermione perpetuates this conflict, infuriating Ron by inviting Cormac McLaggen, an obnoxious older Gryffindor student, to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party in book 6. Ron eventually tires of the relationship and breaks up with Lavender, much to Hermione's delight. As both Ron and Hermione mature (Ron more slowly than either Hermione or Harry), their feelings intensify, and a likely permanent relationship is established in the later books. This finally comes to fruition near the sixth book's end, and we see in the ''Deathly Hallows'' epilogue that Ron and Hermione are married with two children, Rose and Hugo. More detail on Ron's relationships can be found [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Ron Weasley|here]].


'''Weasley Family'''

For general guidance and support, Ron seems particularly dependent upon the loving and close-knit Weasley clan. Arthur and Molly Weasley are doting parents, though with so many children and he being the youngest son, Ron often feels somewhat neglected and the least accomplished among the large brood. As his parents are unable to financially afford little more than their children's basic necessities, Ron resents having to make do with his brothers' shabby hand-me-downs, used goods, or going without entirely. Molly, in particular, seems unaware how this affects Ron's self-esteem and social development during his early teen years. Ron greatly admires his rather Bohemian elder brothers, Charlie and Bill, though their being older and having already left home creates a gap in their relationship with the much-younger Ron, who they mostly view as the &quot;little brother&quot;. Percy, closer to Ron in age, has developed an off-putting, authoritarian, and patrician manner that eventually estranges him from the entire family and angers Ron. During the series, Ron is never close to Percy, but it is indicated that this will likely change after Percy reconciles with the family. Ron spends more time with Fred and George, though they, being identical twins, are particularly close only with one another and usually busy inventing new magic or devising some clever prank. Ron and the entire family are devastated by Fred's tragic death. This no doubt brings Ron closer to George, particularly after Ron starts working with him in the Twin's magic shop before becoming an Auror like Harry. Ginny is the baby in the family and the only girl, and Ron, like the other Weasleys, is protective. Ginny quickly develops a strong, independent personality and her magical abilities appear to be exceeding Ron's from an early age. Ron also becomes rather upset when boys start noticing Ginny, who soon blossoms into an attractive young lady.


'''Hogwarts Friends'''    

Ron's congenial manner generally allows him to get on well with most other Gryffindors, though some may seek his friendship only because he is close to Harry, rather than any interest in Ron. Socially, Ron is somewhat inept, and he can be unintentionally rude, particularly, but not exclusively, to ghosts and other non-human magical creatures. As mentioned above, he can occasionally be ungrateful and somewhat cruel in how he treats others, such as Luna Lovegood, though he generally possesses a good heart.

== Analysis ==

Ron's character can be considered the classic hero's &quot;sidekick&quot;. This person is usually a companion to a stronger, braver, and more capable heroic figure, often assisting him in some task or quest, also brave, but always remaining in a supportive and subordinate role. Whenever the hero falls into mortal peril, it is the sidekick who comes to his rescue. In literature (and cinema), the sidekick is traditionally clever and able, but often less handsome, has a more humorous and lighthearted personality, and is somewhat unsophisticated. Ron assumes this role with Harry Potter, aiding him on his various adventures, but always following Harry's lead. This gradually changes as Ron matures and becomes more capable, independent, and decisive throughout the series. Though he never quite matches Harry or Hermione in ability, intellect, or emotional maturity, his character undergoes the most significant growth throughout the story, becoming far more assertive, self-reliant, responsible, and magically proficient by the series' end. 

Due to his family's relative poverty and size, Ron usually makes do with used school supplies and hand-me-down goods. Even his first wand, a wizard's most important possession, previously belonged to his brother. His mother, Molly, unintentionally humiliates him when she buys him hideous, second-hand dress robes that he must wear to the Yule Ball in ''Goblet of Fire'' while she selects new presentable ones for Harry because he can afford them. This all affects his personality and confidence somewhat, often making him feel he has something to prove. His older brothers have all gone onto successful careers, and Ron, quite rightly, believes there is great pressure on him to perform well in school. 

The family's finances do improve when Mr. Weasley receives a promotion and after the older boys have moved out, thus affording his parents to buy Ron a few luxuries (such as a racing broom and new wand) he might not otherwise have received. Harry always shows great consideration and understanding regarding Ron's poor self-esteem. Knowing that Ron's pride would never allow him to buy him an expensive gift, Harry secretly arranges for the Twins to buy Ron proper dress robes with the money he loans them for their joke shop.

Ron tends to be reckless and insensitive at times, though his heart is indisputably in the right place. Ron has developed tight bonds with his two best friends, Harry and Hermione, and is an important player within &quot;The Trio.&quot;

== Overview ==

'''''Hermione Jean Granger'''''&lt;!-- note: &quot;Jean&quot; is specified in Deathly Hallows chapter 7, UK / Cdn edition p.106 --&gt; is the only daughter of two Muggle dentists. Hermione is academically gifted and spends much time studying, doing homework, and other class-related things during the year at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Hermione often serves as the voice of reason when her two best friends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] get themselves into interesting or dangerous situations. Although seemingly always stressed due to schooling, Hermione is dependable when called upon, and is extremely adept at accomplishing things correctly and efficiently.

Hermione has a rather bossy voice, bushy brown hair, and large front teeth, which she later has magically shrunk. Her birthday is [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=8 September 19th.] She was eleven-years-old at the start of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's_Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], turning twelve shortly thereafter, making her almost a year older than Harry, and six months older than Ron; internal evidence suggests she was born in 1979. 

Hermione's wand is vine with a Dragon heartstring core. Vine can represent great bounty, renewal, and also extreme emotions such as joy and anger. And while Dragons are often considered as evil beasts, they also symbolize strength, purification, wisdom, renewal, and power. The wood in Hermione's wand's also reflects her September 19 birth date, in which vine is the Celtic Tree Calendar's September 2 - September 29 cycle. For more on this topic, see the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wands]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''Note:''' Hermione Granger, while not the viewpoint character in this series, is one of the Trio, and thus involved in nearly all the action. Summarizing her role in the books would, perforce, only recap the books. For a detailed overview of Hermione's role in the series, it is best to read the actual books on which this text is based; failing that, begin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|here]] and proceed onwards from that point. The sections below only highlights her role and character. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Hermione is introduced as a smart, but rather bossy know-it-all girl, who intrudes into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] compartment on the Hogwarts Express. She acts disdainful after Ron unsuccessfully casts a spell, then boasts she has already read all the textbooks. 
Though Ron hoped she would be sorted into some other school House, she is placed in Gryffindor with him and Harry, though they do their best to avoid her. 

Though Hermione excels in her studies, being the first student to levitate a feather in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] class, her intellectualism is off-putting, and she has made few, if any, friends. After overhearing Ron's insulting remarks, she runs off sobbing. A Mountain Troll enters the dungeons and traps her in the girls lavatory. Harry and Ron together defeat it, thus saving Hermione's life, but Professor McGonagall intends to punish them, believing they deliberately attempted to subdue the creature. Hermione intervenes by claiming that she was the one who went looking for the Troll, thus sparing Harry and Ron, and earning her their friendship; the Trio, as they are called, is formed, and they remain together for the series and beyond. 

While this book serves mainly as an introduction to the magical world and its characters, a real quest soon emerges. Harry suspects that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] is plotting to steal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] (known as the Sorceror's Stone in the U.S. editions) that is being guarded at Hogwarts. Apparently, the evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], was killed when he attempted to murder Harry. With Dark magic and the Philosopher's Stone, it is possible he could return. It appears that Snape is his accomplice, but it is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]. Hermione uses her advanced magical skills to help Harry and Ron foil Lord Voldemort's plan to steal the Stone.

Finally, at the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore awards Hermione fifty House points for, &quot;use of cool logic in the face of fire&quot;. Hermione is always at the top of the class, as expected. She and Ron both promise to write to Harry during the summer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Hermione surprises Harry and Ron by her apparent crush on the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], though many other females share this infatuation. Surprisingly, despite his increasingly demonstrated magical incompetence, she still seems to believe that he is exceptionally talented; Hermione's usually astute logic has, for once, been blinded by her emotions.

After mysterious writing appears on a wall warning that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, there is much speculation as to what it is. Hermione asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] to tell the class about the Chamber. Apparently, before departing Hogwarts after a fallout with the other Founders, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] constructed a secret chamber beneath the castle. Henceforth, the Chamber could only be opened by his true heir, and it is believed to contain a monster that would assist in purging all but pure-blooded Wizards from the school.

Suspecting that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] knows something about the heir, Hermione concocts a scheme using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise the Trio as Slytherins and infiltrate their dormitory; she spends the next month brewing it in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Her sudden willingness to break rules is not only uncharacteristic, but amazes Harry and Ron. Hermione's plan backfires when, accidentally adding cat hair to her potion, she half-transforms herself into a feline, landing her in the Hospital Wing for a month. Harry and Ron, however, are able to slip into Slytherin disguised as Crabbe and Goyle, obtaining valuable information from Draco Malfoy.

As students are being Petrified, Hermione pieces clues together, leading her to suspect something about the Chamber. She dashes to the library for more information, but is Petrified before sharing what she learned with Ron and Harry. Harry finds a torn-out page balled up in her hand that suggests the monster is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]], and it is using the plumbing to move about the school.

Thanks to Hermione's help, Harry defeats the monster and saves Ginny Weasley. Hermione, when restored to health, is dismayed that final exams have been canceled.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Hermione seems massively overloaded with books when we meet her in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. Intending to buy an owl, she instead purchases an unusual ginger-colored cat she names [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] that takes an immediate dislike to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], Ron's pet rat.

Throughout the year, Hermione perplexingly appears to be taking more classes than humanly possible, including some taught at the same time. Hermione also seems to inexplicably appear and disappear before and after classes, although she dodges giving any explanation about her odd behavior. Initially, the extra work is enjoyable, but the strain eventually shows, causing Hermione to occasionally act uncharacteristically. She punches Draco Malfoy after he insults Hagrid, who is distraught over the Hippogriff [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak's]] impending execution.

Hermione is always loyal to Harry, and setting aside her concerns about the possible danger, says nothing to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] about Harry's Marauder's Map, a magical document showing every person's location within Hogwarts. With it, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who escaped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban prison]], could enter the castle and locate Harry, who Black apparently intends to murder. Hermione is unable to ignore a potentially greater threat when Harry receives an expensive Firebolt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] as an anonymous Christmas gift, and she reports it to McGonagall. Her valid argument that it may be cursed and could have been sent by Black fail to sway either Harry or Ron, who think only about riding it. Consequently, Hermione experiences their full wrath, and they shun her, causing Hermione much heartache. Although the three reconcile after McGonagall returns the broom in the spring, tension erupts between Hermione and Ron when Ron suspects that Crookshanks killed Scabbers, who has suspiciously disappeared. Ron is particularly upset that Hermione expresses little remorse or accepts responsibility, though being overstressed and burdened by her heavy class load and preparing Buckbeak's appeal may have left her unable to react appropriately. She eventually apologizes to Ron about Scabbers, however, and they make up; Harry and Ron then make good on their previous promise to help with Buckbeak's case.

When Buckbeak's appeal fails, the Trio visit Hagrid shortly before the execution at sundown. To Ron's relief, Hermione finds Scabbers, but the rat escapes. Ron catches him, but a large black dog appears and grabs Ron, breaking his leg as he is pulled into a tunnel under the Whomping Willow. Harry and Hermione follow it to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]]. There they encounter Sirius Black, an unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] who assumes a dog form. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] bursts in, appearing to be Black's accomplice, Hermione reveals his secret: Lupin is a Werewolf. Yet another unregistered Animagus is exposed: Scabbers, who is actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. The three men were James Potter's best friends, but it was Pettigrew, not Black, who betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, framing Sirius for the crime by killing twelve Muggles and faking his own death. Black intends to kill Pettigrew for revenge.

Pettigrew escapes, and Sirius is captured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. As the creatures prepare to suck out his soul, Hermione, prompted by Dumbledore, shows Harry a Time-Turner, a device she has been using all year to attend multiple classes. Leaving Ron behind in the infirmary, they return to Hagrid's hut three hours earlier. As the previous events repeat, they rescue Buckbeak, then free Sirius Black, returning to the Hospital Wing at exactly the time they left.

Heading back to London on the Hogwarts Express, Hermione tells Harry and Ron that she has returned the Time Turner to Professor McGonagall, preferring to have a normal class load.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] === 

Hermione accompanies Harry and the Weasley family to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. A riot breaks out after the game, and hooded figures rampage through the campground, terrorizing Muggle-borns like Hermione. Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] floats in the sky. While at the World Cup, Hermione observed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], being mistreated. She later discovers that Hogwarts' kitchens are staffed by over a hundred enslaved House-elves. Her resolve to help improve their lot soon transforms into a life-long mission.

Students from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], arrive at Hogwarts for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], a recently revived, and dangerous, competition. Ron soon becomes infatuated with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], a Beauxbatons student. Although Hermione finds him rather annoying, a Durmstrang student, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] becomes romantically interested in her.

When Harry is mysteriously selected as the fourth Triwizard champion, Hermione is the only student who believes he did not cheat to enter himself. While others, including Ron, ostracize Harry, she remains loyal, helping him prepare for the Tournament's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]], and providing moral support while Harry and Ron are estranged. As a result, Harry and Hermione become even closer friends, though Hermione is relieved when Harry and Ron eventually reconcile.

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] finds both Harry and Ron dateless. Ron, desperate, asks Hermione, but she is already attending with Viktor Krum. Ron angrily accuses her of &quot;fraternizing with the enemy,&quot; while she chastises him for having invited her only as a &quot;last resort.&quot; Though Ron is mystified by her outburst, Harry thinks Hermione understands Ron's feelings better than Ron does, who becomes even more upset when he learns that Viktor has invited Hermione to visit him during the summer.

For the Second Task, Hermione researches ways for Harry to remain underwater for an hour, and drills him on protective charms and jinxes for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]]. Meanwhile, her curiosity is piqued by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], a muck-raking journalist who reports embarrassing and also false details about her subjects in sensationalistic articles. When Hermione discovers Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus, using her beetle form to eavesdrop on private conversations, she blackmails her to prevent her from writing any more stories about Harry. Otherwise, Hermione will report her to the Ministry as an unregistered Animagus, a serious offense.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Though Hermione corresponds with Harry over the summer, her letters reveal little regarding Voldemort's return or what has been happening in the wizarding world, frustrating Harry. He is hardly placated when, after being brought to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]], Hermione explains that she and Ron were under strict orders from Dumbledore to tell him nothing, though they, being under-aged, have actually been told little themselves. 

Hermione and Ron are made Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefects]]. Hermione diligently performs her prefect duties. Ron, however, is considerably less punctilious, occasionally using his powers for his own amusement and personal gain, annoying Hermione. Harry, meanwhile, is peeved at being passed over. It is soon learned that the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], a Ministry of Magic official who attended Harry's hearing and voted to convict him for using underage magic. When she gives an inappropriately long speech at the Welcoming Feast, only Hermione and a few faculty can concentrate on and fully comprehend her droning words; she later summarizes it for Harry and Ron as: the Ministry intends to meddle at Hogwarts. 

Fearing Dumbledore is building a secret wizard army to overtake the Ministry, Umbridge, with Cornelius Fudge's support, deliberately renders Defence Against the Dark Arts into an ineffective class. Frustrated with learning nothing, Hermione urges Harry to teach real defensive magic to any interested student, thus creating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|&quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot;]].

It is Hermione who notices when Hagrid returns after a long absence, and helps persuade him to discuss his mission to parlay with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]] for Dumbledore. As Umbridge gains more power and begins targeting certain teachers, particularly non-humans and half-breeds like Hagrid, for dismissal, Hermione advises Hagrid to only use Ministry-approved creatures in his classes. Hagrid ignores her warning, however, and is eventually sacked.

At Christmas, after witnessing an attack on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] in a vision, Harry worries that Voldemort may be possessing his mind. Hermione is concerned enough that she cancels her family skiing trip to instead go to Grimmauld Place, forcing Harry to talk with her, Ron, and Ginny. While visiting Mr. Weasley in hospital with the others, she and Ron learn the truth about Neville Longbottom's parents, who were tortured into insanity by Death Eaters, though Harry had kept Neville's secret to himself.

Hermione is instrumental in countering the misinformation and propaganda the Ministry is continually spewing regarding Harry and Voldemort. She blackmails hack journalist Rita Skeeter into writing a truthful story about Harry that Luna Lovegood's father, Xenophilius, publishes in his tabloid paper, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']]. The article changes the public's perception about Harry and Dumbledore, leaving Umbridge furious and casting doubt on the Ministry's official stance.

When Harry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius at the Ministry of Magic, Hermione, suspecting it may be a trick, suggests using the Floo Network to attempt to contact him. Umbridge catches them, and is about to cast the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]] on Harry. Hermione quickly devises a cover story, fooling the vile Umbridge into believing that Dumbledore hid a secret weapon in the Forbidden Forest. She leads Umbridge there, then allows her to fall afoul of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], who, after Umbridge insults and infuriates them, carry the screaming woman away. 

Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]], and Ginny fly to the Ministry on Thestrals to rescue Sirius. But they have been lured into a trap, and are ambushed by Death Eaters intent on retrieving a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] concerning Harry and Voldemort. In the ensuing battle, Hermione is seriously injured. Order of the Phoenix members arrive, and the Death Eaters are defeated, though Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange escape.

When we next see Hermione, she is recuperating in the Hospital Wing. By the time the Hogwarts Express leaves Hogsmeade for London, she is fully recovered.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Professor Dumbledore encourages Harry to share with Hermione and Ron what he learns about Voldemort during their private lessons. Hermione, meanwhile, remains vexed by Ron, who is still infatuated with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]. She is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] preparing for her and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley's]] wedding. Ron also annoys Hermione when he abuses his Prefect powers and seems overly responsive to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown's]] constant flirting. When Harry suspects Draco may be a Death Eater and is involved in a sinister plot, Hermione dismisses this, telling Harry he is over-reacting, though his suspicions actually have merit.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn's]] potions class, Hermione is annoyed when Harry, using an old textbook filled with a former student's notations, outperforms her, even though she diligently follows the traditional instructions. Hermione grows suspicious, however, and tests Harry's book for Dark magic. Finding none, she later searches for information about &quot;The Half-Blood Prince,&quot; the name written inside the book's cover. Though unable to discover anything, Hermione remains convinced the Prince is a dodgy character and using his notes is cheating, though Harry and Ron disagree.

Although Hermione remains at odds with Ron, she discreetly, and surprisingly, lends him a helping hand. When Ron tries out for Gryffindor Quidditch Keeper, he competes against  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen]], an athletically gifted but particularly arrogant student. Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunds]] McLaggen during the trials, causing him to continually miss plays and winning Ron a place on the team. Hermione later justifies her actions to Harry by claiming that McLaggen's combative personality would disrupt the team.

Both Hermione and Harry are drafted into Professor Slughorn's &quot;Slug Club&quot;, a collection of students he considers rising stars. Ron, jealous at being excluded, snubs Hermione's invitation to attend Slughorn's Christmas party, and sarcastically suggests she should instead attend with Cormac. She does, just to annoy Ron, but soon regrets her decision, spending the entire evening evading Cormac's obnoxious overtures. Hermione commends Harry for inviting Luna Lovegood to the party, although others, including Ron, mocked him for taking &quot;Loony Lovegood.&quot;

When Ron begins an intensely physical relationship with Lavender Brown, Hermione becomes upset and avoids him. But Ron and Hermione permanently end their feud when Ron nearly dies after being accidentally poisoned. Ron and Lavender split up soon after, much to Hermione's delight, while Harry is secretly pleased that Ginny ended her relationship with Dean Thomas.

Dumbledore and Harry prepare to search for another Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Harry, suspecting something sinister may be unfolding at Hogwarts, charges Ron and Hermione with re-activating Dumbledore's Army to guard the castle and monitor the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], where Draco Malfoy has been secretly engaging in some unknown activity. Harry's suspicions are correct, and Death Eaters invade the school while Harry and Dumbledore are away. Hermione later discovers that Snape, who has murdered Dumbledore and escaped with the Death Eaters, is the Half-Blood Prince; his mother, a witch, was born Eileen Prince, while his father, Tobias Snape, was a Muggle, making Severus a half-blood.

At Dumbledore's funeral, Hermione and Ron comfort each other. Afterward, they tell Harry that they are accompanying him on his mission, whatever it may be, but Ron reminds him they must first attend a wedding.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Hermione is among the six Harry Potter decoys used in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Escape from Privet Drive|escape from Privet Drive]]. At The Burrow, when Harry still senses Voldemort's thoughts, Hermione is dismayed, reminding him that Dumbledore wanted that channel closed.

As the Trio is about to embark on their mission, Hermione shrinks everything they need, packing it all in a carrying bag. She includes Dark Magic books, and has been researching ways to destroy Horcruxes. Harry already hit upon one method in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 17|the Chamber of Secrets]], namely [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk venom]]. Hermione once again refuses Harry's suggestion that she stay behind. 

When Fred and George swear by the book, ''Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches'', Ron applies its methods to Hermione, who seems to respond favorably. But Ron becomes upset and jealous when Viktor Krum arrives for Bill and Fleur's wedding, apparently still interested in Hermione, while she is flattered by Krum's attention. 

When Death Eaters attack the wedding reception, Hermione Apparates the Trio away and then to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], Sirius Black's family home after Death Eaters attack them at a café. While there, Harry connects Sirius' brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus]] with the ''R.A.B.'' who left the note inside the fake locket Horcrux. After determining the real Locket Horcrux was stolen and used to bribe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], the three infiltrate the Ministry of Magic to search for it. The Trio become separated, but Harry and Hermione retrieve the Locket and, meeting up with Ron, barely escape. 

The Trio wander the English countryside, searching for the Horcruxes and the means to destroy them. Ron, unprepared for such a difficult mission and affected by the Locket's evil nature, leaves the group in a childish huff. His abrupt departure devastates Hermione, but her faith in Harry and his mission never wavers. When dark secrets emerge about Dumbledore's past, causing Harry to doubt him and the mission, Hermione helps him to look beyond Dumbledore's earlier failings and see the good man he chose to become.  

Ron rejoins the group, though Hermione remains furious at him. From here on, however, Ron assumes more responsibility for the mission's operations and often takes the lead, planning their strategy. From a children's story, ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'', the Trio learns about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], three magical objects. Hermione dismisses the Resurrection Stone, but wonders if Harry's Invisibility Cloak is the one in the story, and admits the Elder Wand has a credible history. It may even be Dumbledore's wand that he captured from [[Muggles' Guide to  Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], a Dark wizard he defeated many years before; they soon learn Voldemort is seeking it. 

The Trio is captured by Snatchers and taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Voldemort's headquarters]] at Malfoy Manor. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] tortures Hermione using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]], then offers her as a prize to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], a sadistic Werewolf. Ron, hearing Hermione's screams, is distraught. With Dobby's help, Ron and Harry rescue her, then Disapparate to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], Bill and Fleur's home, where Hermione quickly recovers.

After stealing a Horcrux from the Lestrange's Gringotts vault and making a daring escape, the Trio head to Hogwarts, where Harry believes the last Horcrux is hidden. As Harry searches for it, Ron realizes if the Chamber of Secrets can be opened, the Basilisk fangs lying within can destroy the Horcruxes; he opens the Chamber by repeating Parseltongue words he heard Harry speaking. Hermione truly admires Ron's cleverness, and when he also suggests warning Hogwarts' House-elves about the impending battle, Hermione, ecstatic over Ron's new-found compassion, throws herself into his arms, kissing him.

In the epilogue, we learn that Hermione works in a high-level position within the Ministry of Magic. She and Ron have married, and have two children, Rose and Hugo.

== Strengths ==

Hermione's greatest strength is a vast intellect combined with her magical ability. Her magical skills, have, throughout the series, aided Harry and Ron on many occasions. As she is generally caring, compassionate, and usually adopts a &quot;rule-abiding&quot; point-of-view, Hermione often presents Harry and Ron with alternative approaches to their situations. Her intelligence, while initially more academic, has increasingly been combined with her magical skills, helping her become a skilled duelist, capable of battling far more experienced Death Eaters, as she demonstrated in the battle at the Department of Mysteries, and later in the final battle at Hogwarts. In her age group, apparently only Harry outperforms her in Defence Against the Dark Arts.

Gyrffindor, a House known for bravery, initially seems an unusual choice for Hermione. Given her great burgeoning intellect, Ravenclaw would seem more suitable. But the Sorting Hat can detect unseen characteristics within students that they are as yet unaware exist. While Hermione is as intelligent as any Ravenclaw, she will gradually demonstrate courage they may lack by practically applying her knowledge and pursuing her beliefs, even when mocked or faced with difficult obstacles.

Hermione is also logical, quick thinking, and adaptable. Her cool demeanor, even when under duress, prevents her from panicking while quickly devising a solution to most problems. She is also naturally adept in organization and planning, which culminates in her brilliant preparations for the Trio's Horcrux mission during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

== Weaknesses ==

At times, Hermione's intellect has prevented her from making the same connections about other people and their motives that Ron, and especially Harry, instinctively sense. Her adherence and reliance on &quot;rules&quot; often causes deep conflicts with her intuitive belief that they may sometimes be wrong. She will break rules if she believes it serves a greater purpose, and though she often feels guilty about this, as she matures, it bothers her much less. Hermione is self-conscious about her physical appearance, though she blossoms into an attractive young woman. Her greatest fear is failure — her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]] was Professor McGonagall telling her she had &quot;failed everything,&quot; and she was upset when she missed one O (Outstanding) on her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.s]], earning the next-best grade of an E (Exceeds Expectations) in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

Being a Gryffindor, Hermione certainly has a brave and noble character, and always has the courage to speak her mind on important issues, but she can be timid and uncertain when there is physical danger. Her rather bossy personality, and somewhat superior and erudite manner, were initially off-putting to both Harry and Ron (and other classmates), though her insecurity and self-doubt may partially have been the cause. As she matures, these traits have become subdued somewhat, and she instead uses her intellect and leadership skills to help guide the others.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Hermione, an only child, apparently enjoys a close relationship with her family, but her home life is never seen, and her Muggle parents remain in the distant background. To protect them from Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Hermione alters their memories and sends them to Australia under a new identity in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.

Initially, Hermione has problems making friends at Hogwarts; like Harry, her Muggle background may have caused some difficulty in her adapting to the Wizarding world, despite all her reading about it. She is also highly intelligent, and her somewhat superior manner, coupled with a bossy nature, is rather off-putting to many peers. Behind her confident facade, however, she can be self-conscious about her appearance and fearful of failure. After becoming friends with Ron and Harry, she develops other friendships, becoming particularly close to Ron's sister, Ginny, and later befriends Luna Lovegood, an odd Ravenclaw girl who most students shun. No one is as close to her as Harry and Ron, however, and she becomes an integral player in the &quot;Trio&quot;, where her cool logic and deep intellect constantly aid their adventures. Their friendship is tested, however, after a falling out in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', though the relationship is eventually mended with Hagrid's help.

'''Ron Weasley'''

During the series, Hermione and Ron develop a tentative romantic attraction to one another, though both are hesitant and unsure regarding how the other feels, at least until the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. Earlier, any budding feelings either may have seem scuttled when, in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' Hermione reports to Professor McGonagall that an anonymous benefactor sent Harry an expensive (and potentially cursed) racing broom. Both Harry and Ron shun Hermione, even though her only concern was Harry's safety. Hermione seems equally uncaring and insensitive when she later refuses to acknowledge that her cat, Crookshanks, did anything wrong by apparently killing Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. Harry, in this latter instance, is more sympathetic to Hermione's view that Crookshanks is only being a cat, but the relationship with Ron, almost repaired with the return of Harry's broom, is again in difficulty until Scabbers' return and the revelation of his true nature.

Unable to reconcile their mutual feelings, Hermione and Ron develop other romantic relationships. In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Hermione attends the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum, a visiting Durmstrang student, and continues corresponding with him after he returns home, though her interest in him is more casual than his is in her. She meets Viktor again at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''; he is apparently still attracted to her, while she is flattered by his attention. In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Ron begins dating Lavender Brown, possibly in part to make Hermione jealous. If that is his aim, he succeeds, though his actions also deeply hurt her. Ron, in turn, had become upset and angry after hearing that Hermione had kissed Viktor. Meanwhile, Cormac McLaggen casts his roving eye upon Hermione, and despite his obnoxious, narcissistic personality, she invites him to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party to retaliate against Ron. Her plan backfires, however, when she must actively deflect McLaggen's amorous advances. 

Ron apparently remains oblivious to Hermione's feelings, as well as to his own, at least until late in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. The Twins give Ron a book on how to charm witches, and Ron reveals early in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' that he has been secretly applying its techniques to Hermione, who responds favourably. However, their budding romance seems abruptly ended when Ron, angry at Harry, deserts the mission, and she refuses to go with him. When Ron returns, Hermione is so enraged that he abandoned her and Harry that she has to be physically restrained from attacking him. She eventually forgives him, and Ron shows a new-found maturity and self-reliance that Hermione truly comes to admire. This strengthens their bond until they finally declare their love for one another, late in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. They eventually get married and have two children, Rose and Hugo, as told in the epilogue of that book.

'''The Weasley Family''' 

Hermione becomes good friends with Ginny Weasley, and often stays with the Weasley family. She gets on well with them, except during ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' when Mrs. Weasley, wrongly believing Harry and Hermione are now dating, spurns Hermione after Rita Skeeter's news article falsely implies that Hermione is also toying with Viktor Krum.

Hermione, along with Ron, becomes a Gryffindor prefect, but she, unlike Ron, finds it difficult to overlook the Weasley Twins' frequent pranks and unsanctioned business activities at the school. She does show more fondness for Percy Weasley than other characters do, perhaps because their personalities are somewhat similar. 

'''Harry Potter'''

While Hermione and Harry remain close during the series, their relationship never becomes romantic, despite many fans' hopes that it would. Each is an only child, raised by Muggles, and they entered the Wizarding world at the same time. These common ties eventually bond them like brother and sister, as well as best friends. Their later marrying into the same family further cements their relationship. From as early as the first book, hints are laid that a romantic relationship is developing between Hermione and Ron, while there are no such clues that anything other than a platonic friendship exists between Harry and Hermione. By ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,'' Ron and Hermione's growing attraction is so obvious that not only is Harry noting it, he worries it could affect his own relationship with each one, possibly leaving him without his two best friends should they get together and exclude him, or, if they break up, forcing Harry to choose between them. 

Among Harry's peers, Hermione always remains loyal and never doubts his intent, while offering sage advice whenever she feels it is needed. She steadfastly supports Harry without seeking anything in return. Even Ron, jealous over Harry's celebrity, and later, frustrated with Dumbledore's mission, briefly deserts Harry and Hermione. Throughout the series, it is Hermione who always loyally remains by Harry's side. She, however, has felt the brunt of Harry's (and Ron's) wrath and nearly lost both boys' friendship forever after she reported to McGonagall that Harry received an expensive broomstick from an anonymous sender. Despite the broom possibly being cursed, Harry, concerned only with flying on his new prize, refused to consider that a Dark enemy could have sent the gift as a deadly weapon. Both he and Ron cruelly shun Hermione, leaving her devastated by the long estrangement, though the three eventually reconcile. 

Hermione once again experiences Harry's displeasure after her spell accidentally breaks his wand during their frantic escape from Bathilda Bagshot's house in ''Deathly Hallows''. Even though she saved both their lives, Harry's gratitude suddenly goes missing when, focused only on his lost wand, he rather brusquely avoids Hermione, upsetting her. Harry quickly recovers, however, and realizes just how heroically Hermione acted.     

'''Professor Dumbledore'''

Hermione's relationships with Professor Dumbledore should also be noted. Though they had little direct interaction throughout the series, Dumbledore recognized Hermione's many talents and superior intellect, as well as the important role she would likely play in Harry's mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. Dumbledore may have arranged for her to retrieve some restricted Dark magic books from the Headmaster's office to aid the quest, as she easily summons them through an open window shortly after his death. Further evidence that Dumbledore intended for Hermione (and Ron) to join Harry's mission, is shown by his having bequeathed her a book of fairy tales containing a vital clue about the Deathly Hallows. Hermione greatly admired Professor Dumbledore, and she, unlike Harry, understood that his earlier flaws actually made him into the great man and wizard he eventually became. She helps Harry regain his faith in the Headmaster by showing him that Dumbledore ''chose'' to overcome his earlier failings to instead follow a light path. 

'''Rubeus Hagrid'''

Hermione also grows close to Hagrid, though less than Harry, but more so than Ron. Even though Hermione is the student, her mature advice often guides the gentle, and sometimes child-like, giant as much as he protects her. Knowing that the bigoted Dolores Umbridge has targeted Hagrid and all non-humans and half-humans at Hogwarts for unfair dismissal, Hermione strongly urges him to only use Ministry-approved animals in his Magical Creatures class. Unfortunately, he ignores her warning, giving Umbridge more cause to sack him when some students are slightly injured. Hermione also agrees to help Hagrid civilize his half-brother, Grawp, a full-blooded giant. It is Hagrid who is instrumental in healing the rift between Hermione, and Harry and Ron in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', realizing how deeply the boys' estrangement has hurt her and how much she values their friendship. She, in turn, helps Hagrid defend Buckbeak, the Hippogriff that was unjustly condemned to death, and consoles Hagrid shortly before the scheduled execution. She and Harry later save Buckbeak (and Sirius Black), much to Hagrid's delight and relief, though Hagrid never learns her part in that rescue as far as we are told.

Hermione's romantic relationships with Ron and other characters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Hermione Granger|is covered in more depth here]].

== Analysis ==

Hermione is an integral part of &quot;the Trio&quot;, but unlike Harry, who is the &quot;hero&quot;, and Ron, the &quot;sidekick,&quot; her role is more difficult to define, though she is the stabilizing force among the three. It is clear that, without her vast intellect and meticulous planning, the other two would never have succeeded in Dumbledore's quest to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. Whereas Harry begins losing faith in Dumbledore, and Ron loses faith in Harry (causing him to temporarily depart the quest), Hermione remains steadfast, determined, and loyal to Harry, and always believing in Dumbledore and his mission. In some ways, she assumes Dumbledore's role, gently guiding Harry and Ron with her logical, wise advice, while keeping her eye on the ultimate goal: defeating Voldemort. However, Hermione's erudite, bossy, and overly-cautious personality can annoy both Harry and Ron, though these traits soften somewhat over time.

Of the Trio, Hermione seems the most rational, though she is occasionally high-strung. She is consistently the best student at Hogwarts in almost every subject and would almost certainly have become Head Girl had she stayed at Hogwarts for her seventh year. Failure is Hermione's deepest fear, and she seems to have an near obsessive-compulsive drive to achieve the highest marks and to follow all rules, though she has gradually mellowed with regard to the latter in later books, if she feels it is justified.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As in the Muggle world, the Wizarding realm is contaminated with institutional prejudice, insensitivity, and racism. Hermione introduces a feminist viewpoint and becomes a champion for the downtrodden. Several times, Hermione reminds Harry and Ron that an unknown &quot;he&quot; they are discussing could, in fact, be a woman. She confounds bigots like Draco Malfoy with her Muggle-born brilliance. One of her ongoing ambitions is to secure the advancement and rights of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]] and other intelligent, magical non-humans who have been enslaved or suppressed by wizards. Hermione becomes a one-person symbol of civil rights activism and social progress.

== Overview ==

'''''Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore''''' was the Headmaster of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], a Grand Sorcerer decorated with the Order of Merlin, First Class; also Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] describes him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|at one point]] as &quot;barking.&quot; Non-British readers should be aware that this adjective is commonly used in England to modify the word &quot;mad&quot;, but without the negative connotations of the word &quot;raving&quot; that is similarly used in the US. Someone who is &quot;barking mad&quot; in the UK is fully functional, but exhibits a very high degree of harmless eccentricity.

According to the author, Dumbledore was born in 1881, and appears to be around 115 years old. &lt;!-- Note to prospective editors: Recent revelations of Dumbledore's sexual orientation are not germane to most of the story. They only affect Dumbledore's interaction with Grindelwald and will be in the Greater Picture section only. Attempts to sensationalize his sexual orientation will be reverted. --&gt;

Dumbledore's wand is Elder, a wood representing banishing, prosperity, protection, renewal, and healing. Elder is also believed to intermingle both good and evil, and its flowers produce a strong odor suggesting death. The wand's inner core contains a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|thestral]] tail hair that [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 the author has stated is], &quot;a powerful and tricky substance that can be mastered only by a witch or wizard capable of facing death.&quot;

=== Etymology ===

The etymology of the character's name is:
* '''Albus''': From the Latin meaning ''white'' or ''bright''.
* '''Percival''': From the Old Welsh &quot;peredur&quot; meaning ''warrior of the cauldron''.  
* '''Wulfric''': From the Old English &quot;wulf&quot; ''wolf'', and &quot;ric&quot; ''mighty, powerful, rich, wealthy''. 
* '''Brian''': From the old Celtic &quot;bre&quot; meaning ''hill'', ''high'', or ''noble''. 
* '''Dumbledore''': A compound of &quot;dumble&quot; (similar to ''bumble'') and Middle English &quot;dore&quot; meaning a ''buzzing flying insect'' (such as a ''bee'').

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], two wizards, Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] arrive to leave Harry, an orphaned infant, with his only remaining family, the Dursleys. Dumbledore places him on the Dursleys' doorstep, along with a letter for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|the baby's aunt]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is re-introduced to the Wizarding world ten years later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] tells him that Dumbledore is a powerful wizard and probably the only one the Dark wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], ever feared.

At the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, Dumbledore rises to say a few words. &quot;And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!&quot; Harry wonders aloud if the Headmaster is a bit mad, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] admits he probably is, but also a genius. Dumbledore also issues a warning that, &quot;the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.&quot; When Harry asks if Dumbledore is serious, Percy responds he must be.

Dumbledore remains a remote figure until Christmas when he discovers Harry gazing endlessly at his dead family's reflections in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]]. Dumbledore explains that the mirror shows only people's desires, not what they truly are. The mirror is moved and Dumbledore requests Harry not look for it again. Dumbledore, apparently able to see through Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], suggests there are other ways to be invisible. 

At the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] seems surprised that Professor Dumbledore is attending. Harry, mistrusting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] as the referee, catches the Snitch quickly, ending the match. Afterwards, Dumbledore tells Harry he is pleased that the Mirror of Erised no longer dominates Harry's thoughts.

Believing Snape is stealing the Philosopher's Stone, Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] (also known as the Trio) rush to warn Dumbledore, only to learn he was suddenly called to London. Harry decides to protect the Stone himself, overcoming the final obstacles to reach it and face Voldemort.

In the Hospital Wing, Dumbledore explains he was summoned to London as a ruse, but returned in time to save Harry. Dumbledore is particularly proud of the last protective barrier in the chamber, it involving the Mirror of Erised. He partially explains why events have occurred, though he refuses to say why Voldemort intended to kill Harry.

At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore awards last-minute House points: fifty points each to Ron and Hermione, and sixty to Harry, for saving the Philosopher's Stone. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] is awarded ten points for bravery, Gryffindor is catapulted from last place into the lead, winning them the House trophy.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Dumbledore disciplines [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] after they crash into the Whomping Willow with Mr. Weasley's flying car, sternly warning them that breaking another rule will get them expelled.

Mrs. Norris ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]'s cat) is found Petrified and suspicion falls upon Harry. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] suggests Harry knows more than he admits, Dumbledore ignores the accusations and dismisses Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] without punishment.  

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]] is also found Petrified, and Dumbledore concludes that the Chamber of Secrets has been re-opened and Hogwarts is unsafe. Soon after, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] are also Petrified. Circumstantial evidence begins mounting against Harry, but Dumbledore believes he is innocent. He asks Harry if anything is troubling him. Harry, who has been hearing strange voices, responds negatively.

When the diary of T. Riddle shows Harry the events of fifty years previous, Harry sees a much younger Albus Dumbledore in the halls. It is than that we learn that Dumbledore's hair had been auburn fifty years earlier.

Dumbledore accompanies [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] hut when the Minister arrests him on suspicion of releasing a monster from the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore's attempt to dissuade Fudge fails. The twelve school governors, here represented by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], have also temporarily relieved Dumbledore as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts']] Headmaster, citing a failure of confidence. 

When Harry enters the Chamber of Secrets to rescue [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], he meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], a memory stored in a 50-year-old diary who boasts that he caused Dumbledore's expulsion. Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]] and Dumbledore's animal familiar. Fawkes brings the Sorting Hat that produces Godric Gryffindor's sword. Harry slays the monster and destroys the diary and Tom Riddle's memory.

Upon hearing Ginny was taken into the Chamber of Secrets, the governors recall Dumbledore. Several imply that Lucius Malfoy threatened to curse their families had they not supported Dumbledore's removal. Dumbledore, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] await in McGonnagall's office as Harry, Ginny, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] are led from the Chamber by Fawkes. Dumbledore helps explain Ginny's unwitting involvement, saying Tom Riddle and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] are the same person, and Voldemort has hoodwinked wizards more powerful than her.

There are also no consequences for Harry breaking school rules, and Dumbledore assures Harry that, despite similarities to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], he truly belongs in Gryffindor House, not Slytherin. Dumbledore tells him: &quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot; Lucius Malfoy is warned that anyone caught aiding the Dark Lord will be severely punished. Dumbledore also gives Harry the encouragement he needs to free [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], Malfoy's House-elf who helped Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

At the Welcoming Feast, Dumbledore announces that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] are patrolling Hogwarts, hunting the escaped fugitive, Sirius Black. Students are warned that no subterfuge will allow them to bypass the dangerous creatures. He also introduces two new teachers: Rubeus Hagrid (Care of Magical Creatures), and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] (Defence Against the Dark Arts).

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is slightly injured in Hagrid's class. Hagrid is certain Dumbledore will dismiss him. The Trio assure him Dumbledore would never do that.

The fugitive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] slashes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]] portrait, apparently an attempt to enter Gryffindor Tower and attack Harry. Dumbledore orders students to the Great Hall for the night, while teachers search the castle and grounds. Snape questions a recent appointment Dumbledore made, though Dumbledore feels certain that no-one at Hogwarts would have assisted Black.

During the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry blacks out when Dementors stream onto the field. Dumbledore slows his fifty-foot fall, then casts a spell that scatters the Dementors.

Over the Christmas holiday, Dumbledore is among a handful staying at the school. While students and staff are having dinner, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] suddenly predicts Lupin's imminent departure, prompting Dumbledore to mildly reply that Remus is probably not in any immediate danger.

At another Quidditch match, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]], Draco, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], disguised as Dementors to scare Harry, are bowled over by Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] charm. Professor McGonagall disciplines them, then says Professor Dumbledore is approaching.

The Quidditch final is Gryffindor against Slytherin. Gryffindor wins the match, and Dumbledore presents the Cup to the team.

After Buckbeak is condemned, Dumbledore, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walden Macnair|the executioner]] head to Hagrid's hut for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak's]] scheduled execution. Hagrid told the Trio that Dumbledore volunteered to be present.

Following the events in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], Dumbledore speaks privately to Harry and Hermione in the Hospital Wing. Although Dumbledore now knows Sirius Black is innocent, he says no one will believe two under-aged wizards. Even Remus Lupin, being that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]] will have little credibility with authorities. Dumbledore hints that Hermione and Harry should use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time Turner]], saying that two innocent lives may be spared, then locks them into the hospital wing. Harry understands that Dumbledore intends for them to save Sirius and Buckbeak.

Returning several hours in time, Harry and Hermione, hidden, watch as the execution party enters Hagrid's hut. Dumbledore stalls the proceedings, giving Harry and Hermione enough time to escape with Buckbeak, then rescue Sirius. 

After Black and Buckbeak are safely away, Harry and Hermione meet Dumbledore outside the infirmary, where he has just locked in the &quot;other&quot; Harry and Hermione, who have vanished as the timeline rights itself. Shortly after, Snape bursts in, claiming Harry and Hermione aided Black's escapes, though Dumbledore insists they were in the Hospital Wing.

Snape reveals that Lupin is a Werewolf, forcing him to resign. While packing, Lupin tells Harry that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]]'s Animagus form was a stag, the same shape as Harry's Patronus. After Lupin's departure, Dumbledore tells Harry that Sirius admitted that he and James Potter were unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]]. Harry believed it was his father's Patronus, not his own, that scattered the Dementors. Dumbledore says that as long as they are remembered, those who have died never truly leave. &quot;Make no mistake — Prongs (James Potter) rode again last night.&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

At the Hogwarts' Welcome Feast, Dumbledore introduces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Alastor Moody]], the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry notices Moody only drinks from a hip flask. Dumbledore also announces Hogwarts is hosting the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], an inter-school competition that also includes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|the Beauxbatons Academy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]]. Students under 17 are excluded from the tournament.

During Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Professor Moody overrules Hermione's objections to him demonstrating the three Unforgivable Curses, saying Dumbledore wants students to recognize them. Though disapproving, Hermione remains for the demonstration, despite Moody's offer that any student can be excused.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madam Maxime]], the Beauxbatons Headmistress, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]], Durmstrang's Headmaster arrive with their students for the Tournament. Following a feast, Dumbledore introduces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]], who are Triwizard Tournament judges, along with the three Headmasters. Dumbledore explains that eligible students can enter the tournament by placing their name into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]], but once a contestant enters, they are unable to withdraw. The Goblet will select one Champion from each school. 

At the Hallowe'en Feast, Dumbledore announces the Champions as the Goblet selects them: for Durmstrang, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] is chosen for Beauxbatons. The Hogwarts Champion is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]. But Dumbledore is stunned when the Goblet also chooses Harry Potter. Although Harry insists he never entered, Crouch rules that he is magically bound to compete. Dumbledore suspects there is a plot against Harry, while the other school Heads believe he cheated. Noticing Crouch's ill appearance, Dumbledore invites him to stay at the castle, but Crouch declines. 

At the Weighing of the Wands ceremony, Dumbledore rescues Harry from Daily Prophet reporter, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] after she traps Harry for an interview. Dumbledore pointedly remarks about Skeeter's latest unflattering story about him. Dumbledore stays for photo session following the ceremony.

For the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]]. Harry captures a golden dragon egg in the shortest time. Dumbledore scores him a nine out of ten points.

During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], Dumbledore mentions to Karkaroff that he once discovered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|a room filled with chamber pots]], illustrating how no one can know every Hogwarts secret. Dumbledore also dances, rather awkwardly but without embarrassment, with the exceedingly tall Madame Maxime.

Rita Skeeter publishes a scurrilous story revealing Hagrid's half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]] ancestry. Hagrid, mortified, retreats into seclusion. When Hermione, Harry, and Ron go to Hagrid's hut to console him, they find Dumbledore there. Dumbledore advises Hagrid that he must ignore the press, and relates how his own [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|brother]] was once pilloried in the press, then simply went on as before. Dumbledore orders Hagrid to return to work on Monday.

After Moody prevents [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] from catching Harry out after hours, Moody tells him that Dumbledore believes in second chances, whereas he and Mr. Crouch do not. Harry wonders what Snape, a suspected former Death Eater, had done to deserve a second chance.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], Dumbledore is present when Harry surfaces from the lake with his rescued &quot;hostages.&quot; Dumbledore determines that Harry had arrived at the hostage site first, but remained to ensure all were rescued, putting him over the time limit. Harry is awarded extra points for noble behavior. 

After surveying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task's]] maze, Viktor Krum and Harry are talking when a disheveled Mr. Crouch suddenly appears, rambling incoherently, then demanding to see Dumbledore. Harry returns with Dumbledore, only to find Crouch missing and Krum [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|unconscious]]. Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Enervate|revives]] Krum, then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|summons]] Hagrid, telling him to find Karkaroff. Moody suddenly appears, and Dumbledore has him search for Crouch. Dumbledore orders Harry to remain in his dorm until morning; any messages can wait until then. Harry wonders how Dumbledore knew he was planning to write Sirius.

After experiencing another vision, Harry heads to Dumbledore's office. Outside, he overhears Dumbledore, Cornelius Fudge, and Professor Moody discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] and Bartemius Crouch disappearing. Dumbledore discounts a suggestion that Madam Maxime was involved. Moody detects Harry's presence, and he is invited inside. Dumbledore tells him to remain there until he returns. 

While waiting, Harry peers into a stone basin containing a shimmering substance. Suddenly he finds himself seated alongside Dumbledore in a courtroom, and realizes he is inside a memory. It is Igor Karkaroff's hearing where he agrees to name Death Eaters in exchange for leniency. The image shifts to Ludo Bagman's trial for passing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] secrets to a Death Eater. Finally, four people stand accused of torturing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]] into insanity. Bartemius Crouch, the prosecutor, sentences his own son, Barty Jr. to Azkaban prison. A second Dumbledore appears and returns Harry to the office. Dumbledore identifies the stone basin as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], a useful place to store memories and study thought patterns.

Dumbledore concludes Harry's summer dream was no ordinary one, and believes Harry's scar hurts whenever Voldemort is nearby or feels intense emotions. Dumbledore also reveals that Neville's parents, Frank and Alice Longbottom, never regained their sanity and permanently reside at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. Dumbledore requests Harry keep this confidential, it is for Neville to tell others. Also, neither Snape or Ludo Bagman has been connected with anything Dark since the trials; Finally, Dumbledore wishes Harry luck in the Third Task.

Sirius writes Harry that he should be safe under Dumbledore's protection. At the Third Task, Dumbledore watches as the four Champions enter the maze and is waiting as Harry returns, bearing Cedric Diggory's body. Amid the confusion, he orders Harry to remain where he is; but Harry, distraught and confused, is led away by Moody. Shortly, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape, burst into Moody's office, stunning Moody, an imposter. Dumbledore has Snape fetch Veritaserum, a truth potion, then frees the real Moody trapped in a trunk. The imposter is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch, Jr.]], disquised by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]. Dumbledore knew the real Moody would never have moved Harry after Dumbledore told him to stay put. Barty confesses the Triwizard Cup was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] that transported Harry (and also Cedric Diggory) to Lord Voldemort to be murdered.

Sirius is waiting as Harry and Dumbledore arrive in the Headmaster's office. Harry is tired and weak, but Dumbledore wants him to relate what happened after touching the Triwizard Cup. Dumbledore seems particularly interested that Voldemort used Harry's blood to resurrect his body. Dumbledore also explains that when two wands sharing a common core are forced to duel, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect forces one wand to disgorge its most recent spells; that is why Harry saw his parents' images. Dumbledore and Sirius escort Harry to the Hospital Wing, where Mrs. Weasley, Bill Weasley, Ron, and Hermione are waiting.

When Dumbledore returns to the infirmary, an angry McGonagall reports that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] has sucked out Barty's soul on Fudge's order. Fudge defends his actions, claiming Barty believed he was acting on Voldemort's behalf, therefore his testimony would be suspect. Dumbledore maintains Barty ''was'' following Voldemort's direct orders, though Fudge disputes Harry's account that Voldemort has returned. Fudge storms out, the two men's differences permanently dividing them.

Dumbledore orders Bill Weasley to report everything that has happened to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|his father]] and asks McGonagall to bring Hagrid and Madame Maxime to his office. He requests that Sirius and Snape call a truce and work together, then sends Sirius to gather &quot;the old crowd&quot;: Remus Lupin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Arabella Figg]]. Snape is sent on the mission he and Dumbledore previously discussed. Hagrid and Madam Maxime also have a secret mission.

When Harry is discharged from the Hospital Wing, Ron and Hermione tell him that Dumbledore addressed the school about what happened. Mrs. Weasley asked Dumbledore if Harry could spend the summer at the Burrow, but Harry must first stay at Privet Drive.

At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore gives a tribute to Cedric Diggory, explaining that Lord Voldemort murdered him. The Ministry would object to him revealing this, but truth is better than lies. He also toasts Harry for risking his life to return Cedric's body. Finally, addressing Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, he says they will always be welcome at Hogwarts, as all must stand together against dark forces.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===


During the summer, Harry and Dudley are attacked by Dementors that Harry repels with a Patronus. Dumbledore rushes to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to intercede in any hasty punitive action against Harry for using underaged magic. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] message to Aunt Petunia, likely from Dumbledore, admonishes her after she attempts to eject Harry from the Dursley house. Shaken, she tells Vernon that Harry must stay.

Harry is quickly moved to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]] at Number 12, Grimmauld Place where he is re-united with Sirius. Ron and Hermione are also there, but Harry is vexed they never responded to his queries about Voldemort, though Dumbledore ordered them to reveal nothing; they actually know little more than Harry. Harry is also perturbed after Dumbledore selects Ron (and also Hermione) as a Gryffindor prefect, but not him. Harry learns that the Order is a secret group fighting Voldemort; they remain undercover because the Ministry of Magic officially claims Voldemort never returned. Dumbledore, who has publicly stated that Voldemort was resurrected, has been openly ridiculed and removed from many important Wizarding posts.

Harry is later allowed to ask questions about Voldemort and the Order. Voldemort, he is told, remains unseen as he regains strength and gathers more followers. Harry foiled Voldemort's plan by escaping the cemetery and informing the one person Voldemort least wanted to know he had returned: Dumbledore. The Order's Headquarters is protected by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius charm]], and Dumbledore is the Secret-keeper.

Shortly before Harry's hearing at the Ministry, Dumbledore visits Headquarters without speaking to Harry, upsetting him. At the hearing, Dumbledore appears as a surprise witness, defending Harry brilliantly, citing that underage wizards are allowed to use magic in self defence. He introduces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]], who has been secretly guarding Harry at Privet Drive. She testifies that Dementors attacked Harry. After defusing Fudge's accusations, Dumbledore suggests that someone within the Ministry must have sent the Dementors. When Harry is exonerated, Dumbledore immediately departs without a word to Harry, leaving Harry further frustrated.

At the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, Dumbledore gives his customary speech, then introduces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], a Ministry official and spy, as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. She inappropriately rises to give her own speech, though only Hermione seems able to follow her deadly dull words. Harry learns later that some wizard families were concerned about their children returning to Hogwarts, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan's]] parents, who feel Dumbledore may be &quot;losing it&quot; by insisting Voldemort has been resurrected.

Harry remains upset that Dumbledore continually avoids him. Hermione suggests that Dumbledore has probably not mentioned Hagrid's absence to avoid calling attention to it, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]] thinks Dumbledore's influence allowed the Gryffindor Quidditch team to reform after Umbridge's Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four banned it. Sirius tells Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Umbridge was foisted on the school because Cornelius Fudge suspects Dumbledore is training students to create a secret wizard army to overthrow the Ministry. That is why Umbridge's classes are deliberately ineffectual. In response, Harry secretly forms his own defensive arts group named, &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|''Dumbledore's Army'']]&quot;. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] suggests they use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], Harry remembers Dumbledore mentioning it at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. When Hagrid returns, he tells Harry, Hermione, and Ron that Dumbledore sent him and Madame Maxime to secretly contact the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]] and persuade them to join Dumbledore.

Just before Christmas, Harry has a vision that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] is being attacked by a snake. Without looking directly at Harry, Dumbledore questions him about the attack. Dumbledore sends two Headmaster portraits to investigate and has Professor McGonagall bring the other Weasley children to his office. Word is sent to Sirius at Headquarters that guests are arriving before Dumbledore transports Harry and the Weasley children to Grimmauld Place by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]]. As Dumbledore and Harry briefly make eye contact, Harry feels the snake welling within, ready to strike the Headmaster.

Dumbledore never appears at Headquarters during the holidays, and, fearing Voldemort is possessing him, Harry decides to leave to protect the Order. Phineas Nigellus' portrait delivers Dumbledore's urgent message stating, &quot;Stay where you are.&quot; Harry complies. Soon after, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] arrives with unwelcome news: Dumbledore wants Snape to teach Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]]. No further explanation is given.

Harry &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort discussing a plan with a Death Eater, who says [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery's]] idea would not work. Still resentful over Dumbledore ignoring him, Harry childishly refuses Ron's suggestion that he report his vision to Dumbledore

Dumbledore countermands Umbridge's dismissing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] by allowing her to remain in the castle. He invokes his power to fill the vacancy himself, then introduces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]], as the new Divination teacher, further infuriating an already livid Umbridge.

Umbridge dispatches her Inquisitorial Squad to capture Dumbledore's Army. Only Dobby's timely tip-off allows all members, except Harry, to escape. Harry is ushered to the Headmaster's office where Dumbledore, along with Professor McGonagall, Umbridge, Cornelius Fudge, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] are waiting. Also present are two [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]]: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], who is actually an Order of the Phoenix member. 

Dumbledore disputes Umbridge's claims that Harry held an illegal meeting at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]], noting it occurred before her Educational Decree took effect. Umbridge provides a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|witness]] to additional meetings, but a discrete [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|Memory charm]] cast by Kingsley leaves the girl befuddled. Exasperated, Fudge then claims that a membership roster titled, &quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot; proves Dumbledore is creating a secret army, to which Dumbledore pleasantly concurs. As the Aurors attempt to arrest Dumbledore, they, Fudge, and Umbridge are knocked unconscious amid flashing Phoenix fire. Dumbledore escapes with Fawkes.

Months pass without any word from Dumbledore, while the Headmaster's office remains magically sealed off, preventing anyone but a true Headmaster from entering. Harry suspects Dumbledore is secluded inside. When Umbridge catches Harry using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] in her office to call Sirius, Hermione claims they were contacting Dumbledore about a secret weapon he ordered them to build. They lead her to the non-existent weapon in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], where angry Centaurs carry Umbridge away.

Dumbledore reappears at the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry of Magic]] and captures nearly all the Death Eaters, except [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Voldemort arrives and he and Dumbledore fiercely duel; Voldemort possesses Harry, whose overwhelming feelings of love, friendship, and loyalty drive out Voldemort. Ministry wizards and Aurors, including Fudge, arrive, seeing Voldemort before he and Bellatrix escape. Dumbledore sends Harry to his office by Portkey, then grants Fudge a half-an-hour's explanation before he returns to Hogwarts.

Reinstated as Headmaster, Dumbledore comforts Harry, who is distraught over Sirius' death. Dumbledore admits he made mistakes, such as never revealing a prophecy to Harry stating that either Harry or Voldemort must die at the hand of the other. He had avoided Harry to prevent Voldemort from probing Harry's mind about Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore also explains he did not choose Harry to be a prefect because, &quot;I felt... that you already had... enough responsibilities to be going on with.&quot;

Dumbledore regains his posts in the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards. He also fetches Dolores Umbridge from the Centaurs; Umbridge, traumatized and unable speak, eventually flees the school's Hospital Wing.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] === 

Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive to collect Harry, who is delighted to be leaving his detested home after only a fortnight. Harry has inherited Sirius' property, including the house at Grimmauld Place, Kreacher, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], but a charm may exist that magically leaves everything to Bellatrix Lestrange. Dumbledore summons Kreacher, who immediately obeys Harry's command, proving Harry is Sirius' heir. Kreacher is then sent to work in Hogwarts kitchens. Dumbledore chastises the Dursleys for over-indulging Dudley while abusing Harry, saying he had requested they treat Harry as their own. After departing, Harry notices Dumbledore's blackened and dead-looking hand, but Dumbledore defers an explanation.

Dumbledore must also recruit a new teacher, and he and Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] to Budleigh Babberton, a tiny village. Inside a small house, Harry and Dumbledore discover destruction. Dumbledore pokes an overturned armchair which springs into the fat, bald wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], who is hiding from Voldemort. Dumbledore surmised Slughorn staged the scene because there was no [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] over the house. When Slughorn declines Dumbledore's offer to resume his old teaching post, Dumbledore briefly leaves Harry alone with Slughorn, who is fascinated by the famous boy wizard. Upon returning, Dumbledore makes one final offer, but seemingly defeated, he and Harry prepare to leave. Slughorn suddenly accepts the post.

Apparating to The Burrow, Dumbledore draws Harry aside, suggesting he tell Ron and Hermione about the Prophecy. He also requests that Harry always carry his Invisibility Cloak with him during the coming year, and says they will be having private lessons.

At the Arrival Feast, Dumbledore announces two new staff appointments: Horace Slughorn is the new Potions master, while Professor Snape becomes the new Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. With Voldemort's reappearance, new protective spells have been placed around the school; Dumbledore asks for the students' patience and cooperation.

Rather than studying magic, Harry and Dumbledore will instead review and extend Dumbledore's research into Voldemort. Peering into the Pensieve, they view memories belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]], a Ministry representative arriving at the Gaunt home. Ogden is attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]], who speaks to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|his father]], and watches the byplay between them and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], as the Muggle Tom Riddle rides by. Dumbledore explains that Marvolo Gaunt may be Tom Riddle Jr.'s (Voldemort) grandfather. Merope is Voldemort's mother, and the handsome Muggle is his father, Tom Riddle. The homely Merope magically ensnared Riddle Sr., though, for reasons unknown, the enchantment lapsed, and he abandoned her. Merope died soon after Tom, Jr's birth. Dumbledore asks Harry that this information go no further than Ron and Hermione. Harry notices a broken ring on Dumbledore's desk is the same one in Ogden's memory. It is the signet of the Peverells, an old pure-blood Wizarding family. 

Dumbledore is absent until mid-October; when he returns, he tells Harry that Professor Snape, experienced with Dark magic, has done everything possible for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], who was injured by a cursed necklace apparently intended for someone else. Harry suspects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] was behind the attack, and Dumbledore assures him that Draco will be investigated. He also reassures Harry that Mundungus Fletcher will never steal another item from Grimmauld Place. Returning to their lesson, Dumbledore says Merope Gaunt, alone and pregnant, went to London and sold some valuables to survive, apparently unable or unwilling to use magic. In the Pensieve, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Caractacus Burke|Caractacus Burke]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burke's]] gloats over purchasing Slytherin's locket for ten Galleons. Harry is outraged by Burke's avarice. Next, the younger Dumbledore visits the orphanage where Tom Riddle, Jr. lives. The matron recounts Tom's unsavoury behavior, and says that two children, absent with Tom at a seaside outing, returned terrified.

Tom is initially suspicious upon meeting Dumbledore, though the professor convinces the boy he is a wizard and can attend a school for magic. As proof, Dumbledore performs magic. Tom is offered financial support, but he insists on finding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] by himself. Dumbledore, worried about Tom Riddle's cruelty, ambition, thieving, and his reaction to learning he was a wizard, resolved to closely watch him. Even then, Tom set himself apart, apparently friendless. Tom also liked collecting trophies. 

Dumbledore is flattered when Harry, having angrily rebuffed new Minister for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour's]] attempt to recruit him as a Ministry poster boy, considers Scrimgeour's slur that he is &quot;Dumbledore's man&quot;, as a compliment. Harry also relates a conversation between Snape and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], in which Draco refused Snape's assistance, even though Snape is sworn to help him. Dumbledore assures Harry he trusts Snape. 

They proceed to memories about Riddle's Hogwarts days when Tom was gathering a core group, later loyal Death Eaters. The first memory shows Tom appearing in the Gaunt shack. After learning Tom's identity, Morfin tells him about his mother, Merope, and Muggle father, Tom Sr. Everything suddenly goes black. When Morfin awoke, the entire Riddle family was dead via a spell cast by Morfin's wand, and the Peverell ring was missing.

The second memory shows the much younger Professor Slughorn and his &quot;Slug Club&quot; group, including Tom Riddle, now about fifteen and wearing the Peverell ring. When Tom asks about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], the memory becomes cloudy and only Slughorn's voice is heard. This memory has been altered, and Dumbledore tasks Harry with retrieving Slughorn's unedited version. Later, Hagrid tells Harry he overheard Dumbledore and Snape having a disagreement. Snape seemed reluctant about something he agreed to do. Dumbledore firmly reminded Snape he had given his word. Dumbledore also mentioned Snape's investigations into Slytherin, which Hagrid assumes is about the cursed necklace.

At their next meeting, Dumbledore is disappointed by Harry's failure to obtain Slughorn's memory. Without it, there will be little point in proceeding. Harry makes it his top priority. The lesson continues as they now enter a realm of deep speculation. The first memory belongs to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], a House-elf belonging to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]]. Hepzibah claims to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff's]] descendent. Tom Riddle, now a buyer for Borgin &amp; Burke's, makes Hepzibah an offer for Helga Hufflepuff's cup and Salazar Slytherin's locket. Tom has difficulty releasing the locket, particularly after hearing Burke paid some poor witch a pittance for it. Dumbledore says Hepzibah died two days later. Hokey, believing she had accidentally poisoned her mistress, was punished, but Hepzibah's treasures were never found. At about the same time, Riddle left Borgin &amp; Burke's.

The second memory is Dumbledore's, ten years later. Riddle is seeking the Defence Against the Dark Arts post. He was previously declined a teaching position by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Armando Dippet|then Headmaster, Armando Dippet]], citing his inexperience. Dumbledore, noting Tom's changed appearance, refuses to use his new name (Lord Voldemort), and knows about his Death Eaters and recent activities. Distrusting Tom's motives, Dumbledore rejects his application. Ever since, any Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has never lasted longer than one year.

After sipping some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|good luck potion]], Harry obatains Slughorn's memory, and takes it to Dumbledore. They revisit the Slug Club memory. Slughorn is describing to Tom Riddle how a soul can be split by committing murder; the torn fragment can then be encased in a physical object, tying it to the Earth, ensuring immortality. Slughorn is horrified when Riddle suggests splitting the soul multiple times. And is not seven the most magical number?

Dumbledore speculates that Voldemort divided his soul into seven pieces, six Horcruxes in all, with the damaged portion left in Voldemort's body. As long as any Horcrux remains, Voldemort is immortal. Dumbledore believes the Horcruxes are unique objects. Two have been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary and the Peverell ring. Dumbledore reveals he injured his hand while destroying the ring. Only his skill and Snape's timely action contained the damage. Dumbledore believes Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket are Horcruxes, and one will likely be a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw artifact. The last one may be Voldemort's snake, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]]. Voldemort's soul may be too shredded for him to detect when a Horcrux is destoyed. If all his Horcruxes are eliminated, then Harry can kill Voldemort. It is Harry's capacity to love and make choices that gives him power Voldemort lacks. Dumbledore tells Harry he can accompany him when he locates another Horcrux. 
 
Harry becomes enraged when he learns it was Snape who revealed Trelawney's prophecy's second half to Voldemort, but Dumbledore reiterates that he trusts Snape. He then says he has found another Horcrux. Harry can accompany him, but must promise absolute obedience. Harry reluctantly agrees.

Dumbledore and Harry Apparate to the same sea side cliff young Tom Riddle took his two fellow orphans, terrifying them. Inside a cave, Dumbledore offers his blood to open a hidden doorway leading into another cavern containing a lake; a green glow is at the lake's center. Unable to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] the Horcrux, Dumbledore and Harry set off in a tiny boat. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Dead bodies]] are floating in the water, which Dumbledore assures Harry are harmless as long as they are only floating.

The green light is emmanating from a basin on a tiny island. A potion inside covers the locket, which Dumbledore guesses can only be removed by drinking the liquid. He makes Harry promise to force him to drink everything. The potion's effect is horrific, causing intense pain, terrible memories, and intense raving as Dumbledore pleads with Harry to kill him. The locket is retrieved, and as Harry draws water from the lake for Dumbledore to drink, he is seized by Inferi. Dumbledore revives enough to conjure fire to repel the creatures, freeing Harry. 

Making it back to the cliff, Dumbledore Apparates them to Hogsmeade before collapsing. Before Harry can fetch Snape as Dumbledore requests, Madam Rosmerta appears, saying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] is over the school. Summoning brooms from a pub, Harry and Dumbledore fly to the Astronomy Tower, Dumbledore muttering charms to allow them passage through the protective spells.

Atop the Tower, Dumbledore, hearing someone approach, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrifies]] Harry under his Invisibilty Cloak to protect him. Draco Malfoy appears and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Dumbledore. But distraught and frightened, he is unable to complete his task - to kill Dumbledore. Draco has helped Death Eaters enter the school through a secret passage. Four Death Eaters, then Snape, suddenly appear. Fulfilling his Unbreakable Vow to Draco's mother, Snape blasts Dumbledore with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]], catapulting his body over the wall.

The school remains open until after Dumbledore's funeral, allowing all students to pay their last respects. Many Wizarding denizens attend the funeral, then a white tomb magically appears, surrounding Dumbledore's body. 

Everyone, including Harry, believes Snape a traitor, though Dumbledore's trust in him never wavered. It is unclear whether Snape actually betrayed Dumbledore or was acting under unknown circumstances. Regardless, Harry vows to destroy both Voldemort and Snape. Harry also discovers that someone whose initials are R.A.B. replaced the real Horcrux with a fake locket.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Although Albus Dumbledore is dead, his influence lives on. His obituary in the ''Daily Prophet'', written by his old friend,  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Elphias Doge|Elphias Doge]], states that Dumbledore's father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percival Dumbledore|Percival]], was sentenced to Azkaban for attacking three Muggle children. Albus overcame the notoriety by excelling at Hogwarts, while his brother, Aberforth, preferred settling arguments by dueling rather than debate. As Albus and Elphias were about to embark on a world tour, Dumbledore's mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] suddenly died, forcing Albus to support the family. Shortly after, Albus' younger sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] also died. Following these tragedies, Albus went on to many notable achievements, including defeating the Dark wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]].

A teaser in the ''Daily Prophet'' about Rita Skeeter's new book suggests that Dumbledore dabbled in Dark magic, that Ariana was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]], and Aberforth and Albus were estranged. It also implies that Dumbledore and Grindelwald's epic duel was something other than it seemed, and hints that Dumbledore's relationship with Harry may have been less than savoury. Harry is stunned and outraged by these revelations, but realizes he hardly knew Dumbledore; their conversations were mostly about Harry. 

The Order has moved its Headquarters from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] to The Burrow. As Dumbledore was the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]], his death enables any person, including Snape, who knew Grimmauld's location to divulge its location to anyone.

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione prepare for Dumbledore's mission, Hermione comments on how easily she Summoned the Dark magic books from Dumbledore's study, almost as if Dumbledore intended for her to retrieve them. Harry relates Slughorn's memory regarding Tom Riddle and his Horcruxes, and they wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring Horcrux. Harry has packed a shard from the broken two-way mirror Sirius gave him. In it, Harry continually glimpses a blue flash, similar to Dumbledore's eye colour. 

While at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]], Harry &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort's thoughts. Hermione urges him to close the connection, but Dumbledore believed Voldemort found Harry's emotions to be so disturbing to him (at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]), that he is unlikely to possess him again.

Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour arrives to present Harry, Ron, and Hermione their bequests from Dumbledore's will, but only after the Ministry closely examined them. Ron receives a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]], a magical device for extinguishing lights, (seen in chapter 1 of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]). For Hermione, an old edition of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. And to Harry, the Golden Snitch from his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore also bequeathed Harry the Sword of Gryffindor, but Scrimgeour insists Dumbledore was never its owner; it remains at Hogwarts. Hermione later speculates that Scrimgeour probably wanted Harry to hold the Snitch because it has a &quot;flesh memory&quot;, apparently expecting it to react when Harry touched it. Harry reminds her that he caught the Snitch in his mouth. Pressing the gold ball to his lips, Dumbledore's handwriting appears on it reading, &quot;I open at the close.&quot; Its meaning leaves the Trio mystified.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, Harry asks Elphias Doge about Skeeter's claims. Elphias insists Ariana Dumbledore was not a Squib, only ill, but the Weasleys' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]] claims she knows that Ariana was never a patient at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]]. Muriel also mentions that the family moved to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] and that Aberforth and Albus got into a fist fight at Ariana's funeral. 

When Death Eaters attack The Burrow, the Trio escapes to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. There they are greeted by Dumbledore's dusty simulacrum, one of the curses placed on the old Headquarters to prevent Severus Snape and Death Eaters from entering.

Remus Lupin arrives and informs the Trio that the Ministry wants Harry for questioning related to Dumbledore's death, while the ''Daily Prophet'' reports that Severus Snape has been appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] are the new Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers. The Carrows were among the Death Eaters present when Dumbledore died. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry of Magic to retrieve Slytherin's Locket Horcrux from Dolores Umbridge. Once inside, Harry recognizes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]], a Death Eater who was present when Dumbledore was killed. While searching Umbridge's office, Harry spots Rita Skeeter's book. The Trio escapes with the Locket Horcrux, but are forced to abandon Grimmauld Place and go on the run. 

Ron maintains Dumbledore would have known if a Horcrux was hidden at Hogwarts, though Harry says Dumbledore never claimed to know all the school's secrets. The Trio learns from Phineas Nigellus' portrait that Dumbledore used Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the ring Horcrux, though the sword that is now at Hogwarts is fake and the real sword's location is unknown. Harry feels angry that Dumbledore left him so little information.

A hand-drawn mark found inside ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' that Dumbledore left Hermione is the same symbol Xeno Lovegood was wearing. It is also Grindelwald's mark. Meanwhile, Harry and Hermione agree that the Sword of Gryffindor could be hidden in Godric's Hollow, possibly left with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], a noted historian. They Apparate to Godric's Hollow. In a church cemetery, Hermione finds the same symbol on Ignotus Peverell's tombstone.

In Skeeter's book, Harry and Hermione find a photo of the teen-aged Dumbledore and his friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. In the chapter, &quot;The Greater Good&quot;. Skeeter writes that Dumbledore returned to Godric's Hollow to head the family, though many residents saw little evidence of that. Aberforth ran wild, and Ariana stayed hidden. That same summer, Bathilda Bagshot took in her grand-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald, a brilliant student who was expelled from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. He and Albus became close friends. In a letter to Gellert, Albus agrees Wizards should dominate Muggles, if it is for &quot;the greater good,&quot; but wizards must rule responsibly. Skeeter claims Dumbledore planned to establish wizards' rule over Muggles, contradicting his later stance supporting Muggle-born wizards and protecting Muggles' rights.

Soon after, Dumbledore and Grindelwald acrimoniously parted, possibly due to Ariana's sudden death. Aberforth blaming Albus for Ariana's demise also seemed connected to Albus and Gellert's relationship. Grindelwald went on to terrorize the European wizard world; for five years, Dumbledore ignored pleas for help before challenging and defeating Grindelwald. Unanswered questions remained: Had Dumbledore's prior relationship with Grindelwald delayed his taking action? If Ariana was a Squib, was her death accidental or a first attempt at implementing The Greater Good?

These revelations cause Harry to suffer another loss: his faith in Dumbledore, who he once believed embodied only goodness and wisdom. Hermione discredits Rita Skeeter's account and doubts that Dumbledore would oppress Muggles, despite what he professed at age seventeen. Instead he chose to fight evil his entire life. Hermione surmises Harry is really angry because Dumbledore never shared this information, which Harry acknowledges that might be true, but he wonders how Dumbledore could leave him such a mess. He is also left doubting Dumbledore's love for him.

Xenophilius Lovegood tells the Trio about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] and the three Peverell brothers. Harry guesses that his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father's]] Invisibility Cloak that Dumbledore once borrowed is a Hallow, and the Ring Horcrux was a Peverell artifact, which Harry suspects may be hidden inside the Golden Snitch. Hermione and Ron, worried Harry is becoming obsessed with the Hallows, urge him to remain focused on only destroying the Horcruxes.

Harry ponders whether Dumbledore deliberately made everything so difficult to give Harry time to work things out. Meanwile, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] tells Harry that the Elder Wand, a Hallow, is apparently undefeatable, though its owner is not. While its history suggests it was passed from wizard to wizard through murder, Ollivander claims only disarming its master is necessary.

Harry realzies that Voldemort seeks the Elder Wand. Grindelwald stole it from Gregorovitch, using it to conquer Europe until Dumbledore defeated him; Dumbledore possessed it ever since. Meanwhile, Harry watches through Voldemort's eyes as he removes the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. Harry wonders if only hunting for the Horcruxes, as Dumbledore wanted, is the correct course. Harry also &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort's violent reaction to learning that the Trio obtained another Horcrux. Voldemort believes Dumbledore, who never trusted him, must be involved. He is uncertain now if he can feel his Horcuxes being destroyed, and goes to check on another.

Arriving in Hogsmeade, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are cornered by Death Eaters, but Aberforth Dumbledore pulls them safely into his pub. Harry spies the twin to Sirius' mirror&amp;mdash;Aberforth has been watching them through it. Aberforth questions Albus' mission, asking if Albus had been completely honest or if Harry ever wondered why three young, unqualified wizards were entrusted with such a dangerous mission. Harry, wracked by doubt, is unable to answer; Aberforth scoffs that Albus learned secrecy at their mother's knee.

Aberforth reveals the truth about his family's past. Young Ariana was injured by Muggle boys who saw her performing magic, leaving her unable to control her powers. Their father, Percival, attacked the boys in retaliation, and, refusing to defend himself, was sentenced to Azkaban, where he died. Their mother, Kendra, moved the family to Godric's Hollow and kept Ariana's condition hidden, spawing rumours she was a Squib.

Ariana's care fell upon Kendra and Aberforth, while Albus immersed himself in his studies, confining himself to his room when at home. When Ariana accidentally killed Kendra with an uncontrolled magical outburst, Albus returned home to care for the family, just as Grindelwald turned up. Aberforth discovered their elaborate scheme to overthrow Muggles, and as a fight broke out, a stray curse killed Ariana. Aberforth claims Albus was glad to be rid of his encumbrance, but Harry says Dumbledore was never freed. After Albus drank the potion in the sea cave, Harry believes the raving Albus was pleading with Grindelwald not to hurt Aberforth and Ariana. Harry avers not to abandon Albus' mission. Surprisingly, Aberforth relents and shows the Trio a secret passage into Hogwarts. He later joins the battle inside the castle.

Prior to the big battle, the Trio, hidden inside the Shrieking Shack, overhears Voldemort discussing the Elder Wand with Snape. Voldemort suspects it performs poorly for him because Snape actually commands it, he being the one who murdered Dumbledore. Voldemort orders Nagini to kill Snape, then leaves. Before Snape dies, Harry captures his memories in a flask that then he empties into the Pensieve. Harry first sees Snape pleading with Dumbledore to protect Harry's mother, Lily, from Voldemort. Next, Snape is anguished over Lily Potter's death. Dumbledore says if Snape truly loved Lily, then he will protect her son when Voldemort returns. Snape grudgingly agrees but demands Dumbledore never tell anyone. In another next memory, Snape is railing about Harry being a bad student, while Dumbledore asks Snape to watch over Professor Quirrell. The scene shifts to Dumbledore and Snape at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. Snape says his and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]]'s Dark Marks are growing more distinct; Dumbledore muses that perhaps students are sorted into their Houses too soon, apparently implying Snape might have been better suited to a different House than Slytherin.

While still in Snape's memories, Harry now sees a semi-conscious Dumbledore, his hand blackened after putting on Marvolo Gaunt's cursed ring. Snape treats him, but he can only slow the curse, not reverse it. Dumbledore has a year to live at most. The ring, now cracked, and the Sword of Gryffindor lie on Dumbledore's desk. Dumbledore says this makes things easier, and discusses Voldemort's plot to have Draco Malfoy murder him. Snape says Voldemort intends for Draco to fail, soley as a means to punish the Malfoys. Dumbledore guesses Voldemort intends that Snape will complete Draco's job, as Voldemort will no longer need a spy at Hogwarts once it falls under his control. Dumbledore demands Snape's promise to watch over the students, and asks that he kill him when the time comes, both to save Draco's soul, and allow Dumbledore to die with dignity. Snape, protesting, asks about his own soul, but Dumbledore responds that only Snape can determine if agreeing to his request will damage it. Snape, reluctantly, gives his word.

In Snape's next memory, Dumbledore is explaining to Snape that he was denied information given to Harry because Snape's mission puts him at a greater risk of being detected. Snape, still angry, threatens to rescind his earlier promise. Later, Dumbledore warns Snape that if Voldemort suddenly becomes protective towards [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], then Harry must be told that he is a seventh, accidental Horcrux; Voldemort must kill Harry before Voldemort can be killed. Snape is deeply dismayed that Dumbledore has only been protecting Harry so Voldemort can kill him. Dumbledore asks if Snape is starting to care about the boy. Snape, denying this, produces his Patronus, a doe, the same as Lily Potter's, who he still loves.

In Snape's next memory, he is talking to Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office. The portrait tells Snape he must give Voldemort the correct date for when Harry leaves [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], if he is to retain Voldemort's trust. Snape is to plant an idea into Mundungus Fletcher's mind to use multiple Harry decoys, disguised by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]].  In Snape's final memory with Dumbledore, Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait has just reported that Harry and Hermione are in the Forest of Dean; Dumbledore's portrait tells Snape to plant the Sword of Gryffindor there for them to find.

Harry knows Voldemort can only be defeated by allowing himself to be killed. After Harry enters Voldemort's camp in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort fires the Killing Curse at him. Harry awakens to find himself in an otherworldly place resembling King's Cross Station. A hideously-flayed, infant-like creature is wailing on the floor. Dumbledore suddenly appears in full health, telling Harry that he (Harry) has not died. When Voldemort used Harry's blood to re-animate himself, he tethered his life to Harry's; Harry cannot die while Voldemort lives. Harry's willingly sacrificing himself now shields his allies from Voldemort. The killing curse Voldemort cast at Harry has destroyed Voldemort's own soul fragment that was clinging to Harry.

Dumbledore also explains he believes that Harry and Voldemort's wands, already sharing a common core, merged even closer when wielded in a duel between two wizards who not only shared blood, but also some of the soul. Harry was the stronger wizard because Voldemort feared death, while Harry was prepared to die. Harry's wand thus imbibed some power from Voldemort's, making it more powerful than any other wand Voldemort used.

Dumbledore asks Harry's forgiveness for withholding information about the Deathly Hallows. As a youth, he was obsessed with them - eager to escape death, and achieve fame and glory. His resentment at having to care for his family made it easy for Gellert Grindelwald to befriend him. They bonded over their search for the Hallows, but wanted them for different reasons. Dumbledore desired the Resurrection Stone to reunite his family, while Grindelwald would have used it to command an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]] army. Grindelwald sought the Elder Wand to defeat the Wizarding realm. Neither were interested in the Invisibility Cloak, both being proficient in Disillusionment charms, though Dumbledore had considered it for concealing Ariana.

Their brief friendship ended when they quarreled over Dumbledore's family obligations. After Ariana was killed, Grindelwald fled to Europe,  beginning his reign of terror. Dumbledore shamefully admits he delayed fighting Grindelwald. After defeating him, he won the Elder Wand, and Grindelwald was imprisoned in Nurmengard, where Voldemort eventually found him; Dumbledore says Grindelwald claimed he never possessed the Elder Wand, perhaps a remorseful last act to protect Dumbledore. Dumbledore identified the gem in the Peverell ring as the Resurrection Stone, another Hallow. He put the ring on, hoping to see his mother and sister again, but the curse protecting it destroyed his hand and shortened his life.

Dumbledore says he withheld information about the Hallows so Harry would avoid the same trap Dumbledore fell into. He wanted Harry to gradually discover their true nature. Death's true master, says Dumbledore, is the the one who does not seek to run from it.

Finally, Dumbledore says Harry can choose to travel on to the &quot;other side&quot; or return to the living world and fight Voldemort. Harry chooses to return, but asks if their conversation has been real or only in his mind. Dumbledore responds that it is in his mind, but that does not make it less real.

After defeating Voldemort, Harry addresses Dumbledore's portrait, saying the Resurrection Stone has been left in the Forbidden Forest, and the Elder Wand will be secretly returned to Dumbledore's tomb, in the hope that its power dies with Harry. The Invisibility Cloak will be passed on to his children. Dumbledore indicates his approval.

In the epilogue, Harry has named his second son Albus Severus, after the two Hogwarts headmasters.

== Strengths ==


Albus Dumbledore is among the greatest wizards who ever lived, though his gentle, eccentric nature belies his prodigious magical talents and superior intellect. Although he confined himself to a quiet teaching career at Hogwarts, he has long been considered a major player in the wizard world, heading many prestigious organizations, and is often consulted by the Ministry of Magic on magical matters. He is also an innovative thinker who freely gives his opinion, and has acted as a rallying point during difficult times, showing great leadership against both implacable foe and arrant stupidity. He is widely believed to be the only wizard Lord Voldemort has ever feared, and is singularly dedicated to defeating the Dark Lord, knowing he would eventually return, despite the Wizarding world's adamant insistence he was long dead. Dumbledore is among the few in the magical realm who has always openly spoken Voldemort's name, believing it is unable to harm anyone. Though he does not fear Voldemort's name, when addressing Voldemort directly, Dumbledore calls him &quot;Tom,&quot; his birth name.

Perhaps unusually for a wizard, Dumbledore is also an inventor, specifically of mechanico-magical devices. His office contains many small, clockwork mechanisms performing unknown functions. We see two devices in action: a small object which, when queried, produces a smoke plume forming into the shape of the object or entity being asked about, and the Deluminator, which apart from storing light sources, also allows the owner to hear conversations about him, and can transport him to where that conversation is taking place. He bequeathed the latter object to Ron Weasley, who was later able to use it, though it appears the Ministry of Magic was unsuccessful in determining these devices' purposes when studying them.

Dumbledore is also generous and fair with those disenfranchised from the wizarding world, believing they deserve equal status. He employs Remus Lupin (a werewolf), Argus Filch, and Mrs. Figg (both squibs), and also Dobby and Winky (free elves no one else would hire). He also employed Rubeus Hagrid as Hogwarts grounds and game keeper after his expulsion from Hogwarts, believing he was innocent, and eventually promoted him to professor (Care of Magical Creatures).

Dumbledore tended to believe the best in most people. This is most evident when, after witnessing Severus Snape's deep remorse over his Death Eater past, permitted him to teach at Hogwarts, though this also allowed him to procure Snape's cooperation as a double agent in return. Many believe Dumbledore's bestowing so much trust in those with questionable pasts was misguided, though his nearly succumbing to Dark magic in his youth made him realize it is always possible to redeem oneself.

Family is also important to Dumbledore, and he deeply loved his deceased parents and sister. Although he failed his mother and sister, he recognized and accepted responsibility for how his actions contributed to their premature deaths, a fact that haunted him the rest of his life.

== Weaknesses ==

Albus Dumbledore's greatest weakness seems to have been a certain inevitability about his own failings. This is particularly marked in Book 6, but is foreshadowed throughout the series where he is always preparing Harry as the one who must vanquish Lord Voldemort.

A brilliant student, Dumbledore often used his academic pursuits to shield himself from family obligations, letting the burden for his impaired sister's care fall upon his mother, Kendra, and his younger brother, Aberforth. Dumbledore did put aside his personal pursuits to head the family after his mother's untimely death, but he bitterly resented taking on this responsibility and apparently did a poor job. This sense of martyrdom contributed to his forming a close, albeit short-lived, relationship with Gellert Grindelwald, a young Dark wizard. Albus was affected by Grindelwald's influence, and was briefly seduced by Dark magic's powerful allure, though he never actively pursued it. Unfortunately, his poor judgment regarding Grindelwald was a significant factor in his sister's tragic death, and forever haunted him. Despite following a light path ever after, Dumbledore never trusted himself around power, and instead spent his entire career at Hogwarts, an isolated place away from temptation.    

Dumbledore was prone to being aloof and secretive, and while this undoubtedly helped him surprise his enemies, it may also have prevented him from gathering more trusted confidants who could have acted as advisers. Though Dumbledore often consulted with the former Headmasters' portraits, their opinions on current events were restricted to their confined vantage point and often seemed outdated.

This proclivity for secrecy may have caused Dumbledore to withhold vital information from Harry when he probably should have been more forthcoming. His reticence particularly hampered Harry's mission to hunt Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, a task that may have taken years and ultimately could fail. Dumbledore, who may have intended to share more with Harry before his death, knew he had only a short time left to live, so it is surprising that he gave Harry inadequate instruction for such a difficult and potentially fatal task. Though Dumbledore was rightly concerned that Harry's discovery about, and possible obsession with, the three Deathly Hallows could derail his pursuit for Horcruxes, it seems Harry's quest was made far more difficult and dangerous than necessary. It was also a gamble as to whether Harry would even discover the Hallows' existence or learn their significance.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Even though considered one of the most powerful wizards that lived, Albus Dumbledore apparently led a rather secretive, solitary, and bookish life. And while readers may initially assume his most significant relationship was the one he shared with Harry Potter, it is actually a few other key people who have mostly shaped his character, as well as guided his destiny, though not necessarily intentionally. Dumbledore is among the most complex, mysterious, and perplexing figures in the entire series.

=== At Hogwarts ===

Dumbledore was surrounded by faithful Hogwarts staff and loyal Order of the Phoenix members. While he mostly assumes a leadership role, Dumbledore has strong relationships with several main characters other than Harry, including (but not limited to) [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]]. 

Dumbledore is on friendly terms with all the staff of Hogwarts, and takes a personal interest in how they are getting along. He seems to be aware of nearly everything that is happening in the school, including developing issues which he acts to defray before they become critical &amp;ndash; for instance, he seems to know about Umbridge's plan to dismiss Professor Trelawney, and has arranged for a replacement even as Umbridge is trying to expel Trelawney from the school. However, with possibly a few exceptions, Dumbledore reveals very little of himself to the staff of Hogwarts.

Further discussion of Dumbledore's relationships with Hogwarts staff comprise something of a spoiler and so are in the Greater Picture section below.

=== The Dumbledore Family ===

Like many other Hogwarts faculty, Dumbledore never married or had children. His only remaining immediate family was his brother, Aberforth, who also was unmarried and childless.

Little is known about Dumbledore's relationship with his family while he was growing up, though their history became marred with ongoing tragedy. His father died in Azkaban prison when Albus was still a boy. And though he loved his mother Kendra and sister Ariana, who was handicapped after she was attacked by Muggle boys, he distanced himself from Ariana's care whenever he was at home, leaving it to his mother and Aberforth. Albus was not only deeply affected by his mother's and sister's tragic premature deaths, but was forever guilt-ridden over how his actions contributed to their demises. This fueled his conflict with Aberforth, who had deeply resented Albus' shirking family responsibilities, then blamed him for Ariana's death, though his own hot temper was a factor in igniting the three-way duel between the two brothers and Gellert Grindelwald. This is likely the only thing that allowed them to maintain a respectful, though distant, truce later in life, both never wanting to know whose stray curse accidentally struck and killed their sister. 

Despite Aberforth's lingering resentment toward Albus following his death, he puts aside his personal feelings to help Harry Potter complete Dumbledore's mission to defeat Voldemort. And though Albus knew his own brilliance outshone that of his brother, he considered Aberforth's character stronger, wiser, and nobler than his own.

=== Harry Potter ===

Dumbledore is Harry's kindly, though rather eccentric mentor during his Hogwarts' school years. Although Dumbledore and Harry grew close, probably closer than with any student under his tutelage, Dumbledore never became, nor did he attempt to be, a surrogate father to Harry. They primarily remained as student and mentor. Knowing that only Harry could defeat Voldemort, Dumbledore spent much time grooming him for his fateful encounter with the Dark Lord, though Dumbledore withheld crucial information, including that the only way to destroy the soul shard Harry unknowingly carried within him was to have the Dark Lord murder him. Dumbledore had always seemed rather pragmatic regarding Harry's fated demise, completely accepting that Harry must be sacrificed in order to save the Wizarding world from the Dark Lord. Dumbledore realized later, however, that by utilizing Harry's blood to resurrect his body, Voldemort unwittingly provided Harry the protection he needed to survive his own death at Voldemort's hand. 

Though Harry is magically powerful and had once survived Voldemort's killing curse, causing him to be dubbed &quot;The Chosen One,&quot; many were still critical that Dumbledore entrusted an important secret mission to an as-yet unqualified wizard. Dumbledore may have actually agreed with them, but for reasons he alone understood, Harry was the only wizard who possessed the ability to defeat Voldemort. Even so, Dumbledore recognized Harry's weaknesses and his need to &quot;go it alone&quot;, and strongly urged him to always seek Ron and Hermione's advice and help. 

Harry is devastated when Dumbledore is killed in book 6, though he soon came to doubt Dumbledore's true intentions and his mission to hunt Voldemort's Horcruxes after dark secrets in Dumbledore's past emerged. Harry's bitter disappointment in the late headmaster's failings initially prevented him from seeing that, unlike Gellert Grindelwald, Dumbledore's youthful foray into Dark magic was little more than a brief, youthful flirtation filled with idle theories and never-applied beliefs that he ultimately rejected. If anything, Dumbledore's shame over his lapsed judgment probably made him even more passionate in protecting others from Dark influences. As Dumbledore himself had once taught him, Harry finally comes to realize that it was Dumbledore's deliberate choices in life that made him the great man he truly became. Harry names his second-born son, Albus Severus, to honour both Dumbledore and Professor Severus Snape.

=== Tom Marvolo Riddle ===

Dumbledore was closely tied to the Dark wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] (later known as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]) throughout his life. When he first met the eleven-year-old Tom Riddle in an orphanage, Dumbledore sensed this wizard was different, though he never suspected the young boy would become the most powerful Dark wizard in history. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore always kept a close eye on Riddle without revealing his suspicions to the other faculty, hoping Tom had abandoned his thievery and cruel ways. Though he was a brilliant student, Tom changed little, and instead crafted a false facade, charming his teachers while he quietly began sowing his evil empire, recruiting fellow Slytherins to become Death Eaters. Only Dumbledore suspected Tom was engaging in Dark activities while at Hogwarts, though he was unable to prove anything.

Riddle then returned after a decade away from Hogwarts to apply for a job; Dumbledore, now Headmaster, spoke with him. We see that Dumbledore mentioned how his former student had changed for the worse. Dumbledore received ongoing reports about Riddle's activities, so when Riddle applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching position at Hogwarts, Dumbledore knew about his new name, and mentioned his Death Eater associates. Dumbledore rightly suspected Riddle had an ulterior motive for wanting the job, and believed Riddle placed a curse on the position after being turned down. Ever since, every DA instructor lasted only one year.

Voldemort's biggest hurdle to conquering the Wizarding realm was always Dumbledore, even though Voldemort was supposedly the most powerful wizard in history. Dumbledore was always aware of Riddle's sinister nature and was never taken in by his superficial charm. It was also clear that Dumbledore understood his true nature better than anyone, and this insider knowledge helped Dumbledore prepare Harry for his predestined encounter with Voldemort. 

Voldemort later devised a scheme for Draco Malfoy to murder Dumbledore, though his real intent was to kill Draco when he failed, solely as a means to punish his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. Unknown to Voldemort, Dumbledore uncovered the plot, and used it to aid his own plan to defeat the Dark Lord.

We note that Voldemort, later, wanted to capture the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world, once he learned of its existence; although this is not stated directly, it is likely that once he learned Dumbledore wielded that wand, Voldemort assumed that it was the wand alone that had given Dumbledore the power to defeat him. Although Voldemort physically possessed Dumbledore's wand following his death, he was never its true master. Even if he had captured it directly from Dumbledore, it is questionable if it would have performed well for him. The author has stated on her website that only those able to face death fearlessly can truly control a wand containing a Thestral hair, as the Elder Wand did. 

=== Gellert Grindelwald ===

Though short-lived, Dumbledore's relationship with Gellert Grindelwald was probably his most significant in that it forever altered his adult life. Bitter over delaying his professional goals to instead care for his family after their mother's untimely death, Dumbledore became enthralled with Grindelwald, a young wizard who came to live in Godric's Hollow after being expelled from Durmstrang. Grindelwald was as brilliant as Dumbledore, but readily practiced Dark magic. Dumbledore, feeling he had found a soul mate, came to share Grindelwald's idea to conquer and rule Muggles, though they differed on how to execute this. Dumbledore favored a benevolent approach, convincing himself it was for &quot;the greater good&quot; of all, while Grindelwald espoused a more sinister method. 

It seems inconceivable that the Dumbledore we know could ever endorse such a wicked scheme. However, his tragic youth, misguided ambition, and blind attraction to Grindelwald apparently rendered him susceptible to Grindewald's charismatic, but evil allure. It was only after Aberforth, Dumbledore's younger brother, uncovered their plot, resulting in a three-way duel ending with their sister's accidental death and Grindelwald's abrupt departure, that Albus recognized his own serious failings. But even after Grindelwald began his rampage in Europe, Dumbledore waited over five years to respond to the Wizarding world's pleas for his help. Lingering feelings for Grindelwald may have prevented Dumbledore's confronting and defeating his former friend sooner than he did. Whether his delay caused more innocent deaths or if that affected him is unknown, but forever after, Dumbledore dedicated himself to fighting Dark forces and protecting Muggles' rights.   

&lt;!-- Note to prospective editors: This is a children's book. Dumbledore's sexual orientation affects only his interaction with Grindelwald, and that only to a minor degree, so it will be covered in the Greater Picture section only. Attempts to sensationalize this matter will be reverted. --&gt; &lt;!--Just FYI: I am expanding this section and will be discussing Grindelwald and Dumbledore's relationship, but only as it relates to the book. However, I may be adding some comments on his orientation in the &quot;Greater Picture&quot; section, where it belongs, but not in great detail, as it has little impact on the overall story. Also, as far as I know, Rowling said she only &quot;thought&quot; of Dumbledore as being gay, not that he actually was. -PNW Raven--&gt;

== Analysis ==

Throughout the Harry Potter series, Dumbledore has acted as a trusted mentor to Harry, and, in this way, has contributed greatly in Harry's victories over Voldemort.

During the series, Dumbledore's character changes considerably, and no single analysis can do him justice. It seems reasonable to analyze Dumbledore's character as more information is revealed about him in each successive book.

=== The First Five Books ===

Dumbledore's character in the series' first five books seems largely consistent. He appears as the slightly dotty, elder genius, whose occasional strange decisions are honoured because he is respected for his extreme intelligence and vast knowledge. His offbeat behavior is often considered utterly harmless, and his wisdom is sometimes interpreted as eccentricity. And his more controversial decisions – hiring Remus Lupin, trusting Severus Snape – are accepted purely because he has long been revered for his genius. His strength of character is particularly tested in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', when his reputation is publicly attacked because he repeatedly reports an unpopular fact, namely that Lord Voldemort has returned.

Dumbledore cares about Harry, more so than any other student at the school. He gently, or sometimes not so gently, educates Harry as to his place in the Wizarding world, and attempts to train Harry for the role that a prophecy has fated him for: Harry is the Chosen One&amp;ndash;he must stand against Voldemort. At the end of the fifth book, in Dumbledore's office, Harry's importance to Voldemort is revealed, and we learn why Dumbledore has been so keenly interested in and attentive to Harry.

=== Half-Blood Prince ===

On many fan sites, it was remarked after ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince's'' publication that Dumbledore was acting out of character. In retrospect, we can see that he has indeed changed; however, there is a legitimate reason. When he re-enters the story, his hand is already injured, indicating that he knows he has only one year, at most, left to live. As such, he can no longer wait; whatever he must accomplish now has a definite deadline. On several occasions, he comments on not fearing death, and this may seem a contradiction. However, his actions are motivated not out of a fear of death, but rather from an urgency to complete the necessary work, including imparting a certain amount of knowledge to Harry, before his time ends.

Dumbledore, knowing only Harry must stand against Voldemort, directs much energy to teaching Harry what he knows about Voldemort to enable Harry to defeat the Dark Lord. He continues uncovering information about Voldemort's past that will assist Harry. Guessing that multiple Horcruxes exist, Dumbledore carries out research that leads him to the ring Horcrux and to the original Locket Horcrux's resting place.

It is interesting to note that Dumbledore values Harry more highly than himself in the cavern where the locket Horcrux was hidden. Likely this is due to the prophecy, but Harry has yet to recognize this.

Many people believed, by this book's end, that Dumbledore had erred badly in placing his faith in Snape. Whether or not that had been a mistake remains unknown until the final book.

=== Deathly Hallows ===

In the series' final book, we are finally granted glimpses into the true depth of Dumbledore's character. Elphias Doge's eulogy reminds Harry that he knew almost nothing about Dumbledore's past, having seen him only as the kindly Headmaster who was his protector and mentor. Harry never thought to ask Dumbledore about his earlier life, perhaps youthfully assuming that he sprang from the earth, fully grown with long silver hair and beard. It is only after Rita Skeeter's muck-raking biography about Dumbledore suggests there was something unsavoury about Dumbledore's background that Harry sees Dumbledore somewhat differently. But finally it is Aberforth Dumbledore, recounting the family story to Harry, that reveals Dumbledore as a schemer who mostly kept his own council, and brings us to the realization that Dumbledore had been manipulating Harry as a pawn to act directly against Voldemort. In King's Cross, Dumbledore tells Harry that as a youth, power proved too alluring for him to resist, causing him to carefully avoid it in his adult life. However, it seems he was less averse to being the power behind the throne, driving Fudge, Harry, and others in directions he felt they needed to go.

Revelations in this book also show us how Dumbledore was preparing Snape over the length of the series for his role in supporting Harry and thwarting Voldemort. Snape's actions throughout the series only become fully clear with the revelations in this book about his interactions with Dumbledore.

=== Albus Dumbledore's Age ===

Dumbledore's age and accomplishments are frequently discussed on the various fan sites. Dumbledore is about 115-years-old when he dies, and the author has given his birth year as 1881. His Wizard card states that he is noted for his work in Alchemy with Nicolas Flamel. In passing, we should mention that there is a Nicolas Flamel in Muggle literature as well; he was a relatively famous alchemist in the 1300s. The fictional Nicolas Flamel and the real one apparently have similar, but not identical birth dates. The book in which Hermione uncovers information about Flamel is extremely old, and yet it gives ages for Nicolas and his wife Perenelle. Unless the book magically updates ages, the ages in the book must be outdated by several years. Therefore, Flamel in the Wizarding world is at least 665 years old (the age apparently given in the book), potentially as much as 750 years old if the book is only a hundred years old. If Dumbledore is a mere spring chicken of 115, and Flamel was at least 500-years old when Dumbledore was born, then how could Dumbledore have helped Flamel make the Philosopher's Stone upon which his ongoing life had depended? Careful reading reveals, however, that while Dumbledore worked with Flamel in alchemy, it is never stated he helped him create the Stone. 

There is insufficient information about wizards' typical lifespans, but Dumbledore, when he is around 110 years, is described as appearing old, and he appears more aged than most other characters in the books. Only Nicolas Flamel is explicitly described as being older at 665 years old, though Elphias Doge attended school with Dumbledore and should be the same approximate age. Also, Bathilda Bagshot saw Dumbledore's mother Kendra as a contemporary and thus was likely older than Dumbledore. In addition, Griselda Marchbanks said she &quot;Examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s...&quot;, which means she had at least graduated from Hogwarts at the time. Professor Tofty is mentioned to look like &quot;the very oldest and baldest examiner&quot;, which means he could possibly be even older than Professor Marchbanks. Flamel ultimately died after surrendering the Philosophers Stone (also known as the Sorcerer's Stone), which preserved his life, to prevent it falling into Voldemort's possession. Flamel shared the Stone with Dumbledore, but it is unknown to what extent, if any, it may have been responsible for extending Dumbledore's life.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

=== Relationships at Hogwarts ===

As mentioned, Dumbledore has strong relationships with Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall. 

To readers, in the first six books McGonagall appears to be Dumbledore's closest confidant and advisor, and headed Hogwarts whenever Dumbledore was absent. She was steadfastly loyal to him, and though she is strong-willed and opinionated, she always abided by his decisions. It is only in the last book that we learn Snape was closer to Dumbledore than anyone, though their relationship was not without occasional rancor and disagreements. Snape was under a huge obligation to Dumbledore, who granted him a safe sanctuary after his defection from Voldemort. Dumbledore, disdainful over Snape's past deeds as a Death Eater, demanded much in return, forcing Snape to act as a double agent against Voldemort and his minions. Snape also became one of Harry Potter's protectors and later secretly aided his mission after Dumbledore's death, despite Snape's intense dislike for the boy. 

Snape was obligated to Dumbledore for the remainder of his life, and despite Harry's doubts and misgivings, Snape's loyalty to Dumbledore never wavered and was always freely given. In return, Dumbledore entrusted Snape with knowledge no one else was privy to, not even McGonagall. He certainly never trusted McGonagall any less, and he valued her abilities, but he was able to exploit Snape's Death Eater past by having him infiltrate himself back into Voldemort's inner circle. And Snape, being highly skilled in Occlumency, could safeguard Dumbledore's secrets, particularly those regarding Harry Potter, far better than McGonagall. Dumbledore's own brief seduction by Dark magic in his youth may have made him more sympathetic and forgiving of Snape, creating a unique bond between two men with similarly tainted pasts.

=== The Ending of ''Half-Blood Prince'' ===

Dumbledore's murder by Snape created much speculation and controversy in the fan community. Perhaps it was wishful thinking, a belief that Dumbledore was too powerful, too clever, or that his part was not yet played out, or even the clues dropped either deliberately or accidentally by the author, but until the seventh book's release, many readers were convinced, or at least hopeful, that Dumbledore was not truly dead, and had instead arranged with Snape to fake his death, and that he would somehow return to support Harry through the seventh book.

While there were many clues suggesting Dumbledore's demise was something else entirely, the author stated numerous times that Dumbledore definitely died in the sixth book. This did not mean that Dumbledore would have no further influence beyond his death. The author has admitted that she had trouble writing some of his scenes in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' (The Observer, 6 February 2007). As his portrait immediately appeared in the Headmaster's office, it could be speculated that he would likely play a part in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. An interesting point that has come up is linked to another statement Dumbledore made in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], where Dumbledore says, &quot;I will only ''truly'' have left the school when none here are loyal to me.&quot; Harry echoes this statement at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', in a context which leads us to believe he is truly loyal to Dumbledore. We know that it was that loyalty that summoned [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]] to Harry in the Chamber of Secrets. Will it perhaps have the same effect again in the final book?

One interesting theory surfaced about Dumbledore's death at Snape's hands. Going back to Harry's first Potions class, back in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Snape says: &quot;I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even ''stopper death''...&quot; (We note that in the Scholastic edition, Snape's speech ends &quot;and even put a stopper to death...&quot;) This scene is apparently very important as readers are referred back to it time and time again.

Now, let us look at the effect of the cursed necklace on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. Quoting Professor Dumbledore: &quot;She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin: there was a tiny hole in her glove. ... Luckily, Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse—&quot; So we have the information that the type of curse that was on the necklace spreads from its contact point, and that Snape can stop the its spread.

From elsewhere in that book, there is information that it was Snape who Dumbledore sought after injuring his hand. Was the ring, which contained the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], or some part of its surroundings, similarly cursed? It is possible, given that Dumbledore would have felt duty-bound to destroy the Horcrux before seeking assistance, that the curse was irreversible by the time he reached Snape. The only thing that may be keeping Dumbledore alive at this point is the potion that &quot;stoppers death&quot; (or &quot;puts a stopper to death&quot;). This would explain Dumbledore's different behaviour in this book; he knows his time is limited, and he is in a great hurry to pass on all he knows before his inevitable departure.  

Snape knew that he was not murdering Dumbledore because Dumbledore was effectively already dead, kept alive only by a potion that Snape administered, and which would not be effective for much longer. There may have been other arrangements between them, and it may have been Dumbledore's plan for Snape to kill him to solidify Snape's position in Voldemort's hierarchy. It is important to note that Dumbledore did not fear death; we see this on several occasions, most notably at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|the end of the first book]], where Dumbledore says, &quot;after all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; This also tallies with Snape's expression of extreme distaste as he cast the Killing Curse at Dumbledore – was this an act he had to perform, rather than one he wanted to? It also dovetails with Snape's actions as he flees Hogwarts. Anticipating Harry's every move and blocking his curses, he could easily have injured, Stunned, or even killed him. Instead, he does nothing to harm Harry, and practically uses the confrontation to tutor him on defensive strategy. Also, it should be noted that when Dumbledore says, &quot;Severus... Please...&quot; (page 595 US/556 UK), he is actually pleading for Severus to end his life. It is revealed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]] that Dumbledore forced Severus to agree to doing this, and that Severus later expressed great reluctance to carry out this promise.

=== Gellert Grindelwald ===

Throughout the seventh book, it is gradually revealed that when Dumbledore was seventeen, he and the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald became close friends. We can see, though the young Dumbledore could not, that the evil Grindelwald was power-hungry, and his overall intent was to conquer. Dumbledore's ultimate aim was to make it safe for those like his sister Ariana to exist. Muggles would live under Wizard-kind's benevolent rule, making it possible for wizard offspring and Muggle children to co-exist harmoniously. One simple personality test is selecting a specific Hallow believed to be the most valuable, and why. Grindelwald clearly thought the Elder Wand, unbeatable in a duel, was the most desirable, with the Resurrection Stone running second. Albus felt the Resurrection Stone was more important. To Grindelwald, the Resurrection Stone meant commanding an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]] army; to Albus, it was his parents returned to him, thereby lifting his burden for his siblings' care. Why did Dumbledore fail to see that Grindelwald was choosing a path leading to corrupt power and domination? [http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more The author has said] that Dumbledore was infatuated with Grindelwald, and that being in love had blinded him. He overlooked Grindelwald's faults, and with youthful foolishness, perhaps thought he could change Grindelwald to his own, somewhat more gentle ends. According to Rowling, Dumbledore falling in love with a Dark and selfish person like Grindelwald, and the later consequences, is his biggest tragedy. As a result, Dumbledore never again trusted himself with power, causing him to decline the Minister for Magic post, among other prominent positions, and instead confine his career path to Hogwarts where he would be less tempted.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

At King's Cross Station, Molly Weasley assists a lost-looking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], showing him how to get to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]]. After the children have boarded the train, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] return to the platform to tell her that the &quot;black-haired kid&quot; is actually the famous Harry Potter. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] pleads with her mother to be allowed onto the train to see him, but Molly refuses, saying Harry would not want to be gawked at like an animal in a zoo.

Mrs. Weasley provides some of Harry's Christmas presents. Simple as they are, a jumper (US: sweater) and some candy, these are among the first real Christmas presents Harry has ever received.

Mrs. Weasley greets the Weasley children at the station when they return from Hogwarts, and briefly speaks to Harry. She seems somewhat nonplussed by the brevity of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]'s greeting to Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] arrive at The Burrow in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]'s flying Ford Anglia, Mrs. Weasley is waiting, much to Ron's and the Twin's dismay; they had hoped to sneak out, liberate Harry, and return before she was awake. She scolds the three Weasley boys, but warmly welcomes Harry, and gives him extra sausages after hearing the Dursleys were starving him. As punishment, Ron and the Twins must de-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|gnome]] the garden. Though exempt, Harry, having never seen a de-gnoming, joins in. Mrs. Weasley consults ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s Guide to Household Pests'' on the best way to remove gnomes, though Fred says they know how to de-gnome a garden; George suggests that Mrs. Weasley is sweet on Lockhart. 

When Mr. Weasley arrives home, Mrs. Weasley informs him that the Twins flew his car to London. Mr. Weasley immediately asks how it went, but seeing stern warning signs from Mrs. Weasley, suddenly changes his tone to say they misbehaved.

The Hogwarts book lists arrive listing many Gilderoy Lockhart books. George comments about the cost, but Mrs. Weasley, though worried, assures him they will manage. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] sends an owl suggesting they meet in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], Mrs. Weasley agrees, and they set a date for school shopping.

The family is traveling to Diagon Alley by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]]. Because Harry has never traveled this way, Mrs. Weasley has Ron go first. Though unsure it is safe, Harry goes next, ending up at the wrong grate — Floo powder enables traveling between Wizarding fireplaces. Mrs. Weasley is nearly frantic and divides her brood to search Diagon Alley for Harry, hoping he only went a few grates too far. She is relieved when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] turns up with Harry in tow, having found him in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. She brushes Harry off and dismisses the Twins' questions about Knockturn Alley, reminding them they are never allowed there.

At Gringotts Bank, Harry notices how few coins are in the Weasleys' vault while acutely aware that there are many [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons and Sickles]] in his; Mrs. Weasley carefully checks the vault's four corners for any overlooked coins before sweeping what little there is into her money bag. Once outside, Mrs. Weasley suggests the group split up to do their shopping.

Mrs. Weasley is seen again in Flourish &amp; Blotts, waiting in line at Gilderoy Lockhart's book signing. When a confrontation between Arthur Weasley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] becomes physical and is broken up by Hagrid, Molly is embarrassed. She continues scolding her husband, even after the Twins tell her that Lockhart is not upset, and only wonders how the altercation can be slanted to enhance his exposure.

The family travel to King's Cross Station in Arthur Weasley's flying Ford Anglia, though, being daylight, it remains on the ground. Mrs. Weasley is amazed at how skillful Muggles are, as the auto's interior seems much larger than the outside; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, realize that Mr. Weasley applied another almost-illegal spell to the car.

Unable to pass through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, Harry and Ron, frantic over missing the train, fly the car to Hogwarts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]] see them, however, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Evening Prophet'']] reports their escapade. Furious, Mrs. Weasley sends a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] to Hogwarts, severely scolding Ron during breakfast in the Great Hall.

Mrs. Weasley again gives Harry a hand-knitted jumper (US: sweater) and candy for Christmas. Ron is unimpressed with his jumper, but Harry welcomes his, as it is still unusual for him to receive gifts.

When Ginny is taken into the Chamber of Secrets, Harry, helped by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]], rescues her. Fawkes leads them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s office, where she, Professor Dumbledore, and Molly and Arthur Weasley are waiting. Mrs. Weasley sweeps Ginny into a hug, and then Harry and Ron, apparently too relieved to say much.

Mrs. Weasley and Mr. Weasley take Ginny to the Hospital Wing, and though they are not seen, presumably stay for the following celebratory feast. Mrs. Weasley is present at King's Cross Station when the Hogwarts Express arrives in London, and she is once again dismayed by Uncle Vernon's lack of civility towards Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Molly Weasley reappears in the story the day before the Hogwarts Express leaves for school. Harry has been staying at the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley after a fight with the Dursleys. There he runs into Ron and Hermione shopping for school supplies. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ginny, Fred, George, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] are there and also staying at The Leaky Cauldron. Mrs. Weasley is having little success reining in the Twins, who are mocking Percy by aping his exaggerated formal manner after being made [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy]]. Later, when Harry searches the salon for Ron's Rat Tonic, he overhears Mr. and Mrs. Weasley talking in the next room about him and someone named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], a wizard who recently escaped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison. Black may be headed for Hogwarts to murder Harry. Mr. Weasley believes Harry should know this, while Mrs. Weasley strongly disagrees.

On the station platform the next day, Mr. Weasley takes Harry aside to warn him about Black, though Harry admits he overheard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's conversation. When Mr. Weasley asks him to promise that he will not hunt Black, Harry wonders why he would want to, but the train leaves before he can promise.

Mrs. Weasley gives Harry another hand-knitted jumper (US: sweater) and various treats as a Christmas gift; this time, the jumper is bright red with the Gryffindor lion woven into the pattern.

Finally, Mrs. Weasley meets the students at King's Cross Station when they arrive on the Hogwarts Express; once again, she is dismayed by Uncle Vernon's cavalier greeting to Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Mrs. Weasley re-enters our story through a letter she sends by Muggle post. The envelope is entirely covered with stamps, causing the bemused mail carrier to query Uncle Vernon about it. Predictably, Uncle Vernon is livid that &quot;Harry's sort&quot; has called attention to the Dursley household. Mrs. Weasley's letter invites Harry to attend the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with the Weasley family and to stay at The Burrow until school starts. Harry persuades Uncle Vernon to let him go.

While collecting Harry's school stuff, Fred and George conspire to drop a few [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|enchanted toffees]] in the Dursleys' sitting room; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] eats one, causing his tongue to grow several feet long. Back at The Burrow, Mr. Weasley scolds the Twins, saying pranks like this hinder Muggle-Wizard relations. As he threatens to tell their mother, Mrs. Weasley appears asking, &quot;Tell me what, dear?&quot; Despite Mr. Weasley backtracking, and George and Fred's efforts to escape, Mrs. Weasley loudly chastises the Twins. Mrs. Weasley has also found a stack of order forms for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|''Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes'']], and is upset over Fred and George wasting their time with magical jokes rather than planning for ''real'' careers.

Later, we see Mrs. Weasley preparing dinner, still seething over the Twins. Harry and Ron must leap aside as a drawer opens violently and knives flash out and start chopping vegetables. Adding to Mrs. Weasley's disgruntlement, when she reaches for a wand, it is a trick one that turns into a large rubber mouse when she uses it. Ron and Harry quickly escape to help [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]] set the tables in the garden.

At dinner, Mrs. Weasley nags Bill about his long hair and criticizes his fang necklace. Eventually, Mrs. Weasley sends everyone to bed, reminding them they must get up early to leave for the match.

In the morning, Ron, Harry, Fred, and George find Mrs. Weasley in the kitchen preparing breakfast. She snappishly tells the Twins they cannot [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] to the match like Percy, Bill, and Charlie, they are underage and have not passed their Apparition test yet. As the group is leaving, she asks if the Twins are carrying any Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes stuff; though they deny it, she [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summons]] toffees hidden from their persons. The Twins depart in stony silence, without a backwards glance.

The World Cup riots make [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], and Mrs. Weasley is distraught, fearing her family may have been injured. She is relieved when they troop back in the following morning, hugging everyone, and saying she had feared her last words to the Twins were angry complaints about their magical jokes and meager [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs]]. When Mr. Weasley comments that he is mentioned in the newspaper article, Mrs. Weasley says she did not see his name, otherwise she would have known they were safe. Mr. Weasley is not identified by name, but has been misquoted as a &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] spokesman&quot;, making the situation even worse. As he heads to office to straighten things out, Mrs. Weasley protests that he is on vacation, but she is overruled.

The rest of the summer is subdued. Mr. Weasley and Percy spend all their time at the office, including weekends, dealing with the riot's fallout. Mrs. Weasley, seeing Fred and George hunched over a parchment, demands to know what they are doing. Told it is homework, she is skeptical, suspecting it is another ''order form.'' Fred, looking pained, asks, should the Hogwarts Express crash tomorrow, would she want her last words to the Twins to be an unfounded accusation?

As Harry and Ron pack their school trunks, Ron finds a hideous, lace-trimmed garment among his robes. Demanding to know what it is, Mrs. Weasley tells him it is his &quot;formal robes&quot;, a school requirement this year. It was the best that was available at the second-hand clothing store. For Harry, however, Mrs. Weasley has bought new formal robes that are lace-free and in a colour matching his eyes. Mrs. Weasley explains that Harry can afford new robes, whilst they cannot. After Mrs. Weasley leaves, Ron complains bitterly about his family's poverty.

The following morning, Mrs. Weasley summons Mr. Weasley to the kitchen for an urgent call via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]. After Mr. Weasley finishes talking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]], whose head is floating in the fireplace, Mrs. Weasley offers Amos some toast. He accepts and departs. Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie accompany the Twins, Harry, Ron, and Ginny to London in three Muggle taxicabs which Mrs. Weasley has braved the Muggle post office to call. Once on the platform, it appears that she knows about a secret event happening at the school; but like Bill and Charlie, refuses to divulge anything. And before the train is out of sight of the platform, the three have Disapparated.

Following the Triwizard Tournament's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]], Charlie Weasley congratulates Harry on his win, then says he has to send an owl to Mrs. Weasley to let her know how Harry did.

At Christmas, Mrs. Weasley again sends Harry a hand-made jumper (US: sweater), this time green with a dragon on the front, and a large quantity of home-made mince pies. Later, at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], Harry, while talking to Percy, sees the Twins stop [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]. Ludo later claims that the Twins only wanted marketing advice; Harry is certain Percy will report this exchange to Mrs. Weasley.

An article by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']] shortly after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]]. Skeeter suggests that Hermione is romantically toying with both Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]]. At Easter, Mrs. Weasley sends chocolate eggs; Ron's and Harry's are ostrich sized and filled with toffees, while Hermione's is no bigger than a chicken egg. Ron tells Hermione his mother reads ''Witch Weekly''.

Shortly after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch's]] bizarre disappearance and reappearance at Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to the Owlery to send Sirius a letter describing the event. They are interrupted by the Twins, who can be overheard discussing whether or not their letter sounds like blackmail; they fall silent upon seeing the Trio there. As they leave, Ron comments that the Twins are genuinely serious about starting a joke shop, they are not doing it just to annoy Mrs. Weasley.

On the day of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], Professor McGonagall tells Harry at breakfast that the Champions are meeting with their families in an adjacent room. Harry, knowing that the Dursleys would not be present, remains at the table until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], the other Hogwarts Champion, summons him. Entering the room, he finds Mrs. Weasley and Bill are there. Amos Diggory, also present, is upset that Rita Skeeter's article only mentioned Harry as Hogwarts Champion. While Mrs. Weasley reminds him that Rita writes stories to deliberately cause trouble, this hardly calms him. Harry spends the morning escorting Bill and Mrs. Weasley around the grounds, with Mrs. Weasley commenting on her days there. At lunch, Mrs. Weasley is frosty towards Hermione until Harry explains that Hermione is not his girlfriend. Mrs. Weasley, perhaps remembering her own comments about Rita Skeeter, is then noticeably friendlier. Hermione, meanwhile is suspicious about Skeeter, and has been investigating magical bugging methods. She is unable to tell Harry what she has learned while Mrs. Weasley and Bill are present.

After Harry's exit from the maze, his encounter with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch's]] unmasking, and his debriefing by Dumbledore, Harry is taken to the Hospital Wing. Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione have been demanding that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] tell them where Harry is. As Harry arrives with Dumbledore, Mrs. Weasley immediately swoops over to comfort him. Dumbledore forestalls any interrogation until morning, saying Harry needs sleep.

Mrs. Weasley is still at Harry's bedside the next morning when Professor McGonagall arrives with Cornelius Fudge, who wants to question Harry and delivers his prize money. After Fudge, angered at Harry and Dumbledore's insistence that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has returned, leaves, Dumbledore asks Mrs. Weasley if he can depend on her and Arthur. She assures him he can, and Bill leaves immediately to tell his father. Mrs. Weasley is shocked and alarmed when the large black dog that has stayed at Harry's bedside transforms into Sirius Black. After sending Sirius and Snape on their respective missions, Dumbledore tells Harry to drink his sleeping potion and leaves him with Ron, Hermione, and Mrs. Weasley. When Harry wants to return the Triwizard prize money, believing he did not actually win it, Mrs. Weasley tells him not to fret about it. A loud slamming sound at the window interrupts her, and Hermione apologizes for the noise, though she offers no explanation regarding what she is doing.

Ron later tells Harry that Mrs. Weasley asked Dumbledore if Harry could spend the entire summer at The Burrow, but Dumbledore insisted that Harry must return to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']]. Though no explanation was given, Ron says Dumbledore must have his reasons.

We see Mrs. Weasley again briefly at King's Cross Station, but she only has enough time to exchange a few words with Harry before Uncle Vernon drags him away.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When Harry is brought to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] after the Dementor attack, Mrs. Weasley greets him in the front hall. Asking him to be quiet, she sends him upstairs while the grown-ups have a meeting. Ron and Hermione are there, and Fred, George, and Ginny soon join them. Despite staying at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] Headquarters, the Weasley children and Hermione know little more than Harry about what is happening with Voldemort, though Fred and George reveal their latest invention, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]]. They have been eavesdropping on meetings and other conversations with it, but Mrs. Weasley destroys any &quot;Ears&quot; that she finds. The Weasley children warn Harry to avoid mentioning Percy, who has become estranged from the family. Mr. Weasley breaks whatever he is holding and Mrs. Weasley bursts into tears whenever his name is said aloud.

After the meeting, Mrs. Weasley herds everyone downstairs for supper, and asks that the table be set, though she resists Harry's offer to help, telling him to rest from his trip. The Twins, trying to helpful, charm a large pot of stew, the bread and breadknife, and a pitcher of Butterbeer to the table. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], Sirius, Harry, Ron, Bill, Hermione, and Ginny have to duck the flying, barely controlled dinnerware, while Sirius jerks away from the table, barely avoiding the breadknife stabbing his hand. Mrs. Weasley scolds the Twins for using magic for everything, even though they are now old enough.

Following dinner, Sirius suggests Harry ask questions about the Order's business; Mrs. Weasley objects, saying Harry is too young, and claims Sirius is confusing Harry with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|his father]]. Despite her vehement argument, Mrs. Weasley stands alone; Sirius, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and even Mr. Weasley feel Harry has a right to know. Abandoning this tack, Mrs. Weasley wants the Twins, Ron, and Hermione to leave, but Harry counters that he will just tell Ron and Hermione anything learns; the Twins, being legal age, should also stay. Defeated on all fronts, Mrs. Weasley hauls a loudly-protesting Ginny off to bed.

Returning to the kitchen, Mrs. Weasley remains quiet until Sirius mentions Voldemort is seeking a weapon. She interrupts, saying that is enough information. Lupin agrees, and the youngsters are sent upstairs to bed. The Twins gather in Ron and Harry's room to discuss what they have learned; but, hearing Mrs. Weasley approaching, they quickly Apparate to their own room. An exhausted Harry is asleep before she passes the room again on the way down.

The next morning, Mrs. Weasley allows Harry to sleep in, but puts her children to work making Grimmauld Place habitable. When Harry gets up, he finds Mrs. Weasley and the Weasley children in the drawing room. She tells Harry to get a mask and a sprayer; they are using Doxycide to eradicate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Doxy|doxies]] that have infested the drapes. She has doxy anti-venom but hopes it will not be needed. Fred and George sneak some collected doxy eggs into their pockets; George explains to Harry they are ingredients for their joke-shop goods. When the doorbell rings, Mrs. Weasley answers it. Looking out the window, Hermione sees Mundungus Fletcher carrying cauldrons, and Harry can hear both Mrs. Weasley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Mrs. Black's]] portrait screaming in the front hall. When Mrs. Weasley returns with sandwiches, she is still fulminating about Mundungus and his attempt to use Headquarters to store his stolen goods.

Over the next several days, Mrs. Weasley sets all the children to cleaning Grimmauld Place. When Ron complains that he wanted to do something useful for the Order, Mrs. Weasley says making Headquarters livable is certainly useful. Meanwhile, they are repeatedly uncovering Dark magic artifacts, some of which the Twins hide away when Mrs. Weasley is looking elsewhere.

At dinner, Mrs. Weasley reminds Harry to get up early for his hearing at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Mr. Weasley is accompanying him, as Professor Dumbledore requested, though Harry is upset that Dumbledore was at Headquarters without speaking to him. Mrs. Weasley reassures him that he will have no problem at the hearing, but Harry notices her worried expression. She still looks worried as Harry prepares to leave for the Ministry the next morning. She presses him to eat some breakfast, but he is too nervous and has no appetite. She is relieved when Harry returns acquitted, though Fred, George, and Ginny's victory dance annoys her to the point that she yells at them to be quiet.

The Hogwarts book lists finally arrive, and Hermione and Ron have been appointed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]]. Mrs. Weasley, pleased that Ron has received such an honour, wants to buy him something – Percy got an owl, but Ron already has one. Ron suggests a new broom, but Mrs. Weasley pauses, saying it is expensive, but then agrees and dashes off to arrange a trip to Diagon Alley.

That evening, Mrs. Weasley has a celebration for Ron and Hermione being made Prefects. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody]] is present, and Mrs. Weasley asks him to use his magical eye to inspect the parlour's writing desk to see if a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]] is in it or something more deadly. Moody confirms it is a Boggart, which Mrs. Weasley will deal with herself. Later, Harry passes the drawing room on his way to bed and sees Ron lying dead on the floor. He hears a weeping Mrs. Weasley casting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]], and the dead Ron turns into a dead Mr. Weasley. Realizing it is the Boggart, Harry sees it change rapidly into several other dead Weasleys, and then himself. Lupin arrives and banishes the Boggart, then comforts Mrs. Weasley. Harry continues on to bed, aware that his own death is a more concrete possibility, and it is numbered among Mrs. Weasley's worst fears.

As they head off to school the next day, Mrs. Weasley is angered when the Twins charm their trunks to fly down the stairs, injuring Ginny. Mrs. Weasley heals her, but is then exasperated that Sirius demands to go to the station in his Dog [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] shape. She gives in, but spends the trip pleading with Sirius to behave more like a dog. They make their farewells on the platform.

For the next while, Mrs. Weasley is unseen, but her presence is felt, however, when Hermione, irritated by Fred and George testing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Fainting Fancies]] on first-year students, threatens to tell their mother. This proves to be a much more effective means of controlling the Twins than anything she could do as Prefect.

After Hermione arranges the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] meeting, Sirius relays a message from Mrs. Weasley to Ron forbidding him to join, and requests that Harry and Hermione consider the same.

Just before Christmas, Harry has a vision that Mr. Weasley is attacked by a snake. After confirming the vision is real, Professor Dumbledore prepares to send Harry and the Weasley children to Grimmauld Place. McGonagall asks if she should contact Mrs. Weasley, but Dumbledore says that is a job for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], though Mrs. Weasley may already know, due to her excellent clock at The Burrow which indicates where all the Weasleys are.

Shortly after the children arrive at Grimmauld Place, Mrs. Weasley sends word that Mr. Weasley is seriously injured, but still alive. This does little to ease the Weasley children and Harry, however. When Mrs. Weasley arrives at Grimmauld Place at 5:00 a.m., she reassures everyone that Mr. Weasley is sleeping peacefully. Harry, feeling somehow instrumental in Mr. Weasley being attacked, wonders if he is welcomed there, but Mrs. Weasley says Harry raising the alarm save her husband's life.

Later that day, the entire family, guarded by Mad-Eye Moody and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], visit Mr. Weasley in hospital. The adults discuss privately the events leading to Harry's warning, though Harry and the others listen in with the Twins' Extendable Ears. Moody suggests that Harry may be possessed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

Harry, fearing Voldemort is possessing him, isolates himself in his room; Mrs. Weasley sends up sandwiches when he does not appear at mealtimes. Once Ginny convinces Harry that he is not possessed, he joins in with the Christmas preparations. On Christmas day, Mrs. Weasley is in tears because the jumper (US: sweater) she knitted for Percy was returned unopened.

Later that day, Mundungus Fletcher drives the Weasley family, with Harry, Hermione, Moody, and Lupin, to the hospital. There, Mr. Weasley asks if they have seen his Healer. Mrs. Weasley, noting that his dressings have been changed, demands to know what is going on. The Twins, sensing storm clouds, quickly depart for the tea shop. Mr. Weasley diffidently mentions that the apprentice healer was experimenting with Muggle healing techniques, something called &quot;stitches&quot;. Mrs. Weasley, saying it sounds like sewing, dismissively says that not even Mr. Weasley would be stupid enough to try that. Harry and Ron, also now sensing an incipient explosion, decide the tea shop is calling them as well, and depart with Hermione and Ginny.

Professor Snape visits Grimmauld Place, informing Harry that he will study [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] with him. Flying insults between Sirius and Snape have the two at wands drawn. Harry is standing between trying to prevent a duel when Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and the Weasley children return from hospital. Mr. Weasley is fully recovered.

Mrs. Weasley does not join Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley children on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]] taking them back to Hogwarts after the Christmas break, instead staying on at Headquarters.

When Fred and George exit the school for good, Ron worries that Mrs. Weasley will blame him for their premature departure. Harry assures him that is nonsense, but Ron says Mrs. Weasley somehow believes that, as a Prefect, Ron has the power to control the Twins and could have prevented them leaving.

Mrs. Weasley, along with Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody, are at the station when the Hogwarts Express returns Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny to London. The entire lot face down Harry's aunt, uncle, and cousin, demanding the Dursleys make concession to ensure Harry's comfort over the summer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

After only a fortnight, Professor Dumbledore retrieves Harry from the Dursleys', taking him via side-along Apparition to a small village to recruit a new teacher, then to The Burrow. It is well past midnight, but Mrs. Weasley is still up, waiting in the kitchen for Mr. Weasley to arrive home. She is talking with Tonks, who seems depressed. After Tonks and Dumbledore leave, Mrs. Weasley tells Harry that Mr. Weasley has been promoted, and now heads the new ''Office of Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects''. The promotion has vastly improved the Weasley finances. When Mr. Weasley arrives, he insists on using the Ministry-recommended challenge technique to verify his and Mrs. Weasley's identities before he allows her to open the door. Mrs. Weasley is vastly embarrassed by the intimate questions, particularly with Harry listening in. Once inside, Mr. Weasley shares what happened during his day. Harry, tired but interested, is unable to stifle a yawn; Mrs. Weasley shoos him to bed.

The next morning, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] brings Harry's breakfast, with Mrs. Weasley grumbling behind her. Fleur, with her usual great drama, announces that she and Bill Weasley are engaged, then leaves. Ginny, Hermione, and Mrs. Weasley comment that Fleur is very full of herself, and wonder what Bill sees in her. Ginny has nicknamed her &quot;Phlegm&quot;, which makes Harry and Hermione laugh, though Mrs. Weasley disapproves. After Mrs. Weasley leaves, Harry says how sad Tonks looks. Ron mentions that Mrs. Weasley is always inviting Tonks over, probably hoping that she and Bill will fancy each other. Later, when Harry ventures down to the kitchen, he finds Mrs. Weasley apparently ignoring Fleur, who flutters about with her wedding plans.

The day after Harry's birthday, the Hogwarts book lists arrive. The following day, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Hermione, along with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, set out for Diagon Alley. Arriving in The Leaky Cauldron, they meet Hagrid who is helping to guard them. In Diagon Alley, Mr. Weasley is annoyed by street vendors selling phony anti-Dark amulets and charms, saying that if he was on the job he would run them in. Mrs. Weasley tells him to calm down. Ginny goes with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley to Flourish &amp; Blotts for textbooks, while Ron, Harry, and Hermione head to Madam Malkin's with Hagrid.

The two groups later join up to visit Fred and George's new store, and Mrs. Weasley is taken aback by their garish window display which mocks Lord Voldemort. While in the store, Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], and, under the Invisibility Cloak, he, Ron, and Hermione trail him into Knockturn Alley, eavesdropping on a transaction he has in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]]. Returning to the joke shop, they tell a worried Mrs. Weasley that they were in the store's back room.

The day before the students depart for Hogwarts, Mrs. Weasley wants everything packed the night before, to avoid a mad-morning rush to the train. For their protection, the Ministry is sending cars. The next morning, surprisingly, everyone is ready on time, and they arrive at the station in good order. While Mrs. Weasley bids her children goodbye, Harry takes Mr. Weasley aside and tells him about Draco, advising him to search Malfoy Manor again. Returning to the platform, he collects a farewell hug from Mrs. Weasley before boarding the train.

Harry stays at The Burrow for Christmas. He and Ron are peeling sprouts by hand because Mrs. Weasley feels Ron should understand how Muggles live by doing manual tasks; Harry joined in out of friendship and to talk to Ron privately about what has been happening at school. Mrs. Weasley enters the kitchen while Fred and George are there and explains the sleeping arrangements; with Bill and Fleur there, as well as Lupin, things will cramped. Percy, still estranged from the family, is not expected to be there.

On Christmas Eve, the family gathers in the parlour. The wireless (US: radio) is playing a selection by Mrs. Weasley's favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, who Fleur evidently dislikes and tries talking over it. A small battle erupts in the background, with Mrs. Weasley repeatedly increasing the wireless' volume while Fleur raises her voice in response. After the song is finished, Fleur mocks it, which Mr. Weasley and Lupin use as a signal to end the evening, sending everyone to bed.

At Christmas dinner, the group discuss, among other things, Tonks, who was invited, but apparently chose to spend Christmas alone. Mrs. Weasley blames Bill for her absence, echoing Ron's earlier statement that she wants Bill and Tonks to hook up, and leading us to believe that Tonks' absence is because Fleur is present.

The entire group is stunned when Percy appears at the door, accompanied by the Minister for Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Percy woodenly wishes everyone a Happy Christmas. Mrs. Weasley runs to hug him, which he tolerates but does not reciprocate. Scrimgeour takes Harry aside on the pretense of allowing the family time together, but it is actually a ruse so Scrimgeour can recruit Harry to the Ministry's side. The reunion ends with Percy leaving hurriedly, decorated with mashed parsnips which Fred, George, and Ginny all claim credit for throwing, and Mrs. Weasley in tears.

When Ron is accidentally poisoned on his birthday, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are summoned to the school. Arriving in the Hospital Wing, they effusively thank Harry for saving another Weasley. Harry, embarrassed by the praise, very quickly leaves the Hospital Wing with Hermione and Hagrid.

At the end, Bill is guarding Hogwarts when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|battle at the Astronomy Tower]] breaks out. He is badly mauled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], a vicious [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. As Fenrir was not transformed at the time, Bill is not likely to become a werewolf, but Madam Pomfrey says his damaged face is permanently scarred. It is assumed that Fleur will now lose interest in Bill, but when Fleur overhears this aspersion, she is angered and offended that Mrs. Weasley thinks she was only interested in Bill for his looks; Fleur says she has good enough looks for them both, and the wedding is still on. She shoulders Mrs. Weasley aside and takes over tending Bill. Mrs. Weasley is stunned by Fleur's actions, then tentatively suggests that their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin-made]] moonstone tiara would look lovely against Fleur's hair. She offers to arrange for Fleur to borrow it, which Fleur stiffly accepts. Before Harry can figure out what is going on, the two women are in tears, hugging each other. 

While we do not see Mrs. Weasley again, it is likely that she remained at the school for Dumbledore's funeral.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

During the coordinated escape from Privet Drive, Harry and Hagrid arrive at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks']] house, then catch a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] to The Burrow. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny meet them, relieved to see Harry and Hagrid, but distraught that the others have not arrived yet. When Hagrid asks for some brandy, Mrs. Weasley runs to the kitchen, rather than Summoning it. Harry thinks she is hiding her tears. Shortly, when Lupin arrives with George, who is injured, Mrs. Weasley immediately tends his wound. Lupin takes Harry aside and queries him to confirm that he is the genuine Harry. Lupin fears someone in the Order betrayed them. The remaining pairs trickle in, leaving only Mundungus Fletcher and &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody missing. Fletcher apparently panicked and Disapparated; the killing spell aimed at him hit Moody instead, though his body is never found. Harry, convinced his presence endangers the others, volunteers to leave, but Mrs. Weasley demands that he stay.

The Order knows about the Trio's mission for Dumbledore, but once rebuffed, simply offer their assistance. Mrs. Weasley, however, is more persistent and questions Harry directly, though he gently refuses to provide any information. Though Mrs. Weasley apparently settles into preparing for Bill and Fleur's wedding, the tasks she assigns Harry, Hermione, and Ron seem intended to separate them, thus preventing their preparation for the mission. Harry, fretting over this obstacle, rhetorically asks out loud whether Mrs. Weasley expects someone else to bump off Voldemort; Ginny, who is helping him, apparently now understands Harry's mission and becomes upset, though Harry pretends he was only joking.

Mrs. Weasley's attempt to separate the Trio eventually fails when Mr. Weasley frees Harry from a task. Harry goes to Ron's room, finding Hermione is also there. They do some planning before Mrs. Weasley discovers them and assigns new tasks.

When Fleur's mother arrives, she calms Mrs. Weasley's nerves immediately. Everything is lovely, everything is perfect, and Mrs. Delacour pitches in and helps, including providing a spell that cleans out the recalcitrant oven that has given Ron such problems.

As the next day is Harry's birthday, Mrs. Weasley asks Harry what he would like. Feeling he is already burden enough on the Weasleys during this busy time, Harry responds he needs nothing, and does not want a big fuss made. However, on his birthday, Mrs. Weasley gives Harry a gold watch, a traditional gift for a wizard on reaching his majority. Mrs. Weasley diffidently apologizes for its used condition, saying it belonged to her late brother; Harry understands its significance, and hugs Mrs. Weasley in gratitude. Later, Harry sees Mrs. Weasley carrying what looks like an enormous Golden Snitch; investigating, he realizes it is his birthday cake.

Rufus Scrimgeour's meeting with Harry, Ron, and Hermione later that day to discuss Dumbledore's Will becomes heated, and tempers flare. The shouting brings Mr. and Mrs. Weasley to the parlour, just in time to see an angry Scrimgeour exiting.

On Bill and Fleur's wedding day, while we can see that Mrs. Weasley has done an excellent decorating job, she has very little role in the celebrations.

Mrs. Weasley is not seen again until she arrives in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] in response to the Order being summoned to defend Hogwarts. The entire Weasley clan are in the Room of Requirement when Percy arrives. After a strained moment, which Fleur attempts to defuse, Percy loudly declares he has been a blind, ambitious fool, and asks for his family's forgiveness. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley greet this news with loving hugs, and they head to battle together.

We see Mrs. Weasley once in passing: during a break in the battle, as Harry carries [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s memories to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] in the Headmaster's office, he sees the Weasley family gathered together, mourning Fred's death.

Near the end of the battle at Hogwarts, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] is dueling Hermione, Ginny, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]]. When a deadly curse narrowly misses Ginny, Mrs. Weasley, enraged that her daughter is being attacked and vowing another Weasley will not be lost, engages Bellatrix in a fierce combat, killing her. Seeing Bellatrix fall, Voldemort hurls a curse at Mrs. Weasley; Harry, from under the Invisibility Cloak, blocks it.

In the victory celebration following the battle, Harry sees the Weasley family sitting together, and Ginny leaning against her mother. Harry avoids imposing himself, allowing them to grieve their loss privately.

== Strengths ==

Molly Weasley is a loving wife and devoted mother who cares deeply for her family; she is very much the kingpin around which the entire Weasley clan revolves. Though her magical abilities are largely unseen until the final battle at Hogwarts, she is an extremely powerful witch and excellent duelist, able to defeat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], a formidable opponent, single-handedly. 

While we are unable to judge her intelligence relative to (say) her husband, she has raised a family of very powerful, and in the Twins' case, very inventive, wizards. Her position within the Order of the Phoenix would also indicate she possesses a keener mind than might initially be supposed. She is genuinely friendly and congenial, but underlying this is a direct and forceful character, far more than her husband; she never hesitates to speak her mind, whether it is about the family, Harry, or issues pertaining to the Order of the Phoenix.

Molly is also generous to others, taking Harry into the family as one of her own, providing him gifts, even though there is little money to buy her own children presents. She cares enough that she is unable to allow him to go without while her offspring, despite how meager it may be, always receive a gift on holidays and birthdays.

== Weaknesses ==

As we see in the episode with the Boggart in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Molly's greatest fear is harm befalling her children or her husband... or Harry. Seeing these fears manifest themselves in solid form leaves her weakened and in tears. It is this fear and her love for her family that propels her to combat Bellatrix single handedly, a potentially unwise decision given that, being in Voldemort's upper echelon, Bellatrix is an extremely powerful witch. It is Molly's hitherto unheralded dueling skill that leaves her the victor.

While Molly dearly loves her children, and she and her husband, poor as they are, always provide for them, she can be insensitive regarding their emotional needs. When Ron is required to have formal robes for his fourth year, the hideous lace-trimmed garment she selects not only embarrasses Ron, but unintentionally makes him a target for ridicule, particularly by Draco Malfoy and his cohorts. As a result, Ron's low self-esteem and shaky confidence nosedives even further. That Molly selects proper robes for Harry because he can afford them only makes matters worse, by emphasizing the financial disparity between the two boys and adding fuel to Ron's occasional jealous bouts. Molly, however, seems oblivious to Ron's anguish, mainly concerned with fulfilling her parental obligation to supply her child's requirement for what the family can afford. However, this pattern softens as the Weasley finances later improve, and Molly, though initially hesitant, agrees to buy Ron a new broom when he is made a Gryffindor Prefect.

She also fails to support Fred and George's plan to open a joke shop, convinced it is a silly and doomed venture; she firmly believes they can only succeed by pursuing traditional careers. However, this belief is probably motivated by the many years she and Arthur struggled financially, even with Arthur's stable, though low-paying, Ministry job.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Molly Weasley cares deeply for her children. Like all parents, she wants to be proud of her offspring. As a result, she is possibly a little more ambitious on their behalf than they are themselves. She seems disappointed that the Twins have no interest in working for the Ministry, apparently believing that their starting a joke shop is somehow beneath them or doomed to failure. She is proud when Percy is appointed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch's]] assistant, and must be pleased, at least initially, by his apparent rapid rise within the Ministry. His departure from the family, stormy as it is, pains Molly deeply.

Molly does recognize her children's individuality, and we see a separate motherly dynamic in action for each. She is, for instance, always nagging Bill about his long hair, and chastising the Twins' over their low grades and meager OWLs. She accepts Percy's pompousness, perhaps thinking it justified in someone who is selected as Prefect and later Head Boy. Her interaction with Ron is more varied; perhaps because we observe it more closely, Ron being almost a viewpoint character in the series, but it seems a largely mutual exasperation, Ron at the exigencies of their financial situation, Molly at Ron's inability to handle it. Apart from the protectiveness we see late in book 7, there is little visible interaction between Molly and Ginny.

One ongoing thorn in Molly's side must be Arthur, her husband. Arthur's fascination with Muggle artifacts and techniques exasperates her, his experimenting with spells on them vexes her, and his unwillingness to discipline the children, the Twins in particular, infuriates her. Further, although she never outwardly mentions it, his lack of ambition must gall her as well; surely, if he had a little more gumption, he could advance to a higher-paying Ministry job. And yet, their marriage seems solid, caring for and about each other.

Harry's experience with Molly begins somewhat alarmingly. When he first arrives at The Burrow, Molly tears a strip off the Twins and Ron for their previous night's misadventure, even though it was to rescue Harry. Harry fears he is in for the same, but Molly instantly moderates her tone, knowing he is blameless, and, after a warm welcome, invites him in for breakfast. Molly, throughout the six years starting with ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', brings Harry into her own circle, caring for him as she does her own children, but always recognizing her limited authority over him. We are perhaps mildly surprised that Molly never scolds Harry for reckless behavior, considering his possible death is among her worst fears.

== Analysis ==

For almost the entire series, we see Molly Weasley as essentially &quot;the good mother&quot;, nurturing her children, worrying about them, scolding them when they misbehave, and shielding them from life's cold, harsh realities as best she can. Over time, she also takes Harry under her wing, treating him and defending him as she would her own children. This becomes quite apparent early on in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where she argues unsuccessfully against letting Harry be told the Order's business. In this, she is battling her own husband, who agrees with the other Order members that Harry has a right to know. Additionally, Arthur believes in being a softer disciplinarian than Molly, particularly regarding the Twins. We see this first in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], where, upon being told the Twins took the flying car without permission, his first reaction is to ask how it went, rather than to scold them for taking it. We see it again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], where Arthur, who scolds the Twins for dropping a magical toffee where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] would find it, suddenly backtracks when Molly appears. Molly's attempts to protect Harry come to a head in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where she continually separates Harry, Ron, and Hermione with various tasks, apparently hoping to derail their mission for Dumbledore, fearing just what that mission actually entails. Like many teenagers, Harry chafes at being over-protected, though without openly rebelling. Perhaps because he has been so starved for affection, he accepts this protectiveness as part of the package, and understands its underlying motive. However, he avoids it long enough to make the necessary preparations for his mission. 

It is only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], when she skillfully defeats Bellatrix Lestrange in a duel, killing her, that Molly is revealed to be an extremely powerful witch who has apparently been suppressing her talents while raising her family. From our first meeting with her, in retrospect, we do sense there is a restrained power, a self-assurance in her manner that hardly tallies with the simple housewife persona she projects. It is also unlikely she would be an integral Order of the Phoenix member unless she had specific and significant talents. Granted, one would also have to be very self-assured to deal with raising her sons, especially [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], but perhaps their nature is due to their having inherited her power and forceful personality. It seems that they are their mother's sons, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] have inherited more from their father. It is certainly true that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] seems to have inherited much of Molly's nature and temperament.

Though nothing has been specifically mentioned about Molly Weasley's wand, it can be guessed, as per the author's entry about wandlore and wand woods in Pottermore, that Molly Weasley may have been an owner of a Cedar wand. Molly, through the first 6 books, does not show outstanding magical and duelist abilities, yet it remains a back-ground factor that her home-making and culinary skills are flawless. Moreover, following Fred's death and Bellatrix' direct attack on Ginny Weasley, Molly Weasley surfaces as a fearsome wielder of martial magical abilities, a characteristic that is peculiar to the carriers of a Cedar wand.

== Overview ==

'''''Arthur Weasley''''' is the head of the Weasley family, and so is father to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. He worked at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] was the Minister of Magic. Arthur was then promoted to head the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]] became the Minister. After Scrimgeour leaves the Ministry, this Office is likely abolished, but we do not learn where Arthur is reassigned; he does continue working for the Ministry. Arthur is a thin man, going bald, but the little hair on his head is as red as any of his children’s. His dearest wish is to find out how Muggle airplanes stay up.

Arthur Weasley's birthday is apparently 6 February.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

It is mentioned that Mr. Weasley, Ron Weasley's father, works with the Ministry of Magic, however he otherwise plays no part in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Mr. Weasley first appears when he arrives home from an overnight Ministry raid searching for Dark magic objects to find that Fred, George, and Ron have rescued [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']]. Mr. Weasley is intrigued, first, by Harry's presence, and second, by the Twins having used his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ford Anglia|flying car]]. &quot;How did it go?&quot; When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|his wife, Molly]], sternly reminds him their behavior was bad, Mr. Weasley weakly chastises them. Ron and Harry depart, and Mrs. Weasley's yelling can be heard even from Ron's attic bedroom. 

Mr. Weasley accompanies the group to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] to shop for school supplies. Heated remarks, partly motivated by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]'s Muggle parents being present, are exchanged with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] at Flourish &amp; Blott's, and result in a brawl from which Mr. Weasley emerges slightly the worse for wear.

All of the Weasley children, plus Harry, ride from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] to London in Mr. Weasley's flying car; Mrs. Weasley comments on how there seems to be so much room inside, unaware that Mr. Weasley has charmed it so that the inside is larger than the outside. At King's Cross Station, Ron and Harry are unable to pass through the barrier at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]]. They fly Mr. Weasley's car to Hogwarts, where it crashes into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]. The car ejects them before wildly driving off into the Forbidden Forest; it re-appears later, saving Harry and Ron from the giant spider, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog's]], children.

We next see Mr. Weasley after Ginny Weasley is rescued from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]. Mr. Weasley chastises her: &quot;How many times have I told you not to trust something, if you can't see where it keeps its brains?&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Mr. Weasley accompanies his family (Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], Fred, George, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]) to Diagon Alley for school supplies. After dinner, Harry returns to the lounge to look for the Rat Tonic Ron bought for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], his pet rat. He overhears Mr. and Mrs. Weasley discussing whether or not Harry should be told that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] has escaped from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Black apparently intends to murder Harry. As students board the Hogwarts Express the next day, Mr. Weasley takes Harry aside to tell him about Black; Harry admits he overheard the previous night's conversation. Mr. Weasley asks Harry to promise he will not go looking for Sirius Black, but the train departs before Harry can respond, leaving him confused about why Mr. Weasley thinks he would want to look for Black.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Mr. Weasley procures tickets for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are invited to attend with the family. After Harry receives [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]'s grudging permission, Mr. Weasley arranges to collect Harry. Mr. Weasley, unaware the Dursleys boarded over their fireplace, has had it connected to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]. When he arrives with Ron and the Twins in this constricted, closed space, Mr. Weasley determines that his only way out is to blast a hole in the wall, terrifying the Dursleys. The situation remains strained, even though Mr. Weasley attempts to engage Vernon and Petunia in a friendly conversation about electricity. Fred accidentally-on-purpose drops some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|Ton-Tongue Toffee]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley Dursley]] picks it up and eats it, massively enlarging his tongue. Mayhem ensues, with the Dursleys, clearly blaming anything to do with the Wizarding world, attacking Mr. Weasley with china figurines even as he tries to help them.

Returning to the Burrow, Mr. Weasley is angry enough to scold the Twins for their behavior, warning them that these type of pranks damage Muggle-Wizard relationships. He threatens to tell Mrs. Weasley, but when she, entering, demands, &quot;tell me what?&quot; he backs off sharply, though apparently not sharply enough. From Ron's bedroom, Harry and Ron can again hear Mrs. Weasley yelling.

Early the next morning, Mr. Weasley, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Fred, George, and Ginny walk to Stoatshead Hill, where, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] and his son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], they find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] that will transport them to the match. Arriving at the campground, they set up camp, with Mr. Weasley enchanted by such common things as matches and the mallet used to drive in tent pegs. Tea and breakfast are finally ready, just as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] arrive from the nearby woods, where they have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparated]] in. Throughout the afternoon, Mr. Weasley exchanges greetings with other Ministry wizards passing by, while identifying them for the others. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludovic Bagman]] stops by, taking bets on the match's outcome, and asking if Mr. Weasley has seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]]; shortly afterwards, Bartemius himself stops by, and they discuss problems Ludo is having with the Bulgarian delegation. They also mention some event that will be happening at Hogwarts; Mr. Weasley and Percy evidently know what this event is, but reveal nothing to the inquisitive students.

Mr. Weasley escorts Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley children to the top box, where Mr. Weasley has a small run-in with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. During the game, Mr. Weasley has to restrain his sons and Harry, who are entranced by the Bulgarian mascots, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]]. He promises that the Irish mascots are even more impressive: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Leprechaun|leprechauns]] appear, showering the crowd with gold coins. When the competition between the Quidditch teams turns ugly, so does the conflict between the team mascots; the Veela, throwing fireballs, start turning into bird-like creatures with cruel beaks, displaying their true appearance. Mr. Weasley wisely comments that women should not be judged by looks alone.

After the match, a riot breaks out; Mr. Weasley, along with Bill, Charlie, and Percy, leave to battle the mob of apparent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], while Harry, Ron, and Hermione hide in the woods; someone nearby invokes Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] that appears in the night sky. Shortly after, they are surrounded by wizards casting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunners]] in all directions. Mr. Weasley rushes in and defends Harry, Ron, and Hermione against Bartemius Crouch's accusations that they summoned the Mark. After the confusion has abated, Mr. Weasley ushers Harry, Ron, and Hermione back to their tents, reassuring them along the way. After a short night, everyone catches an early Portkey back to Stoatshead Hill and the Burrow. Mrs. Weasley, reading about the riots in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], is relieved to see them all safe.

Later, hack journalist [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] publishes an article in which she deliberately misquotes Mr. Weasley, and for the rest of the summer, he works long hours at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], attempting to repair the damage. Mr. Weasley is at the Ministry when Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Fred, and George leave for Hogwarts.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When Harry reaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], Mr. Weasley is already there, ensconced in a meeting with other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] members. He has dinner along with the other Weasleys, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Fred and George had earlier warned Harry that he should not mention Percy, who is estranged from the family, and whenever Percy's name is mentioned, &quot;Dad breaks whatever he's holding&quot;.

When Remus asks Harry after dinner if he has any questions about Voldemort, Molly Weasley protests; Mr. Weasley, supporting Lupin and Sirius, avers that Harry has a right to know. Harry's insistence that he will only tell Ron and Hermione anything he learns earns them, Fred, and George permission to stay and listen as Harry's questions are answered. Defeated, Mrs. Weasley still sends a protesting Ginny to bed. Between them, Lupin, Sirius, Mr. Weasley, and Bill explain what the Order of the Phoenix is, and what they believe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] is attempting to do.

Mr. Weasley accompanies Harry, charged with using underage magic, to the Ministry of Magic for his hearing. Mr. Weasley suggests they travel by non-magical means to make a better impression, so they commute by subway. Mr. Weasley is enthralled by the ticket vending machines (even though they are broken), and by the escalators. He and Harry use the Ministry's visitor's entrance, then travel through the Ministry and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] branch, to his office, an over-filled converted broom closet. When the hearing starts, Mr. Weasley escorts Harry to the courtroom, then waits outside until Harry returns, cleared of all charges. As he and Harry are discussing the trial, Percy Weasley exits the courtroom; he apparently fails to notice Mr. Weasley, who says nothing to him, though his expression tightens. Mr. Weasley and Harry see Cornelius Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy as they pass through the Ministry Atrium; spotting Mr. Weasley and Harry, Lucius suggests they finish their discussion, which apparently concerns a large donation Malfoy will be making, to the Minister's office.

Just before Christmas, Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] the snake attacking Mr. Weasley. Harry alerts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] who takes him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]; Dumbledore, in turn, dispatches the Headmaster portraits to raise the alarm. Mr. Weasley is found alive, but seriously injured, and taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]]. The Weasley children and Harry are sent by Portkey to Grimmauld Place; after a tense night, Mrs. Weasley sends word that Mr. Weasley will survive. Shortly after, the family visits him in the hospital. Mr. Weasley effusively thanks Harry for saving his life, though Harry is uncertain how much gratitude he deserves; having witnessed the attack through the snake's eyes, he believes he may have been the agent of the attack on Mr. Weasley. Later, while Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]] are discussing the incident, Harry overhears Moody saying that Harry may be possessed by Voldemort.

On Christmas, the family visits Mr. Weasley again. Arthur is enchanted by Harry's gift, a collection of screwdrivers and fuse wire. It seems that he and an apprentice healer have been experimenting with Muggle healing techniques, and have tried something called &quot;stitches&quot; on Mr. Weasley's wound. This has apparently been less than successful. Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave as Mrs. Weasley starts winding up to yell at her husband.

Shortly before school starts again, Mr. Weasley returns to Grimmauld Place, fully healed. His arrival, with all his family, interrupts an incipient duel between Sirius and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], though Mr. Weasley believes that the situation was not as serious as Harry thought.

Finally, Mr. Weasley is present at King's Cross station when Harry returns from school. Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley, Tonks, and Moody, along with Ron, Harry, and Hermione, speak to the Dursleys, saying that they expect to hear regularly from Harry, and if they do not, they will be visiting to see what is wrong.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

At The Burrow, Mrs. Weasley tells Harry that Mr. Weasley has been working extremely long hours at the Ministry. Mr. Weasley arrives later, extremely wearied. Being a Ministry employee, and feeling he must set a good example, before Mrs. Weasley lets him enter, he confirms who she is and insists that she do the same. In this exchange, we learn that his dearest wish is to learn how Muggle airplanes stay up.

As he is working long hours, Mr. Weasley is seldom seen while Harry is at the Burrow, though he accompanies Mrs. Weasley, Harry, Hermione, Ginny, and Ron to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies. He is scandalized that vendors are offering phony anti-Dark magic charms, saying if he was on duty, he would run them in. Mrs. Weasley asks him to remain calm. The family splits up, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione going to Madam Malkin's for robes, escorted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], while Ginny and her parents head to Flourish &amp; Blotts for textbooks. They regroup later to visit Fred and George's store, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]].

Mr. Weasley escorts Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny to the Hogwarts Express. On the platform, Harry privately tells Mr. Weasley that he followed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]] in Knockturn Alley. While there, Malfoy spoke about some Dark magic object that he needed repaired. Mr. Weasley says they have thoroughly searched [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] and found nothing.

Ron later passes Mr. Weasley's message to Harry saying that Malfoy Manor was searched again, and still nothing was found.

We see Mr. Weasley during Christmas at the Burrow. Harry says he overheard Malfoy and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] discussing some task the Dark Lord has assigned Draco, and about an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] Snape made to Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy. Mr. Weasley believes Snape may be trying to determine what Draco's mission is, to report it to the Order of the Phoenix; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] echoes this opinion.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We hear that Mr. Weasley visited the Dursleys with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], advising them to accept the Order's offer to hide them when Harry turns 17 and the protective charms that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]]'s death provided end. Unimpressed by Mr. Weasley, who half-destroyed the parlor when he last visited, Vernon Dursley, nonetheless, accepts guidance from Shacklebolt, possibly because he has seen him on TV, standing behind the Prime Minister.

Mr. Weasley is among the protectors accompanying the six Harry Potter decoys used to confuse the Death Eaters when Harry leaves Privet Drive shortly before his 17th birthday. Additionally, Hagrid mentions that the defensive modifications to Sirius Black's motorcycle, the one which the true Harry will be riding, were done by Mr. Weasley. 

On arriving at the Burrow, Mr. Weasley rushes in to see what is happening, and is dismayed that George's ear was severed by a spell, but relieved there is no other injury.

Mr. Weasley assists Mrs. Weasley in preparing for Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding. When Mrs. Weasley assigns Harry and Mr. Weasley the job of cleaning the chicken coop, Mr. Weasley tells Harry not to bother; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]] has sent Sirius' wrecked flying motorcycle, which Mr. Weasley has stored in the chicken coop, hoping to figure out how brakes work when he puts it all back together.

When the Ministry falls and Death Eaters attack The Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape, eventually taking refuge in Grimmauld Place. Mr. Weasley sends his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] there, letting them know the family is safe and to not reply, they are being watched.

Before infiltrating the Ministry to search for Voldemort's Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], Harry, Ron, and Hermione secretly observe its operations for a month. They watch Mr. Weasley going in with the other Ministry workers each morning and returning home in the evening. When they actually enter the Ministry to locate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], who has the Locket, Harry is on a lift (US: elevator) with Mr. Weasley when Percy steps on. Percy, seeing his father there, quickly gets off at the next floor; Mr. Weasley confronts Harry, who is disguised as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albert Runcorn|Albert Runcorn]], and tells him that if he provides information against any other wizards as he did against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]], he will be in deep trouble. Harry warns Mr. Weasley that he has a trace on him, but Mr. Weasley thinks &quot;Runcorn&quot; is threatening him.

Mr. Weasley also participates in the final battle at Hogwarts. We see him and Percy, who has reconciled with the family, together dropping the healed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], and later with the other Weasleys following the battle, consoling each other over the tragic loss of Fred in the battle.

== Strengths ==

Arthur Weasley appears to be a talented and competent wizard. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|The Weasleys]] are one of the Old Wizarding Families, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|pureblood]] as far back as they can trace. However, Mr. Weasley, and the entire family, shun Voldemort's &quot;pure-blood&quot; superiority ideology, believing their ancestry should grant them no particular advantage or status over Half-bloods, Muggle-borns, or even Muggles. Many Pure-blood wizards consider this a betrayal, and have branded the Weasleys, and those like them, with the epithet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood traitor|&quot;blood traitor&quot;]]. This &quot;betrayal of the blood&quot; has resulted in Mr. Weasley receiving verbal abuse from pure-blood wizards, who also generally mock his relative poverty. Mr. Weasley's strong character shows in his unflinching response to these assaults. As late as the final book, we see him not only standing his ground against these attacks, but challenging Albert Runcorn (who unknown to him is actually Harry Potter in disguise), a high-level official in the now Death-eater dominated Ministry of Magic.

A devoted husband and loving father, Mr. Weasley always puts his family first. His main strength is his affable, calm demeanor and also his compassion. Lucius Malfoy claims Mr. Weasley is, &quot;a disgrace to the name of wizard,&quot; because he helped author Muggle Protection Laws that he now enforces. 

Mr. Weasley feels that everyone should be given a chance. This even extends to allowing others to possibly place him at risk: while hospitalized after being attacked, Mr. Weasley agreed to allow an apprentice healer to experiment with new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] wound-healing methods on him.

== Weaknesses ==

It could be argued that Mr. Weasley's inability to control the Twins, or other family members, is a weakness. However, whenever a Weasley child needs any correction, he is swift to apply it; witness his reaction when he discovered one of the Twins inveigling Ron into making an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]], an act that can result in death. It is perhaps more likely that he feels very deeply about his children, to the point that, particularly after Mrs. Weasley's usual browbeating, he feels it is unreasonable or unnecessary to additionally scold or punish them.

In Lord Voldemort's eyes and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], of course, his love for his children is a weakness, as is his fondness for Muggles and their technology. To Percy Weasley and others in the Ministry, Mr. Weasley's lack of ambition is clearly considered a deficiency. He, however, is happy with his job, and though it may pay less than he would like, he feels he is doing something that benefits Wizardkind; he has no desire to advance to a post that would take him away from his beloved Muggles.

However content Mr. Weasley may be with his stalled Ministry career, his underachieving nature has created a hardship for his wife and children. His meager salary barely supports the family, and Molly and the seven offspring have always had to make do with few extras&amp;mdash;used and hand-me-down goods are a Weasley tradition. The older boys hardly seem bothered by this, but Ron's self-esteem is particularly affected. He, being the youngest of six sons, is often the last to inherit family possessions that have exchanged many hands. And though Ginny is younger than Ron, she, being a girl, has different requirements, or, by the time Ron is ready to pass on something to her, it may have become so shoddy as to be unusable and must be replaced, likely with a better second-hand item. Mr. Weasley does accept a promotion later in the series, allowing him to better provide for the family, particularly after the older boys have moved out.

Readers have little feel for Mr. Weasley's magical abilities. Given the charms he is able to work on the Ford Anglia, and on Sirius Black's flying motorcycle, one guesses that he is at the very least capable. The flying car, in particular, is quite a magical feat, apparently becoming sentient enough to recognize family members, and it later rescues Ron and Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''; it is unclear if Mr. Weasley ever intended for his charm to have such a profound effect on it, and he may actually possess powers he fails to recognize or has never taken the initiative to fully develop. From his selection by Moody as a protector for the seven Potter decoys, he must be a reasonably strong duelist and skilled with defensive spells, though we never directly see him in battle.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Arthur Weasley is a devoted husband who enjoys a loving relationship with his wife, Molly. As the family patriarch, Mr. Weasley is supposedly called in when Molly is unable to control the children. He is rather remarkably ineffective at this, however, unwilling to punish his offspring more than they have been already. The only time we see him angry is after the Twins tricked Harry's cousin Dudley with Ton-Tongue Toffee. It is mentioned that, in the past, he was furious enough to strike Fred for inciting Ron to make an Unbreakable Vow, a potentially lethal act.

Arthur does seem more than a little overshadowed by his wife, though that may be simply the viewpoint from which we see them. Throughout the series, Harry, despite eventually reaching his majority, is treated by the Weasley family more or less as one of their own children, and so he, and we, will understand Arthur and Molly's relationship through a child's eyes. A more mature reader may guess that Arthur has followed a somewhat old-fashioned parenting path, leaving the daily child-rearing duties to Molly and acting primarily as the family bread-winner. Given the odd hours he is required to be working, this is likely a workable solution, though it does put rather a strain on Molly. We are only given occasional hints of their interactions when the children are not present, but what hints we are granted do suggest that Arthur and Molly remain devoted to each other, even after seven children and at least twenty five years of marriage.

The Weasley children dearly love their father, though even they may consider him rather eccentric. When Percy, the third eldest son, becomes obsessed with his Ministry career and mindlessly follows their anti-Harry Potter agenda, he estranges himself from the family. Mr. Weasley becomes particularly upset over Percy's behavior. Percy eventually reconciles with the family, and Mr. Weasley immediately accepts him back.

Mr. Weasley is also close to Harry, treating him much like a son, though their relationship is never as strong as the ones Harry shares with Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Albus Dumbledore, or even Rubeus Hagrid. Harry is always a welcome visitor at The Burrow, but with seven children, it would seem unlikely that Harry would receive any special attention other than as an honored guest. Presumably their relationship grows much closer after Harry marries Ginny Weasley.

Muggles endlessly fascinate Mr. Weasley, particularly the strange items they use in lieu of magic, and their resulting lifestyle. Mr. Weasley constantly queries Harry Potter about his life while at the Dursleys; he is also curious about Hermione Granger's and her Muggle parents' lives; his attempts to discuss Muggle technology with the Dursleys [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 4|when he visits there]] terrifies them. He has a very open, congenial character, and always attempts to engage someone in conversation.

It is his fondness for Muggles that has Mr. Weasley often at daggers drawn with Lucius Malfoy. Their ongoing feud [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|erupts into a physical altercation]] in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''.

Mr. Weasley is an Order of the Phoenix member, and he appears to be well liked and regarded by other Order members; Dumbledore apparently places the utmost trust in his abilities and loyalty, and recognizes the important role he plays in not only protecting Harry, but providing him a surrogate family life.

== Analysis ==

We can see that Arthur is intended to be something of a father figure, from the first time we meet him. He is overshadowed by Dumbledore, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin, who are either more closely connected to Harry (Sirius is his godfather), or because they spend more time with Harry (Dumbledore and Lupin are at the school, where Harry spends the major part of his time). Arthur's fatherly influence is largely limited to what Harry picks up from Arthur's interactions with his sons, but Harry's feeling at home in The Burrow clearly means that he accepts Arthur's nominal head of household position there.

Many of the names given to characters in the Potter series clearly are meant to carry some indication of the personalities involved. In the case of Arthur, one wonders if the association one is meant to draw, consciously or otherwise, is with the legendary English king. There are definitely some similarities in the feelings of the characters of Arthur Weasley and the Arthur portrayed by T. H. White in ''The Once and Future King''; notably, Arthur Weasley shares King Arthur's preoccupation with the rule of law and the rights of all people, not just the birthright &quot;nobility,&quot; represented in the Potter series by the &quot;pure-blood&quot; wizards. This connection is somewhat tenuous, so while it could be quite interesting to explore, it may be beyond the scope of this work. One does rather wonder whether Molly is meant to represent Guinevere in this case, exactly who would be filling the roles of Merlin and Lancelot, and whether Percy is an analog for Mordred.

It is interesting to note that in the original plotline for the seven-book series, the author intended that Arthur Weasley would not survive Nagini's attack at the Ministry in book 5. In the ongoing pattern of father figures falling to Voldemort, Arthur Weasley was supposed to fall in this book, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. It is uncertain why Arthur was spared, but it certainly seems to tighten the bonds between the Weasley family and Harry when he becomes the instrument that saves their father. The author has later stated that Mr. Weasley's death would have radically changed the dynamics between the Trio, effectively nullifying Ron's good humour, which helps to balance and bind the group&lt;!-- I read this online somewhere, but need to find a citation-PNW Raven --&gt;.

== General Overview ==

'''''Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry''''' &quot;is the best school of wizardry in Great Britain&quot;, according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]]. In fact, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=91 the author has implied] that it is the only school of wizardry in Britain — while every Wizarding child ''can'' go to Hogwarts, the author states that not all ''do'' choose to do so.  Also, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], it is stated that before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] takeover of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], parents of Wizarding children could, instead of sending them to Hogwarts, homeschool them or send them abroad if they so wished, implying that those were the only three options available.  The events of the first six books of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] series, and the climax of the seventh book, occur largely in and around this school, which Harry attends to get his education from the time he turns 11.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Founded roughly a thousand years before the events of the series by the four Founders ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]), Hogwarts, the premier Wizarding school in Britain, is housed in a large magically-active castle near the Wizarding village of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. The castle itself is protected by Anti-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] wards (preventing an attacker from suddenly appearing in its midst), and Muggle-Repellent charms (to the occasional [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] who is determined to approach, the castle is spelled to look like a dangerous ruin, with keep-away warning signs posted). The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], adjacent to the school grounds, contains many wild magical creatures, some of which are actively hostile towards humans, Wizarding or not. Situated at the edge of the Forest, the Groundskeeper's Hut, where Rubeus Hagrid (&quot;Keeper of the Keys and Grounds&quot;) lives, is well-placed for looking after the subjects of each [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] class (taught by Hagrid starting in Harry's third year).

The Hogwarts student body is Sorted at enrollment (by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]]), along lines of aptitude and predilection, into four Houses named after the four Founders ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ravenclaw House|Ravenclaw]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hufflepuff House|Hufflepuff]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]]) and nurturing those characteristics each Founder thought most important. Since even the Founders were unable to keep solidarity ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] left after a legendary dispute with the others), the Houses, each with a professor who doubles as the Head of that House, tend towards friction and rivalry, particularly between Slytherin and Gryffindor. 

The rivalries usually confine themselves to Quidditch (each House fields a team of players, vying for the Quidditch Cup) and the House Cup competition (Houses are awarded points for student excellence and penalized points for student misbehavior and indolence, leading to an end-of-year tally and award).

At the start of the Harry Potter series, the House Heads are:

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]], Head of Gryffindor, who teaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] and is also Deputy Headmistress. Gryffindor House nurtures courage and commitment to a cause.

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], Head of Slytherin, who teaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]]. Slytherin House nurtures self-sufficient cunning, resourcefulness and ambition.

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Filius Flitwick]], Head of Ravenclaw, who teaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]]. Ravenclaw House nurtures thoughtful scholarship and intellectual brilliance.

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Pomona Sprout]], Head of Hufflepuff, who teaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] and runs the school's greenhouses. Hufflepuff House nurtures hard work, tolerance and loyalty.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] holds the position of Headmaster of Hogwarts, in addition to his public duties on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]] (and his later covert activities with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]).

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]], is the castle's Custodian, aided by unknown numbers of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-Elves]] who clean and cook. There is at least one resident [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]] for each House (Gryffindor has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], Hufflepuff has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Friar|The Fat Friar]], Ravenclaw has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|The Grey Lady]], and Slytherin has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|The Bloody Baron]]), plus [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves The Poltergeist]], who is allowed residence by Dumbledore to &quot;keep everyone on their toes&quot;. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Poppy Pomfrey]] is the Medi-Witch who runs the Hospital Wing, the school Infirmary. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Irma Pince|Irma Pince]] runs the school's Library and guards the dangerous books in its Restricted Section.

Castle security is assisted by the House Ghosts, and by the many Wizarding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|portraits]] (paintings where the depicted person can speak and move from frame to frame), such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], which password-protect some passages and monitor the rooms and corridors.

J.K. Rowling has said in an interview that Hogwarts is somewhere in Scotland; its position is uncertain, because it is Charmed to be Unplottable – its position, like that of the other magic schools, cannot be placed on a map. Additionally, it is hidden by spells that make it appear to Muggles as an old ruin, complete with Danger signs. The map here shows the most likely locations of the three schools of wizardry in Europe. For Hogwarts specifically, this article makes the following assumptions:
Hogwarts is not in the most populated areas of Scotland since in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] it is said that the nearest Muggle town is several miles away (a situation that does not exist around Edinburgh and Glasgow). Also are excluded the Scottish Islands, since one can go to Hogwarts by train from London.

=== Academics ===

The school year at Hogwarts is broken into four terms. 
*Autumn term starts at the first of September with the arrival of the students, and continues to the start of the Christmas holidays, usually in late December. 
*Winter term extends from the end of the Christmas holidays to the beginning of the Easter break, usually in mid to late March or early April.
*Spring term runs from the end of Easter break to the start of exams, which occur during the first full week (or two weeks) in June.
*Summer term comprises the time from the last day of exams to the end of classes at the end of June. 

Summer term, a short term, is usually seen as a time to laze around and rest from the year; exams are finished, and while there may be one last Quidditch game between the houses, and there are classes still, most peoples' marks are pretty well settled, so things are taken rather lightly.

All subjects are elective after fifth-year OWL exams; you are only allowed to proceed in a subject if your OWL grades are high enough for the teacher of that course. Until and including fifth year, you must take certain core subjects. The subjects available at Hogwarts are given below:

**Teacher: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]]

=== Class sizes and duration ===

Hogwarts classes are held in different locations within the castle and grounds. Class usually last for one and a half hours, even if they are shared by two Houses. Higher years often have &quot;double&quot; classes, which means they last three hours; Potions classes quite often are double, because potion preparation can take longer than a single class would have time for. There are three class periods, typically, in the morning, and three in the afternoon.

Class size is typically thirty students, according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 12|information in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. This gives a total student population of about 840, or 210 in each House.

=== Grades Classification ===

Grades classification refer here are only given in the student's essay works, quizzes, assignments, homework and examinations.

*'''Passing Grades'''
**O - Outstanding
**E - Exceeds Expectations
**A - Acceptable

*'''Failing Grades'''
**P - Poor
**D - Dreadful
**T - Troll

=== Examinations Given ===

Final examinations are held each year between the end of spring or Easter term and the start of Summer term, and these exams must be passed in order to advance to the next year. In the books, one or two characters ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Flint]] and possibly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]) apparently are held back a year. There are also two major examinations for Hogwarts students:

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels)]] - 'the examinations Hogwarts student took at the age of fifteen' (actually in their fifth year – anyone having a birthday during the school year would be sixteen when they sat these exams) and 'really important, affect the job you can apply for and everything'. These are equivalent to the O-level or GCSE exams in England.
* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T. (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test)]] - examination taken in the seventh year at Hogwarts, roughly equivalent to the old-style English A-level exams.

=== Life at Hogwarts ===

Hogwarts is a very traditional British secondary boarding school, but magical education necessitates many differences.  There are few modern facilities, indeed the castle has no electricity.  This is largely due to the presence of high levels of magical energy fields that cause electrical and electronic devices to malfunction.  Heating is provided by fireplaces and stoves maintained by a large staff of house elves.  House elves also prepare three meals a day for students and staff as well as several feasts throughout the year.  The food is varied, excellent and plentiful.  The castle does have a relatively modern plumbing system including public rest rooms and at least one luxurious magical bath.

Letters and parcels are usually delivered to students during breakfast in the Great Hall by owls who bring them directly to individuals.  Both school and privately owned owls reside in a common owlery.  

The school has a large library that includes a restricted section for advanced texts requiring faculty permission to read. The resident librarian, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Irma Pince|Irma Pince]], seems to be almost fanatical in her caring for the books.

Studying and homework are usually done in the house common rooms, the library, the Great Hall around mealtimes, or in the grounds in good weather.  Like the rest of the Wizarding world, written work is done with quills, liquid ink in bottles, and parchment.  Written assignments are often measured in either the number of scrolls or the length, in inches or feet, of parchment. 
 
Extracurricular activities include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] and a few clubs (dueling and gobstones are mentioned).  In addition, third year and older students may, with parental permission, visit the nearby all-Wizard village of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] on selected weekends throughout the school year. Leisure time is often spent in the common rooms socializing and playing magical games. In warm weather, students can be found on the grounds or near the Lake, where we often see them playing with the resident giant squid.

Magic from inexperienced wizards, injuries from Quidditch matches, and pranks around the school make Hogwarts a somewhat dangerous place.  Therefore, a hospital wing staffed by a matron/nurse/healer is located within the school.  Injuries that would kill or maim Muggle students are treated in-house, and full recovery is usually achieved in just a day or two.

Most students return home during the Christmas and Easter breaks, but there are some who stay at Hogwarts over the holidays.  Both Christmas and Hallowe'en are celebrated at Hogwarts with decorations and elaborate feasts.  Other holidays observed in the books include St. Valentine’s Day and Easter.

== Analysis ==

=== School population ===

As mentioned above, class size is typically thirty students, according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 12|information in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. This gives a total student population of about 840, with 210 (thirty per year, times seven years) or so in each House. Readers may be confused by the fact that at most five boys and five girls of each house in each year are named. At least one fan site has published information apparently received from the author that she had only developed characters for ten students in each year, and had decided that was enough, but that the number of students was intended to be about thirty per house per year. She has also variously given the student population as 600 or 1,000.

Against this, we have the information in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] that &quot;twenty broomsticks were laid out in neat lines&quot; for the combined Gryffindor and Slytherin first-years flying lessons. Carrying through the calculations, we would determine the total school population to be 280 at most, 70 in each House.

It is not the place of this book to try and resolve this apparent contradiction. We do note that all descriptions that imply entire houses or the entire school, rather than naming individual students, do seem to fit a population of about 800 students better than they fit a population of 280. We will suggest that we hear more from, and see more of, the students in Harry's dormitory simply because Harry, sharing a dormitory with them, is much more familiar with them. While this is not suggested in the books, it is possible that there are two other dormitories for students in Harry's year, each having five other unnamed students, in both the girls' side and the boys' side of Gryffindor tower.

As a small point of interest, this allows us to calculate the Wizarding population of the United Kingdom, assuming that Hogwarts draws its students from the UK. If the class size is 30, as stated above, Hogwarts, which is believed to be the only Wizarding school in the UK, has space for 120 students per year. Assuming a slightly longer-than-Muggle life span of 85 years for wizards, simple multiplication gives us a population approximation of 10,200 wizards in all of the UK, or roughly 1 wizard for every 6000 Muggles (UK population 58,000,000 in 1997). Extending this admittedly tenuous reasoning, we can extrapolate a world population of 1 million wizards (based on a 2000 world population of 6 billion individuals). Note that this does conflict with the author's statement, given in an interview, that there are about 3,000 wizards in the UK; but the author has further said that her mathematics is a definite weak point. If we accept the author's estimate of 3,000 wizards in the UK, the Hogwarts class size (per house) drops to 10, and the total world Wizarding population drops to 300,000, or one for about every 20,000 Muggles.

We further note that in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], the author mentions that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] expects an attendance of about 100,000 wizards. This tends to suggest that the higher figure for wizard population, approximately 1,000,000 wizards, is more likely; we find it unrealistic to expect that a solid third of the Wizarding population would be able to take the necessary time off, typically two weeks or longer, to attend even as popular an event as this, but one tenth of the population is a much more reasonable figure.

Other fan sites have noted that there are not enough teachers for the stated school population. Working from the description of the Potions courses, we see that this is generally a double course, two periods and two Houses each class. In the NEWT-level classes, all four Houses are taught together. Thus, the Potions instructor must be teaching two sections in each of five years, plus one section in each of two NEWT-level years, for a total of twelve sections. As these are double classes, we can assume that most other teachers will be teaching twice as many sections, typically about twenty-four. Even those courses that are not core subjects, such as Care of Magical Creatures and Divination, and are not offered for the students' first two years, will involve, typically, sixteen sections. Yet, as we learn at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', the most courses that can be taken without the aid of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-Turner]] is ten; if it is impossible for a student to take more than ten courses, then equally it is impossible for a teacher to teach more than ten sections. Thus, there must be a large number of teachers who we never meet. To add to this we have the apparent impossibility of Dolores Umbridge not only teaching her own classes, but also being present to inspect all of Hagrid's and all of Sybill Trelawney's classes, thus effectively tripling her workload. Again, it is not the place of this book to resolve this contradiction. We will point out that adding the apparently-necessary additional teachers would have the effect of significantly diluting the story line.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Hogwarts is Unplottable.  How, then, can the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauders' Map]] exist?
# How does Hogwarts meet its expenses? There is never any mention of school fees, and Harry certainly is never called upon to pay any.
# How do Muggle-born students manage to cover expenses, if they are not supported by school bursary, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] was? Is there any exchange where Muggle money could be interchanged with Wizard world money?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;Osteoid osteoma&lt;/b&gt; is a benign osteoblastic (bone forming) tumor.  It consists of a highly vascularized osteoid core.  The growing core induces a peripheral zone of sclerosis and periosteal reaction.

==Clinical Presentation==

The hallmark is pain which is classically increased at night and often relieved by low doses of salicylates. 

Typically occurs in patients age 5-25 years old.  Can also occur in the very young and very old.

Male to female ratio is 3:1.  

==Imaging Findings==

Classic plain film/CT description:  Centrally located oval or round nidus, &lt; 2 cm in diameter, with a uniform peripheral zone of sclerosis.  

Unfortunately, appearance can be highly variable because the nidus can be located in the cortex, intrameduallary space, or periosteum of a bone.  Description above is classic for an intracortical lesion.  Diagnosis can also be more difficult when there is intraarticular extension or occurs in the spine.             

===Additional pearls===   

*Radiolucent nidus, &lt; 2 cm in diameter.  
*Nidus may contain calcified bone matrix. 
*Nidus surrounded by sclerosis.  (Sclerosis sometimes is so extensive that the nidus can't be detected on plain films.) 
*Nidus located in the metaphysis or diaphysis of long bones.  (Ephysis is very uncommon.)    
*Periosteal reaction. 
*Monostotic or polyostotic.  One or multiple niduses.  Niduses may be clustered. 
*Lesion is located on the concave side of bone in patients with painful scoliosis.  
*Synovitis commonly occurs, especially if there are periarticular or intracapsular lesions. 
*Limb overgrowth in children.

===Distribution===

*Intracortical--80% 
*Tibia/femur--55% 
*Hands/feet--20%

==Differential Diagnosis==

The classically described intracortical lesion is almost an Aunt Minnie.  

However, since these lesions may occur in the intramedullary space or periosteum as well, the appearance can be highly variable.  Sometimes all that can be seen on plain film is extensive sclerosis.   

Consider differential diagnoses for bone forming tumors, sclerotic lesions, bone lesions with radiolucent centers, and periosteal reaction.  Consider including infection in the differential.  Remember that these usually occur in 5-25 year old patients.  Ask if the patient has pain.  Narrow the list based on specific clinical information and imaging findings.

Often the differential diagnosis includes: 

*Stress Fracture ( Linear, radiolucent center with callus formation.) 
*Abscess 
*Osteoblastoma (This is the main differential when suspect a benign bone forming tumor.)

&lt;i&gt;Osteoblastomas:&lt;/i&gt; Rare, can be expansile, either lytic or &gt; 2 cm in diameter-- in which case called a giant osteoid osteoma, have variable sclerosis, and frequently located in the posterior elements of spine.

&lt;i&gt;Osteoid osteoma:&lt;/i&gt; common, not expanisle, &lt; 2cm in diameter, always has peripheral sclerosis, and frequently located in femur/tibia. 

*Osteosarcoma 
*Hemangioma 
*Osteoma

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Adamantinoma of Long Bone (extragnathic adamantinoma):&lt;/b&gt; Adamantinoma is a rare primary low-grade malignant tumor of bone that is locally aggressive. Adamantinoma of the long bone is not related to adamantinoma or ameloblastoma of the mandible and maxilla, which is derived from Rathke's pouch.

==Demographics==
*Age: 10 - 50 (50% are age 10 to 30) 
*Sex: Males greater than or equal to females 
*Site: ~80% involve tibial diaphysis (some with anterior cortical involvement). Other bones that may be involved are the humerus, ulna, femur, fibula and radius.  Rare in other tubular bones.

==Clinical Presentation==
Approximately 60% of patients with adamantinoma have a history of trauma, including fractures, to the affected bone, but it is unclear whether trauma is involved with formation of the tumor or the formation of the tumor leaves the bone weak and susceptible to injury.

Common symptoms (duration from a few weeks to years):
*Localized, insidious aching pain
*Gradual swelling and deformity of the affected limb
*Limping
*Increased pain with activity or lifting
*Advanced or recurrent lesions may be associated with a soft-tissue mass (15%)

==Imaging Findings== 

Conventional Radiographs: (Here is an example from [http://brighamrad.harvard.edu/Cases/bwh/images/265/cesarxr.gif BrighamRad])

*Eccentrically-located 
*Well-circumscribed 
*Slightly expansile 
*Multilocular 
*Osteolytic with intervening reactive sclerosis (&quot;soap-bubble&quot;) 
*Cortical thinning 
*Little or no periosteal reaction (Unless the lesions extends through cortex to the soft tissue) 
*Late stages result in bone deformation (e.g., bowing of the tibia)

*Computed Tomography:
**Low attenuation expansile mass with sclerotic margins
**Superficial erosion and soft tissue involvement

*Magnetic Resonance Imaging:
**MRI findings in adamantinoma are non-specific, but can help demonstrate intraosseous and extrasseous involvement.
**T1-weighted 
***Low signal intensity 
***Peripheral enhancement of the lesion when post-gadolinium (Here is an example from BrighamRad)
**T2-weighted 
***High signal intensity that does not diminish with fat suppression technique 
***Decreased signal in the periphery of the lesion, consistent with sclerosis
**STIR  (Here is an example from BrighamRad) 
***Increased signal in the region corresponding to the lytic lesion on plain films 
***Decreased signal in the periphery of the lesion, consistent with sclerotic changes

*Bone Scan (Tc-99m MDP): 
**The pattern of increased isotope uptake on flow, pool, and delayed images corresponds closely to the radiographic extent of the lesion

==Pathology==
*Gross Pathology
**Firm, rubbery, grayish-white to yellow with smooth to lobulated external contours 
**Involvement of the cortex and periosteum is common 
**Cystic degeneration is common 
**Foci of hemorrhage are common 
**Eccentrically located and sparing the medullary cavity

*Microscopic histology:
**There are two distinctly different components:
**Epithelial origin composed of squamous cells and epithelial pearls 
**Mesenchymal origin composed of immature mesenchymal cells and spicules of dysplastic bone

==Differential Diagnosis==

*Giant cell tumor 
*Fibrous dysplasia 
*Simple bone cyst 
*Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) 
*Eosinophilic granuloma 
*Osteomyelitis 
*Osteofibrous dysplasia (ossifying fibroma) 
*Chondromyxoid fibroma 
*Chondrosarcoma

The radiographic features of adamantinoma and osteofibrous dysplasia of the tibia are generally identical.

Adamantinoma, fibrous dysplasia and osteofibrous dysplasia (ossifying fibroma) share many radiographic and pathological features, but their interrelationships are unclear.  Sarisozen et al. state that there is an entity known as osteofibrous dyplasia-like adamantinoma (differentiated adamantinoma) that may be a precursor to classic adamantinoma.

==Natural History==
Adamantinoma usually presents as an intraosseous, intracortical stage I-A sarcoma.

This low-grade, slowly-growing malignancy metastasizes in about 20 percent of cases by both hematogenous and lymphatic routes to other parts of the body, usually to the lungs or nearby lymph nodes. Of these cases, about 15 percent of the patients die. 

Young females seem to be at the highest risk for early demise with the average age of death being 33 years compared to 48 years for men.

==Treatment== 

Treatment of adamantinoma is wide surgical excision - neither radiation therapy or chemotherapy is effective.  Local recurrence is common if the tumor is not completely removed.  [http://www.bioline.org.br/request?jp03015 Filippou et al.] report a case of recurrent adamantinoma with metastasis to the lungs that was successfully retreated with surgical resection of the recurrent tumor and metastases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;[[Wikipedia:Ewing%27s_sarcoma|Ewing's sarcoma]]&lt;/b&gt; is a malignant tumor that belongs to a broader family of tumors that includes PNET (primitive neuroectodermal tumors). In simple terms, these tumors are all pathologically characterized by the so-called &quot;small round blue cells.&quot; Ewing's sarcoma almost always occurs in bone, although other members of the PNET family can occur anywhere. Ewing's is pathologically differentiated from other members of the family on the basis of immunohistochemical staining.

Ewing's sarcoma was described by James Ewing in 1920. Similar tumors were reported earlier than this, but it was the work of Ewing which established that the disease was separate from lymphoma or neuroblastoma.

==Clinical Findings==

Usually presents in childhood/early adulthood with a peak between 10 and 20 years of age, although it can occur in younger children and older adults. Can occur anywhere, but most commonly in the pelvis and proximal long tubular bones. The [[Wikipedia:Metaphysis|metaphysis]] and [[Wikipedia:Diaphysis|diaphysis]] of the femur are the most common sites, followed by the tibia and the humerus. Thirty percent are overtly metastatic at presentation.

The most common clinical findings are pain and swelling.

==Imaging Findings==


&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Plain Radiographs:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The most common osseous presentation is a permeative lytic lesion with periosteal reaction. The classic description of lamellated or &quot;onion skin&quot; type periosteal reaction is often associated with this lesion.

[[Image:Ewing1.jpg]] [[Image:Ewing2.jpg]]

AP and lateral views of proximal tibia in child with Ewing's sarcoma. Note the permeative lesion with adjacent lamellated periosteal reaction.



&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CT:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19 year old male with Ewing's sarcoma of proximal femur, with pathologic fracture. On CT, note the large soft tissue mass anterior to the femoral neck. Evaluation of the extraosseous structures is an advantage of CT over plain films.

[[Image:Ewing3.jpg]][[Image:Ewing4.jpg]]



&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;MR:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 21 year old male with pain and swelling. Typical MRI findings here (in order T1, T2, and FSE T2 images) show low signal intensity in T1 images and high signal intensity in T2.

[[Image:Ewing7.jpg]] [[Image:Ewing8.jpg]]



&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Radionucleotide/PET:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Same patient as above, bone scintigraphy shows the typical increased uptake of radionuclide in the femur at the site of the lesion (there are rare reports of cold&quot; lesions). 

[[Image:Ewing9.jpg]]

==Imaging Work-up==

Plain films add valuable information in the initial evaluation or screening. The wide zone of transition (e.g. permeative) is the most useful plain film characteristic in differention of benign versus aggressive or malignant lytic lesions. Zone of transition is not useful in MRI.

MRI should be routinely used in the work-up of malignant tumors. MRI will show the full bony and soft tissue extent and relate the tumor to other nearby anatomic structures (e.g. vessels). Gadolinium contrast is not necessary as it does not give additional information over noncontrast studies.

CT can also be used to define the extraosseous extent of the tumor, especially in the skull, spine, ribs and pelvis. Both CT and MRI can be used to follow response to radiation and/or chemotherapy.

Bone scintigraphy can also be used to follow tumor response to therapy. 

==Differential Diagnosis==

Other entities that may have a similar radiologic presentation include [[Wikipedia:Osteomyelitis|osteomyelitis]], [[Wikipedia:Osteosarcoma|osteosarcoma]] (especially telangiectatic osteosarcoma) and eosinophilic granuloma. Soft tissue neoplasms such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma that erode into adjacent bone may also have a similar appearance.

==Treatment==

Because almost all patients with apparently localized disease at diagnosis have occult metastatic disease, multidrug chemotherapy as well as local disease control with surgery and/or radiation is indicated in the treatment of all patients (2). Treatment often consists of adjuvant chemotherapy generally followed by wide or radical excision, and may also include radiation. Complete excision at the time of biopsy may be performed if malignancy is confirmed at that time.

==Prognosis==

Staging generally separates localized versus metastatic disease. Most commonly, metastasis occur in the chest, bone and/or bone marrow. Less common sites include CNS and lymph nodes. 

Survival for localized disease is 65-70% when treated with chemotherapy. Survival for metastatic disease is 25-30% (3).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Brown tumors&lt;/b&gt; are more common in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, however, due to the increased prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, there are more brown tumors from secondary hyperparathyroidism than form primary hyperparathyroidism.  It is difficult to differentiate a Brown Tumor from a giant cell tumor or fibrous dysplasia; however, other signs of hyperparathyroidism should be present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous section, we described how we represent digital images in computers. With this understanding, we now know what the final result we are trying to create is. There are many interesting fields of computer graphics that generate digital images, but for the rest of the book, we are going to focus on what we'll call '''the rendering problem'''. That is, how do we take a digital representation of geometry, and create a drawing of it in a digital image? Later chapters of the book deal with the cases where we want to create a very photorealistic image or a very quick rendering for interactive applications. For now, we are concerned with understanding how we represent and manipulate the geometry that we will try to render.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Essjay. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Essjay~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">We immediately face a problem very similar to our problem when we were trying to understand how to represent color as numbers in digital form. Specifically, how do we represent a geometric object in digital form? 

Most of us are familiar with the [[w:Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate system]] we are taught in school. The Cartesian coordinate system lets us denote the position of objects in space relative to two axes in space. We then locate a point in space by its position along the two axes, where we consider the place where the axes cross to be the &quot;zero&quot; location. Because these axes are abstract ideas that extend infinitely in every direction, it is as if we have created a universal measuring stick for space (specifically a two dimensional plane in this case). It does not matter where we set the axes, or in which direction they point (as long as the axes are at right angles to each other), we can still measure the distances along each axis, and in so doing locate a given point in space.

Thus, if we are given a collection of points, our choice for how we place the Cartesian coordinate system axes is entirely unimportant, the relationships between the points will be maintained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Parathyroid hormone is the main hormone that maintains a balance of calcium and phosphate in our bodies.  When released, parathyroid hormone increases the release of calcium from the bone, reabsorption from the kidney, and secondarily stimulates absorption of calcium from the intestines.  It also stimulates secretion of phosphate in the kidney.  Hyperparathyroidism is the abnormal secretion of parathyroid hormone.

==Clinical Findings==

The classic medical school clinical findings are &quot;Stones, Bones, abdominal moans, and psychiatric overtones,&quot; referring to renal calculi, bone pain, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and CNS symptoms (confusion lethargy, weakness).  Depending on the etiology, the serum calcium may be elevated and phosphate may be decreased.

==Etiology==

*Excessive parathyroid hormone due to a parathyroid gland abnormality
*80% parathyroid adenoma
*12% parathyroid hyperplasia (rarely from Multiple endocrine neoplasia)
*1-3% parathyroid carcinoma

==Radiology==

===Osteopenia and bone demineralization===
Osteopenia and bone demineralization are present in all forms of hyperparathyroidism

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
&lt;b&gt;Paget's disease&lt;/b&gt; is a chronic progressive focal disease of bone, characterized by excessive resorption followed by excessive formation of bone, with abnormal bone remodeling.

This process results in mosaic pattern of lamellar bone, with extensive local vascularity and increased fibrous tissue in the bone marrow. 

Involvement is usually polyostotic and asymmetric, and prefers the pelvis, spine, skull, femur, and tibia.

Three phases: 

#&quot;hot&quot; or &quot;active&quot; phase (osteolytic dominant, with fibrous replacement of marrow and vascular hypertrophy); 
#&quot;mixed&quot; phase (disorganized lamellar bone deposition plus osteolysis; rapid bone turnover);
#&quot;cold&quot; phase (osteoblastic dominant; pagetoid woven bone replaced by islands of lamellar bone, but haversian systems and remodeling along lines of stress do not occur).

==Etiology==

Hard to accurately say who is affected because many affected individuals are asymptomatic, but autopsy studies have shown approximately 3% of adults over 40 have the disease.

Unusual under age 40.

Unknown etiology, probably viral.

==Clinical Findings==

Often asymptomatic, but can have a painful, warm extremity, bowing of long bones, high output CHF, enlarged hat size, sequelae from spinal cord/nerve compression, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urine hydroxyproline.

==Radiographic Features==

Plain films: Lysis typically begins at an epiphysis and slowly advances at rate of a few mm per year to involve entire bone. Classically described as a &quot;candle flame&quot; or &quot;blade of grass&quot; lesion, with lucent osteolytic advancing edge, and sharp transition between normal and involved bone.

Pagetoid (woven) bone forms behind advancing osteolysis, with coarsened trabeculae and overall decreased cortical density. Not uncommon to see insufficiency fractures and deformities because of lack of bone remodeling.

[[Image:Paget1.jpg]]


Spine: Classic lesion is the &quot;picture frame&quot; appearance of the vertebral body, with initial widening of the peripheral cortex. This progesses to a dense sclerotic body with continued endosteal progression, and eventually even the posterior elements are involved.

Skull: Commonly involves cranial vault. Well demarcated geographic appearance (&quot;osteoporosis circumscripta&quot;) in lytic phase (particularly frontal bones), followed by focal radiodensities with pagetoid bone formation, and finally a thickened radiodense &quot;cotton wool&quot; appearance in the quiescent phase. Basilar invagination can be seen due to insufficiency of the pagetoid bone; subsequent narrowing of neural foramina and foramen magnum can occur.

Pelvis: Thickening of the iliopubic and ilioischial lines early in the disease, with subsequent trabecular thickening and acetabular protrusio.


[[Image:Paget2.jpg]]

[[Image:Paget3.jpg]]


Long bones: Cortical thickening and bone enlargement. Bowing of tibia and femur


[[Image:Paget4.jpg]]

[[Image:Paget5.jpg]]


CT: Can demonstrate dense enhancement of very vascular lesions in the lytic phase. Cortical thickening and typical &quot;swiss cheese&quot; appearance of bone are also well demonstrated. 


[[Image:Paget6.jpg]]


*Bone scan: 
**Helpful in determining extent of disease.
**Extremely hot in lytic phese; can be cold if inactive (uncommon).
**Increased radiotracer uptake usually abuts on joint and extends distally.

[[Image:Paget7.jpg]]

==Complications==

Fractures: Secondary to insufficiency, often incomplete.

Neoplasm: Sarcomatous degeneration is rare (&lt;1%), but more likely with extensive disease

[[Image:Paget8.jpg]]

==Differential Diagnosis==

Main consideration is metastatic disease, which much more commonly involves ribs than Paget's.

==Treatment==

Goal is to arrest the osteolytic process. 
#Calcitonin (inhibits bone resorption)
#Disphosphonates (inhibit demineralization)
#Mithromicin (cytotoxic antibiotic)

'''Notice''' the superlineation of line 4 IHS (Latinized Greek letters) is not a line as the first and primary hand in the main work, but something of an umlaut by the secondary hand (ca. 10th century) and accidently or on purpose the two dots represent the two missing letters &quot;su&quot; in the Latin word Iesus. The continuation of a form of the written abbreviated sacred name or nomina sacra from Hebrew or Aramaic traditions of the unpronounceable name of God (&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;DS&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;DEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; in Latin) was an early trademark of Christianity.

[[Category:Ada Programming/Maintenance| Contributors lounge]]

Welcome to the Contributors lounge &amp;mdash; here we discuss how to create an even better Wikibook.

== Ada Development Environment ==

I propose to add a section just after the section &quot;Building an Ada Program&quot; (see &quot;Program in Ada&quot; / &quot;Getting Started&quot;):

  '''Ada Development Environment'''

It should give advice about infrastructures, tools, methodologies...

{{unsigned|Didier Willame}}

:I think it's a good idea, feel free to add a new section. In the future, if the contents grow a lot maybe it should be moved to a new chapter (with more advanced topics, instead of introductory ones). Cheers &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 11:32, 30 June 2012 (UTC)

== Reorganization of categories ==

Hello, I've been ordering a bit the categories. For example, until now both [[:category:Ada Programming/Interfacing pragmas]] and [[:category:Ada Programming/Representation pragmas]] were direct subcategories of [[:category:Ada Programming]], but I've moved them to a new [[:category:Ada Programming/Pragmas]] to reduce the number of subcategories in the main one, and for easier navigation of that topic. The same for the [[:category:Ada Programming/Ada 2005 feature]] and [[:category:Ada Programming/Ada 2005 incompatibilities]] (now under the new [[:category:Ada Programming/Ada 2005]]), and so on.

In addition, I was thinking on separating the categories related to Ada characteristics with internal categories specific to the wikibook maintenance, like [[:category:Ada Programming/Maintenance]],  [[:category:Ada Programming/Print version]], or [[:category:Ada Programming/Templates]], to ease navigation through the categories and also to reduce misunderstandings. For example, C++ programmers would think that [[:category:Ada Programming/Templates]] is related to generic programming, but actually it just contains all the wikibook templates used in the book. That is, to clearly separate chapters of the training material from those pages just interesting to contributors.

My proposal is to rename those categories with the &quot;Wikibook:&quot; prefix, e.g. [[:category:Ada Programming/Wikibook:Maintenance]]. If no objections are made, I volunteer for the task, of course ;-) Cheers &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 11:26, 30 June 2012 (UTC)

:I agree with the proposal in general but not about the naming. I think that copying the syntax used by Mediawiki for namespaces is a bit confusing. I'd rather name them with subpages, that is [[:category:Ada Programming/Wikibook/Maintenance]],[[:category:Ada Programming/Wikibook/Templates]], etc. On the other hand, I see that other books are not so internally subcategorized, and moreover see this category and what it does mean: [[:Category:C++ Programming/Templates]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ManuelGR|contribs]]) 12:17, 30 June 2012 (UTC)

::Good point, maybe that pseudo-namespace prefix can be misleading. I have asked for more opinions at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General#Naming convention for contributors' pages]], maybe there's even an existing policy in place. In addition, I've broadened to topic for normal contributor's pages as well, not just categories. With respect to [[:Category:C++ Programming/Templates]], this category was created at August 2009 whereas [[:category:Ada Programming/Templates]] is from December 2008, so maybe they just copied our convention... ;-) &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 14:22, 30 June 2012 (UTC)

:::I like the proposals discussed, are certainly better than my original one and we also follow the usual conventions. So what about:
:::* No need to rename any category, just move the internal maintenance categories to new category [[:Category:Ada Programming/Wikibook]] (I prefer that name than [[:Category:Ada Programming/Contributing]], I think it's more generic):
:::** [[:category:Ada Programming/Templates]]
:::** [[:category:Ada Programming/Maintenance]]
:::** [[:category:Ada Programming/Print version]] (well, maybe this one should still hang from the main category, what do you think?)
:::* Move [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing]] to  [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Ada]] (shared for all Ada-related wikibooks)
:::* Move [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing/Discussion]] to  [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Ada]]
:::* Move [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge]] to  [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Ada/Contributors lounge]]
:::And this is also much easier and less work! If you agree, I can handle it in a moment. Thanks again for your help! &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 12:12, 1 July 2012 (UTC)

::::I agree completely with your proposal. Regarding [[:Category:C++ Programming/Templates]] date, I'm not surprised. In many ways we have inspired some developments in other books. We are leading the way! Take a look at [[Template:C++ Programming/kw]] (''started, an adaptation of Template:Ada/kw'') Not sure about [[:category:Ada Programming/Print version]], but in case of doubt leave it as it is. In fact it is book content.  [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ManuelGR|contribs]]) 19:37, 2 July 2012 (UTC)

::::Even simpler, you could move  [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge]] to [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Ada]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:57, 2 July 2012 (UTC)

:::::Done! So finally:
:::::* created new category [[:Category:Ada Programming/Wikibook]] to organize the internal templates and maintenance categories ([[:category:Ada Programming/Print version]] and [[:category:Ada Programming/Figures]] are classified both into the [[:Category:Ada Programming]] and [[:Category:Ada Programming/Wikibook]] because are relevant for readers and contributors).
:::::* [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing]] moved to [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Ada]]
:::::* [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge]] moved to [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Ada]]
:::::** [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge/Archive 1]] moved to [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Ada/Archive 1]]
:::::** [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge/Archive 2]] moved to [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Ada/Archive 2]]
:::::* [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing/Discussion]] moved to [[Wikibooks talk:WikiProject Ada/Archive 0]]
:::::The advantage of directly moving the contributors lounge to the wikiproject's talk page is that now the discussion pages are centralized into this very page and [[Talk:Ada Programming]]. Thanks again for your great ideas! Cheers &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 19:14, 3 July 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Lucius Malfoy''''' is the father of Draco Malfoy.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Lucius is briefly mentioned in passing by Draco at the beginning of the book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] observes Lucius and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and  Burkes|''Borgin and Burke's'']], where Lucius is apparently selling some Dark Magic items. Harry, who entered the store unseen through the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]], is hiding inside a large black cabinet, watching the transaction.

Back in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], Lucius Malfoy meets Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] at ''Flourish &amp; Blotts'', and makes some disparaging comments about the Weasley family's poverty; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], arriving on the scene, gets into a physical altercation with Lucius which is broken up by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]].

Late in the school year, Lucius exerts his influence as a school governor to have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] suspended as Headmaster. Lucius visits the school to personally deliver the suspension, and Harry is present when Lucius speaks to Dumbledore inside Hagrid's hut.

After Ginny is rescued from the Chamber of Secrets, Professor Dumbledore is reinstated, to Lucius' apparent anger; apparently several school governors had the impression that unless they voted to remove Dumbledore, Lucius would curse them. It is revealed that Lucius had intercepted Ginny at ''Flourish &amp; Blotts'' specifically to plant [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]'s old diary in her cauldron. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing his House-elf, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. 

Finally, it is mentioned that Lucius has been sacked as a school governor.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

After Draco Malfoy is injured in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] class by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], Draco spends considerable time in the Hospital Wing. On his return, he taunts Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], saying that his father can get Hagrid sacked.

As it turns out, he cannot; the hearing, just before Christmas, exonerates Hagrid. However, Lucius can get Buckbeak's part in the case referred to the Committee for the Disposal of Magical Creatures. Despite Hagrid's being coached by Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], Hagrid reports that Lucius came across as much smoother and was better able to state his case to the Committee. As a result, though Hagrid was spared punishment, the Committee had ordered Buckbeak executed.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Lucius attends the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|wife, Narcissa]] and their son Draco. Apparently, he has been invited to the Top Box by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] on the strength of a recent donation to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]]. Lucius and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] have a barbed conversation in the Top Box at the Quidditch World Cup.

In the riots after the Cup, there is a strong suggestion that Lucius may be one of the hooded wizards rampaging through the campsite and tormenting the Muggle owner.

When Draco Malfoy Curses Harry in the Entrance Hall, he is seen and punished by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]. Later, taking Draco to see his Head of House, Moody comments that Draco's father is &quot;an old friend&quot;. Moody being an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], and his intonation being threatening, one can see that Moody believes Lucius to have been a Death Eater.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] is resurrected, he summons his remaining [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. One of the Death Eaters speaks with Lucius' voice; it is he who asks how Voldemort had managed to return.

When Harry returns from the graveyard, and describes what happened there, he names Lucius Malfoy as one of the Death Eaters there present. Cornelius Fudge refuses to believe this, saying that Malfoy was an old, established Wizarding family, and had always donated to all the right charities.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

As Harry is leaving the courtroom with Arthur, after his hearing, he sees Cornelius Fudge and Lucius Malfoy in the Atrium. As usual, Arthur and Lucius exchange heated words, ended by Lucius excusing himself to Fudge's office; evidently Lucius is there to make another donation to some worthy cause.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] accompanies Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the train station to see them off to Hogwarts, his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] dog form is recognized by Lucius Malfoy, who apparently passes this information on to Draco. This suspicion is strengthened by a story Hermione finds in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] a week later, suggesting that Sirius had been spotted in London.

Harry later has one of his disturbing dreams, in which he seems to be looking through Voldemort's eyes. In this one, he is speaking to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augustus Rookwood|one Rookwood]], who Harry later recognizes as a recent escapee from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]]. Rookwood tells him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery's]] plan could never have worked, which is why [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Bode]] had fought so hard when Lucius had put him under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. Discussing this dream the next day, Harry remembers that Lucius had been hanging around near the entrance to the Department of Mysteries, where Bode worked, on the day of his hearing. Hermione remembers that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sturgis Podmore|Sturgis Podmore]] had been arrested on the day that they had all left [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] for school, and speculates that Lucius may have placed him under the Imperius curse to try and get Podmore to steal whatever it was that Voldemort was after.

Lucius is one of the Death Eaters, and apparently the leader, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry]]. Lucius is the spokesman of the group of twelve Death Eaters that surround Harry and try to convince him to hand over the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]], and is the one who reins in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] when she threatens Harry directly. Once Harry and his friends escape from the Death Eaters, Lucius instructs them to split into pairs to search the Department, pairing himself with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mulciber|Mulciber]]; however, we do not see either of them during the chase. The Death Eaters, including Lucius, corner Harry in the room of the Veil, but just before Harry surrenders the Prophecy, members of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] arrive, and Lucius is possibly stunned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]]. He later recovers and has a brief duel with Harry before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] intervenes and begins dueling him. Judging by the fact that we do not see him again, and Remus appears a few seconds later, we believe that Lucius lost the duel. Following the battle he is arrested and taken to Azkaban.

Draco blames Harry for Lucius' arrest, and is prepared to curse Harry in retaliation, but is interrupted by the arrival of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Lucius has been convicted of being a Death Eater following the Battle at the Ministry in the previous year, and sentenced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]]. As such, we don't actually see him in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When we first see Lucius in this volume, he is at a council of Death Eaters, which has been convened in Voldemort's new headquarters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. He, with his wife [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] and son Draco, are seated far down the table, distant from Voldemort, as a sign of their decreased status within the organization. Much to her dismay, Bellatrix is seated near them. It would appear that the Malfoy family is in disgrace: Lucius had first lost the Diary [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], and then bungled the battle at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] and been sent to Azkaban, and now was essentially under house arrest in his own home. Draco had performed half of his mission but then funked the second half, the previous year. And Narcissa had broken the rule about talking with other Death Eaters about missions, not only with Draco, but with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]. Voldemort, having determined that he likely would be unable to defeat Harry using his own wand, demands that Lucius give him his wand, as he won't be needing one. He taunts Lucius' apparent brief hope that it would be a trade. To test the power of Lucius' wand, Voldemort uses it to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charity Burbage|Charity Burbage]].

When Voldemort determines which of the six Harry Potters escaping from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] is the true Harry, he attempts to use Lucius' wand to kill Harry. The attempt fails, however, with Harry's wand, apparently all on its own, sending out a burst of golden fire that causes Lucius' wand to shatter.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] are brought to Malfoy Manor, their captors call on the Malfoys to identify them before summoning the Dark Lord. Summoned by Lucius, Narcissa is unable to identify Harry, and orders Draco to look; Draco is also uncertain. Bellatrix by and large takes charge of proceedings at this point and Lucius retreats into the background.

At the battle of Hogwarts, Hermione calls on Harry to find out where Voldemort is. Harry senses that he is in the Shrieking Shack; a hang-dog Lucius is with him. Lucius is asking after Draco, his son. Voldemort replies that he should have left the school and joined him with the other Slytherins. Lucius asks him to stop the battle, so that he can be sure to kill Potter himself. Voldemort says that this is simply an attempt by Lucius to save his son, and sends Lucius to find Snape.

In Snape's memories, Harry sees that when Snape was Sorted into Slytherin house, he was greeted by then-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]] Lucius Malfoy.

When Harry returns to the forest to face Voldemort and his destiny, Lucius is present, though far away from the center of the gathering. 

His last appearance is in the Great Hall, after the battle. He is with Narcissa and Draco, standing somewhat apart from the celebrations around them.

== Strengths ==
While Lucius is considered to be on the &quot;other&quot; side from Harry Potter, he does have some admirable strengths. Lucius is known to be very intelligent; he was a prefect back in his Hogwarts days, and is a rich, successful businessman in his adult life. He has a smooth, charming manner that enables him to read people and he usually gets what he wants from them. He is calculating, intuitive, and strong. 

Though we never directly see Lucius participate in any actual dueling, we can deduce from his past that he has strong leadership skills; he was one of Voldemort's most trusted Death Eaters before Harry Potter was born, and Lucius was selected to lead the raid against Harry Potter in the Hall of Prophecies in the fifth book, ''Order of the Phoenix''. Though this battle marks the beginning of Lucius's fall from Voldemort's grace, Lucius's charisma is undeniable. 

Perhaps Lucius's greatest strength is his ability to love. J.K Rowling was quoted as saying &quot;anyone who is still capable of love is redeemable.&quot; Unlike the other Death Eaters, Lucius puts his family first and cares far more about his wife and son than serving Lord Voldemort. While his sister-in-law Bellatrix Lestrange admitted she would be perfectly willing to sacrifice any of her children to the service of the Dark Lord, Lucius has no interest in sacrificing his son Draco. When Lucius is freed from prison by Voldemort, he is visibly panicked and miserable when he learns of Draco's mission to kill Dumbledore (under pain of death if he fails). During the final battle at Hogwarts, all Lucius wants to do is find his son and keep him safe; he begs Voldemort to let him find Draco, is refused, but does so anyway as soon as he gets the chance. Lucius does not even attempt to fight against the Order in this battle; all he cares about his finding his wife and son and protecting them. Hence, Lucius has another strength: he can prioritize what matters most to him, and what matters most is his family. 

Lucius has a fairly good relationship with his son Draco; Draco obviously respects and loves his father, as he gets violently angry when Harry calls Lucius a &quot;loser&quot; in the sixth book after Lucius is sent to Azkaban. The same can be said for Lucius's wife Narcissa; she becomes furious when Bellatrix insults Lucius in the beginning of the sixth book. Thus, Lucius has a good enough relationship with his wife and son that they love him and will defend him fiercely.

Lucius is a complex character; we see a steady change in him throughout the series, and in the end, his love is his greatest strength, and it is what keeps him alive.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Lucius Malfoy is married to Narcissa Malfoy.  They have one son, Draco Malfoy. We are never sure of the exact feelings between father and son until the final book, where we learn that Lucius fears that Draco has come to harm in Hogwarts. Prior to that, the only interaction between them we had witnessed was in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|Borgin and Burkes]], where Lucius seemed to be bullying Draco.

Lucius' wealth and status secures him influence over high level [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] officials including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]]. However, he does not appear to have any true friends.

Lucius is particularly hostile to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], insulting him about his low level in the Ministry, poverty and fondness of Muggles.

We see Lucius patting Severus Snape's shoulder when Snape is Sorted into Slytherin House. There are implications throughout the series of the two being friends or at least close acquaintances. Narcissa herself refers to Snape as &quot;Lucius's old friend&quot; and she herself seems very familiar with him implying that the Malfoys have some level of intimacy with him that goes beyond that of fellow Death Eaters. Severus has been described by Sirius as Malfoy's lapdog and Lucius seems to have informed Severus that he recognized Sirius in his dog form. Another telling example is the way Snape reacts to Harry implicating Lucius as one of the Death Eaters he saw after the rebirth of Lord Voldemort. Still it it unknown how close the two actually are as we do not see them together very often.

== Analysis ==

Lucius is one of the more interesting characters in the series, as we see enough of him to be aware of how he is changing as the series continues. In the beginning, he is smooth, assured of his own superiority over the rabble surrounding him. We know that a lot of this is buying influence; this is drawn particularly into focus when, after the return of Voldemort, Harry starts naming the Death Eaters who had come to his side, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] protests that Lucius can't be a Death Eater, as he makes hefty donations to all sorts of worthy causes. We see this start to crack when Voldemort returns; Lucius is put on the spot immediately, as Voldemort asks why he had run when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] had appeared in the sky at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and why he, unlike the Lestranges, had not tried to find out where Voldemort had gone. He is still able to put on a good façade, though: we see him talking with Fudge after Harry's hearing, and he is then apparently about to donate a lot of gold to some charity.

As his plans fall apart around him, he collapses inwards into himself as well; when we see him in the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', he seems little more than a shell of himself. He does not protest when Voldemort demands his wand, not even when Voldemort says he will have no further use for it. Wandless, he cannot fight at Hogwarts, though he is present; Voldemort keeps him around as a messenger, and apparently intends to humiliate him. At the end of the book, when we see him, he seems to be quietly thankful that he and his family were allowed to remain alive; there is no sign of his old confidence.

The interaction between Lucius Malfoy and the Weasleys should, perhaps, be mentioned as well. Lucius was certainly guilty of prejudice against Muggleborns, but the Weasleys were Purebloods also, so Lucius probably was more irritated at the Weasley affinity for things Muggle, perhaps most especially a friendship with Hermione, rather than any racial prejudice against them as a family. As Arthur's job had to do with Muggle life, Lucius would have seen the Weasleys as blood traitors, especially as Arthur was able to get some laws enacted protecting Muggles from the worst Wizards. It is certainly true that Lucius used Arthur's relative poverty against him, something which adds to our perception of him as a bully.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Lucius Malfoy, when we first formally meet him in Flourish and Blotts in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', makes very cutting comments to Ginny Weasley, and later to Arthur Weasley. Were Lucius' comments to Ginny simple prejudice, or were they intended to increase the likelihood of Ginny's running afoul of the diary and its contents? If the latter, exactly how much did Lucius understand of the diary's nature when he concealed it in Ginny's other purchases?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

While examining Lucius can be rewarding, he does remain largely in the background of the series, except in the second book where he deliberately plants the diary in Ginny Weasley's book bag. We are never entirely sure whether Lucius knew that the diary was one of Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Apparently, according to what we learn later, Lucius had been told that the diary was a source of disruption, intended to be left somewhere like Hogwarts. Voldemort had, however, neither informed him of its exact nature, nor given Lucius instruction to part with it. While some Death Eaters knew of Voldemort's Horcruxes, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]] apparently did, we are led to believe that Lucius did not know that the diary was one. As such, when Voldemort learns of the destruction of the diary, he is enraged. Lucius' fall from grace in Voldemort's eyes can likely be traced from the time Voldemort learned of the destruction of the diary, which seems to mark the first of a series of failures: his attempt to use the Imperius curse to retrieve the Prophecy, first on Sturgis Podmore and later on Broderick Bode, fails, as does the mission he leads into the Ministry to get it via Harry, which results in Lucius himself being locked up.

== Overview ==

'''''Severus Snape''''' is the Potions teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is also the Head of Slytherin House, and briefly served as Headmaster in book 7. Although Snape is a former Death Eater, Professor Dumbledore places his utmost faith in Snape's loyalty, though exactly why he trusts him so implicitly is initially unknown. Snape joins the Order of the Phoenix to combat Lord Voldemort, apparently acting as a double agent, though, later, Snape also serves Lord Voldemort. Snape's true loyalties remain uncertain until the final book.

According to the author, Severus Snape's birthday is 9 January 1960 and he died on 2 May 1998 at 38. It is unknown what wood and core comprises Snape's wand.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s first interaction with Professor Snape is minor, but telling; as Snape glares at him across the Great Hall, Harry's forehead scar starts throbbing. The scar is a link between Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], the evil wizard who inflicted it, and this may be a connection between Snape and Voldemort. That night, Harry dreams about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell's]] turban, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] turning into Snape.

During Potions class, Snape humiliates Harry by asking questions he could not know the answers to, though implying that he should. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] melts his cauldron during class, Snape blames Harry, and penalises Gryffindor house a point.

During the Hallowe'en feast, a giant troll enters the dungeons, though rather than follow the other teachers there, Snape instead rushes upstairs, possibly to the corridor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] declared off-limits. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Harry later notice Snape limping, and Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] tending Snape's wound and overhears Snape mention something with three heads. The Trio speculate Snape was wounded by the giant three-headed dog that is guarding a trap door in the forbidden corridor. 

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] match against Slytherin, Snape appears to be jinxing Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] until Hermione distracts Snape by setting his robes on fire. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] later defends Snape, and surprisingly admits to the Trio that the three-headed dog is his pet and is actually quite tame.

Snape fills in as the Quidditch referee for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]]; Harry, believing Snape is using this as a cover for another attempt on his life, catches the Snitch almost immediately, ending the game.

After Harry overhears Snape arguing with Professor Quirrell about his loyalties, Harry, Hermione, and Ron conclude that Snape is after the Philosopher's Stone for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], and only Quirrell stands between it and the Dark Lord. Hagrid's claiming that Snape is helping protect the Stone only causes the Trio more concern. Harry believes that once Voldemort is resurrected, he will kill Harry. The Trio venture through the trap door under Fluffy, to retrieve the Stone before Snape can.

In the climactic scene between Professor Quirrell and Harry, Quirrell reveals that he (Quirrell) seeks the Stone for Voldemort; Snape was actually thwarting Quirrell's efforts to jinx Harry's broom during the Quidditch game. Harry's scar hurt during Arrival Feast because Quirrell and Voldemort share a link, rather than it being connected to Snape.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

After Harry and Ron crash the flying car into the Whomping Willow, Snape arrives on the scene and takes them to his office. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Evening Prophet'']] reports that Muggles sighted a flying car. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] arrive, Snape wants Harry and Ron expelled. After sternly warning them, Dumbledore says it is up to McGonagall to determine the boys' punishment.

Snape allows the Slytherin team to unfairly usurp the Quidditch pitch during Gryffindor's practice time, &quot;in order that they may train their new Seeker,&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]. It seems that Mr. Malfoy has donated expensive new broomsticks to the Slytherin team. 

When Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, is found petrified, Snape questions why Harry, Ron, and Hermione were absent from the Hallowe'en Feast, and seems skeptical when they claim they instead attended [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Deathday party. Snape suspects Harry may be involved with Mrs. Norris being petrified, and recommends banning him from Quidditch. Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore overrule him, reminding Snape that Harry is innocent until proven guilty.

When Hermione needs to raid Snape's office for Polyjuice potion ingredients, Harry tosses a firecracker into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]'s cauldron during Potions class to create a diversion while Hermione retrieves the ingredients. Snape is unable to prove that Harry set off the firecracker, and he avoids punishment.

In the Dueling Club, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] uses Snape as his sparring partner, though Snape easily defeats him. When Lockhart has students practice in pairs, it is Snape who halts the ensuing mayhem when students try jinxing each other and ignore Lockhart's instructions. Later, when Lockhart suggests having a student pair on the stage, Snape selects Malfoy and Harry. When Malfoy casts a serpent, Lockhart's attempt to eliminate it merely tosses the snake harmlessly into the air. Upon landing, it seems poised to strike [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. As Harry tries calling off the snake, Snape quickly casts a spell to dispatch it, then stares oddly at Harry; Ron and Hermione quickly escort Harry away.

After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] is taken into the Chamber of Secrets, Snape is among the teachers echoing Lockhart's recent boasts about his knowing the Chamber's secrets back to him, apparently in an attempt to persuade Lockhart to confront the Monster. Lockhart, a fraud, instead returns to his office and starts packing, intending to leave Hogwarts quickly.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

At the Arrival Feast, Harry notes Snape's loathing glare at the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]].

Draco Malfoy, claiming his injury from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] still hurts him, returns to Potions halfway through the class. Snape orders Ron to assist Draco. Harry believes a Gryffindor student would be treated quite differently if they had been 30 minutes late.

Just before Lupin's class, Snape cautions him that Neville Longbottom causes havoc with every wand stroke; Lupin counters that he hopes Longbottom will lead off his demonstration. Lupin explains to the class that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]] he trapped in the wardrobe will appears as its opponent's greatest fear. For Neville, that fear is Snape. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]] charm forces the Boggart to assume whatever funny guise the caster is imagining, and Lupin instructs Neville to picture Snape wearing his grandmother's clothing. Neville successfully transforms the Boggart twice, though when Snape later hears about this, he mercilessly bullies Neville in Potions class.

Harry, lacking parental permission to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] on a student outing, is invited by Professor Lupin to his office. While there, Professor Snape brings in a steaming potion for Lupin, then leaves. Despite Harry's warning that Snape would likely do anything to obtain Lupin's job, Lupin drinks the potion. At dinner, Harry notes how Snape intently watches Lupin, but, apart from seeming rather fatigued, Lupin shows no ill-effect from the potion.

Following fugitive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] break-in into the castle, Professor Dumbledore orders all students to sleep in the Great Hall. Prefects stand guard while the teachers search the castle and grounds. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still awake when Snape gives the all clear to Professor Dumbledore. Snape reminds Dumbledore about his concerns over a recent appointment Dumbledore made, but Dumbledore avers that nobody at Hogwarts would have aided Black.

Harry, arriving ten minutes late for Defence Against the Dark Arts class, is dismayed to find Professor Snape substituting for an ill Lupin. After penalizing Harry for tardiness, Snape declares the class should be further along, and sets an essay on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolves]]. Upon his return, Professor Lupin cancels the assignment, much to Hermione's dismay, who apparently completed it.

Professor Snape is among the teachers staying at the school over the Christmas holiday. Throughout the Christmas dinner merriment, he remains sour looking. Dumbledore asks him if Professor Lupin has been receiving his potion.

There is another Hogsmeade weekend, only this time, Harry, using his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], intends to travel the secret passage to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Honeyduke's Sweetshop|Honeyduke's]]. But Snape catches Harry on his way to the tunnel's entrance and orders him back to Gryffindor tower. Harry notices Snape inspecting the hump-backed witch statue as if he had read Harry's mind that a passage starts there. Harry returns later and follows the underground path leading to Hogsmeade. He is spotted in Hogsmeade, and rushes back to the castle where Snape, apparently alerted, catches him. Snape confiscates the Marauder's Map and commands that it reveal itself. The map, writing as Messrs. Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs, only insults Snape. Snape shows the map to Lupin, who claims it is merely a Zonko's Joke Shop insult scroll. He collects Harry, the map, and also Ron, who arrived to support Harry's story, and takes them out of the now clearly livid Snape's office.

During Snape's Potions final exam, Harry is doing poorly. Snape scribbles what looks like like a zero on Harry's notepad before walking away.

Snape hides under Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] inside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]] as Lupin and Sirius tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione about their days at Hogwarts. Snape, their classmate, was tricked by Sirius and nearly killed by Lupin, who was confined in the Shrieking Shack during his werewolf transformations. Harry's father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]], saved Snape by preventing him from entering the Shack. Revealing himself, Snape says he saw Sirius' name on the Marauder's Map in Lupin's office. He ignores Remus' explanations about Sirius' innocence, instead binding both him and Lupin, intending to turn them over to the Dementors at the castle. Harry, Ron, and Hermione simultaneously [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Disarm]] Snape, rendering him unconscious.

Snape awakens after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] was revealed to be alive and had escaped. Snape collects the unconscious Sirius, Harry, and Hermione, who were disabled by Dementors, and also Ron, who Pettigrew jinxed, and takes them to the castle. With Sirius now captive, and the Trio in the Hospital Wing, Snape summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] to report that he captured Black. Harry awakens in the Hospital Wing and overhears Snape telling Fudge that Lupin helped Sirius break into Hogwarts and also claims that anything Harry and Hermione might say should be discounted because they were [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunded]]. Snape appears pleased when Fudge says Snape could receive an Order of Merlin. 

When Dumbledore arrives to speak with Harry and Hermione, Snape and Fudge head off to witness the Dementors administering the &quot;Kiss&quot; to Sirius, only to discover that Sirius escaped. Snape, raging mad, accuses Harry of being involved, despite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey's]] assertion that he and Hermione were always in the infirmary. As Snape angrily stalks off, Fudge comments that Snape seems unhinged.

The next day, still angry, Snape reveals to everyone at Hogwarts that Lupin is a werewolf, causing Lupin to resign his post as the Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. It was learned at the Shrieking Shack that Snape had been brewing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane potion]] for Lupin to retain his mind during his werewolf transformations. Snape is among the few who can successfully brew the complicated potion, a recent discovery.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

When Draco Malfoy attempts to Jinx Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] transforms Draco into a white ferret. Professor McGonagall sternly warns Moody that Hogwarts never uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] as punishment and should instead report Draco to his House Head, Professor Snape. Moody, a retired [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], departs with Draco in tow, claiming Snape is an, &quot;old friend.&quot;

Snape seems harsher than usual on his Potions students. Apart from his resentment at being passed over yet again for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, Snape appears to fear and despise Moody, and may be venting his resentment on his students.

It is mentioned that Snape has Harry's class researching antidotes, leaving Harry worried there will be a practical test – a student will be poisoned, and Harry worries he might be the test subject.

When Harry's name is ejected from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]], he proceeds as directed to the chamber where the other Champions are waiting. Snape and the other teachers and judges join them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] are adamant that Harry somehow crossed Professor Dumbledore's Age Line that restricted underage wizards. Snape snidely observes that Harry has been crossing lines ever since his arrival at Hogwarts.

Harry, fed up, confronts Draco Malfoy about his anti-Harry lapel buttons. Their clashing spells deflect onto [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] and Hermione. Snape sends Goyle, sprouting boils, to the Hospital Wing while professing that Hermione, whose front teeth have grown enormous, is fine, causing Hermione to run off crying. Harry and Ron protest Snape's unfair treatment, only to have him penalize Gryffindor House 50 points and assign Harry and Ron detention. That day's potion lecture concerns antidotes, and Snape announces they will test one. Harry is relieved when he is summoned away from class to attend the Wand Weighing ceremony, though this only intensifies Snape's resentment over Harry's increased publicity.

During Snape's antidote exam; Harry, panicked that he has yet to find a date for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], forgets a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|vital ingredient]], and fails the test.

At the Yule Ball, Harry and Ron eavesdrop on Snape and Karkaroff in the rose garden. Snape is blasting the bushes apart, penalising students hiding within as Karkaroff complains that something is becoming more visibly distinct; Snape responds that Karkaroff may run if he chooses. Ron wonders how Snape and Karkaroff got on a first-name basis.

Harry has heeded [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]'s advice and had taken his Golden Egg to the Prefect's Bathroom to help decipher a clue for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]]. While checking his Marauder's Map to make sure the hallways are clear, Harry notices [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]] in Snape's office. Curious, Harry decides to investigate, but his foot becomes trapped in the staircase's trick step. The dropped Egg starts wailing, summoning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]], Snape, and eventually Professor Moody to investigate the noise. Only Moody, with his magical eye, can detect Harry under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. Snape suspects someone was in his office, which interests Moody. When Moody notices the map and thinks Snape dropped, Harry gesticulates wildly to indicate it is his. Moody quickly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summons]] it. Snape, recognising the Map, suspects Harry must be close by under his Invisibility Cloak. Moody claims nobody is there and comments about how quickly Snape's mind jumped to Harry. After Snape and Filch depart, Moody rescues Harry from the step.

In Potions class, the Slytherins are huddled over something, sniggering. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] tosses a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|Witch Weekly]] to Hermione. Inside is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter's]] article, ''Harry Potter's Secret Heartache.'' The article suggests Hermione romantically threw over Harry for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] and might be using love potions. Professor Snape appears and penalises Gryffindor ten points, then ten more for having ''Witch Weekly'' in class. He reads Skeeter's article aloud, inciting laughter from the Slytherins. Snape then places Harry at the table immediately facing his desk. Snape softly mutters to Harry that he knows he is stealing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boomslang|Boomslang]] skin and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gillyweed|Gillyweed]] from his stores. Harry denies it, but remembers that Hermione once stole Boomslang skin to make Polyjuice potion, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] swiped the Gillyweed. Snape produces a vial containing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], implying he may use it on Harry.

Igor Karkaroff enters the classroom, claiming Snape has been avoiding him. Harry stays after class, crouching behind his cauldron so he can listen. Karkaroff shows Snape something on his left forearm saying, &quot;It has never been that clear, not since . . . .&quot; Snape says they can discuss it later. When Harry is spotted, Snape and Karkarov fall silent, and Snape orders him to leave. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], who has been hiding out in a cave outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], tells Harry, Hermione, and Ron it seems curious that Snape and Karkaroff were talking together. While Karkaroff was a Death Eater, Snape was never accused of being one, despite his skill in the Dark Arts. According to Sirius, Snape also hung around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Evan Rosier|Evan Rosier]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilkes|Wilkes]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery]] when they were students at Hogwarts.

When Bartemius Crouch, confused and rambling, is found near the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Harry runs to Professor Dumbledore's office for help, only to find Snape blocking his path. Dumbledore appears and Harry explains the situation. Soon after Dumbledore and Harry arrive back at the scene, Moody also appears, saying Snape told him they were there.

In Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], Harry views Dumbledore's memories of Death Eaters' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]] trials. Karkaroff attempts to lighten his own sentence by identifying other Death Eaters. He names Severus Snape, but Dumbledore claims that Snape was a double agent working against Voldemort. A bit later, while talking to Dumbledore, Harry's face appears in the Pensieve, smoothly changing into Snape's, who says, &quot;It's coming back, Karkaroff's too&quot;. Harry asks why Dumbledore trusts Snape, but Dumbledore replies that is between him and Snape.

Upon Harry's return from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]] graveyard, Moody steers him to his office, despite Dumbledore's having told Harry to stay put. Just as Moody reveals he is a Death Eater intending to kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape burst in, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|stunning]] Moody. Dumbledore commands Snape to bring truth serum and to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]] from the kitchens. Moody transforms into a man that Winky identifies as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]], Bartemius Crouch's son. Barty admits that he had raided Snape's potion supplies to make more Polyjuice Potion for his disguise as Mad Eye Moody.

Harry, sent to the Hospital Wing, awakens to hear Cornelius Fudge and Dumbledore arguing about Voldemort. Snape shows Fudge the Dark Mark on his left forearm, saying it is how Voldemort communicated with his Death Eaters. The mark has been growing darker recently, and it burning his arm a few hours ago proves Voldemort has returned. Fudge, disbelieving Snape, departs. Dumbledore requests that Sirius and Snape put aside their mutual dislike and work together for the Order. Snape is then sent on a mission that he and Dumbledore had previously discussed.

At the Leaving Feast, Snape is present, apparently having returned from his mission; Harry thinks he is more sour looking than usual.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Harry, arriving at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]], is disappointed to find Snape there. Snape leaves before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] can use their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]] to eavesdrop on the Order's meeting.

Immediately before Potions class, Draco Malfoy snidely comments that mentally deficient people should be confined to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]]. Neville, livid, attacks Draco, though Harry and Ron restrain him. Snape enters and promptly penalises Gryffindor 10 points for fighting. Ron wonders what prompted Neville's outburst, though Harry, knowing what happened to Neville's parents, says nothing as Dumbledore had requested. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], acting Hogwarts High Inquisitor, is monitoring Snape's class. She asks how long Snape has taught at Hogwarts (&quot;fourteen years&quot;), and about his applying as the Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape replies he has repeatedly been declined the post and to ask Dumbledore if she wants to know the reason. Straining to overhear, Harry ruins his potion and receives a zero.

While Harry is at Grimmauld Place for Christmas, Snape arrives and informs him he will be studying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]], the art of closing one's mind from another's intrusion. Harry agrees until he discovers that Snape, not Dumbledore, will be instructing him. Sirius wants Dumbledore to teach Harry, and a verbal battle between Sirius and Snape erupts and escalates into drawn wands. Harry stands in-between, trying to prevent a duel. Only Hermione's and the entire Weasley family's timely arrival interrupts them. Snape departs, telling Harry to be his office at 6 o'clock Monday evening. Later, Hermione says Harry will be happy to stop the nightmares. Ron comments that he would rather have the nightmares.

Harry, still distrustful, begins his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]], Snape explains, is the ability to read other's thoughts and memories. Voldemort is an expert in Legilimency, and Occlumency will help Harry block his mind. Snape removes some of his memories and deposits them into a Pensieve. Harry's first attempts to block Snape penetrating his mind fail miserably. However, Harry now recognises the hallway he has frequently dreamt about; it is the hall in the Ministry of Magic leading to the Department of Mysteries. it is the same hallway the snake attacked Mr. Weasley. Snape dismisses him, and while leaving, Harry sees Snape reinserting his memories back into his head.

Over the next few months, Harry's Occlumency lessons proceed poorly. He is unable to block Snape's probes, his scar pricklels almost continually, and he still experiences Voldemort's emotions. Ron thinks Snape may be making it easier for Voldemort, but Hermione reiterates that Dumbledore trusts Snape. Harry's hatred for Snape hinders him, though he is making some progress, and, on one brief occasion, enters Snape's mind. Harry again experiences his corridors dream, but upon reaching the door, Snape breaks his vision, seemingly concerned by what appeared in Harry's mind. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney's]] wailing in the hallway interrupts the session; Umbridge has just dismissed her.

When Snape is summoned by Umbridge during another Occlumency session, a shimmering light catches Harry's eye. Peering inside the Pensieve, he sees a young [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] and Sirius Black at Hogwarts. They are cruelly tormenting their classmate, Severus Snape, by suspending him upside down in mid-air, exposing his dingy underwear. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] intervenes and berates James and Sirius for their deplorable behaviour. The humiliated Snape resents Lily's help and insultingly calls her a &quot;Mudblood&quot;. Harry is appalled by his father's bullying behavior, but before considering it further, the present-day Snape yanks him from the Pensieve. Furious, Snape demands that he never reveal what he has seen to anyone, and orders him to leave, permanently ending their lessons. Later, Harry lies to Hermione, claiming Snape says he needs no more lessons. 

It is mentioned that Harry performs creditably in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|Potions O.W.L.]], perhaps because Snape is absent.

Harry envisions Sirius being tortued at the Ministry and unsuccessfully tries contacting him via the Floo network. Umbridge catches Harry and summons Snape, demanding he use truth serum on him. Snape claims she used all the Veritaserum while interrogating other students, even though only three drops is needed. When he says it will takes weeks to brew more, Umbridge places him on probation, then dismisses him. Harry, suddenly remembering that Snape is an Order of the Phoenix member, cryptically tries to warn Snape about Sirius, but Snape appears dismissive and leaves.

Following the battle at the Ministry in which Sirius was killed, Dumbledore tells Harry that Snape, a double agent for the Order, had contacted Sirius to confirm he was safe at Grimmauld Place. He then saw Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge going into the Forbidden Forest. When they failed to return, Snape alerted the Order. Dumbledore further explains that he had wanted Harry to learn Occlumency to block Voldemort from implanting visions into Harry's mind and luring him into a trap. Dumbledore believed that the old animosities between Snape and Harry, and also between Snape and Harry's father, James, could be forgotten, but admits he was wrong. Dumbledore did not tutor Harry himself because he feared Voldemort could see that their relationship was more than headmaster to student, opening them both to attack. Harry believes Snape deliberately waited too long to warn the Order about Sirus.

Harry nearly gets into a duel with Draco Malfoy, but Snape intercedes. Snape is about to penalise Gryffindor House points, but realises Gryffindor has no points left. Professor McGonagall suddenly arrives, and generously awards House points to the Gryffindor students who fought at the Ministry, then deducts the amount Snape was going to penalize Gryffindor.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] arrive in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Spinner's End|Spinner's End]]. Narcissa, worried about a task the Dark Lord has assigned her son, Draco, seeks Severus Snape's help, though Bellatrix distrusts him. At Snape's house, his home during the summer break, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew)]] serves drinks, then is dismissed while complaining bitterly about having to perform menial work. Snape fires a jinx at the bookcase where, listening from behind, Wormtail yelps and retreats. 

Despite Voldemort trusting Snape, Bellatrix does not, and she fires probing questions at him. He responds that, like many Death Eaters, he did not search for the Dark Lord because he believed he was finished. Snape remained at Hogwarts after Voldemort's fall to continue spying on Dumbledore, gathering sixteen years of intelligence on Dumbledore while Bellatrix languished uselessly in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison. Snape protected the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] because it appeared that Quirrell sought it for himself. Snape ignored Voldemort's summons after his return to avoid Dumbledore's suspicion. Snape taunts Bellatrix about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the Ministry fiasco]], and claims the Dark Lord had ordered him to stay away to protect his position at Hogwarts. Snape has not killed Harry Potter because he would lose Dumbledore's protection and be unable to spy for Voldemort. Dumbledore's trust in him is what has made him useful to the Dark Lord.

With Bellatrix's worries seemingly overridden, Narcissa explains that Voldemort assigned Draco a difficult and probably fatal assignment. She wants Snape to protect her son. Snape, however, already knows about Draco's task, and refuses to try and change Voldemort's mind. Snape agrees that Voldemort's real intent is revenge against Narcissa's husband [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] for his failure at the Ministry. Narcissa persuades Snape to swear an '[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] to protect Draco and complete his task should he fail. Bellatrix acts as their Bonder, though apparently half-expecting Snape to somehow invalidate the Vow.

Aboard the Hogwarts Express, Harry, suspecting Draco has become a Death Eater, eavesdrops on him. Draco spots Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|petrifies]] him, then stomps on his face before covering him with his Invisibility Cloak, leaving him on the train. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] finds Harry before the train departs for London. Harry, arriving late at the school, finds Snape waiting at the gate. Snape jeers at Tonks' new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] shape that she sent to the castle to alert the staff about Harry. Snape, refusing to allow Harry to change or clean up, takes him directly into the Great Hall, where the Arrival Feast is just ending. Harry is shocked when Snape is announced as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. It had appeared that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Horace Slughorn]], the new Potions teacher Dumbledore just recruited, was hired for that position.
 
Harry finds Snape's Dark Arts class both illuminating and alarming, with Snape almost seeming unnaturally entranced by the subject. Snape teaches the class how to cast wordless spells, though the students are having difficulty. To demonstrate, Snape squares off against Harry, who fearing any spell Snape might cast against him, uses a verbal [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|shield spell]], earning himself a detention. The detention conflicts with one of Slughorn's &quot;little soirées&quot;, and Slughorn prevails upon Snape to change Harry's detention time, though Snape refuses. Harry is uncertain which is worse, Slughorn's party or Snape's detention.

Harry discovers a non-verbal spell, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Levicorpus|Levicorpus]], in the Half-Blood Prince's Potions book which he is using in Slughorn's class. It appears to be the same spell that Harry, once watching Snape's memories in a Pensieve, had seen his father use to humiliate Snape when they were both Hogwarts students.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] is nearly killed after touching a cursed necklace, Professor McGonagall has it taken to Professor Snape for examination. Later, Professor Dumbledore tells Harry that Snape had done all he can to help Katie, explaining that Snape has more experience with Dark magic than Madam Pomfrey.

At Slughorn's Christmas party. Slughorn mentions to Snape that Harry seems a natural at Potions, like his mother, though Snape has a different opinion. Argus Filch suddenly appears, dragging Draco Malfoy, who was &quot;skulking&quot; about in the halls. Slughorn assumes Draco was gatecrashing the party, while Draco hardly seems pleased that Slughorn allows him to stay. Soon after, Snape and Draco, leave together. Following under his Invisibility Cloak, Harry eavesdrops on their conversation. Snape probes Draco's mind for details about Katie Bell, but Draco blocks him, apparently having been tutored in Occlumency by his aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange. Snape says he knows about Draco's mission and has taken an Unbreakable Vow to help him. Draco, angered at the thought that he could need help, storms off.

Harry, believing Snape and Draco are working for Voldemort, discusses his suspicions with Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to  Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], Remus Lupin, and Hermione. Everyone discounts Harry's opinion, saying they have absolute faith in Dumbledore and his trust for Snape; it is more likely that Snape wants to learn what Draco's mission is so he can inform Dumbledore. Despite Snape's costing him his job at Hogwarts by revealing his being a werewolf, Lupin claims Snape had always perfectly brewed his werewolf potion. Snape could have done far more damage if he had wanted. At their next lesson, Harry reports his suspicions to Dumbledore. Dumbledore thanks him, but, for confidential reasons, states he absolutely trusts Snape.

Snape is briefly mentioned during Slughorn's Potions class. Harry must create an antidote for several different poisons and finds nothing in the Half-Blood Prince's textbook about them except a notation, &quot;Just shove a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]] down their throat.&quot; Remembering Snape's comment in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 8|his first-ever Potions class]], Harry grabs a bezoar from the supply closet, and shows that to Slughorn as his finished potion.

Hagrid mentions overhearing an angry-sounding exchange between Snape and Professor Dumbledore. Snape expressed second thoughts about something he had promised Dumbledore he would do. Something was also said about Snape's investigations into Slytherin house, which Hagrid assumed was about the Cursed necklace. Filch's sudden arrival interrupted their conversation.

Harry believes Draco is using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] to perform his secret task. Just before class, Harry attempts to enter the Room, but is unable to make the door appear. Snape penalizes Gryffindor ten points when Harry arrives late. Seamus Finnigan asks Snape about the difference between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghosts]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]], as a story in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] mentioned Inferi; Professor Snape says the story actually was about one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who was arrested for impersonating an Inferius. Ron also gets taunted and given detention by Snape. After class, Ron's girlfriend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]], starts dissing Snape, irritating Ron rather than amusing him, and he and Harry duck into a bathroom to avoid her.

When Harry and Dumbledore view Slughorn's memory about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], Dumbledore explains that he injured his hand destroying Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Only his own reflexes and Snape's timely intervention contained the damage.

Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] shows that Draco is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle's]] bathroom, one floor below. Harry investigates but is spotted by Malfoy, who casts the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]; Harry counters using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|''Sectumsempra'']] spell from the Half-Blood Prince's book without knowing its effects. Draco is severely slashed, his blood spilling everywhere, causing Moaning Myrtle to fly off screaming; Professor Snape responds swiftly and saves Draco, rushing him to the Hospital Wing. Returning, Snape demands to know whence Harry learned the spell, and despite Harry's attempts at occlumency, Snape apparently gleans some information that Harry's potions book is the source. Snape demands to see his textbooks. Harry instead gets Ron's Potions textbook, then hides the Half-Blood Prince's book in the Room of Requirement before returning to Snape.

Snape, skeptical this is actually Harry's book, particularly since it is signed &quot;Roonil Wazlib&quot;, assigns Harry detention (with Professor McGonagall's concurrence) every Saturday until school ends. Reporting to Snape's office, Harry is assigned to copying old detention files, with Snape suggesting he start with ones detailing his father's misbehaviour. Fearing Snape might confiscate his Potions textbook, Harry hides it in the Room of Requirement. As a result, Harry's Potions work now suffers, though Slughorn attributes it to his new romantic interest in Ginny.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] Trelawney happens to mention to Harry that it was Snape who overheard the prophecy foretelling Voldemort's nemesis, and he carried this information to Voldemort. Harry angrily confronts Dumbledore, but Dumbledore avers that he trusts Snape. He seems about to explain why he does, but quickly changes the subject by saying he has located another Horcrux.

Harry and Dumbledore retrieve the Horcrux, but the Headmaster is left greatly weakened by the effort, and Harry assists him back to the castle. Landing atop the Astronomy tower, Dumbledore tells Harry to fetch Severus, but Draco unexpectedly appears and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]] Dumbledore. Dumbledore offers Draco protection if he switches sides, but four Death Eaters intervene. Snape also bursts onto the scene, and Dumbledore seems to be pleading with him. Snape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Dumbledore, then departs with the Death Eaters and Draco. Harry, who was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|petrified]] for his protection under his Invisibility Cloak by Dumbledore, is freed by Dumbledore's death. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stuns]] a Death Eater and chases Snape, firing spells at him.  Snape, easily blocking every curse, criticizes Harry's Occlumency skills that leave his mind open to opponents. Harry is stunned when Snape reveals he is the Half-Blood Prince who once owned Harry's Potions book. Snape prevents the other Death Eaters from attacking Harry, saying that the Dark Lord wants him for himself; he then escapes with Draco and the other Death Eaters.

Harry learns that during the battle Snape was allowed to enter the tower. When he returned, Order members never suspected Dumbledore had just been killed, believing Snape was only fetching Draco. Harry reveals that Dumbledore had trusted Snape because after Snape carried the prophecy to Voldemort, he later returned to Dumbledore, claiming remorse.

Hermione's research reveals that Snape's mother was a witch, named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Eileen Snape|Eileen Prince]], his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tobias Snape|Tobias Snape]], was a Muggle, hence Snape's self-imposed nickname, the Half-Blood Prince. Harry is upset that he had Snape's unwitting help, through his old Potions book, all year. He wonders also at the similarity between Snape's half-blood ancestry and Voldemort's, and wonders how Dumbledore could have missed it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Snape and a Death Eater named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] enter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Voldemort's new headquarters. At the council table, Snape is placed at Voldemort's right hand side. Yaxley, sitting in the middle, reports that Harry Potter will be moved to an Order safe house on Harry's 17th birthday, though Snape disputes this. His information, &quot;from the same place as before,&quot; indicates the move will occur earlier and by Order members, as the Order no longer trusts the Ministry. Snape does not flinch under Voldemort's intense gaze, though many other Death Eaters do. Voldemort decides that the attack on Harry will take place according to Snape's information.

During the escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], George Weasley, disguised as Harry, has his ear severed by Snape, using the Sectumsempra spell.

While hiding out in Grimmauld place, Harry, Ron, and Hermione read in the ''Daily Prophet'' that Snape had been appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts. Hermione realizes that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black's]] portrait is now a conduit to Snape, as his other portrait hangs in the Headmaster's office. To prevent Phineas from spying on them, she stuffs his picture into her small beaded bag carrying their traveling gear.

One night, while traveling the countryside, Harry, Ron, and Hermione happen to overhear a conversation about three Hogwarts students, including Ginny Weasley, having broken into the Headmaster's office and attempting to steal the Sword of Gryffindor. A Goblin in the group says that shortly after, the Sword was transferred to Gringotts Bank for safekeeping, though that Sword is actually a fake. The three students involved reportedly were &quot;cruelly punished,&quot; but when Harry and Hermione consult Phineas Nigellus' portrait, he reports the students were merely sent to Hagrid, who set them to work in the Forbidden Forest.

Harry, re-entering Hogwarts, heads to the Ravenclaw common room to see the sculpture of Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her lost Diadem. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]] spots him and touches her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] to alert Voldemort that Harry has been found. Professor McGonagall, helping Harry escape, runs into Snape in the hall. Snape is searching for Harry who is hidden under his Invisibility Cloak. Snape seems to be using Legilimency to locate him. McGonagall and Snape duel, but when the other House Heads arrive, Snape runs and leaps out a window. Harry believes he must have fallen to his death, but sees a large, bat-like shape flying over the castle wall — Snape has escaped.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron travel through the tunnel under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] to the Shack where Voldemort is. There, they witness a confrontation between Snape and Voldemort. Snape asks permission to enter Hogwarts and bring Harry out. Voldemort refuses, saying he is disappointed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand's]] performance. He believes the Wand answers not to him but to Snape, who killed Dumbledore, the Wand's previous owner. Saying he regrets the necessity, Voldemort orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] to kill Snape, then leaves.

Harry rushes to Snape's side as soon as Voldemort leaves. Snape offers Harry his memories, which Harry collects in Hermione's crystal vial, and, gazing into Harry's eyes, so much like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother's]], dies.

Harry enters the headmaster's office and pours Snape's memories into the Pensieve. Harry views snippets of Snape's life:

Snape sees Lily Evans, about ten-years-old, experimenting with magic. He tells her she is a witch, and that he is a wizard. Lily's sister, Petunia, is clearly frightened by her sister performing magic, while Lily seems affronted Snape called her a witch. Snape tells Lily things about the Wizarding world. Later still, we see Snape watching Lily and her family as they put Lily on board the Hogwarts Express for her first term at Hogwarts. Petunia is telling Lily that she's a freak, that Lily and that Snape boy are being sent to a school for freaks. Lily says that she had seen Dumbledore's reply to Petunia's letter, and that he had been very kind. When Petunia demands to know how she had seen that letter, it was private, Lily indicates that Snape had helped. Petunia flounces off to join her parents. We then see Severus on board the train, looking for Lily. He finds her in a compartment with James Potter and some other first-year students, including Sirius Black. Snape says he hopes Lily will be placed in Slytherin; James is adamant that he wants to go to Gryffindor. When James insults Snape, Lily leaves to find a different compartment, and Snape follows; James tries to trip Severus as he passes.

At the Sorting ceremony, Lily is placed in Gryffindor, along with Sirius Black, James Potter, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin. Snape is sorted into Slytherin, where he is greeted by Lucius Malfoy.

Snape and Lily are seen strolling across a courtyard, quarreling. Snape wonders what has happened to their friendship. Lily responds they are still friends, but she detests his friends, most notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mulciber|Mulciber]]. Snape reminds Lily about the trouble James and his friends get into, and is heartened when Lily dismisses James as an &quot;arrogant toe-rag.&quot;

Harry witnesses a scene he saw some years earlier, when James, along with Sirius, tormented Snape. Not wishing to revisit this scene, Harry keeps his distance. The memory ends with Snape calling Lily a Mudblood, and reforms in front of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|the Fat Lady]]. Lily says that she had heard that Snape would stay outside the entrance to the Gryffindor Common Room all night, unless she came out to speak with him. Despite his obvious remorse, and his heartfelt apologies, Lily will not forgive Snape the insult, and tells him that he should go to his Death Eater friends.

We now see Snape meeting in secret with Dumbledore. Snape says he does not carry a message from Voldemort, but is there to plead on his own behalf. He had carried Trelawney's prediction to Voldemort, and Voldemort, having decided that the prophecy referred to Harry Potter, was now planning to kill not only Harry, but also Lily and James. Snape pleads with Dumbledore to save Lily from Voldemort. Dumbledore is disgusted that Snape only wants Lily saved, not caring about her husband or child. Taken aback, Snape pleads for them as well, saying that in return for their safety he would do anything.

Next, Snape is in Dumbledore's office, plainly grief-stricken. Snape demands of Dumbledore why he had not kept Lily and her family safe. Dumbledore tells him that they had put their trust in the wrong man, just as Snape had in trusting Voldemort to spare Lily's life. Dumbledore reveals that Harry had survived, and that if Snape had truly loved Lily, he would help Dumbledore protect her son when Voldemort returns. Snape reluctantly agrees, but says that Dumbledore must never tell anyone that he is protecting James Potter's son.

Snape, apparently during Harry's first year at Hogwarts, is complaining fiercely to Dumbledore about Harry, and how he is a troublemaker like his father. Dumbledore responds mildly that no other teacher is complaining, and asks Snape to keep an eye on Quirrell.

As students leave the Yule Ball, Snape tells Dumbledore that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] on his arm is growing darker, as is Karkaroff's, and that Karkaroff plans on fleeing if the Mark burns him. Dumbledore asks if Snape has similar plans, and Snape angrily retorts he is no coward. Dumbledore remarks, almost off-handedly, that perhaps the students are Sorted into their Houses too early; Snape seems quite taken aback by this.

We now see Snape in Dumbledore's office again. Dumbledore is semiconscious, his blackened right hand dangling over the edge of his desk. Snape, pointing his wand at Dumbledore's wrist, is muttering incantations while pouring a golden liquid down Dumbledore's throat. When Dumbledore returns to himself, Snape asks why Dumbledore had even tried on the ring, and Dumbledore says he was a fool. We see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]]'s ring on the table, broken, beside the Sword of Gryffindor. Snape tells Dumbledore that the curse was extraordinarily powerful, and that while he has contained it for the moment, it will eventually kill Dumbledore; he says that Dumbledore has, at most, another year of life. Dumbledore says that this makes things much easier to decide, and starts discussing Voldemort's apparent plan to have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|the Malfoy boy]] kill him, Dumbledore. Snape says that the attempt is not expected to succeed, but instead to further punish and disgrace the Malfoy family. Dumbledore correctly guesses that Snape has been given the job of killing Dumbledore should Draco fail, as Voldemort expects that Hogwarts will be fully under his control and he will no longer need a spy there. Dumbledore asks that Snape agree to watch over his school, and be the one to kill him, both to spare Draco's soul and to grant Dumbledore some dignity in death, sparing him from the malicious pleasures of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and Bellatrix Lestrange. Snape reluctantly agrees.

In the scene that Hagrid had partially overheard the year before, we now see Snape and Dumbledore walking in the castle grounds. Challenged as to what he is doing with Harry, Dumbledore says he is giving Harry information he will need, while he still can. Snape asks why he is not privy to that information as well, to which Dumbledore says he does not like to keep all his secrets in one basket. Snape appears to be angered by this, saying that his job as double agent is extremely dangerous, and he is at least as trustworthy as Harry. When Dumbledore tries to explain the next steps of his plan, Snape threatens a change of heart about killing Dumbledore when the time comes. Dumbledore reminds him of his word, and suggests that he keep an eye on Draco. When Snape still seems rebellious, Dumbledore wearily makes an appointment for later that night in his office.

Dumbledore, later, explains that Harry must not know what he has to do until the final moment. That moment will be the time when Voldemort, instead of letting his snake, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], run free, he keeps her confined within a protective spell. At that time, Snape must tell Harry that Harry is an accidental seventh [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], inadvertently created at his mother's death, and that he must die in order that Voldemort would be vulnerable to death. Snape feels tricked, as he had worked so hard to protect Lily's son, only to have him destined to die at Voldemort's hand. Asked if Snape has grown to care for Harry after all, Snape casts his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]]. It is in the shape of a silver-white doe, indicating to Dumbledore that Snape is still in love with Lily, fifteen years after her death.

We learn that it was Dumbledore's portrait that ordered Snape to give Voldemort the correct time for Harry's departure from Privet Drive. Dumbledore suggests using seven Harry Potters headed for seven safe houses, and instructs Snape to plant that idea in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]'s mind to pass to the Order of the Phoenix. During the actual departure from Privet Drive, we see that Snape was attempting to jinx the Death Eater drawing a bead on Remus Lupin, and air currents had caused them both to miss, resulting in Snape's spell severing George Weasley's ear.

Snape is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] old room at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. He takes the second page of a letter Lily wrote, and the portion of a photograph containing her image, then leaves with them.

Finally, Snape is seen speaking with Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait. Phineas reports that Harry is in the Forest of Dean, and Snape retrieves the Sword of Gryffindor hidden behind Dumbledore's portrait, and departs with it.

Snape is not seen again, but in the epilogue, we learn that Harry has named his second son Albus Severus, after two Headmasters, and one of them was not only a Slytherin but possibly the bravest man Harry had ever known. In post-publication interviews, the author has revealed that Snape's portrait did not appear in the Headmaster's office at his death, as he had abandoned his post. Later, Harry successfully campaigned to have it placed there.

== Strengths ==

Snape is an exceptionally intelligent and magically potent wizard. As a student, he excelled in potions, revising many standard formulas that made brewing them easier and faster. It was said he knew more Spells, Hexes, and Jinxes in his first year at Hogwarts than most seventh-year students, and had invented many new ones. In addition to being a respected Potions expert, Snape is adept in defensive arts and highly skilled in Occlumency and Legilimency, skills that made him a valuable ally, but also a dangerous enemy. Dumbledore utilized these talents by having Snape infiltrate and spy on Death Eaters, knowing Voldemort would be unable to read Snape's mind; however, these same abilities also ideally allowed Snape to act as a double agent, as Dumbledore would also likely be unable to penetrate Snape's thoughts. Snape's persuasive abilities, including Occlumency and Legilimency, allowed him to maintain an ambiguous facade, leaving his true loyalty unknown until Book 7's conclusion. Throughout the series, however, Dumbledore steadfastly defended Snape's loyalty, both to him and the Order of the Phoenix, though he never explained the reason behind his trust. 

Though Snape maintained few close relationships in his lifetime, he was intensely loyal to his allies. Unlike Voldemort, Snape possessed the ability to love, though his early proclivity for the Dark Arts and his association with certain Slytherin students, future Death Eaters, destroyed his only chance at a lasting relationship. Despite being able to love, Snape was never one to wear his heart on his sleeve and rarely exhibited any emotion other than annoyed disdain. However, it was this trait, along with his Occlumency skills, that allowed him to uphold his tenuous double-agent role, simultaneously claiming both Voldemort's and Dumbledore's confidence. Ironically, the dual identity he carried so well throughout the series could easily have concealed that he was actually loyal to no one, his neutral cover so convincing that he was positioned to align himself with either winning side, with neither the wiser. Only after Harry views Snape's memories in the Pensieve are his true fidelity and motives revealed.

== Weaknesses ==

Snape possesses a dark, moody personality, and rarely takes the initiative to create friendships or establish personal alliances, apparently preferring solitude and mostly relying upon himself. At best he is cordial to his superiors and tolerates his peers. Only Albus Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall seem to be afforded any true esteem. Others describe Snape as unattractive, mainly with regard to his personal grooming, particularly his hair, which is described as oily. As an instructor, he favours his own Slytherin House students, capriciously punishing others, particularly Harry and many Gryffindors. This is usually for minor infractions or incidents initiated by Slytherin students, who usually escape punishment for their role in the proceedings. Snape is also unable to forget or forgive past hurts or grudges, and seems unable to look past any preconceived notions.

An only child, Snape experienced a traumatic childhood, suffering under an abusive Muggle father who resented and mistreated his witch mother. This left Snape emotionally battered, shy, insecure, and longing for someplace to belong. He usually found solace only in solitude and his magical studies at Hogwarts, where he was sorted into Slytherin House. Though Snape seemed suited to Slytherin, Dumbledore, noting Snape's character many years later, suggests that students are perhaps sorted too soon, indicating his belief that Snape could have fared better in another House.

Though Snape was a magically proficient student destined to become a powerful wizard, he was unable to defend himself against classmates James Potter's and Sirius Black's merciless bullying. As a result, Snape unfairly transferred his long-held resentment and hatred onto James' son, Harry, often arbitrarily punishing Harry or singling him out for ridicule in his class. Snape becomes particularly incensed after Harry, not knowing Snape's true motives, calls him a coward as Snape flees Hogwarts with the other Death Eaters in Book 6.

Although Lily Potter was Snape's only true friend during their youth, he was unable to forgo his attraction to the Dark Arts or give up his unsavory Slytherin comrades that she strongly disliked. Never having been accepted as a peer before, his new-found companions became too strong an allure for him to heed Lily's request to abandon them. Snape inexplicably turned against Lily when she attempted to defend him during one of James and Sirius' cruel pranks, forever ending any opportunity for a more meaningful and lasting relationship with her.

Without doubt, Snape risked his life by defecting from Voldemort's service to instead serve Dumbledore. However, his actions, at least initially, were driven by selfish motives, seeking Dumbledore's protection for someone the Dark Lord had marked for death. In return, Dumbledore demanded Snape's complete loyalty and employed him as his double agent, at great peril to Snape's life. Snape agreed to Dumbledore's terms, but his goal was always to protect Lily Potter, not fight the Dark Lord to save the Wizarding world. After Voldemort murdered Lily, Snape sought revenge, and secretly protected Harry and his mission to destroy the Dark Lord. It is unknown if Snape would have turned against Voldemort had the Dark Lord never targeted the Potters, but the reader suspects not.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

An apparent loner with no close friends, Snape mostly keeps his own company. Throughout the series, Snape seems uniformly bitter and pernicious. While he can work and cooperate with allies who either serve Voldemort or who oppose him, Snape seems unable to actually care about anyone. Every interaction Snape has with Harry, his other students, and even at times other Hogwarts staff members, sometimes seems acrimonious and occasionally infused with venom. The only exceptions are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]], who he trusts enough to bind the wound &quot;Fluffy&quot; inflicted on him in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who he always treats with marked preference and leniency, and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. His relationship with Professor McGonagall had always appeared cordial, though cold, until Snape became Headmaster. Snape's dealings with Voldemort's supporters, with the possible exceptions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] and Voldemort himself, mostly seem similarly toxic. While we could speculate that Snape's consideration for Narcissa Malfoy springs from a hidden liking for her son, Draco, that remains questionable. Knowing that the Malfoy family is rich, influential, and staunch Voldemort supporters, Snape could be cultivating their favor through their son, though this seemingly changes after Lucius earns the Dark Lord's wrath. However, as Snape was working as a double agent for Dumbledore, he may also have been fostering an avenue through the Malfoys to the Dark Lord. The tone of Snape's interactions with both Dumbledore and Voldemort, however, seems somewhat fueled by the power that he and they, separately, wield with one each other.

=== Harry Potter ===
Even though Snape's relationship with Harry is important to the overall story, it is never his most significant. It is, however, the first that we are able to observe in depth. From Harry's arrival at Hogwarts, Snape's reaction to him seems illogically hostile. It first appears that Snape mainly resents Harry for his celebrity, but it is gradually learned that his negative feelings run much deeper and actually predate Harry's birth, extending as far back to when Snape attended Hogwarts with Harry's father, James, and also Sirius Black, Harry's godfather. James and Sirius mercilessly bullied Snape at school. And though Snape had always deeply loved Harry's mother, Lily, his affections for her never extended to her only child. Despite his personal feelings, Snape secretly protected Harry from Voldemort after Dumbledore extracted his promise to do so, though no one, other than those two, knew about this. Throughout the story, Harry resents, and later deeply loathes, Snape, believing him responsible for his parents' deaths and the later murder of Dumbledore. It is only after learning the truth behind Snape's actions that Harry must reconcile his long-held hatred against his former Potions master, which he apparently does as he will name his second son Albus Severus.

=== Albus Dumbledore ===
This was probably Snape's closest and longest lasting-relationship, though it was occasionally fraught with conflict and rancor. Dumbledore first knew Snape when he entered Hogwarts as a student. Young Severus was exceptionally intelligent and magically talented, though there appeared to be no notable relationship between Headmaster and student until Snape discovered that Remus Lupin, also a student then, was a werewolf. Dumbledore made Snape swear never to reveal this secret to the other students. Snape apparently honored this promise while he remained a student, and long after, though reluctantly &amp;ndash; he attempts to get the Defence Against the Dark Arts class to recognize it on their own, and finally pushed beyond his limits, he &quot;accidentally&quot; lets the information slip out to his House.

After becoming a Death Eater during Voldemort's earlier reign of terror, Snape defected the Dark Lord's service to seek Dumbledore's help in protecting Lily Potter after Voldemort targeted her and her family for death, though it was Snape's actions, relaying a prophecy to Voldemort, that helped placed the Potters in danger. Dumbledore was unable to save James and Lily, and following Voldemort's demise, he offered Snape a safe sanctuary at Hogwarts, though this was probably an unpopular decision among the faculty and staff. In exchange for his help, Dumbledore had demanded Snape's promise to serve as his double agent and, believing Voldemort would one day return, to protect Harry Potter. Snape agreed, and continued in this role until his death. 

Throughout the years, the two men's relationship with one another gradually changed, and Snape became Dumbledore's closest confidant and adviser, though it had appeared to readers that McGonagall held this position. While Snape was never particularly friendly with his Hogwarts co-workers, and was generally disliked by most Hogwarts students, his extreme competence in teaching Potions may have eventually overridden any objections to Dumbledore's appointing him. And while Dumbledore knew Snape would make a valuable spy against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, as well be as an excellent Potions teacher, he may have given Snape a second chance for other reasons. Dumbledore truly deplored Snape's Death Eater involvement, but Dumbledore himself had once been seduced by magic's Dark side, causing him to form a brief alliance with the evil wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. Though he finally defeated Grindelwald in a duel, Dumbledore realized that his own early failures had caused much tragedy, and this may have tempered his harsh judgment regarding Snape's misdeeds. Up until the series' end, Harry always remained convinced that Snape still served Voldemort, while Dumbledore never doubted Snape's loyalty to him (Dumbledore). And though Snape was eternally grateful to Dumbledore, and despite his disliking Harry Potter, he was deeply critical and angered upon learning that Dumbledore had been protecting Harry only to groom him as a weapon against Voldemort, knowing the boy was destined to die. Despite his strong objections, however, Snape understood Dumbledore's reasoning behind it. 

Despite any underlying discord, a strong bond existed between the two men, and Snape never wavered in his loyalty or service to Dumbledore. Unfortunately, this devotion exacted a high emotional price for Snape, forcing him to honor his promise to carry out Dumbledore's final orders to help defeat Lord Voldemort.

=== Lord Voldemort ===

There is probably no person that Snape despised more than Lord Voldemort, though Snape was once his ardent and loyal follower. Snape was never inherently wicked, but his early attraction to Dark magic drew him to Voldemort. It is never entirely understood why Snape chose a Dark path, though it may have been that having found acceptance and fellowship within Slytherin House, he passively followed his Slytherin classmates into Voldemort's service. Alternatively, he might have actively chosen it, irresistibly drawn to something seemingly grandiose and important to which he could attach himself. At such an impressionable age, Snape may have been unable to fully comprehend Voldemort's evilness, though his own Dark nature played a significant factor, and he was ultimately responsible for his own decisions and wrongdoing. It was only after Voldemort targeted, and later murdered, someone Snape cared deeply about, despite Snape's then devoted servitude to him, that he turned against the Dark Lord and secretly aligned himself with Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.

After Voldemort's resurrection and rise to power, Snape apparently returns to his service, as seemingly devoted as before. While readers never know Snape's true loyalties until the final book, Snape never forgave Voldemort for Lily's murder. The Dark Lord, however, always seemed confident regarding Snape's loyalty to him, perhaps discounting Snape's ability to truly love and also underestimating his Occlumency skills that effectively concealed his true thoughts from Voldemort's intense mental probes. Voldemort proved once again that he valued his minions only while they were useful. Without hesitation, he ordered Snape's death, convinced it would fulfill his plan to command the Elder Wand that he mistakenly believed had fallen under Snape's control. Though Snape did not witness Voldemort's final downfall, his actions, before and after Dumbledore's demise, aided Harry's efforts to defeat the Dark Lord.

=== James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew ===
James, Remus, Sirius, and Peter were Gryffindor students together at Hogwarts. Anointing themselves the &quot;Marauders&quot;, all but Peter, also known as &quot;Wormtail&quot;, were magically proficient far beyond their years. Pettigrew, who tagged after the other three, relied heavily on the other three for magical help, also becoming an Animagus solely due to their aid. James and Sirius took a particular dislike to their Slytherin classmate, Severus Snape, bullying him frequently, mostly for their own amusement. Although Lupin never participated in this activity, Snape equally despised him, particularly after discovering Lupin was a werewolf, a secret Dumbledore later made Snape swear never to reveal to other Hogwarts students. Snape never forgave James or Sirius for their cruelty, though he was far from being an exemplary person himself. Snape despised James even after he saved Snape from Sirius' potentially fatal prank, always believing James intervened solely to protect himself against being punished.

When Lupin was hired as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in Harry's third year, Snape deeply resented him, though he apparently disliked anyone holding the position that he had long coveted but was continually denied. Despite this, Lupin always treated Snape with genuine respect, perhaps regretting that as a Hogwarts prefect, he had done little to curb James and Sirius' earlier bad behaviour towards Snape. Even after Snape revealed to Hogwarts students (and their parents) that Lupin was a werewolf, forcing Lupin to resign, Lupin still treated him respectfully, later telling Harry that Snape could have caused far worse damage to him and that while he was teaching at Hogwarts, Snape had always perfectly prepared his Wolfsbane Potion. 

Snape had even less regard for Peter Pettigrew, a cowardly, weak wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort and framed Sirius Black for his own faked murder. Snape interacts with Pettigrew only by Voldemort's command, hiding Pettigrew at his summer home in Spinner's End, in book 6, presumably under instruction to closely watch him for the Dark Lord.

Sirius Black was one of the few people Snape truly loathed. Sirius nearly cost Snape his life by urging him to investigate the mystery inside the Shrieking Shack during their Hogwarts school days. That mystery was Remus Lupin, who was confined there during his werewolf transformations. Snape likely would have been killed without James' intervention, preventing Snape's entering the Shack during a full moon. Snape never forgave Sirius for his potentially deadly trick, nor did Sirius ever show any remorse for his actions, and their mutual hatred permanently carried over into their adult lives. Sirius, of course, knew about Snape's involvement with Voldemort and other Death Eaters and how that association contributed to James and Lily Potter's deaths, further intensifying his hatred towards Snape. Despite their turbulent history, Snape and Sirius were able to somewhat subdue their mutual animosity at Dumbledore's request, to work together in the war against Voldemort. When Harry believed Sirius was in danger, Snape did warn the Order, though Harry always believed Snape deliberately delayed and was therefore partially responsible for Sirius' fate, perhaps overlooking Sirius' own reckless tendencies.

=== Lily Evans Potter ===

Lily Potter (née Evans) was the first character in the series that Snape knew, dating back to before their starting Hogwarts together. Snape, being a Half-blood, knew from an early age that he was a wizard, while Lily, a Muggle-born witch, was unable to understand her burgeoning magical powers. Snape explained much about the Wizarding world to her and that her sister Petunia's jealousy was over Lily being magical, while she was not. The two soon became close friends.

At Hogwarts, to Snape's disappointment, he and Lily were sorted into separate Houses, he into Slytherin, and she into Gryffindor. Initially, they remained close friends, and when Snape became a favorite target for James Potter and Sirius Black, also Gryffindors, to bully and torment, Lily defended him. Their once close friendship became strained, however, as Snape grew increasingly attracted to the Dark Arts and made friends with the more unsavory Slytherin students (and future Death Eaters). Their relationship finally ended over an incident involving James and Sirius, when Snape, upset and humiliated, apparently resented Lily's intervention on his behalf and aimed a derogatory comment at her. This caused Lily to permanently end their friendship despite his repeated apologies, and she eventually married James Potter, later giving birth to Harry.

Lily was the only person Snape had ever deeply cared for, and while the relationship's exact nature and Lily's true feelings for him are unknown, Snape was devastated by her death, never fully recovering. Snape's actions, learned about later in the series, were mostly driven by his love for her. Dumbledore seized upon that to secure Snape's help in protecting Harry and to combat Voldemort. 

Snape's relationships with other characters is discussed in greater detail in the Greater Picture section of this article.

== Analysis ==

Snape's actions throughout the series have shown service to each of the opposing sides. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort believe Snape is only loyal to them, allowing him to work as a double agent. Not only is it unknown until very near the end of the final book which side he is really on, but there is no concrete evidence until then that he has actually chosen one. He has made strong claims, which Dumbledore trusts, to oppose Lord Voldemort's cruelty, but hatred exists between himself and many Order of the Phoenix members. Though seemingly fearing a world under Voldemort's domination, he would appear to have equally little place in one where the Order is victorious. There is little reason to believe he has an interest in either side winning, and he may even prefer being able to exert influence on, and gain favours from, both.

Snape exhibits both good and evil qualities, making him the series' only anti-hero. Snape possesses a nasty demeanour, and is especially retaliatory to those who hurt him (James, Sirius, Snape Sr.) However, Snape's seeming cruelty may have resulted from a terrible childhood and early youth. When Harry delved into Snape's early memories, there was nothing good to be seen, only an abusive father, a victimized mother, derisive classmates, and a cruel James Potter and Sirius Black. While the series does little to emphasize Snape's good qualities, it is implied, at least until the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', that he would protect Order of the Phoenix members with his life. He has saved Harry's life on more than one occasion, though it might take a particularly observant reader to see that. Though he treats students badly and is seemingly indifferent to their feelings or situations, he wants them to learn valuable lessons.

During the series, we see these contradictions in Snape's behaviour. He seems motivated by his hatred for Harry and, occasionally to some extent, Dumbledore. We can easily believe, like Harry, that Snape is attempting to eliminate Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. Snape's consistently sabotaging Harry's Potions coursework throughout the year is clearly going to be something of a recurring story element throughout the series. Yet by that book's end, Snape acted to save Harry's life in his first Quidditch match. In ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', we are as aware as Harry that Snape coveted Remus Lupin's teaching post, and that Snape distrusts Lupin; yet, Snape had repeatedly brewed a very tricky Wolfsbane potion, flawlessly, fully aware that any minor error would have eliminated Lupin from the school forever, without provable intent on Snape's part – &quot;Anyone can make a mistake, Headmaster, surely you don't think I would have deliberately done anything to risk a student's death from a werewolf bite?&quot; And as late as the final book's mid-section, when we hear that Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and Neville Longbottom had been &quot;punished cruelly&quot; by being sent to help Hagrid, when Snape knows precisely where Hagrid's sympathies lie, we are left wondering whether Snape deliberately minimized the punishment he was meting out to protect the students.

That Snape's mother's surname was Prince, and that he is a half-blood, hints broadly at the title character's identity in the sixth book, ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. As Harry spends much time trying to uncover who this character is, prematurely revealing his identity would constitute a plot spoiler.

=== ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' (The Prince's Tale) ===

The memories Snape reveals to Harry serve two purposes. The first set, up to the deaths of Harry's parents, seem to explain Snape's feelings, and provide a basis for his later actions. Snape, who first met Lily Evans at age 9 or 10, had revealed to her that she was a witch and he was a wizard, and introduced her to the Wizarding world. He had also defended her against her Muggle sister, Petunia, as Lily prepared for her first year at Hogwarts. They became close friends, a friendship that was eventually strained to destruction by Snape's association with darker Slytherin students. Despite their friendship's demise, Snape continued loving Lily, and he had agreed to do anything in exchange for Dumbledore's promise to save Lily, and her family, from Voldemort. When the story opens, Snape had kept this promise for eleven years, starting when he first turned informant against Voldemort, and continued to keep it throughout the series, even beyond Dumbledore's death, protecting Harry against Voldemort and his allies.

After James and Lily's deaths, Snape's memories, while still reinforcing our understanding of Snape's unrequited love for Lily, also show Dumbledore and Snape working together to protect Harry and mold him into the weapon that eventually destroys Voldemort. Dumbledore, knowing he had little time left and that Voldemort had charged Draco with killing him, orchestrated his own demise at Snape's hands, telling Snape it was to protect Draco's soul, and to allow Dumbledore to retain some dignity in death. We also learn that Harry has become an unexpected seventh Horcrux, and that Snape must somehow have Voldemort kill Harry in order to destroy it. We learn, in particular, that Dumbledore had set large plans in motion, and that Snape, much to his own dismay, was merely a cog in Dumbledore's machinations. Snape is particularly dismayed that, having worked so long and so diligently to protect Harry, they must now arrange his death to finally defeat Voldemort.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|Later in the book]], we will find that, despite the large role Dumbledore had planned for Snape, and the extreme trust he placed in him, Dumbledore never told Snape the entire story. Some pieces, notably the Elder Wand's role and Harry's inability to be killed by Voldemort, he reserved, perhaps feeling them to be too dangerous, or perhaps worrying that knowing the entire plan would cause Snape to become overzealous and unwittingly allow Voldemort's escape.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

=== First Five Books ===

While we do not yet fully understand, it becomes apparent in the first book that Snape absolutely hates Harry in particular, and Gryffindor in general. Just how deeply this hatred runs is only gradually realised; initially, Snape's malice seems rather impersonal, though it is certainly directed at Harry more than anyone else in Gryffindor. Neville Longbottom and Hermione also receive insults and slights from Snape, though never the same degree as Harry. Neville perhaps deserves some disdain, as he often performs poorly in Potions. However, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we discover that Neville's worst fear is Professor Snape. That fear, combined with his notoriously poor memory, renders Neville utterly incompetent in Potions, creating horrible messes and melting cauldrons. With a more forgiving and supportive teacher, Neville might have performed much better in class. Harry certainly improves his Potions skill under Professor Slughorn, though he could be considered to have had some additional unsanctioned help.

In ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' we discover why Snape so dislikes Harry. Harry looks &quot;most extraordinarily like&quot; his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]. James was involved in a prank that would have left Snape facing a werewolf (Remus Lupin). While James did save Snape's life, Snape never forgave him, claiming James acted only to protect himself from being punished. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], we also learn that three of the Marauders, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew, apparently made a hobby of tormenting Snape, a practice they continued at least until their fifth year at Hogwarts. Harry's appearance always reminded Snape of this dark and painful period in his life, and quite possibly explains some of his maltreatment of Harry, though it in no way excuses it.

Some ambivalence on Snape's part concerning Harry can be seen as early as the first book. Snape was actually protecting Harry, notably during Harry's first Quidditch match. When Harry's broom is Jinxed by Professor Quirrell, Snape attempted to counter it; we have Quirrell's word on that. In ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Snape agreed to Dumbledore's request to try and teach Harry Occlumency to shield him from Voldemort's mental probes. When Dolores Umbridge requests Veritaserum from Snape, in order to interrogate Harry, from its lack of effect (she apparently had used the entire phial, such that even the slightest sip on Harry's part would have probably constituted the necessary three drops), one must wonder if Snape had provided her with a fake potion. Snape's refusal to provide additional Veritaserum on demand, after Umbridge caught Harry using her fireplace to contact Sirius, could also be construed as defending Harry. And later, it appears Snape believed Harry's about Sirius' status, at least enough to investigate his claim and then keep a watchful eye on Harry's whereabouts, and to notify the Order when Harry failed to return from the Forbidden Forest.

=== ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' ===

Snape plays little direct part in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' despite lending his nickname to the title. Equally, the book is to a large extent all about him. Throughout, he is seen in flash-backs and stories about other characters which illuminate his character, as Harry and company try to discover who the talented Half-Blood Prince really is. Dumbledore explicitly expresses absolute faith in Snape, though he refuses to reveal why; it is this refusal to reveal the reason that has Harry discounting Dumbledore's trust.

Towards the book's beginning, as mentioned above, Snape is finally appointed as the as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, a position he had sought for many years. As a result, a new Potions teacher is needed, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], a former head of Slytherin house, is coaxed out of retirement. Slughorn accepts students with less than excellent grades for his NEWT-level Potions class, which Snape would never have done. Harry enrolls late and is lent an old textbook, that Harry discovers contains many useful tips hand-written into the margins. As the year progresses, we discover that the textbook is old enough to have belonged to one Eileen Prince, finally identified as Snape's mother, who had married Tobias Snape, a Muggle. We already know (from the Pensieve episode in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]) that Snape was most probably in the same class as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] (who married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], Harry's father), and from Slughorn's recollections we find that Lily, rather than Snape, was the outstanding natural potions student. The textbook notes are all in the same handwriting and the book is inscribed 'property of the Half Blood Prince'. It also includes descriptions of some spells which Snape admits he created. The implication here is that he recorded all this information into the book; yet if he had been as skilled at Potions as Harry became thanks to the book, it would have been Snape who was remembered as the natural, rather than Lily. All this suggests that in some way the book may have been a collaboration between Snape and Lily. However, given that this is a textbook for 6th year students, and Lily had ended their friendship in their fifth year, Snape was probably the sole contributor. Assuming that they were both in the same NEWT Potions class, however, as everyone in all four houses of Harry's year group seems to be, Snape could have been observing and recording Lily's potion-making from a distance, as a way of trying to stay in touch with her somehow.

The new information adds understanding to the Pensieve scene. In that scene, James was bullying Snape, using a curse on him which we now believe Snape invented. The scene took place during or immediately after Severus Snape's and James Potter's OWLs, which would be their fifth year, before the year in which this textbook would have been used in class. Lily is seen reacting to the injustice, and Snape abusing her out of proportion to what has occurred, as she seems only to have wanted to help him. Together these scenes add credence to the existence of a longstanding relationship between Snape and Lily. She is described as always seeing the good in people others would shun. He is from a doubtful Muggle background, more similar to hers than most of their classmates. Additionally, there is the fact that Snape has not once mentioned Harry's mother, though they apparently were in the same Potions class, almost as if he cannot bear to have her name mentioned. Ordinarily, it would have been so easy to compare Harry against Lily: &quot;Your mother could have whipped that potion up with her eyes closed...&quot; And it is certainly true that he has similarly mentioned Harry's father in that sort of context. All together this has given rise to speculation that Snape was in love with her, even if this was not reciprocated.

Snape is also, in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', identified as the person who informed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] about the prophecy foretelling his nemesis. This inevitably led to Voldemort seeking out Harry to eliminate him, and in the process killing James and Lily. It makes Snape unwittingly but directly responsible for two people's deaths who were certainly his classmates, one who may have been his rival but the other who may have been (secretly) his one great love. This may explain Dumbledore's unshakable belief that Snape irrevocably rejected Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

=== ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' ===

Snape's loyalty is unclear to us until very late in the final book when it is revealed that he had secretly loved Lily Evans, as speculated above. He had aligned himself with Dumbledore as a means to protect Lily from Voldemort.

This revelation clarifies much of the confusion and mystery that had surrounded Snape. He had hated James Potter for many reasons, including James' ongoing bullying and torment toward him during their school days at Hogwarts, and also James' rescuing Snape from a fatal encounter with the werewolf Lupin, leaving Snape bitterly resenting being forever in James debt. Finally, James spirited away Snape's one love, Lily Evans, daring to have a child with her. To protect Lily from Voldemort, Snape agreed to an open-ended promise with Dumbledore (&quot;Anything!&quot;). Dumbledore, knowing Snape's skill in Occlumency, had Snape spy against Voldemort, and after Lily's death, required him to protect Lily's son, Harry.

This, of course, sets up a major conflict in Snape's life. Every interaction with Harry carries emotional baggage, the more so as Harry, except for his eyes, is the image of his father. Snape cannot help but be reminded of the hated James every time he sees Harry. In Snape's memories, we see him railing about Harry to Dumbledore; interestingly, every trait he attributes to Harry is one that we have seen, to some extent, in James, rather than Harry. Yet, he is sworn to protect Harry, who is the only child of his lost love. In such an untenable situation, is it any surprise that he is bitter? Desperately unhappy himself, he gets what relief he can by making others unhappy also. About the only person Snape does not savage is Dumbledore, who initially exacted the promise from him, and who did do everything he was allowed to do to prevent Lily's death. It is perhaps because of this that Dumbledore dismisses Harry's belief that Snape had been prepared to duel with Sirius; Dumbledore has not experienced directly the depth of Snape's bitterness, and so discounts it. In discussing his reasons for assigning the task of teaching Harry Occlumency to Snape, Dumbledore does admit to having believed that Snape's dislike of Harry could be dealt with.

It is because of this internal conflict, and its final resolution, that the much-despised Snape is one of the most moving, and best-rendered, characters in the entire series. Several readers have been moved to tears by the revelations in chapter 33 of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

One thing that is not, however, made certain is exactly why Dumbledore kept his belief in Snape's loyalty. At first reading, it seems that he expected Snape to remain loyal because he saw Snape's regret after Lily Evans' death. But strictly speaking, it could have been that Snape's love for Lily had faded over the years, and so he could have turned to Voldemort again. Until the scene with the doe Patronus in Dumbledore's office, which took place in Harry's sixth year, we have no information that Dumbledore could have gotten which unarguably would have proven that Snape was still loyal after fifteen years. What we do know is that once Dumbledore grants someone his trust, he doesn't revoke it lightly. We see evidence that Snape is quite frequently in Dumbledore's company, both in the memories of the Prince and in Harry's direct experience. And while it is never said outright, we believe that Dumbledore has some ability at Legilimency. Dumbledore clearly expected Snape's love for Lily to fade, as shown by his reaction to Snape's Patronus; however, he would not expect Snape's loyalty to fall away, and back towards Voldemort, until Voldemort returned. It is quite possible that Dumbledore had inspected Snape quite thoroughly after the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], but we would not see that in the Prince's memories, because that would have been one of the more humiliating experiences in Snape's recent life, and would not have been germane to Harry in any event.

As an interesting sidelight, Severus' motivation is actually implied to some extent by his name. The opera by Donizetti, [[w:Poliuto|''Poliuto'']], and the lesser-known opera [[w:Polyeucte|''Polyeucte'']] by Charles Gounod, are both based on the drama [[w:Polyeucte|''Polyeucte martyr'']] by Pierre Corneille. Both operas introduce a romantic subplot in which the Roman general Severus is in love with Polyeuctis' wife Pauline. Though given orders to prosecute Christians, Severus attempts to defend Polyeuctis, who has converted to Christianity, for Pauline's sake. His attempts are unsuccessful, and in the end Pauline dies alongside her husband. The implication is weakened by the number of famous Romans named Severus, including several generals and at least one emperor.

=== Loyalty ===

With the exception of Dumbledore, everyone in the books, at one point or another, has their doubts about Snape's loyalty. The doubts of the Death Eaters, as expressed by Bellatrix Lestrange in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], are well-founded: at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff's]] hearing, where he is betraying his fellow Death Eaters to the Wizengamot as part of negotiating for a sentence reduction, he claims Snape is a Death Eater, and Dumbledore states that Snape had been working against Voldemort long before Voldemort had fallen. There is no way that this statement, made in what was effectively open court, would have missed being heard by a Death Eater or sympathizer; it is possible, in fact, that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] was present, and that Harry simply failed to see him in Dumbledore's memory. 

This actually is part of the explanation for Karkaroff's conversations with Snape in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. The reader may wonder why Karkaroff is discussing Voldemort's possible return with Snape, who Karkaroff in particular knows had at the very least been in a position to betray Voldemort, and possibly had actually done so. Karkaroff at that point is aware that, having betrayed other Death Eaters in order to save his own skin, he is now equally a traitor in Voldemort's eyes, and believes that if he responds to Voldemort's summons, he will be murdered, if not by Voldemort himself, then by the families or friends of Death Eaters he had betrayed. His trust in Snape is based on his belief that he and Snape are both refugees from the Dark Lord.

Given this understanding, why should Voldemort trust Snape? This also is discussed in detail in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. In discussions with Bellatrix, Snape tells her and Narcissa Malfoy why Voldemort accepted him back to the Death Eaters organization. Snape implies that Voldemort had examined him by means of Legilimency, which suggests that Snape must be an exceptionally strong Occlumens, not only able to block Legilimency but able to seamlessly generate false images for a Legilimens to perceive. We know, from events in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], that Voldemort has this ability; he uses it to create perceptions of Sirius Black being tortured in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. The fact that Voldemort was unable to perceive Snape doing this leads us to the inescapable conclusion that Snape was significantly stronger at both Legilimency and Occlumency than Voldemort.

Knowing that Snape is loyal to Dumbledore, and knowing the reason for that loyalty, a reader would be well rewarded by studying the portrayal of Snape, and exploring how the many hints of his true loyalty are obscured, and how his loyalty is perceived by other characters. Surprisingly, Snape's influence on the story is almost as great as Dumbledore's, and it is worth study to determine how that influence is hidden from the reader.

'''Publishing 101: How to Start and Run a Magazine or Newspaper'''

== Starting Out ==

The art of publishing books, magazines and newspapers has never been as streamlined as it is today with the advent of digital publishing methods which have transformed high-overhead processes into reasonably affordable ventures. Modern desktop publishing (DTP) software and computers are available to experienced professionals and to less sophisticated users at corresponding prices. And because of the Internet, it is possible to have an entire editorial/production staff that exists online. Keep in mind that a lot of the information that follows is in need of updating.

== Equipment and supplies you’ll need ==

(Assuming you’ll be creating a publication with a print run of over 1,000, as opposed to a small photocopied zine)

=== Hardware ===

'''A good computer with a lot of memory.''' A good computer, with at least twice the minimum amount of RAM installed, is preferable if you're going to try to do everything on one computer. As one person wrote, &quot;It is worth spending as much as you can on your computer.&quot; Another absolute in today's society is having a processor that is fast. In fact, as with any computing needs, the faster the better, but a processor that's at least 1.5Ghz should be considered an essential, dual or quad core is even better!.

Apple (aka Macintosh) computers are what the majority of printing companies and professional freelance designers use. If you are looking to produce a newspaper of any size with a team, you will want more than one machine. Page layout takes time, so the more availability you have the better, but this has to be balanced with cost, as well as warm bodies that will be using the machines.

'''A Flash drive, or DVD writer, and a External Hard Drive for long term backups.''' This is one important way, aside from FTP software, that you’ll move your digital documents around. They are also good for backing up your data. A DVD writer should be less than $50.  Flash drives are even cheaper. As of Sept 2008, for USD$155, you can get a 1 Terabyte internal hard drive, so relatively speaking, that's cheap, especially when you look at prices from even three years ago.

'''A good printer.''' Laser is best and can be had for little money, new for less than $100 but look into spending around $400 for good one with network support built in. Laser also eats up a lot less ink than inkjets. It’s more pricey up front, but cheaper over the long haul, and they last longer.

'''A good digital camera.''' Film is not cheap. We recommend the Canon or Nikon point-and-shoot series. They’re fast, reliable and less than $400 new. When shopping around, find a digital camera with at least six megapixels, but eight or ten would be better, if possible. However, megapixel by itself is not a guarantee of quality, because other factors, such as lens quality, focal length and lag time, must be taken into account in comparing cameras.

=== Software ===

'''Desktop Publishing Software.''' QuarkXpress or [http://www.adobe.com/ Adobe] InDesign (successor to Adobe Pagemaker). You may also want to look at Adobe Photoshop for tricking out your pictures. This can cost a lot, sometimes over $1,000 for each program when you buy the latest version. If you're just starting out on a shoestring budget, check up on eBay for older versions, as you can pick those up a lot cheaper. None of the programs are really difficult to use, and there are tutorials available on many Web sites. Also, do a search for email discussion groups and [http://www.google.com/groups/ Usenet] newsgroups focused on the specific piece of software, as well as your area of interest, such as &quot;launching newspapers&quot; or &quot;launching magazines&quot; -- there are newsgroups and discussion lists for everything! '''Extremely important''': learn conventional typesetting methods and study what good papers are doing to turn out a superior product. Learn and be conversant in all the typesetting terms, and buy a copy of the latest &lt;u&gt;AP Style Manual&lt;/u&gt; so you can edit correctly to an industry standard. On the other hand, if your job is putting out a church newsletter, then you don't need to get this fussy.  

For many things today, and to be able to find a printer that can accept your files without reformatting everything, you will want to get copies of nothing earlier than QuarkXPress version 3.3 or better or PageMaker 5. Be sure to check with the printer that will be publishing the final product to find out if their software -- likely within one version of being current with the newest release of the software package -- can open or import your files without issue.

As far as photo tools, look for at least Adobe Photoshop CS or newer. Other solid photo manipulation tools are Gimp and [http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.asp SnagIt], although they aren't as fully developed as Adobe Photoshop.

While there are other desktop publishing programs available, they generally aren't supported by actual printing businesses. If you must use a tool other than QuarkXPress or PageMaker, a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) package, Scribus, is good. It isn't a feature-rich as either QuarkXPress or PageMaker, but it can help you come up with an end product. Scribus can natively print to portable document format (PDF), but sometimes the actual PDF doesn't work well for some printing companies. Be sure to run a test to ensure the actual final product will work for you, meaning that it will do everything you need and want, but also that the company printing your publication can open the final file to print your newspaper.

'''Website Software.''' If you're going to have a Web site for your newspaper, check out Adobe Dreamweaver (formerly Macromedia Dreamweaver), Adobe Pagemill and KompoZer are good WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors for designing a Web site.

While we’re on site creation, make yours a dynamic site that uses PHP or .Net if possible. This software, available for free online, allows you to update your site as easily as sending an email from any computer. Instead of PHP, you could also consider using SSI (server-side includes) if your site is hosted on a Unix server. Using SSI is relatively simple. All you do is create and upload one file with the HTML coding, reference the file name from a static page, and everything changes. Be sure to research '''[http://www.apacheweek.com/features/ssi server side includes]''' to get a full understanding.

Other options for simple and easy-to-create and easy-to-maintain sites are to use a blog-based tool, such as [http://www.wordpress.org WordPress] for a self-hosted site, or [http://www.ezymedia.com EzyMedia] and [http://www.WordPress.com WordPress.com] for hosted sites, meaning the site's files and primary headaches will be handled -- for free -- by your hosts. The disadvantage to using the hosted package with WordPress is that you cannot entirely customize the theme. You can modify the themes offered in the package, but beyond that, you don't have the option of uploading additional files to change the theme. The self-hosted option can serve you better for a personalized site. TypePad is another blog-based tool that many sites use as a mini-CMS (content management system) to maintain the site.

If you're experimental, geeky, and can understand technical stuff fairly quickly, check out fully-fledged CMS tools, such as EzyMedia, Drupal, Joomla, or other CMS packages. Many are FOSS packages for the download. Setting up most CMS packages is relatively painless once the files are uploaded to the server. Maintaining sites through blog-based and CMS-based platforms are easy, as you use a simple WYSIWYG editor interface to enter the stories (use a simple copy-and-paste approach), add a headline, a title (or &quot;slug&quot;) -- which then becomes the URL, click SAVE, and you're done.

=== Telecommunications ===

'''High-speed Internet.''' Yeah, it’s $40 a month, but it’s also indispensable for maintaining your sanity. You can also share WiFi with a neighbor, but be certain to read the Terms of Service for the plan's stipulations about sharing a connection.

'''A phone number and business cards.''' Voicemail is only about $10 a month and you can get 1,000 business cards from Staples for about $20. It sure beats writing your name on scrap paper, trust me. If you have a cell phone with unlimited use, or one with cheap rates, you could also consider using [http://www.netzero.com NetZero Voice] (aka [http://www.privatephone.com PrivatePhone.com]), which offers free voicemail, a free voicemail number, and 10 free 10-minute &quot;return&quot; calls that display &quot;your&quot; phone number and business name (as you entered it when you create the account) per month. You can receive up to 10,000 calls per month for free. If you don't mind using a cell phone or other means to return calls -- even email, which many companies do these days -- this could be a possible alternative.

NOTE: On a check up of the PrivatePhone service on 12/14/07, it has been indicated that PrivatePhone will be discontinuing their service on 12/31/07.  They recommend searching the internet for &quot;Free Phone and Voicemail Service&quot; to find other comparable services.

'''Web Hosting.''' You can register a .com or .org. for as little as $8. You can get good, reliable hosting for $15 to $35 a month for a basic site. Many Web hosts have packages with 200 gigs or more of space, with 2,000 email accounts, unlimited email aliases, and other features, for $19USD per month. Packages with less space can be had for $4USD to $14USD per month.

** PRIVATEPHONE SERVICE ENDED ON FEBRUARY 19, 2008 **

=== Location ===
If running your project out of your home isn’t an option, inexpensive space is available in local artist spaces, from progressive community groups.

=== Finances ===

'''A business checking account.''' Small business checking accounts are free at many local banks. The banks may tell you they require an [http://www.irs.gov/ IRS]-issued EIN (Employer ID number, similar to a Social Security Number for businesses), but if you explain you do not expect to receive over $9,000 this year in income and that the IRS doesn't require an EIN until you reach that threshold, they generally use just the principle owner's Social Security Number in the U.S. Other countries may have other requirements, so check.

At the state and local level, you may be required to file documents with the Secretary of State and the county and/or city where you are located. Some cities and counties require business licenses, and if they do, it's generally cheaper to get the license than to get caught doing business and not having one. A call to a local business attorney can get you the general information, as well as a call to your local city hall.

'''An accountant.''' Although sometimes expensive, you can find accountants that will charge only $50 to $80 an hour for a consultation. This could help you tremendously in keeping your books, and it doesn't have to be an on-going alliance. Sit down, get the basics, find out what you need to learn, and check back as appropriate. Also ask for an ad! Be sure to at least read a book on the subject before you DIY.

== Finding a team ==

Depending on the size and frequency of the newspaper you are starting, you will need to staff a number of different positions, from the publisher's chair on down.  The smaller the paper, the smaller the number of employees you will need. At the bare minimum your paper will need a publisher, an editor, a sales manager, reporters, photographers, sales staff, copy editors/page designers, a production (graphics) team and someone to handle classified ads. Someone in accounts receivable is probably a necessity. 

At smaller operations, such as a weekly or monthly publication, many of these roles may overlap and be filled by a single person. A reporter, for example, may take their own pictures. A sales manager might also be the salesperson; and the publisher may also be the editor. 

There are several ways to staff your paper. There are a number of media-specific job websites that cater to both employers and employees. Many prospective employees and journalism school graduates keep a close eye on these sites as they seek out employment opportunities. Placing employment ads online and in other publications is also a good way to let people know you are hiring. It also can't hurt to contact journalism schools directly and let them know you are hiring. Whichever method you choose, be sure to be specific in the qualifications you are looking for in a potential employee. The idea of working in the media is appealing, and many applicants think no specialized training is required. 

'''Who’s doing what?'''
You’ll need to determine if you’re going to function as a democratic collective, a top-down construct or some other organization system. Some papers operate as a democratically driven hierarchy. They ask the entire team to give consent to what we do. The democracy is integral to the mission of the magazine. Editorial decisions, design questions and ethical considerations receive round-table speculation by everyone involved in the project. Complete consensus is not necessarily the goal; in fact; Encourage debate. No matter what the outcome, consider staff input crucial to the operation. It takes a little longer to consult staff members, but you’ll find it’s worth it.

'''Communication'''
Communicating with a staff of 12 can be more difficult than reaching 12,000 readers. Use an Internet message board to keep in contact with your team and make sure everyone is on the same page…or Web page. We use topica.com to network our team. It’s a free service. This is a listserv, which functions as an email broadcast system. Send a message and it goes out to the whole team. If Joe Smith replies, his reply goes out to everyone, like on a party line. We also have monthly meetings where we meet in person and parties where we hang out.

== Developing your prototype ==

Start with a statement of purpose. Our first directive was to democratize media by sharing the tools of journalism with the general public. Let your statement become your guiding light, your prime directive.
You will never have more time to debug your magazine or newspaper than right now. Take your time and develop a working model with actual stories and photos (stuff that’s not time sensitive so you can actually use it in your first issue). Look at magazines you like and determine what stylistic aspects you’d like in your own. Develop a consistent page size (determined by printing press specifications) and margins, font, font size, standard leading and spacing, headline standards, number of columns and logos. Then again, maybe your zine’s just too avante garde for that stuff to matter. That’s okay too, the rules are yours to rewrite.
Figure out how often your publication will come out and what size and format you want.

== Printing ==

There are many printing options available. What you can achieve depends largely on your budget. When you see something you like, call the publisher and find out where they print. The cheapest game on the block is web press on newsprint. You can get a 1,000 copies of an 8-page tabloid size in black and white for about $500 per print run. Then again, 5,000 of this same rag might be only $1000. Basically, producing plates to print newspapers represents a significant part of the costs, as does getting the print run ready and doing the admin. The paper and ink is less expensive. The first 1,000 papers will usually be very expensive, but after 10,000 copies you'll be paying very little per 1,000 'run-on'.

Feel free to ask your printer questions on what they need and how they need it. Good printers should provide you with information on how best to produce pages to print well with them. Stick to the deadlines you negotiate with them. They can be among your best allies. Modern page layout software exports to the Adobe Acrobat format (PDF). Sending pages in this format is as close to 'what you see is what you get' printing as you can hope for. The format allows fonts to be embedded and avoids the newspaper coming back barely legible due to a substituted font face. Other methods include sending across EPS pages and our fonts on disk - if a font is missing the story that uses that font will degrade into another font (often Courier). That screws up all the spacing and layout and could cause you to lose the end of a story. Take your first issue in early, be prepared to head back to your office, fix the problems and return. It is very common for printers to accept files by internet (FTP) transfer.



Finding sales people willing to work on commission only can be a very difficult process. You may well have to do this yourself. Only the most dedicated staff can and will do it well.

Determine the cost of the ads by looking at your local competition and peers. Your magazine or paper is published in regular cycles; monthly, weekly, etc. Your operating expenses (paying contractors, paying rent and other regular expenses) come in cycles as well.

The following formula works well: (Total printing cost divided by total number of pages)  = Cost per page. Simple. Now you know what that paper real estate costs you.

In the planning stages for each issue, you look at many things in determining the number of pages. Some publications use a ratio of 50 percent advertising to 50 percent content, while others use a 60/40 ad-to-content ratio, and still others use a 70/30 ad-to-content ratio. While each publication determines its own ratio, the closer to a 50/50 balance you maintain, the better your publication will be viewed by your readers. The reason: it will seem like they have '''actual content to read''' -- ''not just ads to pass by'' in a vain attempt to find your content.

==Fundraising and Grant writing==

Unless your operation is a non-profit, it's doubtful you'll be able to secure grant money. Look for fundraising opportunities that serve your niche readership.

== Distribution and Subscriptions ==

The way you choose to get your magazine into people’s hands will be an important determining factor of how you’ll be spending your time on your publishing project. You can basically create a free distribution model or a pay-at-the-newsstand/subscription/street hawker model. Both have their benefits and drawbacks. There are companies that handle either sort of job, but it’s a lot cheaper to do it yourself. Most business owners are glad to have new papers in their shops. Most importantly, maintain a stable fulfillment plan. Do what you say you’ll do and deliver the magazine or paper on time.

In delivering on-time, be sure to not over-commit yourself to a specific number of pages for any specific issue.

== The bottom line ==

In the end, consistency, integrity and respect will get you farther than anything else and dogged persistence will help you go beyond yourself and allow you to realize your vision.
Remember one thing, if you are the owner of a newspaper, you have power. Power has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's up to you how you use this power. For example, the media mogul Rupert Murdoch is the owner of News Corp. the biggest newspaper company in the world, and guess what? He has dinner with the President of the United States, oops, I mean the President has dinner with him!  Reflect on what was said and good luck.

DakeDesu says:

Looks good... I would have never have thought to ask other newspapers in my area.

One note: EPS is not really comparable to PDF. EPS technically is an image format. An image format used primarly by PS. PDF allows scripting via PS. (Actually PDF's specs allow scripting in any language ontop of PS, but most interpretors only understand PS).

To use some extremely poorly chosen examples: EPS is to BMP as PDF is to DOC.

Though, I found the rest of the article helpful and informative.

== More information about starting a newspaper ==

Somebody obviously had fun writing the &quot;Equipment and supplies you’ll need&quot; section, but in my opinion, that is the section that people know the most about.  What is the most important to a person starting a newspaper is the information in the other sections: Printing, advertising, selecting a staff, etc.

== A decent piece of software for websites? ==

I would hardly call Frontpage a decent piece of software for WYSIWYG. Most webdesigners agree with this. About the only piece of software worse for websites would be MS Word (though Word could be used for the Copy (but definitely not publishing)).

Other web site creation software that should be up for note would be, NVU, Kompozer, Quanta and SCREEM. It should also be noted that a website can be created in Notepad, or if you want more power Vim or Emacs

== Online Newspaper Business Model ==

There is a need for a section about business model. There are three major models: freemium, advertising and subscription.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cerebral palsy''' or '''CP''' is a group of permanent disorders associated with developmental [[Wikipedia:brain injury|brain injuries]] that occur during [[Wikipedia:fetus|fetal]] development, [[Wikipedia:Childbirth|birth]], or shortly after birth. It is characterized by a disruption of [[Wikipedia:motor skills|motor skills]], with symptoms such as [[Wikipedia:spasticity|spasticity]], [[Wikipedia:paralysis|paralysis]], or [[Wikipedia:seizure|seizures]]. Cerebral palsy is a form of '''static [[Wikipedia:encephalopathy|encephalopathy]]'''.  One form of it, spastic diplegia, is sometimes known as '''Little's disease''' in the United Kingdom.  Properly speaking, the fact that CP does not get better or worse implies that it is a 'condition' (chronic nonprogressive neurological disorder) rather than a 'disease.' The incidence is about 1.5 to 4 per 1000 live births.  There is no cure, but therapy has been shown to be helpful in the maintenance of motor functions. While severity varies widely, cerebral palsy ranks among the most costly congenital conditions to manage.

Cerebral palsy develops while the [[Wikipedia:brain|brain]] is under development.  80% of all cases occur before the baby reaches 1 month old, however this disorder can occur within about the first 5 years of life.  It is a nonprogressive disorder; once damage to the brain occurs, no additional damage occurs as a result of this condition.  Cerebral palsy neither improves nor worsens, though symptoms may seem to increase with time, likely due to the aging process.

== History ==
Cerebral palsy, then known as &quot;Cerebral Paralysis&quot;, was first identified by a [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|British]] surgeon named [[Wikipedia:William Little|William Little]] in [[Wikipedia:1860|1860]].  Little raised the possibility of [[Wikipedia:asphyxia|asphyxia]] during birth as a chief cause of the disorder.  It was not until [[Wikipedia:1897|1897]] that [[Wikipedia:Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]] suggested that a difficult birth was not the cause but rather only a symptom of other effects on fetal development.  Modern research has shown that asphyxia is not found during birth in at least 75% of cases.  Such research also shows that Freud's view was correct, even though during the late [[Wikipedia:19th century|19th century]] and most of the [[Wikipedia:20th century|20th century]] Little's view was the traditional explanation. (&quot;Conditions&quot;, 9)

== Cause ==
Since cerebral palsy refers to a group of disorders, there is no exact known cause.  Some major causes are [[Wikipedia:asphyxia|asphyxia]], [[Wikipedia:hypoxia|hypoxia]] of the brain, birth trauma or [[Wikipedia:premature birth|premature birth]], [[Wikipedia:genetics|genetic]] susceptibility, certain [[Wikipedia:infection|infections]] in the mother during and before birth, central nervous system infections, [[Wikipedia:Physical trauma|trauma]], and consecutive [[Wikipedia:hematoma|hematomas]]. In most people with CP, the cause is unknown. After birth, the condition may be caused by toxins, physical brain injury, incidents involving hypoxia to the brain (such as [[Wikipedia:drowning|drowning]]), and [[Wikipedia:encephalitis|encephalitis]] or [[Wikipedia:meningitis|meningitis]].  Despite all of these causes, the cause of many individual cases of cerebral palsy is unknown.

Recent research has demonstrated that asphyxia is not the most important cause as it was once considered to be, though it still plays a role, probably accounting for about 10% of all cases.  The research has shown that infections in the mother, even infections that are not easily detected, may triple the risk of the child developing the disorder.

Premature babies have a higher risk because their organs are not yet fully developed.  This increases the risk of asphyxia and other injury to the brain, which in turn increases the incidence of cerebral palsy.

== Incidence and prevalence ==
The [[Wikipedia:incidence|incidence]] is about 1.5 to 4 per 1000 live births.  This amounts to approximately 5,000-10,000 babies born with cerebral palsy each year in the [[Wikipedia:United States|United States]].  Each year, around 1,500 preschoolers are diagnosed with the disorder.  In around 70% of all cases, cerebral palsy is found with some other disorder, the most common being [[Wikipedia:mental retardation|mental retardation]].  

Overall, advances in care of pregnant mothers and their babies has not resulted in a noticeable decrease in cerebral palsy.  Only the introduction of quality medical care to locations with less than adequate medical care has shown any decreases.  The incidence increases with premature or very low-weight babies regardless of the quality of care.  [[Wikipedia:Twin|Twins]] are also four times more likely to develop cerebral palsy than single births, and triplets are more likely still to develop it.

Despite medical advances, the incidence and severity of cerebral palsy has actually increased over time.  This may be attributed to medical advances in areas related to premature babies or the increased usage of artificial fertilization techniques.

== Types ==
Based on the group of muscles involved (typically only used to further describe spastic CP):

# '''Tetraplegia''' or '''Quadriplegia''' : Involvement of the four limbs, the trunk and the head. The great majority of these individuals will not be able to stand up or walk.
# '''Diplegia''': The four limbs are affected, but lower limbs are more involved than upper limbs. Some of the people with diplegia will be able to walk alone, with orthosis, or by the use such as crutches or walkers.
# '''Hemiplegia''':  Only the right side or the left side of the body is involved. People with hemiplegia are the most likely to walk, even though people with the above two types can often walk without assistance, if severity allows.

NOTE: These are not the only 3 types of spastic CP. Occasionally, terms such as monoplegia, paraplegia, triplegia and pentaplegia may be used.

# '''Ataxia''':  Persons with ataxia have damage to their [[Wikipedia:cerebellum|cerebellum]] which results in problems with balance, especially while walking.  It is the most rare type, occurring in at most 10% of all cases.
# '''Athetoid''' or '''dyskinetic''':  Persons with this type generally have involuntary body movements.  The damage occurs to the [[Wikipedia:extrapyramidal motor system|extrapyramidal motor system]] and/or [[Wikipedia:pyramidal tract|pyramidal tract]] and to the [[Wikipedia:basal ganglia|basal ganglia]]. It occurs in ~20% of all cases.
# '''Spastic''':  Persons with this type have damage to the [[Wikipedia:corticospinal tract|corticospinal tract]], [[Wikipedia:motor cortex|motor cortex]], or [[Wikipedia:pyramidal tract|pyramidal tract]].  It occurs in ~70% of all cases.

These three types may be found together.  In 30% of all cases of cerebral palsy, the spastic form is found with the one of the other types.  There are a number of other minor types of cerebral palsy, but these are the most common.

== Presentation (signs and symptoms) ==
All types of cerebral palsy are characterized by abnormal muscle tone, posture, reflexes, or motor development and coordination.  The classical symptoms are spasticity, paralysis, seizures, unsteady gait, and [[Wikipedia:dysarthria|dysarthria]].  While [[Wikipedia:mental retardation|mental retardation]] and cerebral palsy do not cause each other, the two disorders are found together in approximately 20%-30% of all persons with cerebral palsy. CP symptomatology is as diverse as the individuals who have it.  Secondary symptoms can include rigidity of limbs, bladder control issues, and impaired tongue movement.

== Imaging Findings ==

=== Soft Tissue ===

Soft tissue findings consist largely of decreased muscle mass.

=== Bones ===

In order for bones to attain their normal shape and size, they require the stresses from normal musculature.  The osseous findings will therefore mirror the specific muscular deficits in a given patient.  The shafts ([[Wikipedia:diaphysis|diaphyses]]) of the bones are often thin (gracile).  When compared to these thin shafts, the [[Wikipedia:metaphysis|metaphyses]] often appear quite enlarged (ballooning).  With lack of use, articular cartilage may atrophy, leading to narrowed joint spaces.

Depending on the degree of spasticity in a given patient, they may exhibit a variety of angular deformities about their joints.

Vertebral bodies also need vertical gravitational loading forces to develop properly. If a patient with cerebral palsy spends a great deal of time horizontal (in bed) during skeletal maturation, their adult vertebral bodies may be somewhat vertically elongated. Since the horizontal spines of quadrupeds normally appear this way, this finding in humans is sometimes referred to as &quot;caninization&quot;.

== Prognosis ==
Cerebral Palsy is not a progressive disorder. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood, if they receive extensive care from specialists. Some individuals with the disorder will need to stay under the immediate care of another person for their entire lives, while others have a mild enough case to pursue fully independent lives.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for cerebral palsy, but various forms of therapy can help a person with the disorder to function more effectively.  Nevertheless, there is only some benefit from life-long care.  The treatment is usually symptomatic and focuses on helping the person to develop as many motor skills as possible or to learn how to compensate for the lack of them.  The disorder does not affect the expected length of life so treatment focuses on quality of life issues. Non-speaking people with cerebral palsy are often successful availing of [[Wikipedia:Augmentative and Alternative Communication|Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] systems such as [[Wikipedia:Blissymbols|Blissymbols]].

== Usage of the term &quot;spastic&quot; ==
The term &quot;spastic&quot; describes the attribute of [[Wikipedia:spasticity|spasticity]] in one type of cerebral palsy. In [[Wikipedia:1952|1952]] a [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|UK]] [[Wikipedia:charity|charity]] called ''The Spastics Society'' was formed. The term &quot;spastic&quot; was used by the charity as a term for people with cerebral palsy. The word has since been used extensively as a general insult to disabled people, which they see as extremely offensive. It is also frequently used to insult able-bodied people when they seem overly anxious or unskilled in sports. The charity changed its name to [[Wikipedia:SCOPE|SCOPE]] in [[Wikipedia:1994|1994]].

== Central nervous system (CNS) ==
The CNS is the first of two principal components of the [[../../Nervous System/]] that can be divided by their anatomical compartmentalization. The CNS is enclosed by bony structures - the skull (''Cranium'') and the vertebral canal (''Canalis vertebralis'') - in order to provide maximal mechanical shelter. Furthermore, at the microscopical level all parts of the CNS are ensheated with a specific tissue, the meninges, that almost completely separate the CNS from the rest of the body. The meningeal envelope controls the import and export of nurishing substances, pivotal electrolytes, but also prevents entry of potentially harmful material like toxins, bacteria and viruses.
Anatomically, the CNS consists of two major components, the spinal cord and the brain. In both parts two basic types of nervous tissue can be differentiated: gray and white matter.

=== Spinal cord (''Medulla spinalis'') ===
'''''Gross anatomy:'''''

The spinal cord is a tail-like structure that embedded in the vertebral canal of the spine. The adult spinal cord has a length of ca. 40cm and weighs approximately 30g.
The spinal cord is caudally attached to the ''Medulla oblongata'' of the brain stem. It can be subdivided into five sections (cranio-caudal order): the cervical part (''Pars cervicalis''), thoracic part (''Pars thoracica''), lumbar part (''Pars lumbalis''), sacral part (''Pars sacralis'') and the coccygeal part (''Pars coccygea''). Most caudally the spinal cord constricts and ends in a conical structure, the ''Conus medullaris''.
In the course of the spinal cord, two swellings are apparent at the cervical and the lower lumbar level, the ''Intumescentia cervicalis'' and ''Intumescentia lumbosacralis''. The swollen appearance is owed to the fact that these portions of the spinal cord provide extensive innervation of the upper and lower extremities (muscles, dermatomes, vasculature), which are supplied by these segments (C4-T1 and L1-L3).

'''''Microscopic anatomy:''''' 

The spinal cord is composed of three distinct columns on each side: the ventral (anterior), lateral (or intermediate) and dorsal (posterior) column.

'''''Internal organization &amp; Function:''''' 

The spinal cord exhibits a archetypic organizational principle serving four distinct tasks: 

(1) ascending tracts convey mainly sensory information to the brain. 

(2) descending tracts carry centrally (in the brain) generated informations for controlling peripheral targets, e.g. skeletal muscles.

(3) local autonomic centres control visceral organs; their efferent commands are conveyed by the autonomic nervous system.

(4) local sensorymotoric centres are enabled to carry out basic programmes for controlling posture and fundamantal movement routines.


===Brain (''Cerebrum'') ===

The brain is the most complex organ of the body. Its complexity arises from hundreds of billions of nerve cells (neurons) that are clustered in different local compartments (Nuclei) and that interacts with each other via the process of neurotransmission.
The brain can be further subdivided into three main sections that arise very early in embryonic development: the forebrain (''Prosencephalon''), midbrain (''Mesencephalon'') and hindbrain (''Rhombencephalon'').

==== Hindbrain (''Rhombencephalon'') ====

The hindbrain consists of three components.

===== Medulla oblongata (''Myelencephalon'') =====
Most caudally at the transition zone between brain and spinal cord, the ''Medulla oblongata'' is the  first region that formally belongs to the brain. The internal structure and gross aspect of the Medulla oblongata nearly resembles the spinal cord's appearance, which led to the coining of an alternative name: ''Myelencephalon''.

===== Pons =====
The ''Pons'' (bridge) bridges the ''Medulla oblongata'' with the midbrain region. Attached to the dorsal aspect of the ''Pons'' is the ''Cerebellum''.

===== Cerebellum =====
The ''Cerebellum'' is a separate brain region only attached to the rest of the brain by three stalks (''Pedunculi'') on each side: the ''Pedunculus cerebellaris superior'', ''Pedunculus cerebellaris medius'' and ''Pedunculus cerebellaris inferior''.
The ''Cerebellum'' exhibits a distinction of gray and white matter like the Prosencephalon. Two hemispheres are separated from each other by the interposed ''Vermis cerebelli''. A different subdivision describes three cerebellar lobes, anterior (''Lobus cerebellaris anterior''), posterior (''Lobus cerebellaris posterior'')and the flocculonodular lobe (''Lobus flocculonodularis''). Additionally, the ''Cerebellum'' contains internal nuclei (''Nuclei cerebelli'') that are distinct from the cerebellar cortex: ''Ncl. fastigii'' (''Ncl. medialis cerebelli''), ''Ncl. dentatus'' (''Ncl. lateralis cerebelli''), ''Ncl. emboliformis'' (''Ncl. interpositus anterior''), and the ''Ncl. globosus'' (''Ncl. interpositus posterior'').


Terminological comment:
 
''Pons'' and ''Cerebellum'' are occasionally referred to as the ''Metencephalon'' (not to be mistaken with ''Mesencephalon''). They develop from the same embryological structure, which is still apparent in adulthood given their close topographical position and their interconnection via two of the three cerebellar peduncles.

The term &quot;brain stem&quot; is a useful description of the topographical and functional triad composed of ''Medulla oblongata'', ''Pons'' and ''Metencephalon''. These three components arise from developmentally distinct regions in the embryo but they represent an anatomical and functional continuum. The brain stem houses all cranial nerve nuclei.

====Midbrain (''Mesencepalon'')====

The midbrain is interposed between the hind- and the forebrain. It displays the same basic functional composition as found in the spinal cord and the hindbrain. Ventral areas are dedicated to motor function and accommodate tracts that convey motor information from the ''Prosencephalon''. Dorsal regions of the midbrain are implicated in sensory information cicuits. The ''Mesencephalon'' can be further subdivided into three compartments, the ventral ''Basis'' or ''Pes mesencephali''. The ''Tectum mesencephali'' represents the dorsal roof of the midbrain. Interposed between both is the ''Tegmentum mesencephali''.
In the ''Mesencephalon'' nuclei of some cranial nerves, whose ventrodorsal positions in the midbrain match the functional motor-sensory axis of the brain stem and the spinal column.


==== Forebrain (''Prosencephalon'') ====

The forebrain is the evolutionary youngest part of the CNS. It consists of two components.

===== Diencephalon =====

Thalamus

Hypothalamus

===== Telencephalon =====

Cortex

Basal ganglia

== Peripheral nervous system (PNS) ==
PNS is an extent network of neurons that spreads the whole body and is out of bony structures - the skull (Cranium) and the vertebral canal (Canalis vertebralis).
This network consists of Somatic &amp; Autonomic ports based on functional compartmentalization. The Somatic part classifies in two groups.
=== Afferent division or sensory fibers  ===
They are Axons of the primary afferent neurons that transmit the signals of stimuli in the form of action potential to the central portions of sensory system that lie in the central nerve system. Body of these neurons lie in the peripheral ganglions and nuclei in the CNS.

=== Efferent division or motor fibers ===
They are axons of efferent neurons that conduct motor signals from central nerve system to peripheral organs; muscles... and create motions in the target sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Description needs cleanup (paring down, too). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 18:37, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

What sort of cleanup? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:11, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

As for the size, I wish the rest of the cookbook would be a bit more verbose about serving suggestions and descriptions. If this recipe sticks out, it's only because many recipe authors don't bother to even describe what the result will be like or how it might be served. Adding intro text to many of the other recipes would be wonderful. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:11, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I don't think the intro is too long, I think it is a bit scattered and the suggestion about pineapple juice belongs in a variations section. The writing style grates a bit as well as it is a little too informal (for my tastes anyway). My intention is to personally go through all the modules marked with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and do some cleanup. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:46, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

I understand reccomendations to serve this w/ rice, various meats, and veggies as they are all parts of the same dish, but does this really need a suggestion to drink a soda with the dinner? I guess you could say that it is similar to suggesting a wine, but a &quot;drink with any kind of corn-syrup sweetened beverage&quot; seems silly to me. Alternatively you might be trying to get at the point that this is for a ''casual'' dinner, but I think that can be done other ways. I also don't get the comment about &quot;picky eaters&quot; at all, as it seems totally subjective. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:01, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:I would suggest milk with cookies, muffins, or chocolate. I would suggest tomato juice or orange juice with scrambled eggs. I would suggest red grape juice with roast pork. (wine, if you want to kill brain cells) I would suggest soda with many things that are greasy and/or salty. (one might choose beer I suppose) I'd really insist if this were a recipe for pork rinds. :-) Eating pork rinds with milk would be '''very''' wrong. Well, this isn't pork rinds or even deep-fried, so I won't insist. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:58, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:I note that sauces have a problem. I could create a chicken recipe, &quot;chicken with teriyaki sauce&quot;, and a beef recipe and... I hope you see where I'm going with this. If sauces can't be in those categories, then we need to make lots of trivial recipes. That would be awful. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:58, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:: How about &quot;Chicken with teriyaki sauce&quot; (linked to this recipe for the sauce) with appropriate variations? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:08, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:As for picky eaters... well, the sauce doesn't have chunks in it. It doesn't have bits of onion, orange peel, and garlic. Maybe there should be a category for dishes that don't have poorly-identified bits floating in them. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:58, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:: I guess... I wasn't even sure what that term meant in this context. I know of people who don't like certain ingredients (tomatos, chocolate, etc) but never people who were adverse to finely chopped things. =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:08, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I just found the abandoned site about the [[Nervous system]] and tried to set up a logical and helpful way to explain the anatomical systematics of this challenging topic. I'd appreaciate if anyone feels up to comment on that.

I think the distinction between the functional and localizational aspect has to be made in order to get things right, especially the nomenclature that is always mixed up by people since they don't understand the difference between terms that describe function and terms that name positions.

I have started to insert both the English terms for anatomical structures but also added the Latin anatomical description in Italic according to the recent (Parisian) Nomina anatomica [http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/Nomina_Anatomica] and Terminologia anatomica from 1998. I would like to please every author who wants to contribute to attach to this system for two reasons. First, the english manner of anglifying medical terms generates a certain degree of misunderstanding as the plethora of medical phrases and descriptions contain some ambiguity. The nomina anatomica is the conventional language that anatomists use and that all medical personnel around the world should attach to. I know this is far from reality as english-speakers dominate the medical literature and they do not study, publicize and converse in proper Latin terms. Nevertheless, if WikiBooks aims to generate reliable textbooks at least the minimal standard for such project would be the use of the correct language. The second reason for using both forms lies in the fact that a minority - but a large one - from some European countries will be able to fluently read into the matter as they are trained to use the Latinized nomenclature. 

I have started to set up a preliminary division of chapters. I would suggest to everyone who would like to contribute to concentrate on four main sections for each structure as can be already seen in the [[Anatomical compartmentalization#Spinal_cord_(Medulla_spinalis)|spinal cord]] chapter: 

(1) Gross anatomy

(2) Microscopic anatomy

(3) Internal organization

(4) Function

Any suggestions?

Okay, that's it for the beginning. See you later.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Triton moon mosaic Voyager 2 (large).jpg|right|220px|Triton as seen from Voyager 2]]
'''Triton''' is the largest moon of the planet Neptune, and the seventh largest in the Solar System. The best view we have had of Triton was in 1989 when the Voyager 2 spacecraft passed close by Neptune.

==How big is Triton?==
Triton has an average size of 2700 km across, which is larger than Pluto and about the same size as Europa. The moon is about half the width of the United States.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface is icy and the temperature on the surface is bitterly cold. The southern half of the planet is covered by an ice cap. The moon does have a very thin atmosphere.

Triton is one of the few places in the Solar System where there are volcanoes. These are caused by the distant heat from the Sun. The volcanoes spew material from below the surface, mostly very cold dust and gas. These geysers are slowly reforming the surface, and have wiped out any craters.

==How long is a day on Triton?==
One day on Triton lasts for 5.877 days on Earth, around 5 days and 21 hours.

==How long is its orbit around Neptune?==
Triton takes 5.877 days to complete an orbit around Neptune, the same time as the length of one day. This means it always keeps the same side facing toward Neptune.

This moon unusual because of the direction of its orbit around Neptune. Normally a moon orbits in the same direction that the main planet rotates. However Triton has a ''retrograde'' orbit, which means it orbits in the opposite direction. It is the only large moon in the Solar System to have a retrograde orbit.

Because of this backward orbit, Triton is gradually being dragged closer and closer to Neptune. Millions of years from now it will come too close to the giant planet and break apart. When it does so, the debris will form a large ring around Neptune that is similar to the ring around Saturn.

==What is it made of?==
This moon is mostly made of rocky material with about a quarter made of ice. It is very similar to Pluto temperature wise, but it is more of an icy texture and composition.

==How much would Triton's gravity pull on me?==
If you were on Triton, it would pull you down with a force less than one-twelfth as strong as the force of Earth's gravity.

==Who is it named after?==
Triton was the son of Poseidon in Greek mythology. In Roman Mythology, Poseidon was called Neptune.

==How was it discovered?==
Triton was discovered by William Lassell in 1846, shortly after the planet Neptune was discovered. However the moon was named by Camille Flammarion in 1880. The name of this moon did not come into general use until the middle of the twentieth century.

==So Why Write a Book About iTunes?==
Apple Computer's iTunes software is a powerful yet elegant solution for managing a digital audio library. It allows users to gather music and other audio from a wide range of sources, provides them with the tools to organize libraries of tens&amp;mdash;or tens of thousands&amp;mdash;of songs, encourages mobility through tight integration with Apple's iPod music player, and helps the user bridge the gap between a computer and a home theater or stereo system through the Airport Express wireless base station.

Like all software that is feature-rich, it might be reasonably feared that learning how to use iTunes will be a long and complicated process. Fortunately iTunes is designed to interact with the user in a very intuitive way. Millions of iPod users get their first introduction to iTunes when they plug in a new iPod and their computer launches iTunes automatically. Whether you have an iPod or not, it is important to think about iTunes as a tool for working with audio files and not so much as an intimidating application with a long learning curve. You will also have this book as a guide which we hope will help immensely.

The iTunes interface also embodies the core design principles used in software development for Mac OS X. So if you are new to OS X or want to get a better handle on how to interact with Macs, then iTunes is a great place to start. Elements of its design are applied in Apple's iPhoto as well as dozens of third party applications. Many of the basic ideas and actions introduced in this book will be applicable in most well-designed programs for the Mac.

==What's This Book About?==
Now let's talk about this book. We will do our best to make sure that we describe all the concepts that we introduce in this book in plain language and will take time to explain in more detail the most critical ones. The authors of this book assume that the reader has a basic understanding of how to interact with a computer.

With that in mind, let's take a quick tour of this book.

#First, we need to make sure that iTunes is installed on your computer. We will review the basic steps of getting the iTunes software from Apple. Once we have the software, we will get it up and running on your computer.
#After iTunes is running, we will review what you see on the screen. We will give names to all parts of the interface and add details for the most important ones.
#iTunes really isn't a whole lot of fun without some music so the next section will be entirely devoted to acquiring music and other audio content. We will hit on such topics as Pod-Casting, Apple's Music Store, ripping CDs, internet radio, and a host of other ways to get interesting content into iTunes.
#Playing music in iTunes is relatively simple once you actually have music in it. There is a large round button provided for that purpose. This section will go beyond the play button and explore ways to tweak your iTunes experience. We will also touch on the broad variety of headphones and speakers available, as well as the Airport Express.
#One of iTune's primary strengths is its ability to deal with a truly enormous amount of music just as easily as a handful of songs. For this section we will discuss ways to keep track of your music, whether you need to catalog 50 or 50,000 songs. Topics covered will include playlists, searching, browsing, sorting, and storing music in multiple locations.
#By itself iTunes is an awesome product, but coupled with the iPod it reaches a different level entirely. We will apply many of the concepts we introduced in the section on organization to the iPod as well as point out many often overlooked features in iTunes for extending your iPod experience.
#Last but not least we will approach some advanced topics that don't fit particularly well in other parts of the book. In general, these are the sorts of things that you probably won't ever have to do but will be extraordinarily glad to know if you need to.

Then we are done. Good luck and have fun!

[[Image:Blender-yafray-render-lighter.png|375px|thumbnail|right|This is how your render will look if you use my example settings.]]How to import your SolidWorks model in Blender and render it using Yafray.

== Introduction ==
[[w:SolidWorks|SolidWorks]] is one of the main product design solid modellers. It has a built in render engine called PhotoWorks. With the release of PhotoWorks 2, rendering within SolidWorks has become more realistic and easier. In a lot of cases PhotoWorks will be the most convenient way to render your model, because you don't have to leave SolidWorks.
However, sometimes you will find the need to make renders that are more realistic (or even photo-realistic), and PhotoWorks is not sufficient anymore. This is when you might consider using an external program for rendering. In this how-to, I will describe how to do this using [[w:Blender_(software)|Blender]] with [[w:YafRay|YafRay]].

Both programs are open-source software, and you can download them for free:
*[http://www.blender.org Blender] (version 2.45)
*[http://www.yafray.org YafRay] (version 0.0.9)

If you use different versions (especially YafRay), you might have difficulties trying to follow this how-to.

You need a basic understanding of the Blender interface to be able to follow this how-to. If you have never worked with blender before, I advise you to read the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blender Interface|Blender Interface]] chapter of the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] wikibook first.

Another great option is to watch some video tutorials first. [http://www.ibiblio.org/bvidtute/contrib/interface.avi This one] about the interface is really helpful. There are very good other video tutorials as well at http://www.ibiblio.org/bvidtute/

== Exporting from SolidWorks ==
I will be working with a model of a lighter (Created by '''Marko M. Markovic''') that I downloaded from the [http://www.swugn.org/ SolidWorks Users Group Network (SWUGN)] at the bottom of the &quot;FREE SolidWorks models&quot; section.

Before you can import your model into Blender, you need to export it to the [[w:VRML|VRML 1.0]] format first.
In this how-to I will describe how to do this with an assembly, but it is essentially the same for a separate part.
[[Image:Solidworks-vrml-export-settings.png|200px|right|thumb|the export options window]]
* Open your assembly.
* If you don't want to export all the objects, suppress the objects you don't want to export first.
* The export quality (strangely enough) depends on the screen settings. To improve this, go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Document Properties tab &gt; Image Quality. If your model looks faceted in your viewport, just set the &quot;Shaded and draft quality HLR/HLV resolution&quot; to a higher value. Especially for complex shapes with a lot of curvature, you'll probably want a higher value. Take into account, however, that a higher value means a bigger file and slower operations within Blender.
* Go to File &gt; Save As...
* Select VRML as your file-type and click on the &quot;Options...&quot; button.
* Make sure &quot;VRML 1.0&quot; is selected. Usually you need to set the unit to something bigger than millimeters; normally centimeters will do, but for the bigger models I advice you to set the unit to meters. You'll be able to scale the model again once you're in Blender.
* uncheck &quot;save all components of the assembly into a single file&quot;

Because SolidWorks appears to be making a mess out of large assemblies (randomly combining several parts into one mesh), we'll export the assembly as separate files into one directory. To be able to load these files easily, you need to create a new directory for this export first. Later on, we'll import all the files in this directory at once (time saver), so make sure there's no other files in this directory!

* Close the &quot;Export Options&quot; window (click OK).
* Create a new directory for the export (or use an empty one), and hit &quot;Save&quot;.



== Creating an HDRI environment ==
Because the aim of this how-to is to get you started on photorealistic rendering, we will be using an [[w:HDRI|HDRI]] environment. HDRI stands for High Dynamic Range Imaging, and is basically a technique to use a picture of the environment to light your scene. This will result in very realistic and convincing shadows, highlights and reflections. This is very important for realistic emulation of chrome for example.


First of all, you'll need an HDR image. There is a whole range at http://debevec.org/Probes/ that you can download for free. I will use the [http://debevec.org/Probes/uffizi_probe.hdr Uffizi Gallery probe], but any other HDR image will do just fine.

Now start Blender. To apply the HDRI environment to your scene:
* Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
* In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;.
* Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
* Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
* Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.
* To be able to render using this environment, you need to enable YafRay. Press F10 and change the &quot;Blender Internal&quot; to &quot;YafRay&quot;.
* Go to the YafRay tab and deactivate the XML button and set Exp (the exposure control) to 1.5.
* Set the Raydepth to 6.
* In the YafRay GI tab, select &quot;Full&quot; as your method, and &quot;Low&quot; quality (that's good enough for a preview). Also enable the &quot;Cache&quot; button.
* Set both Depth and CDepth to 10.
* For [[w:Caustics|caustic]] effects you can activate the &quot;Photons&quot; button, but in my case (a lighter lying on a table), it won't make much difference.

== Assigning materials ==

[[Image:Blender-lighter-black-material.png|thumb|50px]]
=== Plastic ===
The first material we'll create will be plain plastic. We'll apply this material to the middle part, the gas regulator and the push button.
Whenever you're going to create a new material, think of it in terms of how much it should reflect, how much it diffuses light, how transparent it is etc. because these are your parameters within Blender's material editor.
To create the plastic material:

* Select the two middle parts, the push button and the gas regulator (use SHIFT + click to select more than one mesh at once).
* Go to the shading settings (F5) and add a new material (Click &quot;Add New&quot;).
* Press CTRL + L (in the viewport) and select Materials from the popup to use this material on all the objects you selected.
* Change the color to almost completely black (RGB: 0.07/0.07/0.07).
* In the Shader tab, set the specular shader to &quot;Blinn&quot;.
* Set the &quot;Spec&quot; value to 1.4 and &quot;Hard&quot; to 320.
* Press &quot;Ray Mirror&quot; in the Mirror Transp tab, and set the &quot;rayMir&quot; value to 0.3.{{clr}}

[[Image:Blender-lighter-green-transp-material.png|thumb|50px|right]]
=== Transparent plastic ===
For the fuel part, we'll assign a nice green transparent material.
* Select the fuel part, and add a new material to it (again, F5, &quot;Add New&quot;).
* Set the color to a bright green (HSV: 0.220/1.000/1.000) and the alpha value (A) to 0.300.
* Set the Amb value to 1.000.
* Go to the Mirror Transp tab and enable both &quot;Ray Mirror&quot; and &quot;Ray Transp&quot;.
* Set rayMir to 0.20 and IOR to 1.45 (which is an approximate [[w:List of indices of refraction|index of refraction]]).
* Set Filt to 0.250.{{clr}}

[[Image:Blender-lighter-chrome-material.png|thumb|50px|right]]

=== Chrome ===
The metal part needs to be nice &amp; shiny, so we'll make a chrome-like material for that.
* Set the Ref value to 1.000.
* Set the specular shader to &quot;Blinn&quot;, and use the following values: Spec 2.000, Hard 50 (default), Refr 6.500.
* In the Mirror Transp tab, enable &quot;Ray Mirror&quot; and set the rayMir value to 0.9. Leave the rest unchanged.{{clr}}

[[Image:Blender-lighter-ground-wood-texture.png|thumb|50px|right]]
=== Wood Texture ===
As stated before, to make it make the lighter more realistic, it needs a realistic environment. We already made part of this environment with the HDR-image, but to make it even more convincing, we're going to turn the ground-plane into a realistic looking table.
We need an image of wood to apply to the plane. I'll use one from [http://www.mayang.com/textures/Wood/html/Manufactured%20Wooden%20Items/index.html Mayang's Free Texture Library], called &quot;parallel wooden planks&quot;.

* Because this texture is 1600x1200, we'll scale the ground-plane to the same aspect-ratio - S, 1.6 (TAB), 1.2.
* Set the Ref value of the diffuse shader (Lambert) to 0.600.
* Set the Spec value to 0.175, Hard to 30.
* In the Texture tab, press &quot;Add New&quot;. Press F6 to switch to the texture properties.
* Change the Texture Type to &quot;Image&quot; and load your texture (in my case the wood texture from Mayang) in the Image tab (&quot;Load Image&quot;).{{clr}}

== Rendered with materials applied ==
To render, you can hit F12 directly, or you can go to the render settings first (F10). Because of the render settings we use (GI and an HDRI environment), my render took about 3 minutes on a AMD64 3200+ with 1GB of RAM. If you just want a preview, you can either make a smaller render (set it to 25% in the Render tab), or use worse quality GI settings. For a final render, I advice you to use at least High for the GI quality - it will take more time but the result will be better looking!

Below you can see the result I got with all the settings from this how-to. Remember that this is just a general guide, and I encourage you to change the settings (Exposure for example), to see the effect. You have to get a little bit of 'feeling' with the material settings to be able to create a satisfying material quickly. I hope this how-to helps to get started with a SW to Blender workflow.

'''note:''' if your result is very different from the picture below, please report this on the discussion page (the tab at the top of this page). That way we can keep improving the tutorial. You can upload the render as well, but make sure it has a specific name (lighter-yourname.jpg for example).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Formal definition ==

The commonly known 1D binary CA ''rule 110'' is defined as &lt;math&gt; \langle Z, S, N, f, B \rangle &lt;/math&gt; where
* &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; can be finite or infinite
* &lt;math&gt;S=\{ 0,1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of two values
* &lt;math&gt;N=\{ -1,0,1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is the neighborhood of size &lt;math&gt;k=3&lt;/math&gt; with symmetric radius &lt;math&gt;k_0=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the local transition function rule &lt;math&gt;r=110&lt;/math&gt;

== De Bruijn diagrams ==

=== Overlap ===

[[Image:cellular automata neighborhood overlapping rule 110.png|thumb|300px|right|Neighborhoods of adjacent cells overlapping]]

Neighborhoods of adjacent cells are overlapping for &lt;math&gt;k-1=2&lt;/math&gt; cells. There are &lt;math&gt;|S|^{k-1}=4&lt;/math&gt; different overlaps &lt;math&gt;{00,01,10,11}&lt;/math&gt; or written in compact form &lt;math&gt;{0,1,2,3}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Symbolic De Bruijn diagram ===

[[Image:cellular automata symbolic De Bruijn diagram rule 110.png|thumb|300px|right|Symbolic De Bruijn diagram for rule 110]]

The De Bruijn diagram has &lt;math&gt;|S|^{k-1}=4&lt;/math&gt; nodes (one for each of the possible overlaps) and &lt;math&gt;|S|^k=8&lt;/math&gt; links (one for each of the possible neighborhoods).

:&lt;math&gt; D=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdot &amp; \cdot \\
\cdot &amp; \cdot &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdot &amp; \cdot \\
\cdot &amp; \cdot &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== preimage matrix ===

There are two preimage matrices, one for each of the available cell states.

:&lt;math&gt; D(0)=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}

\qquad D(1)=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Boundary conditions ===

There are two commonly used backgrounds, the quiescent background and the ether.

==== Quiescent background ====

The quiescent background is an infinite sequence with period &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; of length  &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|=1&lt;/math&gt; cell.

There are always exactly two preimages for this background independently on the length of the sequence from a single cell to infinity (see the preimage network). The left and right boundary vectors are equal.

:&lt;math&gt; b_L = b_R = [1,0,0,1] &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata preimage network rule 110 quiescent background.png|Preimage network for rule 110 and the quiescent background configuration]]

==== Ether background ====

The ether background is an infinite sequence with period &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\overline{00010011011111}&lt;/math&gt; of length  &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|=14&lt;/math&gt; cells. This is the prevailing background emerging from a random initial configuration.

The number of preimages of the ether configuration increases exponentially with the sequence length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; going to infinity. A circular lattice is used to calculate the number of preimages of the period &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; p = p_c(\alpha)^{l/|\alpha|} = 2^{l/14} &lt;/math&gt;

Because of the exponential growth the boundary vector does not represent the number of preimages of the whole infinite background but only weights derived from the period's preimages. The value of the boundary vector depends on the position inside the period, in the next table vectors are columns for each of the 14 positions.

  overlaps | boundary vectors

== Reversing the direction of time ==

[[Image:cellular automata inverted global transition function.png|thumb|200px|right|Preimages of the present configuration depend on the inverse of the global transition function]]

The [[Cellular_Automata/Mathematical Model#Neighborhood, local transition function and rule|local transition function]] and the [[Cellular_Automata/Mathematical Model#Global transition function|global transition function]] define the evolution of cellular automata in the forward time direction. To calculate preimages from the present configuration, inverses of the forward mappings must be defined.

The preimages of a single cell &lt;math&gt;c_x^t&lt;/math&gt; are the ''locally valid [[Cellular_Automata/Mathematical Model#Neighborhood, local transition function and rule|neighborhoods]]'' &lt;math&gt;n_x^{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; defined by the inverse of the local transition function

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(c_x^t) = \{ n_x^{t-1} \in S^N \; | \; f(n_x^{t-1})=c_x^t \} &lt;/math&gt;

Preimages &lt;math&gt;C^{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; of a configuration &lt;math&gt;C^t&lt;/math&gt; are defined by the inverse of the global transition function

:&lt;math&gt; F^{-1}(C^t) = \{ C^{t-1} \in S^Z \; | \; f(C^{t-1})=C^t \} &lt;/math&gt;

Locally valid neighborhoods of adjacent cells must overlap correctly to become globally valid. De Bruijn diagrams describe how sequences can overlap an thus provide a method to calculate global inverses knowing the local inverse.

The number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preimages &lt;math&gt;C^{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; can vary from none to many, depending on the rule and the present configuration &lt;math&gt;C^t&lt;/math&gt;, arising questions about the injectivity, surjectivity and reversibility of the rule.

== De Bruijn diagrams ==

[[Image:cellular automata De Bruijn diagram.png|thumb|300px|right|The De Bruijn diagram]]

De Bruijn diagrams come from the theory describing shift registers. Its nodes are strings &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; of symbols over some alphabet, usually all strings of a fixed length. Its directed links describe how this strings overlap if one of them is shifted. Here only shifts of a single cell are described.

There is a link from a source node &lt;math&gt;w_s = a \alpha&lt;/math&gt; to a drain node &lt;math&gt;w_d = \beta b&lt;/math&gt; if string &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt; overlap with string &lt;math&gt;o_R&lt;/math&gt; shifted right by one symbol. This means that the overlapping source substring &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt; without the start symbol &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the overlapping drain substring &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;w_d&lt;/math&gt; without the end symbol &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;).

The topological matrix of the De Bruijn diagram is

:&lt;math&gt; d_{w_s w_d} =
\begin{cases}
1,  &amp;  \alpha = \beta \\
0,  &amp;  \alpha \neq \beta
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

For the diagram to be easier to read and use on cellular automata this book uses a diagram representation, where all the nodes are drawn twice. Nodes on the left are source points of links and nodes on the right are drain points of links. The direction of the links is chosen to point in the increasing direction of cell position indexes.

== Preimage diagrams and matrices ==

=== Overlapping of adjacent neighborhoods ===

[[Image:cellular automata neighborhood overlapping indexing.png|thumb|400px|right|The overlapping of adjacent neighborhoods (dark gray)]]

The overlap &lt;math&gt;o_i&lt;/math&gt; is the group cells from the overlapping neighborhoods of a pair of adjacent cells &lt;math&gt;c_x c_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;. The size of the overlapping &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; is one cell less than the size of the neighborhood.

:&lt;math&gt; o_x = c_{x+1-k_0} c_{x+2-k_0} \dots c_{x+k-k_0-1} &lt;/math&gt;

A compact representation of the overlap is a number with &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; digits base &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; o_x = \sum_{i=0}^{k-2}{c_{x+1-k_0+i} |S|^{k-2+i}} =
c_{x+1-k_0} |S|^{k-2} + c_{x+2-k_0} |S|^{k-2} + \dots + c_{x+k-k_0-1} |S|^0 &lt;/math&gt;

If a cell sequence &lt;math&gt;... c_{x-2} c_{x-1} c_x c_{x+1} c_{x+2} c_{x+3} ...&lt;/math&gt; is cut (or joined) into two parts between &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the neighborhood of the last cell in the left part &lt;math&gt;... c_{x-2} c_{x-1} c_x&lt;/math&gt; is overlapping with the neighborhood of the first cell on the right part &lt;math&gt;c_{x+1} c_{x+2} c_{x+3} ...&lt;/math&gt;. The overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; at the cut (or junction) is defined as above and is used to describe the boundaries of sequences.

=== Preimage matrix ===

[[Image:cellular automata preimage diagram.png|thumb|300px|right|The preimage diagram (described by the preimage matrix)]]

The first step to the preimage matrix is constructing a De Bruijn diagram representing preimages of a single cell in a cellular automaton. It's nodes are all &lt;math&gt;|S|^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; different overlaps of neighborhoods. The source nodes &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; are overlaps on the left side of the cell and the drain nodes &lt;math&gt;o_R&lt;/math&gt; are overlaps on the right side of the cell. The links represent neighborhoods &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and connect nodes &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;o_R&lt;/math&gt; according to the next two decompositions:
* the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n=c_L o_R&lt;/math&gt; is formed from the remaining left cell &lt;math&gt;c_L&lt;/math&gt; and the right overlap &lt;math&gt;o_R&lt;/math&gt; or
* the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n=o_L c_R&lt;/math&gt; is formed from the left overlap &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; and the remaining right cell &lt;math&gt;c_R&lt;/math&gt;

The topological matrix of the diagram is a square of &lt;math&gt;|S|^{k-1} \times |S|^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; elements.

:&lt;math&gt; D =
\left[ \begin{matrix}
d_{00} &amp; d_{01} &amp; \cdots \\
d_{10} &amp; d_{11} &amp; \cdots \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots
\end{matrix} \right]  &lt;/math&gt;

The value of an element is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; if there is a link between nodes &lt;math&gt;o_L o_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else.

:&lt;math&gt; d_{o_L o_R} =
\begin{cases}
1,  &amp;  o_L c_R =  c_L o_R = n \\
0,  &amp;  \mbox{else}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to form a ''symbolic De Bruijn matrix'', where elements are link labels. A link representing the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is labeled according to the output cell value &lt;math&gt;c=f(n)&lt;/math&gt; defined by the local transition function. Node pairs without a link can be labeled with a dot.

:&lt;math&gt; d_{o_L o_R} =
\begin{cases}
f(n),  &amp;  o_L c_R =  c_L o_R = n \\
.   ,  &amp;  \mbox{else}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The last step is to form ''preimage matrices'' &lt;math&gt;D(c)&lt;/math&gt; one for each of the &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; available cell states &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. There is a link between a pair of nodes &lt;math&gt;o_L o_R&lt;/math&gt; only if the relative neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leads to the desired cell value &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; d_{o_L o_R}(c) =
\begin{cases}
1,  &amp;  o_L c_R =  c_L o_R = n \wedge f(n)=c \\
0,  &amp;  \mbox{else}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The preimage matrix of a sequence ===

Before the definition of the preimage matrix can be extended to a sequence of cells &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the meaning of the matrix elements must be defined, so the definition can be checked against it.

Entries &lt;math&gt;d_{o_L o_R}&lt;/math&gt; in the matrix &lt;math&gt;D(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; represent the number of preimages of length &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|+k-1&lt;/math&gt; that begin with the left overlapping &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; and end with the right overlapping &lt;math&gt;o_R&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha^{t-1}=o_L\beta_R=\beta_L o_R  \;\wedge\;  F(\alpha^{t-1})=\alpha^t
\quad\Rightarrow\quad  |F^{-1}(\alpha^t)| = d_{o_L o_R}(\alpha^t) &lt;/math&gt;

The preimage matrix of a string of cells &lt;math&gt;\alpha = c_p c_{p+1} \dots c_q&lt;/math&gt; is the multiplied chain of single cell matrices

:&lt;math&gt; D(\alpha) = D(c_p c_{p+1} \dots c_q) = \prod_{x=p}^{q} D(c_x) = D(c_p) \cdot D(c_{p+1}) \cdots D(c_q) &lt;/math&gt;

The preimage matrix of an empty string &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an [[w:identity matrix|identity matrix]].

:&lt;math&gt; D(\varepsilon) = I &lt;/math&gt;

=== Preimage boundary conditions ===

[[Image:cellular automata preimage junction boundary.png|thumb|400px|right|The preimage junction or boundary]]

The ''preimage vector'' consists of &lt;math&gt;|S|^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; nonnegative integer entries, one for each of the possible neighborhood overlaps or nodes of the preimage diagram.

Elements &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; of the preimage vector &lt;math&gt;b_x&lt;/math&gt; count the preimages that contain an overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x=i&lt;/math&gt; of value &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the present cell sequence.

:&lt;math&gt; b_x = [p_0, p_1, \dots, p_{i-1}, p_{i}, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{|S|^{k-1}-1}] &lt;/math&gt;

The preimage vector is used to describe the boundary or more precisely it can describe the preimage count at one side of a junction of two strings.
* to describe the ''right boundary'' of the string &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \dots c_{x-1} c_x&lt;/math&gt; the ''right boundary vector'' &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt; is used, it counts preimages to the right from the junction
* to describe the ''left boundary'' of the string &lt;math&gt;\alpha = c_{x+1} c_{x+2} \dots&lt;/math&gt; the ''left boundary vector'' &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; is used, it counts preimages to the left from the junction

The ''unrestricted boundary'' is usually used to avoid any specific boundary. It is assumed that there is exactly one preimage for each overlap. All the entries in the vector are &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; b_u = [1,1,\dots,1]  \qquad  |b_u|=|S|^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Since there can be an infinite number of preimage for a ''semi-infinite sequence'', usually only periodic sequences are used, counting only preimages of the period &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; b_L = b_u D(\alpha) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; b_R = D(\alpha) b_u^T &lt;/math&gt;

Quiescent and ether backgrounds can be represented by periodic sequences.

The number of preimages &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (paths through the network) of a sequence &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with the left [[#boundary conditions|boundary condition]] &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; and the right [[#boundary conditions|boundary condition]] &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; p = b_L D(\alpha) b_R^T &lt;/math&gt;

The [[#boundary conditions|unrestricted boundary]] is commonly used and it counts all the preimages of a sequence &lt;math&gt;D(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; exactly ones. The number of preimages is simply the sum of all elements in the preimage matrix &lt;math&gt;D(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; p = b_u D(\alpha) b_u^T \,&lt;/math&gt;

==== Preimages of a cyclic string of cells ====

Since a string in a cyclic lattice must have the same overlapping at its left and right side, only elements on the diagonal of the De Bruijn matrix form valid preimages. The number of all preimages of a string &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of elements on the diagonal.

:&lt;math&gt; p = \sum_{i=0}^{|S|^{k-1}} d_{ii}(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;

==== Garden of eden ====

A ''garden of eden'' sequence does not have preimages. For finite strings on an infinite lattice this is true exactly when the De Bruijn matrix of the string is a [[wikipedia:zero matrix|zero matrix]] &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; (all elements are zero).

:&lt;math&gt; D(\alpha) = M_0  \Rightarrow  \alpha \in G&lt;/math&gt;

Any string which substring is a garden of eden is a garden of eden.

:&lt;math&gt; \forall \beta_L, \beta_R \; [ \alpha \in G  \Rightarrow  \beta_L \alpha \beta_R \in G ] &lt;/math&gt;

A garden of eden can be the consequence of the boundary conditions, both restricted of cyclic boundaries.

{{example|[[Cellular Automata/Examples on Rule 110#Garden of Eden sequences|Garden of eden sequences in rule 110]]}}

== Proofs ==

=== Proof of the preimage matrix equation for sequences ===

The proof of the formula on sequences is an induction on the length of the string.
;Base (&lt;math&gt;l=0,1&lt;/math&gt;)
:If the length of the string is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; than there is no shift and nodes are linked only to themselves.
:For the string of length &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; the meaning of the single cell preimage matrix elements is evident from the [[#preimage matrix|definition]].
;Induction
:&lt;math&gt; D(\alpha a) = D(\alpha)D(a) \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Requirements==
*A computer that can run or programs written for [[w:Windows 2000|Windows 2000 SP4]] or [[w:Windows XP|Windows XP]]. This usually means either a computer running Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP or later versions; however, iTunes is usable in Linux using [[w:CrossOver Office|CrossOver Office]].
*Hard disk space to store data (around 1MB per minute of audio is a good guide.)
*Many features such as Internet radio, pod-casting, and the music store require an Internet connection.
*This book covers features of iTunes which require additional hardware, such as an [[w:iPod|iPod]] or [[w:AirPort|AirPort]] network.

==Where To Get iTunes==
*Apple provides free downloads of the latest iTunes software [http://www.apple.com/itunes/download here].

==Installing iTunes==
You will need to be logged in as an administrator to install iTunes.
**Download
**#In a web browser follow this link to download the latest [http://www.apple.com/itunes/download iTunes software installer].
**#If you intend to use an iPod with this computer you should download the latest [http://www.apple.com/ipod/download iPod software installer].
**#If your web browser allows you to open files from it you can do so. Otherwise you need to locate the installer(s) on your computer and run them. If you have downloaded the iPod software is generally better to run the iTunes installer first.
**#During the iTunes installation you will be asked a few questions. In general the default settings are sufficient and they can be changed later if necessary.
**CD (Warning: The software on an iPod's CD is only as new as the iPod. If your iPod is more than a couple months old it is generally better to install from downloaded files).
**#Insert the CD that came with your iPod into your computer's optical drive.
**#The CD Contains a combined iPod and iTunes installer that will generally run automatically when you insert the CD. If it does not, go to My Computer then double click on your CD or DVD drives icon. Next double click on the iPod installer.
**#During the installation you will be asked a few questions. In general the default settings are sufficient and they can be changed later if necessary.
==Did It Work?==
Just to make sure the installer actually worked you should try these steps.
*#Click on the Start Menu
*#Click on All Programs
*#Choose iTunes in the listing. Then chose iTunes again in the next menu.
*#You will be asked to agree to the iTunes license agreement.
*#You will be asked a few questions about how iTunes should operate. It is usually not necessary to make any changes.
*#After you answer the questions you should see a large window with metallic edges labeled iTunes.
*#You did it! iTunes is now on your system and ready to use.

Now that all the technical stuff is out of the way we are ready to have some fun.

{{Prerequisite|Calculus}}
{{Reading level|Advanced}}

This book is going to serve as an introduction to the field of astrodynamics, especially from a practical, engineering perspective. We will focus our attention on man-made satellites, and the dynamics of orbiting such satellites around the earth, the moon, and other &quot;local&quot; objects. We will look at practical applications, such as earth-orbits, lunar and inter-planetary trajectories, ballistic missiles, and interstellar escape trajectories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Metaphor ==
Go is a game of territory. Two players alternate turns, each placing one stone on the board in an attempt to surround as much territory as possible.  Groups of stones can be captured when they are completely surrounded by enemy stones. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the game is about surrounding territory, not capturing prisoners.

== Learning from Go ==
Lots of people see lots of different things in go.  Some see a war game where each stone is a little soldier, and the best general wins.  Others see a more peaceful trading game, where each player makes compromises on what part of the board they want.  I have heard that one of the more traditional views was that the board represented the earth, and the black and white stones are night and day fighting over the earth for all the days of the year (361~=365). Some people even view the board as economics, where stones are businesses and the board is unreached markets.

These variations in what people see also determine what they can learn from it.  From being a better general, a better negotiator, to being more at peace with the world.

== Player Rankings ==
There are three rank scales. The low scale is called &quot;kyu&quot;. Kyu ranking numbers decrease with increased ability, so 30 kyu (sometimes abbreviated as 30k) is the weakest and 1k (&quot;first kyu&quot;) is the strongest. The middle scale are the amateur dan levels starting at 1d and going to 7d. The high scale are &quot;professional dan&quot; rankings. 1 dan (&quot;first dan&quot;) is the rank above 1 kyu (however, a professional 1 dan is typically strong enough to be a rank up from an amateur 7 dan), then 2 dan, and so forth up to 9 dan. Professional ranks also follow the dan scale, but they are denoted 1p-9p to indicate that they are separate from amateur ranks. In Korea &quot;gup&quot; is used in place of kyu. The scale is 18 gup to 1 gup.

Ranking is simply a convenient way to set handicap. This allows players of different strength to have an interesting game despite their disparity in skill. A general guideline is that the player taking black (the weaker player) receives one handicap stone per difference in rank with the white (stronger) player. Placing handicap stones is black's first move.

Several ranking tests are available online; one such test is on [http://www.motorscope.com/dojo/tests/ this site.]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategy for Raw Beginners (30 kyu - 21 kyu) ==
Just relax; it's only a game and you're only a beginner.  Don't worry about winning or if you're not improving fast enough.  Your game is an extension of your personality and emotion at the time of each move.  Tensing up will only cause you to lose even when you don't have to.

If you aren't having fun then there is no point in playing. The more you let yourself enjoy the game the better you will become.

Rule Number 0:
Play LOTS of games.  Play during every waking moment that you can.  Try to play people stronger than you.  They will defeat you, but they ''should'' teach you, and show you how to become better as well.  Play computer programs. They will defeat you, but they are always ready to play (you can find them by just looking online).  Books do exist for the absolute beginner (Such as Learn to Play Go by Janice Kim), though their use is rudimentary.  Get a better feel for the game, then go after the theory.

Rule Number 1:
The best thing that you can do at this stage is play and lose the first 50 games as fast as possible.  Play a move within 5-10 secs and see what happens.  Should you stop and try to think about every move, stronger opponents will become frustrated and decline to play with you in the future.  Think of it from their perspective: they wait and wait for you to play, and then they see a flaw in your play very quickly and play, only to wait some more.  As you play more games in this manner, your intuition, ability to read ahead quickly, and ability to recognize threats will all improve very quickly.  As an added bonus, stronger players will agree to play you more often and will show you new shortcuts and situations, helping you to improve even faster.

Rule Number 2:
Territory comes first.  If one of your stones is in atari, the best move might be to ignore it and aim for that tasty side dish.  This is not always the case as individual stones can be important, but your intuition on this will improve as you play more games.  It might be the case that you're trading the 1 point of territory and 1 prisoner for a 20-40 point side.

Rule Number 3:
Do not be afraid to take risks.  You don't understand the game enough at this point to say, &quot;that is overextending myself&quot;.  Just drop a stone in there and see how it fares.  Do try to avoid doing so when you know that one of your bigger groups is in mortal peril.

== Basic Strategy (20 kyu - 11 kyu) ==
Congratulations.  You have reached a point that 50% of the people I've introduced to the game never reach.  Rules no longer exist, merely ideas.  This is the point where most people feel like an idiot because they are finally glimpsing the extent of the game.  Stick to it and make it on to the next level.

Idea Number 1:
At this point, you should begin your thought into the workings of the game.
Try to avoid making the same mistakes more than twice.  Don't stress if you do, just note it, and try to avoid it again.  Begin to look at influence and how individual stones affect the area around them.  Take a look at joseki, but don't take them as stone tablets.  Play with them a bit, it'll help you understand why they were formed that way.  Ask questions, and try to understand the answers.

Idea Number 2:
Watch stronger people play.  Many of the moves will confuse you.  Aim for about 5 kyu ranks above you.  That way the entire game won't blow over your head, but it will stretch your mind.  Try to understand why they moved on from a fight, or why an &quot;obvious&quot; move wasn't played.  Understand that these people are probably wrong about a lot of things, but they can take you to school and are worth listening to.

Idea Number 3:
Tsumego: go problems of varying difficulty; they can be found online or in books.  Start trying to solve them.  They will vastly increase your fighting capability.  Do not however take more than 60 seconds trying to solve them.  If this is the case, they are too hard.

Idea Number 4:
Read ahead and have some idea about how your move will affect the board.  You should be reading about 4 moves ahead easily as a 20 kyu, and &gt;8 moves ahead as an 11 kyu.  Keep in mind Rule Number 1 from the 30k-20k range, and keep it short, but do look for the best move.  You may be wrong, but just looking will help you improve.

Idea Number 5:
Do not be afraid of moving in a different area of the board than the last move.  There are many times when you need to do so, but watch for when your moves just aren't worth that much.  When you see yourself fighting to gain tiny amounts, go and claim another section of the board.

== Strategy for Variants ==
=== Phantom Go ===
Beware that an illegal move can be a suicide one. Playing next to an illegal move often lets you decide whether it was because there already was a stone, or because it was suicide.

Play strong connected goups. You don't know that you're attacked until some stones are captured. Be sure that almost every stone will be discovered sooner or later by your opponent (and you're not told which one he discovers). The more previsibly you play, the earlier your stones are discovered.

There is no influence. What looks as a territory (such as a wall on the third line) might in fact be invaded (by a wall on the second line).

Divide and conquer is a viable strategy.

Kill while you still can.

=== All-white ===
This is a game where both players are the same color.  It's significantly easier than blind Go as you have a reminder of each move.  Don't think that this is easy though.  If your attention slips, it's very difficult to regain where all of the moves are.

The key is to remember the patterns.  You don't need to memorize each piece in a corner if you can remember that all of the moves fall under a certain joseki.  Just keep running your eyes over the entire board reminding yourself of who all of the pieces belong to.

===Level===
A class level describes how much previous knowledge is needed.  Courses build off knowledge gained in the previous level.  

===Prereq===
A prereq is a course that is assumed to be taken and understood before you take this one.  Knowledge from a prereq is used heavily throughout a class.  Prereqs are always from previous levels, but not all classes from a previous level are prereqs.


==Level 1==

Into to programming (taught in multiple languages-  C version, Java, C++, etc.  Course structure should be replicated between courses with language specific stuff changed)

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

== Naming convention ==
Each chapter or page in a book must start with the name of the book followed by a slash:
* &lt;tt&gt;Book_Title/Page_name&lt;/tt&gt;.

Books and pages may use either title- or sentence casing. The [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] recommends title casing for book titles to prevent clashes between title- and [[Wikibooks:Categories#Subjects|subject-categories]].

See [[Help:Editing#Subpage links]] for more on sub-pages.

== Non-compliant books ==
Some books don't use slashes to designate sub-pages.  If you come across a book with pages that don't comply with this policy, please rename them (use the ''move'' tab at the top).  If for some reason you are not able to move pages, add {{tl|fix title}} to the top of the book.  (Users must be [[mw:Project:Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed]] to move pages, and only [[Wikibooks:administrators|administrators]] can move pages over existing pages.)  You can also specify what to rename pages to by adding {{tlx|rename|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[new_page_name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} to the top of pages to be renamed.

Moving of a whole batch of pages is best done by a [[Wikibooks:Bots|bot]] (e.g. when sub-pages have been delimited with a different character; the colon was a popular choice before this policy came into effect).  Adding {{tl|fix title}} to the top of the title page should be enough for a bot operator to eventually come along and take care of it (or an enthusiastic Wikibookian &amp;mdash; feel free to count yourself as one).  Alternatively, contact an active bot operator.

== See also ==

==Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion==
{{Wikipedia|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}

;First Law:The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the foci of that ellipse.
;Second Law:The line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time.
;Third Law:The square of the planet's period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the sun.

As we remember from algebra, an ellipse is a conic section formed from two foci, where the sum of the distances from the ellipse to each focus is equal. The sun is at one focus, and the other focus is an imaginary point in space. 

This picture is an orbit in the form of an ellipse with the sun at one of the foci. We call the focus that contains the central body the ''prime focus'', and the other focus, which has no physical significance as the ''secondary focus''.

[[Image:Kepler1.gif|center]]

This picture is a demonstration of Kepler's second law:

[[Image:Kepler2.gif|center]]

As we can see, for the line joining the planet (dashed lines) to sweep out triangular sections of equal areas, it must move slower as the planet gets further from the sun. When the planet is closer to the sun, it must be traveling faster in order to sweep out equal areas in equal time.

For a similar example, consider a bouncing ball. The ball is moving slowest at the top of its arc, and continues to gain speed as it travels downward towards the earth. As the earth moves away from the sun, gravity decelerates the planet. When the planet is moving towards the sun, gravity is accelerating the planet.

Kepler's third law can be easily illustrated by comparing the average distances of solar system bodies and their orbital periods to Earth's. Expressed in astronomical units and years the orbital period is the semi-major axis raised to 3/2 power.

== Newton's Laws of Motion==

{{Wikipedia|Newton's laws of motion}}

;First Law (Law of Inertia):A body in motion tends to remain in motion in the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force. A body at rest tends to remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force.
;Second Law (Law of Force):The rate of change of the speed of an object, its acceleration, is proportional to the force applied on that object, and occurs in the same direction as that force.
;Third Law: To every action there is always an equal but opposite reaction.

The second law is typically written by the equation ''F = ma'', where ''a'' is the acceleration of the object, ''m'' is the mass of the object, and ''F'' is the amount of force applied. However, the second law also stipulates that the acceleration has a direction associated with it, and that direction is the same as the direction of the applied force. We must re-write this equation using vectors to account for the direction of the force and the acceleration. We can write this instead as '''F'''''= m'''''a''', where '''F''' is the vector for force, and '''a''' is the vector for acceleration. We will not define specifically what items these vectors contain, because as we will see shortly, it is very much dependant on the problem.

In space, there is never a single force acting on an object, gravitational pulls from all objects in the universe play some role. However, because the force that gravity exerts on an object decreases with distance, objects that are very far away produce negligible force, and can typically be ignored. However, consider a situation of a satellite orbiting around the earth: that satellite is being affected by gravity from the earth, from the moon, and to a lesser extent from the sun. We can sum these forces together to produce a more general form of the second law:

{{eqn|Newton's Second Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sum \bold{F} = m \bold{a}&lt;/math&gt;

The third law also produces an interesting result, and one that is going to shape many calculations. In space travel there are two types of motion: powered and un-powered. In a powered device, such as a rocket, for the body to be &quot;pushed&quot; forward, it must push something backward with equal force. In the case of a rocket, burnt fuel is pushed out the back of the rocket, in order to move the body of the rocket forward. As a result of the third law, any powered space craft will have ''non-constant mass'', which will introduce additional complexity into our calculations. If we have two bodies, 1 and 2, and they are pushing against each other, we can say that the force exerted by body 1 on body 2 is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, from the force exerted by body 2 on body 1. In other words, we can say:

{{eqn|Newton's Third Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_{12} = -\bold{F}_{21}&lt;/math&gt;

We will use these laws throughout the book.

== Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation ==

{{Wikipedia|Gravitation}}

Newton's law of gravity is another common law, and one that is of prime importance in the study of astrodynamics. Stated in its most simple form, the law of gravity is:
{{-}}
{{eqn|Law of Universal Gravitation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_g = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}\hat{\bold{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the law of gravity is directional, that is that the force of gravity works to pull two bodies together, along the straight line between them. The image below shows two bodies, ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' being attracted to each other through the force of gravity acting along the line between their centers of gravity:

[[Image:Orbital Equations Figure 1.png|center]]

The force acting on ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is denoted as '''''F'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the force acting on ''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is denoted as '''''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;''. We know from Newton's third law of motion that the two forces must be equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_{12} = -\bold{F}_{21}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the direction of the force is important, we vectorize the law of universal gravitation equation as well:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{F}_g = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \frac{\bold{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''r''' is the distance vector between the two bodies, and ''r'' is the scalar distance between the two. '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the force vector of gravity.

=== Gravitational Constant ===

{{Wikipedia|Gravitational constant}}

The big ''G''' is called the '''gravitational constant'''. It is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt; G = 6.67428  \times 10^{-11} \ \mbox{m}^3 \ \mbox{kg}^{-1} \ \mbox{s}^{-2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Men are infinitely complex. Yes, they may be partly governed by certain primitive urges, but they are also capable of the height of feeling that produced Byron and Pushkin, the immensity of genius that characterised Einstein and Bohr, and the generosity of spirit that became Gandhi and Booth.

Been dumped recently? Only know grief from men in Your life? Don't despair for while such transgression is true for many men most of the time, and all men some of the time, there is another side to the other half.
 
==Know your Target==
Men have a number of general tendencies that it is important to be aware of. Following these pieces of advice will help:
* '''Be yourself.''' On pragmatic and moral grounds there is no basis for insincerity.  You are who you are because you govern your life.
* '''Contain yourself.''' This however does not mean that you need to reveal or lay out on a plate everything that you sense or think or feel or believe. Keep some things back. A certain tentative restraint in a woman is frighteningly attractive.
* '''Relax.''' Remember that if it doesn't work it doesn't work.  Have fun, and remember, the process takes time for a reason.  Look beyond the tree and wait for the forest to come into view.  You have as much time as you make it, to decide for sure if anything is permant.
* '''But now DO SOMETHING.''' If there are no guys where you are, go or wait patiently. If there is a guy, spend time around him. Let him know somehow. If there is more than one guy in your life, decide on one.
* '''Let him know.'''  Use your own judgement.  Think to yourself, &quot;What if...&quot;  Well?
* '''Offer ideas and input when suggested''' If you want to do something, don't expect him to have all the answers.  Don't assume too much in this area.  If you really need to size up the situation, it'll be clear the more you interact and get to know each other.  If you have something you like to do, offer it. (See Relax)
* '''Don't miss the blindingly obvious.'''
* '''Say &quot;yes&quot;.''' Maybe it will come out of the clear blue sky, or maybe you've been waiting for years, but when he asks you out, then remember to say &quot;yes&quot;. 
* The massive secret: '''Don't be put off.''' Sometimes men just don't see it. Sometimes there are other things happening in their life. Sometimes there might be a relationship that he had not intended to get entangled up, or maybe he simply hadn't met you yet. Often, in the present author's experience, the girl walked away just as she had began to be properly appreciated. Patience is a necessary virtue and against any setback it is important not to be put off.

==Don't==
; Burn the bridge
: Things may not be right/work out until later, much later.  You can't see far enough down the road to know for sure.  At any rate, the bad blood you instill ends up hurting you just as much in the long run.

==Proposal to Remove Grandfathering Provision==

I think that with the new naming convention being in place for over two years now it no longer makes sense to have some of our old books under the old naming convention.  I think for consistentency it would be better for the project to have all books under the same system.  I would like to open a proposal to remove this clause from the naming policy and invite comments from the community.

Just as a bit of background I removed this clause back in July and following objections from David Carey have now restored my change and am formally proposing it here.  Our discussion on the subject can be seen above.  As I have said to David I do not want to reopen a debate about which naming convention is the better, that discussion has been had already and I don't think we need to spend any more time on it.  What I am proposing is having adopted the slash convention as our choice we should now bring all books under the same convention.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 06:47, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Emblem-fun.svg|15px]] '''I agree because''' consistency is important, and dependency on it has grown both in the mediawiki software and within Wikibooks. I also believe dependency on the slash convention will only continue to grow. Having read David Carey's comments, I believe &quot;[[WB:NOTPAPER|Wikibooks is not paper]]&quot; is relevant, however maybe we could be trying to encourage the mediawiki developers to either make the DISPLAYTITLE magic word more flexible or add a new magic word to allow changing the displayed heading title completely so the displayed name can be different from the page name without having any side effects. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:39, 10 September 2008 (UTC)
*We've already had a discussion on the merits of the various naming conventions. Now that we have a decision, consistency is certainly useful, an will likely be needed in the future for software feature requests such as [[mw:Extension:AllBooks]]. What we are currently discussing is the grandfathering provision. Given that this policy has been in effect for a long time, I see absolutely no reason that the provision should remain. Any books still lingering should be updated as they are found regardless of age; the provision should be removed. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:49, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

::: I don't think it can handle books which use &quot;:&quot; as a normal character while also using &quot;/&quot; as part of the naming convention. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:14, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
:::: You may be right. However, the documentation for [[mw:Extension:AllBooks]] says &quot;This extension will list all books in a Wikibooks wiki when using two of the most common naming schemes: &lt;code&gt;Book/Chapter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Book:Chapter&lt;/code&gt;.&quot; --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:01, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
*'''Agree'''. Massing page move can be done using bots. It would be great having the same naming policy on all Wikibooks projects, this would help developing tools and extensions working on books. --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 12:47, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
*'''Agree'''.  The benefits (kinetic and potential) clearly outweigh any disadvantages. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:41, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
* '''Disagree'''. Wikibooks is not Wikipedia ([[WB:NOTWP]]). ''&quot;Unlike wikipedia or wiktionary — which are essentially very large books with a single manual of style — the individual wikibooks found on Wikibooks can be written in vastly different styles, according to what best suits the topic and the preference of the authors.&quot; -- [[WB:LMOS]]''. Jomegat alludes to &quot;clear kinetic and potential benefits&quot; -- could someone please spell them out (or link to some previous discussion about them)? I agree that the nifty &quot;automatic backlink at the top of the page&quot; is one good reason for using the slash style, but that alone is not enough to mandate using it for every book.  --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:25, 12 September 2008 (UTC)
*: For example, sysop can move a book and automatically move all subpages of the book; more over, lot of book-related tools need a clear naming policy to work on books (i.e. [[mw:Extension:AllBooks]] has problems due the different naming policies used on various wikibooks). More over the manual of style talks about capitalization of titles, categories or so on; following the naming convention has some advantages, and no disvantages. The problem is not the preference of t he author or what best suits the topic, but the software and the organization of books :-). --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 07:20, 12 September 2008 (UTC)
*:: I agree that mw:Extension:AllBooks has problems with some kinds of book organization. How is that is relevant to this discussion about banning the &quot;colon naming convention&quot;, which as far as I can tell is *not* a problem for [[mw:Extension:AllBooks]]? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:04, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
* '''comment''' Rather than &quot;reopen a debate&quot;, may I ask for a link to that debate, a link to where &quot;We've already had a discussion&quot;? Years ago, there was a consensus vote to keep the colons for some books ([[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Naming policy]]). Having made that decision, why change now? Has there been some more recent &quot;debate&quot; and &quot;discussion&quot; of which I remain blissfully ignorant? If consensus truly has changed, then that's fine. But when proponents of one option claim that the consensus supports banning all other options, while the only evidence I see (admittedly years out of date) shows that the consensus preferred some sort of compromise -- those claims rub me the wrong way. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:04, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
*: David, as I have said above there is no new discussion to link to.  This is it.  The reason we feel that consesus supports the slash option is that for two and a half years every new book on this project has been created under the slash convention.  This means that for anyone who has joined the project in that time (which includes myself) the slash convention is the only convention we have ever known.  So &quot;on the ground&quot; the colon naming convention has gone.  Further in all the time I have been working on the project and through all the books I have moved onto the new convention this is the first comment that I have seen from anyone on the colon/slash debate.  I feel the colon naming convention is part of wikibooks history and it is now time to move forward with one convention, not two. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:00, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

I feel I should point out that indignation about policy evolving over time without exhaustive debate and straw polls etc is a bit silly. Policy is what we do - sometimes it is written down, and sometimes it is up-to-date. In the past two years the community has gradually grown accustomed to the slash convention, as well as to changing books which don't use that convention. Changing the policy is long overdue and shouldn't be hindered without good reason, which I have yet to see here. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:37, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

I think it should also be pointed out that despite the grandfather clause people have moved old books using the &quot;:&quot; convention to the &quot;/&quot; naming convention without it becoming an issues until now. This suggest that people want old books to use the same naming convention even though the books are not required to. What this means is that there are probably only a few books left now that this clause could apply to. Of course I and others involved in this discussion might be the only ones who've made these moves. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:09, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

Some authors prefer the &quot;&lt;code&gt;Book:Chapter&lt;/code&gt;&quot; colon convention, and have already listed what I consider &quot;good reasons&quot; ([[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy#Disadvantage with the slash]], [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Naming policy#Disadvantages]], [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy/Archive 2#Problems with forcing article titles to be computer filenames]]).
Changing the policy to support those authors is long overdue, and shouldn't be hindered without good reason, which I have yet to see here.

I think it should be pointed out that, even though some people think that &quot;The colon convention could potentially interfere with the creation of new wiki projects, and new namespaces.&quot;, the evidence is 2 to 0 in the opposite direction.
The Cookbook namespace was created from pages with titles that began with &quot;Cookbook:&quot;.
Then the Wikijunior namespace was created from pages like &quot;[[Wikijunior:New Title Policy]]&quot;.

:David, you seem to be straying back towards attacking the slash convention again, which is what I meant when I said I didn't want to reopen that debate.  You talk about users who like the colon convention, if these users exist then why have they not proposed a change to the policy to allow both conventions?  At the moment do they only work on old books where they can use colons? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:54, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
:Despite any past issues concerning the use of the slash convention, consensus was that the slash convention should be used for any new books. Most of the past issues seemed to be concerned about publishing books in print form despite that [[WB:NOTPAPER|Wikibooks is not paper]]. Changes to reflect the medium used is not uncommon from what I have seen. The creation of the two namespaces did cause problems, behind the scenes the developers had to correct the entries for all pages in the two namespace because namespaces are referred to by id, rather than part of the page title in order to become accessible again, similar problems existed when Wikiversity was made a interwiki prefix, pages beginning with Wikiversity: had to be renamed in order to become accessible again. Many solutions have been found and proposed for working around any perceived disadvantages to the slash convention. More technical problems exist with the colon convention because of its internal uses within the mediawiki software than is caused by using the slash convention. Can we get back on track as AdRiley suggested, as to whether to remove the Grandfather clause or not. I don't think any consensus on allowing the colon convention in new books is going to happen. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:25, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

:: The naming policy -- from the time it was first made policy in 2006 until today (except for 9 July 2008 - 10 September 2008) -- already does allow both conventions, at least for pre-existing books.

Then the [[Wikijunior]] namespace was created from pages like &quot;[[Wikijunior:New Title Policy]]&quot;. Also the [http://www.wikiversity.org/ Wikiversity sister project] was created from pages with titles that began with &quot;Wikiversity:&quot;. Darklama, earlier on this section of this page, said that there were &quot;problems&quot; during this process, and I am inclined to believe him.
: Total: 2 namespaces and a sister project were created from wikibooks that used a colon.

== Page casing ==
''See also the earlier page casing discussion at [[Wikibooks talk:Manual of Style#title casing]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 12:43, 24 August 2009 (UTC)''

The page [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Naming_policy|oldid=1433568}} currently] states that both book and page titles must use title casing. While I see many benefits in a consistent casing scheme for book titles, I feel we should leave sub-page casing up to contributors to individual books. Looking through the archives, I could find no discussion that demonstrates any sort of community consensus on this particular issue (though I did not read the entire archives).

Unless someone sees a solid argument for a Wikibooks wide policy on sub-page title casing, I'll give this a rewrite soon. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:56, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

: I know I'm guilty of moving books to title casing, but really now that I take a look, I can't find where it mentions title casing at all in this policy. Perhaps we are both thinking of [[WB:MOS]] where it mentions title casing and sentence casing, and how title casing is preferred. IOWs title casing seems to be a community standard assumed to be policy, but which isn't. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:32, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

:: In fact, the MOS doesn't even say that title casing is preferred, it says that some people prefer title casing while others prefer sentence casing.

:: I ''think'' the one MOS section that mentions casing is a section about book titles.  It does seem, though, to be trying to say more than it actually does say:  it says to &quot;be consistent for books you are editing&quot;.  This might be construed to mean that the page titles within a book should follow the same convention as the title of that book, but that's not the only thing it might mean.  It could also mean that if the main title of a book uses title casing, then a subtitle for the book should also use title casing &amp;mdash; and after using title case for the book title one could then use sentence casing for the chapters and sections of the book.  In my own non-wikibooks writing I prefer to use sentence casing for section titles, chapter titles, and even paper titles, reserving title casing for book titles.

:: BTW, we're using &amp;mdash; deliberately, at least on my part &amp;mdash; sentence casing in the [[Conlang]] book (though I see one error, at a glance, and of course the book title is noncommittal since it's only one word).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:41, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

::: Wow, I guess I misread this. Anyway, it seems this could be clearer. I'll leave a note on this.
::: As for the consistency recommendation, I've always understood it as just whatever combination of title/sentence casing for the various parts (title, sub-pages, sections, etc.) which the book contributors want. Personally, I prefer title casing for titles, and sentence casing for everything else. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:01, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

:::Title casing for a book's title, as it states on the main page that this talk page corresponds to, avoids conflicts in the category names books use and category names subjects use.  See [[Wikibooks:Categories]] for a definition of the terms. What you as an editor do with the subpages is up to you. Just be consistent throughout the book. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:20, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

== Misleading / confusing ==

The whole &quot;slash&quot; policy is misleading, as it is listed in the welcome message left on my user page. I'm contributing to the Cookbook, which still uses the &quot;colon&quot; style. No mention of that is made here, but probably should be. Otherwise, the entire cookbook needs to be converted, which seems silly.&amp;mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&amp;nbsp;1]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|&lt;sup&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/sup&gt;]] 06:51, 31 August 2012 (UTC)
:You are confusing two things. &quot;Cookbook&quot; (and Wikijunior) is a different namespace so the colon is part of referencing the namespace not part of the book structure. For example, [[Castles of England/Norman Castles]] is really &quot;mainspace:Castles of England/Norman Castles&quot;. You don't see &quot;mainspace:&quot; because in effect mainspace has a null name. However, in the Cookbook and Wikijunior you need to specify the namespace - an example is [[Wikijunior:World War II/Blitzkrieg]]. If I moved this Wikijunior book into the mainspace it would appear as &quot;World War II/Blitzkrieg&quot;, in line with the naming policy. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:13, 31 August 2012 (UTC)
::As the title for this section reads, yes, it's confusing. I don't understand the difference between a namespace and a book title, apparently. Isn't &quot;Cookbook&quot; the title of the book? If so, shouldn't chapters be &quot;Cookbook/Acorn Squash&quot;, not &quot;Cookbook:Acorn Squash&quot;? There is some discussion above about the Cookbook and Wikijunior being converted to namespaces from the colon titling scheme, but again, it's all confusing. If I'm just reading the policy in the welcome message, and assuming that the title of the book I'm contributing to is &quot;Cookbook&quot;, then I read it as saying that my contributions should be titled &quot;Cookbook/Acorn Squash&quot;. Sorry if I'm being a pain, but it ''is'' confusing! Thanks.&amp;mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&amp;nbsp;1]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|&lt;sup&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/sup&gt;]] 04:35, 1 September 2012 (UTC)

::: Part of your confusion may be because namespaces are a ''software'' grouping of pages, while books are a ''logical'' grouping of pages.

::: The wiki software identifies each page in the wiki by a namespace, a colon, and a pagename.  There are &quot;magic words&quot; for extracting these parts:  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NAMESPACE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the wiki markup of a page expands to the name of the namespace, and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the wiki markup expands to the pagename.  For example, this talk page is in namespace {{nowrap|&quot;{{NAMESPACE}}&quot;}}, and its pagename is {{nowrap|&quot;{{PAGENAME}}&quot;}}.  One of the namespaces of the wiki is referred to (by people) as the mainspace; its namespace name is actually the empty string, and you can omit the colon between the (empty) namespace name and the pagename.  You ''could'' refer to, say, the main page of the ''Using Wikibooks'' book as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Using Wikibooks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, thus: {{nowrap|[[:Using Wikibooks]]}}.

::: The software also supports grouping together all the pages in a single namespace whose pagenames all consist of the same prefix followed by a slash and then some other stuff.  For example, here are all the pages in Wikijunior space whose pagenames begin with &quot;Solar System&quot; and then a slash: [[Special:PrefixIndex/Wikijunior:Solar System/]].

::: Books are logical groupings of pages, which are meant to be ''understood by readers'' as a coherent whole.  Usually, the name of a book consists of namespace, colon, and pagename without slashes in it.  Subpages of the book then have the book name followed by a slash and some other stuff.  This is taking advantage of the groupings provided by the software.

::: Just to complicate things further, there was one book so sprawling that we have given it its own namespace, and ''everything'' in that namespace is part of that one book:  Cookbook.  So the entire Cookbook namespace is a single book, while the Wikijunior namespace is a bunch of separate books.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:51, 1 September 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Go is a learning game.  You learn something every time you sit down to play, and every player has a truly unlimited potential to learn more.  The emphasis on learning is part of what makes the game enjoyable.  There is no question that go is a competitive game, but when players respect each other enough to appreciate what they have to learn from one another and the game they play, there is a cooperation of learning which enriches the experience.  Because go is also a philosophical game, lessons learned on the [[Go/Glossary_of_terms#Goban|goban]] often apply to other areas of life.  Attributes such as open-mindedness, flexibility, humility, honesty, and respect are truly important and helpful to your go game, and just as beneficial to life in general.  Improving your go game is satisfying and enjoyable in its own right, but as you learn you should also be on the outlook for larger life lessons that just happen to be illustrated in stones.

As enjoyable as it is, there are parts of learning go that can be challenging, even frustrating.  Many novice players have had the experience of playing their first games with an enthusiastic, more experienced friend, and hopelessly losing every game.  Because there is so much to learn in go, and because those lessons learned can immediately and dramatically affect the quality of one's play, even modest gradiations in skill (particularly for novices) can be insurmountable hurdles.  The [[Go/Basic Rules and Foundational concepts#Handicaps|handicap system]] helps to some extent, but does have its limitations.

The purpose of this chapter is to give guidance to the beginning player on how to progress -- what sorts of games to play, what to study, what to focus on learning at what stage, etc.

The standard board for playing go has 19 by 19 intersection points, but may not be good for the real first-timers. Both the complexity and the duration of the game would make it hardly enjoyable. That is the reason why smaller boards are preferred for learning and tutoring. The traditional way is to start with a board of 9 by 9 for the first couple of games. After getting some experience and learning the basics of go tactic the player may step on the slightly larger board, 13 by 13. Here one can learn the most simple elements of the go strategy. A good number of games should be played on this board, too. 

'''Games on the 9X9 board'''

This is smallest board which used for teaching the real beginners traditionally. Combined with the proper amount of handicap the game will be enjoyable for both players. Games are relatively short, and both the size and complexity can be overviewed by the unexperienced players. The players are fighting each other very quickly, so this board is very good to teach go tactics. 

'''Games on the 13X13 board'''

The medium sized board increases the complexity, but not too much. Having learnt some elements of the tactics we are ready to start with the basic elements of the go strategy. 

'''Games on the 19X19 board'''

The full complexity and beauty of the game waits for us. The starting point of a long learning curve.

The reader at this moment may ask how many games should one play on the smaller boards to learn and develop at the optimal rate. Though it is a very important issue, the answer is not straitghtforward. It depends on one's dedication to learn, on the fighting spirit and on the amount of time we are ready to use for playing go. The clear sign that one reached the appropriate strength to step a level higher is the ease and proficiency of using the basic tactics and strategies. A good tutor will see it. It's a good idea to have somebody teaching us the game.

== Problem? ==

Is this guide out of date or something, cause when I put in &quot;print raw_input 'What is your name?'&quot; in my Python3.0 command line, it returns a syntax error.
: Yes, somewhat. It has a note saying that in Python 3.x, you need to use &quot;input&quot; instead of &quot;raw_input&quot;. I'm having a problem with EOFError instead of syntax error. It mentions that it happens if it terminates prematurely, but I don't know how to not make it end prematurely?

==Introduction==



==Spacecraft Orientation==
[[File:Spacecraft_Orientation.svg|thumb|Spacecraft orientation]]
To change your orbit in space, you must first determine what direction your spacecraft is pointing. The &quot;forward direction,&quot; or the direction in which you are moving, is usually labeled &quot;Prograde.&quot; The opposite direction is usually labeled &quot;Retrograde.&quot;

==Hohmann transfer==
A Hohmann transfer is a transfer between two coplanar orbits with two burns. In a two-body system, it is almost always the most efficient transfer between two circular orbits in terms of &amp;Delta;V.

[[Image:Hohmann transfer orbit.png]]


Orbital transfers can be &quot;Near Hohmann,&quot; meaning that they are still efficient, but not the ''most'' efficient. An example of a near Hohmann transfer orbit would be the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter transfer orbit.


[[Image:MRO Transfer Orbit.jpg|400px]]

==Spiral transfer==
Low thrust spiral transfers are used when a low thrust engine such as an ion thruster or a solar sail is available. Such thrusters continuously add &amp;Delta;V and require more total &amp;Delta;V than Hohmann transfers.

==Orbit Plane changes==
Orbital plane changes are conducted at a point between the current and desired orbital planes called a node, which is where the current orbit intersects the line of intersection of the two planes, or the &quot;Line of Nodes.&quot; There are two nodes at which this can take place, which can be either ascending or descending, depending on the direction from which they are approached. To change the plane on a descending node, you orient your spacecraft properly so that the thrust is propelling you in a direction referred to as &quot;Orbit Normal.&quot; Your orbital plane will then start to align itself with the desired plane. To correct the plane at an ascending node, simply orient your spacecraft in the opposite direction, or &quot;Orbit Anti-normal.&quot;

==Orbit Synchronization==
For a spacecraft to dock with a space station, it must first synchronize its orbit with the station, or, in other words, &quot;Hone in&quot; on the station.  This is done by executing prograde or retrograde burns to change the orbital period of the spacecraft, so that it begins to &quot;catch up&quot; to the station. When the station is within the desired range, another burn is executed to zero out the spacecraft's velocity relative to the station. After the relative velocity has been reduced to near zero, docking maneuvers are conducted.

This book intends to provide an introduction to jet propulsion at the undergraduate level. 

A jet engine is an air-breathing internal combustion engine often used to propel high-speed aircraft. Jet engines, like rocket engines, use the reaction principle in that they accelerate a mass in one direction and, from Newton's third law of motion, experience thrust in the opposite direction. However, jet engines use air to burn fuel while rocket engines use stored oxidizer. Air-breathing provides higher performance in terms of thrust per unit of propellant and allows the highest endurance. Jet engines hold the current aircraft records for non-refueled distance (26,389.3 miles in 76 hours 45 minutes [[wikipedia:Virgin_Atlantic_GlobalFlyer|GlobalFlyer]]).

Frank Whittle received a British patent for the jet engine in 1930 and Hans von Ohain received a German patent in 1935. The first jet aircraft was the Heinkel He178 flown in 1939 with a von Ohain engine producing 4.9kN of thrust.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Jet Propulsion/Axial compressors|Axial Compressors]]==

{{wikipedia|axial compressor}}

In axial compressors the fluid flows mainly parallel to the rotation axis. They are widely used in [[Jet Propulsion/Gas turbines|gas turbines]]. Axial flow compressors have large mass flow capacity and high efficiencies, but have a smaller pressure rise per stage than centrifugal compressors. Most commercial jet engines used in transport employ axial compressors. Smaller engines such as those used in helicopters use [[Jet Propulsion/Centrifugal compressors|centrifugal compressors]] which provide larger pressure ratios.

Axial compressors can achieve pressure ratios of about 2 per stage, limited by the blade velocity and diffusion capability. With aspirated blades providing better boundary layer control much higher pressure ratios can be achieved.

Axial compressors have higher mass flow per frontal area, and this is a major advantage for jet aircraft.

==[[Jet Propulsion/Centrifugal compressors|Centrifugal Compressors]]==

Although the inlet flow to a centrifugal compressor is more or less axial, the rotor exit flow is in a radial direction. Downstream of the rotor, a diffuser slows the flow down to recover static pressure. The diffuser also normally restores the flow to a more axial direction  
, ready for the next process (e.g. another centrifugal compressor or reverse flow combustor).

Although high stage pressure ratios (more than 10:1) are achievable, rotor stress considerations significantly limit the stage pressure ratio that can be used when the overall pressure ratio is high (e.g 30:1). 

Nowadays, centrifugal compressors are less commonly used in jet aircraft. Their prime applications are in small turbojets/turbofans and turboprop/turboshaft engines, where the simplicity, compactness, lower weight and lower cost are needed.

In small size axial compressor, the aerofoils on the rear stages are not very rugged, because they are too thin (a bit like razor blades). Consequently a centrifugal compressor is often used as the rear stage on a small compressor. Common configurations are axial-centrifugal or, at really small sizes, double centrifugal (i.e. two centrifugal compressors in series). At small sizes, centrifugal compressors are more efficient than the equivalent axial units.      

Their very design limits their use. They are only used in small engines because of the fact that they're made of a relatively heavy piece of metal that spins at very high speed (30'000 RPM and more). That creates an extreme centrifugal force. Today's materials cannot endure the force that would be generated by a compressor of more than three to five feet in diameter.

One disadvantage of an centrifugal compressor is the relatively large overall diameter across the diffuser unit, which can pose installation problems. 

==[[Jet Propulsion/Diagonal or mixed flow compressors|Diagonal or Mixed Flow Compressors]]==

As the name might suggest, a diagonal (or mixed) flow compressor is a cross between an axial and centrifugal compressor, where the flow takes a diagonal route through the compressor, exiting diagonally (rather than radially) at a significantly higher higher mean radius than at inlet. The compression process is part axial and part centrifugal. 

So far, only a few examples of these units have been tested worldwide. They do, however, offer the advantage of a relatively high pressure ratio per stage, without the need for a relatively large diameter exit diffuser, which can cause installation problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Axial compressors are [[../Compressors|compressors]] in which the fluid flows mainly parallel to the rotation axis. They are widely used in [[Jet Propulsion/Gas turbines|gas turbines]]. Axial flow compressors have large mass flow capacity and high efficiencies, but have a smaller pressure rise per stage than centrifugal compressors. Most commercial jet engines used in transport employ axial compressors. Smaller engines such as those used in helicopters use [[../Centrifugal compressors|centrifugal compressors]] which provide larger pressure ratios.

A typical axial compressor has a [[../Rotor|rotor]] which looks like a fan with contoured blades followed by a stationary set of blades, called a [[../Stator|stator]]. Some designs also have inlet guide vanes.

== Energy Exchange between rotor and fluid ==

The relative motion of the blades relative to the fluid adds velocity or pressure or both to the fluid as it passes through the rotor. The fluid velocity is increased through the rotor, and the stator converts kinetic energy to pressure energy. Some diffusion also occurs in the rotor in most practical designs. 

The increase in velocity of the fluid is primarily in the tangential direction ([[../Swirl|swirl]]) and the stator removes this angular momentum.

The pressure rise results in a [[../Glossary/Stagnation temperature|stagnation temperature]] rise. For a given geometry the temperature rise depends on the square of the tangential [[../Mach number/]] of the rotor row. Current [[../Turbofan|turbofan]] engines have fans that operate at Mach 1.7 or more, and require significant containment and noise suppression structures to reduce blade loss damage and noise.


==[[../Velocity diagrams|Velocity Diagrams]]==
The blade rows are designed at the first level using velocity diagrams. The velocity diagram shows the relative velocities of the blade rows and the fluid.

The axial flow through the compressor is kept as close as possible to Mach 1 to maximize the thrust for a given compressor size. The tangential Mach number determines the attainable pressure rise.

The blade rows turn the flow through and angle ß and larger turning allows a higher temperature ratio, but requires higher [[../Solidity|solidity]].

Modern blades rows have lower aspect ratios and higher solidity.

== Compressor maps ==
A compressor map shows the performance of a compressor and allows determination of optimal operating conditions. It shows the mass flow along the horizontal axis, typically as a percentage of the design mass flow rate, or in actual units. The pressure rise is indicated on the vertical axis as a ratio between inlet and exit stagnation pressures.

A surge or stall line identifies the boundary to the left of which the compressor performance rapidly degrades and identifies the maximum pressure ratio that can be achieved for a given mass flow. Contours of efficiency are drawn as well as performance lines for operation at particular rotational speeds

== Axial Compressor Blading ==

== Supersonic blading ==

== Compressor efficiency ==
Compressor efficiency defines the performance of the machine. isothermal, adiabatic, and volumetric efficiency are referred for the performance of compressor.

== Stage performance parameters ==

Corrected speed

Corrected mass flow

== Multi stage compressors ==

Multistaging is done to reduce the total work input required for pressurization. This is achieved by facilitating intercoolers between stages of compression, intended to bring done the operating temperatures close to isothermal compression.

== Compression stability == 
Operating efficiency is highest close to the stall line. If the downstream pressure is increased beyond the maximum possible the compressor will stall and become unstable. 

Typically the instability will be at the Helmholtz frequency of the system, taking the downstream plenum into account.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Multibody Notation}}

Angular velocity is a vector which describes the rotation rate of a [[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|reference frame]] relative to another reference frame.

Typically the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (omega) is used exclusively to represent angular velocities (and many authors also use &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;).  In this text the angular velocity of frame &quot;B&quot; relative to &quot;A&quot; is denoted as
    &lt;math&gt;{}^A\vec{\omega}^B&lt;/math&gt;.

The angular velocity vector is defined such that any vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt; which is fixed (constant) in the local frame &quot;B&quot; ([[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|reference frame]]) has its time derivative in another frame &quot;A&quot; expressed with a [[Multibody Mechanics/Vector Operations|cross product]] as
    &lt;math&gt;\frac{{}^Ad}{dt}\vec{\zeta} = {}^A\vec{\omega}^B \times \vec{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;.

This relationship is not difficult to prove, however doing so is of little practical use and is deferred to the end of this discussion.  It is useful to note that since vectors can be expressed as linear combinations of [[Multibody Mechanics/Basis Vectors|basis vectors]], this relationship finds its way into of the expression for a the [[Multibody Mechanics/Vector Operations|derivative of a general vector]] (including angular velocity itself).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In fluid dynamics, a streamline is a line which is everywhere tangent to the velocity of the flow.
This implies that if '''u''' is the velocity vector at a point and '''dr''' is the vector in the direction of the streamline, then their cross product is zero.

'''u''' x '''dr''' = 0.

This  translates to,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{u} = \frac{dy}{v} = \frac{dz}{w} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' = u'''i''' + v'''j'''+ w'''k'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ratio of [[turbofan]] bypass mass flow to the [[engine core]] mass flow in a [[turbofan]] engine.

As the name suggests, this is the ratio of the air which bypasses the engine core and flows round the outside of the engine and exits via the nozzle. In a modern, high bypass ratio engine, bypass ratios can be as high as 85%.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Limestone is one form of carbon sink.  It is generated as ocean organisms generated micorscopic shells which collect on the bottom.  As the ocean get more carbon dioxide mixed in it, rather than oxygen, then it tends to re-dissolve the limestone back into carbon dioxide and dissolved calcium.

* Soil humus and peat is another form of carbon sink.  Though it has been noted that in some types of warmer climate conditions soil humus is broken down faster than it forms.

== Bathing ==

Bathing is an important part of the overall grooming process.

Brushing is often recommended before bathing, to remove dead skin and loose hair. Human shampoos are generally not recommended, due to pH differences between humans and dogs.

Here are some general steps:

*Rinse the dog completely.
*Apply the shampoo on dog's back. Lather well. Repeat for belly, legs and tail.
**Short-haired dogs can be scrubbed in a circular pattern. It may be easier to wash medium-length haired with a back-and-forth motion; longer-haired dogs in the direction of hair growth.
**A washcloth can be used to wash the dog's sensitive head and face.
*Rinse again, holding the water with one hand as you work out the soap with another.
*Run your hand all along the dog to remove excess water. Squeeze longer hair to remove excess water.
*Towel-dry. Use a hair dryer on longer haired dogs, but use a very low heat setting because of the sensitivity of the dog's skin to heat.

Many use an indoor tub for dog bathing. For many home owners this can be burdensome, especially with large dogs. If you have an outside dog, chances are they may be particularly more dirty than an inside dog. Getting your large, dirty dog inside can be difficult and messy. You can always wash your dog outside with a water hose. It is important to be conscious of the outside temperature and the temperature of your outside faucet water.

It may be useful to purchase an elevated dog bath tub that brings the dog up to the level of the human, not vice versa. The ability to wash your dog without bending down or getting on your knees is not only convenient, but less stressful on your body. Many tubs also have straps to hold your dog inside the tub and prevent them from slipping and hurting themselves. A simple search for [http://www.google.com/search?q=dog+bath+tub dog bath tub] will reveal many providers of quality tubs especially for bathing your dog. They can also substitute for a grooming table.

:I'm about the only one reliably active on there these days, alas, as PNWRaven seems to be working elsewhere in the Wikiverse... and I've changed direction on it a little bit, as we were not really adding value (IMHO) by simply being encyclopedic; I'm now putting more effort into highlighting the things that make the writing so captivating. As much as I can, anyway, I'm am engineer in real life. Other than that, I'm doing well, haven't let Panic drive me away yet &amp;lt;grin&amp;gt;... still keeping busy.

= Formal Semantics =

English syntax for 'Dogs bark' specifies that it consists of a plural noun followed by an intransitive verb.  English semantics for 'Dogs bark' specify its meaning, namely that dogs bark.

In [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/The Sentential Language|The Sentential Language]], we gave an informal description of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We also gave a [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax|Formal Syntax]].  However, at this point our language is just a toy, a collection of symbols we can string together like beads on a necklace.  We do have rules for how those symbols are to be ordered.  But at this point those might as well be aesthetic rules.  The difference between well-formed formulae and ill-formed expressions is not yet any more significant that the difference between pretty and ugly necklaces.  In order for our language to have any meaning, to be usable in saying things, we need a formal semantics.

Any given formal language can be paired with any of a number of competing semantic rule sets.  The semantics we define here is the usual one for modern logic.  However, alternative semantic rule-sets have been proposed.  Alternative semantic rule-sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; have included (but are certainly not limited to) [[w:Intuitionistic logic | intuitionistic logics]], [[w:Relevance logic |relevance logics]], [[w:Non-monotonic logic | non-monotonic logics]], and [[w:Multi-valued logic | multi-valued logics]].

== Formal semantics ==

The formal semantics for a formal language such as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; goes in two parts.

* Rules for specifying an interpretation.  An ''interpretation'' assigns semantic values to the non-logical symbols of a formal syntax.  The semantics for a formal language will specify what range of values can be assigned to which class of non-logical symbols.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has only one class of non-logical symbols, so the rule here is particularly simple.  An interpretation for a sentential language is a ''valuation'', namely an assignment of truth values to sentence letters. In predicate logic, we will encounter interpretations that include other elements in addition to a valuation.

* Rules for assigning semantic values to larger expressions of the language.  For sentential logic, these rules assign a truth value to larger formulae based on truth values assigned to smaller formulae.  For more complex syntaxes (such as for predicate logic), values are assigned in a more complex fashion.

An ''extended valuation'' assigns truth values to the molecular formulae of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (or similar sentential language) based on a valuation.  A valuation for sentence letters is extended by a set of rules to cover all formulae.

== Valuations ==

We can give a (partial) valuation &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P_0}\ :\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P_1}\ :\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P_2}\ :\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P_3}\ :\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(Remember that we are abbreviating our sentence letters by omitting superscripts.)

Usually, we are only interested in the truth values of a few sentence letters.  The truth values assigned to other sentence letters can be random.

Given this valuation, we say:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[\mathrm{P_0}]\ =\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[\mathrm{P_1}]\ =\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[\mathrm{P_2}]\ =\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[\mathrm{P_3}]\ =\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, we can define a valuation as a function taking sentence letters as its arguments and truth values as its values (hence the name 'truth value').
Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; does not have a fixed interpretation or valuation for sentence letters.  Rather, we specify interpretations for temporary use.

== Extended valuations ==

An extended interpretation generates the truth values of longer sentences given an interpretation.  For sentential logic, an interpretation is a valuation, so an extended interpretation is an extended valuation.  We define an extension &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of valuation &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as follows.


: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{i.} \quad \mbox{For}\ \pi\ \mbox{a sentence letter,}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\pi] = \mathfrak{v}[\pi].\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii.} \quad \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\lnot\varphi]\ =\ \begin{cases}\mbox{True} &amp; \mbox{if}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\varphi] = \mbox{False}; \\ \mbox{False} &amp; \mbox{otherwise (i.e., if}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\varphi] = \mbox{True).}\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{iii.} \quad \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[(\varphi \and \psi)]\ =\ \begin{cases}\mbox{True} &amp; \mbox{if}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\varphi] = \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\psi] = \mbox{True}; \\ \mbox{False} &amp; \mbox{otherwise}.\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{iv.} \quad \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[(\varphi \or \psi)]\ =\ \begin{cases}\mbox{True} &amp; \mbox{if}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\varphi] = \mbox{True}\ \mbox{or}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\psi] = \mbox{True}\ \mbox{(or both)}; \\ \mbox{False} &amp; \mbox{otherwise}.\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{v.} \quad \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)]\ =\ \begin{cases}\mbox{True} &amp; \mbox{if}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\varphi] = \mbox{False}\ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\psi] = \mbox{True}\ \ \mbox{(or both)}; \\ \mbox{False} &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{vi.} \quad \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)]\ =\ \begin{cases} \mbox{True} &amp; \mbox{if}\ \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\varphi] = \overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\psi]; \\ \mbox{False} &amp; \mbox{otherwise}.\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

We will determine the truth value of this example sentence given two valuations.
: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


First, consider the following valuation:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\ :\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\ :\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\ :\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By clause (i):
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{P}]\ =\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{Q}]\ =\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{R}]\ =\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By (1) and clause (iii),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}]\ =\ \mbox{True}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By (1) and clause (iv),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}]\ =\ \mbox{True}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(5)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By (4) and clause (v),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})]\ =\ \mbox{False}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(6)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By (3), (5) and clause (v),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})]\ =\ \mbox{False}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus (1) is false in our interpretation.


Next, try the valuation:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\ :\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\ :\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\ :\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(7) By clause (i):
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{P}]\ =\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{Q}]\ =\ \mbox{False}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{R}]\ =\ \mbox{True}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(8) By (7) and clause (iii),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}]\ =\ \mbox{False}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(9) By (7) and clause (iv),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}]\ =\ \mbox{True}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(10) By (9) and clause (v),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})]\ =\ \mbox{False}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

(11) By (8), (10) and clause (v),
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})]\ =\ \mbox{True}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus (1) is true in this second interpretation.  Note that we did a bit more work this time than necessary.  By clause (v), (8) is sufficient for the truth of (1).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A velocity diagram for a [[blade row]] describes the velocity changes of the fluid as it passes through the row. 

The blade velocity is shown in blue. The incident flow shown in green is axial and the relative velocity to the blades is shown by vector addition of the blade and fluid velocities. The blade turns the flow through an angle but leaves the axial velocity unchanged, resulting in a higher total velocity. Subtracting the blade velocity from the exit relative velocity shown in orange gives the exit actual velocity. 

This blade row then causes an increase in fluid velocity and an increase in energy, hence it is a compressor rotor. For a turbine rotor the situation at the exit and entrance would be reversed and energy would be extracted from the fluid by the blade row.

For stators the blade velocity is zero, and hence no energy is added or subtracted from the fluid under ideal conditions.

'''Mother-In-Law's Milk''', or '''Latte di Suocera'''

La Suocera is as proverbial in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]] as she is anywhere else, and Italians (especially daughters-in-law) have come up with all sorts of ways to keep them content; one of the most popular items in candy stands at fairs is ''addormenta suocere'', candied nuts that supposedly send mothers-in-law off into a deep sleep (my mother-in-law simply enjoys them). Those who like to make liqueurs at home can also try this milk.

It will be a nice after dinner drink -- so nice I'd probably drink more than I gave my Suocera -- and will also work very well over vanilla ice cream.

==Ingredients==

* 1 1/8 pounds (500 g, or 2 1/8 cups) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 pint (568 ml) whole [[cookbook:milk|milk]]
* 1 pint (568 ml) grain [[cookbook:alcohol|alcohol]]
* grated zest of an organically grown [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]]
* 1/2 [[cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] bean, split lengthwise

==Procedure==
#Combine all the ingredients in a wide-mouthed jar, screw the lid on tightly, 
#give them a good shake, and 
#put the jar in a dark place. 
#Shake it once a day for 8 days, and then 
#filter it and bottle it. 
#Stopper the bottle, put it in a cool dark place, and let it rest for a month before you open it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Titania''' is the largest moon of the planet Uranus. The closest view we have of this moon came in 1986 when the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by Uranus.

==How big is Titania?==
This moon is 1,578 km wide (981 miles). Titania is less than half the size of the Earth's moon. The total surface of this moon is only a little larger than the area of Australia.

==What is the surface like?==
[[File:Titania (moon) color cropped.jpg|thumb|left|A picture of titania taken by a spaceship in 1986]]
The surface of Titania is barren and there is no atmosphere. The ground on the surface is covered by dirty ice that has been mixed with rock. There are many craters which are formed when a rock from space collides with the moon, leaving a bright white patch surrounding the hole. Near the top of this moon is a large crater that has a double ring.

There are also long valleys on the surface that were formed when the interior heated up and expanded. This left what are called ''rift''s in the surface. The longest of these valleys runs for a distance of about 1,000 km.

==How long is a day on Titania?==
It takes 8.71 Earth days for Titania to complete one full rotation. That is about 8 days and 17 hours.

==How long is its orbit around Uranus?==
Titania completes one full orbit around Uranus each day. That is an orbit takes 9991 Earth days to finish. This means that Titania always keeps the same side facing toward Uranus. This is very similar to how our Moon always keeps the same side facing the Earth.

==What is it made of?==
Nearly half of the moon is made of  frozen water. The rest is rock and a mixture of frozen gas.

==How much would Titania's gravity pull on me?==

'''Newtons''' describe how hard gravity is pulling you down.  On Earth, if you weigh 51 kilograms or 112 pounds, your weight is 500 newtons. We only use newtons for some special purposes, when we are really interested in how hard we push down on something because gravity is pulling us.

Your weight in newtons would be less on Titania, only about one twenty-sixth of what it is on Earth.  To find your weight in newtons as you stand on Titania, just take your weight on Earth, and if that weight is in kilograms, multiply it by 3/8.  If that weight is in pounds, divide it by 6 to get newtons.  But then you'll have to add in the weight of your spacesuit as well, because that is pressing down on the surface just like you are.

==Who is it named after?==
The English poet and play author William Shakespeare once wrote a play called a ''Midsummer-Night's Dream''. In this play there was a mythical woman named Titania who was the wife of Oberon and was also the Queen of the Faeries. Uranus also has a moon called Oberon which was named after Titania's husband.

The name of this moon is similar to Saturn's moon Titan. However Titan was named after a race of giants from Greek mythology.

==How was it discovered?==
This moon was discovered in 1787 by the English astronomer Sir William Herschel. This man also discovered Uranus and its moon Oberon. The name for this moon was suggested by Sir Herschel's son, John Herschel, in 1852.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stubborn Difficulties==
===&quot;I think I'm ugly&quot;===
In as much as there is an objective element to attractiveness, this may well be the case. Remember, however, these five important principles:
* There is a very large ''subjective'' element to attractiveness as well.
* Physical attractiveness is not the only aspect of you that a guy cares about.
* Goodness beautifies a person. A joyful countenance, an upbeat and outgoing personality, and a mind or heart that are genuinely engaged or concerned with or about other things and people, will make you more attractive.
* Take care of your appearance. Make the best of what you've got. Perhaps you aren't [[w:Sophie Marceau|Sophie Marceau]], but by being disciplined in 'doing the basics' (washing, brushing and deodourising), you can make an improvement.
* Bide your time. Strange though it may seem, and contrary to the popular contemporary media, women often get more attractive with age.

===&quot;No one would approve&quot;===
If your society, friends or family won't approve then the following advice might help:
*'''Decide on the morality of your move.''' If you are offending some higher law, then suffer in silence and wait another spring.
*'''Grasp the thorn.''' Let those that disapprove know first. Don't go behind folks backs. Don't ask for advice if you're not prepared for it.
*'''Listen to them.''' Maybe he is a waste of time, abusive or capricious. Does their point of view ring true?
*'''Cool off.''' Sometimes family approval just ''takes time''. Are you prepared to outwait those who object? Are you prepared to take the time to see what truth there is in their opinions.
*'''Make your position clear.''' Stand your ground. Your beloved, if he is true, will hurt as much as you do; but be prepared for the consequences. See [[en:w:Romeo and Julliet]]! 
*And if he really means all that to you: '''elope.'''

===&quot;He just doesn't notice me&quot;===
*This isn't necessarily true.  He might be as nervous as you are.
*Also, he might have a reason not to notice you (is he in a relationship?)

===&quot;There is no way to just spend time together&quot;===

===&quot;He won't commit&quot;===

==Procedure==
#Place all the above ingredients, other than the heart, in a bowl and mix thoroughly.
#Clean the heart, removing all fat. Cut into bite size cubes. Place the heart pieces into the marinade mixture and leave to marinate for about 10 hours or overnight. The heart should be completely covered.
#After marinating, insert meat on skewers. At this stage if desired , some additional ingredients such as green pepper or red pepper (capsicum) or corn-on-cob (cut to a similar size to the heart, may be also inserted on the skewers.)  
#The skewered heart should then be cooked on a barbecue grill, turning frequently and brushing with the marinade mix. When they are well done they should be served immediately.

==Description / variations==

Anticuchos, is one of the most popular dishes in Peru. It is often sold by street vendors and accompanied by corn-on-the-cob and portions of cold boiled potato with a spot of chili sauce. Those whose tastes do not extend to trying beef heart may substitute any good cut of red meat, though this is not the authentic Peruvian style.

== What is a linear first order equation? ==

A linear first order equation is an equation in the form

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The simpliest case of which is shown below in Example 1 where &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(x)&lt;/math&gt; are not functions but simple constants. Linear first order equations are important because they show up frequently in nature and physics, and can be solved by a fairly straight forward method. 

We first begin by motivating the method.  First recall that the product rule states that &lt;math&gt;[f(x)\cdot g(x)]'=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The key observation is that the left hand side of the first order ODE appears to be fairly similar to the product rule.  There is one term with a derivative of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and there is one term without a derivative of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  

Let's compare the left hand side 

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y&lt;/math&gt; 

to the product rule applied to the product involving &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the prime  &lt;math&gt;'&lt;/math&gt;  operator.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\Big[\mu(x)y(x)\Big]=\mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{d\mu}{dx}y(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The first fact we notice is that on the left hand side of our first order ODE there is no &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; in front of the term &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can try to correct that by multiplying through by &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the ODE would become:

::&lt;math&gt;\mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+\mu(x)P(x)y=\mu(x)Q(x).&lt;/math&gt;

But now this would only look like the product rule if &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mu}{dx}=\mu(x)P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+y(x)\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \mu(x)Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which we do not know by now. But this simple equation can easily be solved, as it is a separable equation.  Dividing both sides of it by &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; and integrating we get:
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\frac{d\mu}{dx}\,dx = \int P(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating by substitution the integral on the left hand side is simply &lt;math&gt;\ln |\mu(x)|&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus pulling over the natural logarithm to the right, we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\mu(x)=e^{\int P(x)\,dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is very important and is called the 'integrating factor'. So our original ODE can be rewritten as
::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)\,dx}\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)e^{\int P(x)\,dx }y=e^{\int P(x)\,dx}Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;

But now the whole point of introducing &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)&lt;/math&gt; was we were trying to turn the left hand side of this ODE into &lt;math&gt;[\mu(x)y]'&lt;/math&gt; for easily integrating it, which is exactly what we have done.  Thus

::&lt;math&gt;[e^{\int P(x)\,dx}y]'=e^{\int P(x)\,dx}Q(x).&lt;/math&gt;

So we may integrate both sides and then solve for y to get 

::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)\,dx}y=\int e^{\int P(x)\,dx}Q(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{-\int P(x)\,dx}\int e^{\int P(x)\,dx}Q(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Below we provide another derivation of this formula.

===Step-by-Step Solution===

===Example 1: P and Q are Constant===

:Let's say we have the equation

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+my=n&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''n'' and ''m'' are constants.  Solve this for ''y''.

:'''Step 1''':  Find the integrating factor, &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}&lt;/math&gt;, 
:with P(x) = m and the integration of a constant being 

:::&lt;math&gt;\int mdx=mx+C&lt;/math&gt;

:yielding

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}=e^{mx}e^c=Ce^{mx}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^c&lt;/math&gt; is collapsing into C. Letting C=1, we get ''e''&lt;sup&gt;mx&lt;/sup&gt;.

:'''Step 2''': Multiply through by the integrating factor just found.

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{mx}\frac{dy}{dx}+e^{mx}my=ne^{mx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 3''': Recognize that the left hand side is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \Big[e^{\int P(x)dx}y\Big]&lt;/math&gt;,
:that is subject to the product rule, giving us.

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \Big[e^{mx}y\Big]=ne^{mx}&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 4''': Integrate both sides with respect to ''x'', 
:with the left hand side now easily integrated.

:::&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dx} e^{mx}y)dx=\int ne^{mx}dx&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{mx}y=\frac{n}{m}e^{mx}+C&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 5''': And finally solve for ''y''

:::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{n}{m}+Ce^{-mx}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2: P and Q are ''x''===

:Take the equation

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+xy=x&lt;/math&gt;

:Solve for ''y''.

:'''Step 1''':  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}&lt;/math&gt;, P(x) = x and the integral of x being

:::&lt;math&gt;\int x=\frac{1}{2}x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

:yielding

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}=Ce^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:Letting C=1, we get &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 2''': Multiply through

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}\frac{dy}{dx}+e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}xy=e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}x&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 3''': Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{\int P(x)dx}y&lt;/math&gt;, giving

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}y=e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}x&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 4''': Integrate

:::&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dx} e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}y)dx=\int xe^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}y=e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}+C&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 5''': Solve for ''y''

:::&lt;math&gt;y=1+\frac{C}{e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 3: P and Q are Unrelated===

:Take the equation

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{1}{x}y=x&lt;/math&gt;

:Solve for ''y''.

Before we begin we notice that for the function ''y'', we are not guaranteed a solution for all ''x''  because the coefficient is discontinuous at 0.  So either we can find a solution in &lt;math&gt;x\in (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; or for &lt;math&gt;x\in(-\infty,0)&lt;/math&gt;.  For the purposes of this solution we shall assume &lt;math&gt;x\in (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. 

:'''Step 1''':  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(x) = 1/x&lt;/math&gt;,
:and the integration of 1/x being

:::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx=\ln(x)+C&lt;/math&gt;

:yielding

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}=Ce^{\ln(x)}=Cx&lt;/math&gt;

:Letting C=1, we get ''x''.

:'''Step 2''': Multiply through

:::&lt;math&gt;x\frac{dy}{dx}+y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 3''': Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{\int P(x)dx}y&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} [xy]=x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 4''': Integrate both sides w.r.t.''x''.

:::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{d}{dx} [xy]\,dx=\int x^2dx&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;xy=\frac{1}{3}x^3+C&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 5''': Solve for ''y''

:::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{3}x^2+\frac{C}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

==An alternative derivation==

There is a strategy for solving inhomogeneous equations called ''variation of parameters'' that proceeds as follows.  First find the general solution to the homogeneous equations.  Guess that the solutions of the inhomogeneous equations can be written in the same way as for the solutions of the homogeneous equations, except where the unknown constants are replaced by unknown functions.   Then you plug a solution of this form back in to the equation to see if you can find what the unknown function is.  

This method works well in case of first order linear equations and gives us an alternative derivation of our formula for the solution which we present below.

#First, set Q(x) equal to 0 so that you end up with a ''homogeneous linear equation'' (the usage of this term is to be distinguished from the usage of &quot;homogeneous&quot; in the previous sections).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#This equation is separable, so separate it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y}+P(x)dx=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#Solve the equation to obtain the solution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;y=Ce^{-\int P(x) dx}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#Now let C be replaced by a variable function of x, and denote it g(x).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;y=g(x)e^{-\int P(x) dx}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#Substitute the previous equation into the differential equation to get&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;g'(x)e^{-\int P(x) dx}=Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#Now solve for g(x) to get&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;g(x)=C+\int Q(x)e^{\int P(x) dx}dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

#Now obtain the general solution by plugging in this expression in g(x):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;y=g(x)e^{-\int P(x) dx}=Ce^{-\int P(x) dx}+e^{-\int P(x) dx}\int Q(x)e^{\int P(x) dx}dx&lt;/math&gt;

==Making Linear Equations from Non-Linear Equations==

Sometimes a non-linear equation, which is not solvable like this, can be made linear, and more easily solvable, by applying a substitution.

===Example===

:::&lt;math&gt;y\frac{dy}{dx}+xy^2=5x&lt;/math&gt;

:Let's make the following substitution:

:::&lt;math&gt;v=y^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=2y\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

:Plugging in, we get

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{dv}{dx}+xv=5x&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}+2xv=10x&lt;/math&gt;

:We can then solve as a linear equation in ''v'', using the step-by-step method above:

:'''Step 1''':  Find the integrating factor:

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int 2x dx}=e^{x^2+C}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}=Ce^{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:Letting C=1 for convenience, we get &lt;math&gt;e^{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; as our integrating factor.

:'''Step 2''': Multiply through

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{x^2}\frac{dv}{dx}+e^{x^2}xv=10e^{x^2}x&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 3''': Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{\int P(x)dx}v&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{x^2}v=10e^{x^2}x&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 4''': Integrate both sides w.r.t.''x''.

:::&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dx} e^{x^2}v)dx=\int 10e^{x^2}xdx&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;e^{x^2}v=5e^{x^2}+C&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Step 5''': Solve for ''v''.

:::&lt;math&gt;v=5+\frac{C}{e^{x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:Now that we have ''v'', solve for ''y''.

:::&lt;math&gt;v=y^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;y^2=5+\frac{C}{e^{x^2}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darwin states that the most important difference between man and the the lower animals is conscience and that in this chapter he will attempt to answer the question posed by the philosopher Immanuel Kant,&quot;Duty!...whence thy original?&quot; Darwin mentions that at least thirty British authors have written on the origin of man's moral sense.

Darwin lists four reasons why any animal with social and /or parental instincts would develop some kind of moral sense as its intellect developed. First of all the &quot;social instincts&quot; make an animal enjoy the company of its own kind and compel it to help them. Secondly, with intellectual development memories of social activities would mix with more basic needs for food and shelter. Thirdly, the development of language enabled members of a society to discuss their common needs and encourage the members to work for the common good. Finally, the actions taken for the good of all would become habits over time. Thus, Darwin confirmed the view that humans are social animals.In addition he notes that John Stuart Mill's failure to acknowledge the importance of inherited intelligence in the development of conscience will be &quot;...judged as a most serious blemish on [his] work...&quot;

Darwin describes a number of anecdotes of social behavior in a variety of animals. He also mentions cases where instincts overpower other instincts as when a swallow abandons its young to migrate, and he notes similar conflicts in human behavior. He also discusses various virtues and their usefulness to &quot;savage&quot; versus &quot;civilized&quot; societies. He attributes immorality among &quot;savages&quot; to social instincts like sympathy that do not extend beyond the tribe, weak &quot;self-command&quot;, and insufficent powers of reason.

Darwin concludes by differentiating his concept of the social instinct from earlier philosophies that said that morality originated from selfishness or the &quot;Greatest Happiness Principle&quot;. He states that people ought to recognize all other people as members of the same society although he laments that history shows otherwise. Then the extension of that feeling to all other animals can spread through &quot;instruction and example to the young&quot; and into public opinion. He quotes Marcus Aurelius in comfirming his belief that we should not dwell on past sins of history. Finally he reiterates his belief in the inheritance of morality or lack of it among all classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darwin states that the object of this chapter is to show that &quot;there is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculty.&quot; 

First of all he discusses the instincts of man and apes. He even suggests that apes in the wild may learn things like which plants are poisonous from other apes. He also mentions how birds on deserted islands appear to inherit a fear of man while the sterile worker bees and ants appear to acquire their instincts spontaneously.

Darwin states that people &quot;underrate the mental powers of the higher animals, and especially of man.&quot; He stresses the development of &quot;the mental organs&quot; through &quot;variability&quot; and natural selection. He quotes Wallace on the difference between how people learn to make things and how animals learn to make their homes. He comments on animal behavior that show they feel &quot;pleasure and pain, happiness and misery&quot; as well as terror, &quot;courage&quot;, and &quot;suspicion&quot;. Darwin also relates anecdotes about maternal behavior of female animals especially monkeys, and shame and playfulness in dogs.

In discussing the higher mental faculties, Darwin describes animal curiosity, the need for stimulation, and the abilities to imitate and focus attention. He also makes some questionable statements regarding animal imagination and memory,i.e., that animals can &quot;judge of the intervals of time between recurrent events&quot; and that some dogs' howling is the result of &quot;fantastic images&quot; from their own minds. In discussing examples of reason in animals, Darwin mentions anecdotes reported by others of eskimo dogs, elephants, bears, fish and monkeys and related them to his observations of his own children's behavior as infants. He also describes animal toolmaking as reported by many other sources. He speculates that higher reasoning like self-awareness evolved from simpler reasoning. And he also comments on animal communication and their ability to understand human languages. In showing the relationship between the development of language and the brain, Darwin refers to the writings of contemporaries.  He even relates natural selection to the changes in languages. He also says that the use of bright plumage and musical calls in male birds show that &quot;a sense of beauty&quot; is not unique to man. 

In the final section on religion, Darwin remarks that &quot;numerous races have existed, and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea.&quot; He hastens to add that this has nothing to do with whether a Creator exists which question had been answered positively by &quot; some of the highest intellects that ever existed.&quot;Darwin goes on to talk about many cultures' beliefs in spirits and refers to a number of academic articles on the development of religion.

He mentions &quot;strange superstitions&quot; like human sacrifice and trials by ordeal and says that humanity owes a debt of gratitude to &quot;science and our accumulated knowledge&quot; for improving human reason.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darwin first states that the similarity between the human skeleton and the skeletons of other animals was &quot;notorious&quot;. Scientists had even seen a similarity between the human brain and that of an orangutan. He mentions the diseases humans can catch from other animals and human illnesses which monkeys also suffer from including &quot;apoplexy, inflammation of the bowels, and cataract in the eye.&quot; He also mentions that monkeys can develop a liking for &quot;tea, coffee, and spiritous liquors&quot; and that he has seen monkeys &quot;smoke tobacco with pleasure.&quot; Other similarities between man and monkeys include: 
#Manner of reproduction, including prenatal development.
#Helplessness of infants. 
#Difference in size and strength between male and female.
#Tissue structure.
#Male nipples. 

Other animal features which man has to a lesser extent include: 
#Muscles that move the scalp and ears.
#The connection of the sense of smell with memory.
#Body hair, including eyebrows. 
#&quot;Lanugo,&quot; or wool-like hair on fetuses.
#Wisdom teeth.
#Vermiform appendix. 
#A fissure in the upper arm bone.
#A tail bone or coccyx.

He even includes illustrations and photographs from other sources. 

In the final paragraph, Darwin emphasizes the &quot;community of descent' among all vertebrates and that only prejudice and arrogance keep people from seeing this.

[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] '''Limoncello''' recipe.

==Ingredients==
*15 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Fifth|fifths]] (1.5 litres total) of 100 proof [[Cookbook:Vodka|vodka]]
*5 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
# Wash the lemons with a vegetable brush and hot water to remove any reside of pesticides or wax. Carefully [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] the lemons with a [[Cookbook:Zester|zester]] or vegetable peeler so there is no white pith on the peel.
# In a 1-gallon glass jar, add one fifth vodka and the lemon zest. Cover the jar and let sit at room temperature for at least 10 days, and up to 40 days in a cool dark place.
# In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and water and cook until thickened, appox. 5 to 7 minutes. Let the syrup cool before adding it to the limoncello mixture. Add the additional fifth of vodka. Allow to rest for another 10 to 40 days.
# After the rest period, strain and bottle, discarding the lemon zest. Keep in the freezer until ready to serve.

== General Overview ==

'''''Number 4 Privet Drive''''' is a thoroughly ordinary house on a thoroughly ordinary street, in the fictional suburb of Surrey called Little Whinging, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] lives with the Dursleys, his thoroughly ordinary aunt, uncle, and cousin.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When Harry is left on the doorstep of Number 4 Privet Drive, after he is orphaned, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] protests, characterizing the residents as &quot;the worst kind of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]].&quot; This is apparently a valid assessment; when we next see him, ten years later, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs. Shortly, he begins [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 3|receiving letters]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], addressed exactly to his &quot;cupboard under the stairs&quot;. In what might be an attempt to avoid future letters being sent, or more likely a reaction to outsiders apparently knowing how Harry is being treated, Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|aunt]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|uncle]] move him to his cousin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s second bedroom, where Dudley stores his extra and broken gifts. Throughout the rest of the series, Harry retains the use of this bedroom when he is living at the Dursleys, though the broken gifts are not in evidence in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Harry's second year]] and later; we assume they have been moved somewhere else or discarded. Harry is locked into this room at times, just as he was locked into the closet under the stairs initially, at one point even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 2|having bars installed over the window]]. Harry does eventually learn how to pick locks without use of magic, thus gaining limited freedom of the house for himself, despite being locked into his room, when he needs it; and he also carves out a hiding place under the floorboards of his room, where he hides gifts from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], and magical artifacts of one sort or another.

We hear, multiple times, that other wizards are willing to provide Harry a permanent home, taking him away from the abusive and hated Dursley family, but they are overruled by Dumbledore, who says only that he has his reasons for keeping Harry at the Dursleys'.

== Analysis ==

The ordinary, non-magical nature of the house on Privet Drive is reiterated throughout the series. It reflects the Dursleys' views on magic, that it should not be tolerated, it should not be allowed. Even the sitting room fireplace, which we see in use to burn letters addressed to Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 3|the first book]], has been walled up by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 4|the fourth book]], and an electric fire placed in the wall where it was. We suspect that the randomness of a real wood fire is annoying for the Dursleys, though it may simply be a reaction to the letters coming down the chimney in the first book. This squared-off rigidity makes a sharp contrast with the rather amazing pile of magical construction that is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], Harry's favorite place to stay (apart, perhaps, from Hogwarts).

It is mentioned in passing that the house at Privet Drive has four bedrooms; one is for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Marge]]). Initially, one of the others is for Vernon and Petunia, one is for Dudley, and the last and smallest one is for Dudley's broken and unused toys. After the first letter for Harry arrives, and it becomes obvious that someone knows that Harry has been sleeping under the stairs, Harry is moved into Dudley's second bedroom. We believe this move is only done to &quot;keep up appearances&quot;: whoever is sending the letters needs to be made to believe that the Dursleys are not mistreating Harry.

We should note that the name of the community, Little Whinging, is more appropriate than it might seem to non-British readers. Whinging is what is known in North America as &quot;whining,&quot; and Dudley certainly seems to do a lot of that, at least in the first book.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry absolutely hates the time he spends in the house on Privet Drive; he would much rather be living with wizards. However, the protection he gained from the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]], when she was trying to save him from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], will remain in force only so long as there is a place that he can call home, which is owned and occupied by his own blood – in this case, Petunia, his mothers' sister. Harry is not allowed to know this until late in the series, and even when he does understand the necessity for it, his knowing it does not improve the feelings about his required presence in that house. This protection ends once he comes of age at seventeen, which happens early in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]; he is then equally at risk wherever he is, and so there is no need for him to return to Privet Drive ever again, for which he seems to be profoundly grateful.

One point worth speculating on is the reason that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] thought it necessary to remove the Dursley family from Privet Drive when Harry came of age. Surely, with Harry no longer in residence, the Dursley family would be of no interest to Voldemort and his minions, except perhaps as a matter of revenge. So why remove the Dursleys? Dumbledore mentions that he had strengthened the protective magic that was based on this most ancient spell, but does not go into detail. It is possible that the strengthening applied at this time is, in fact, extension of the protection provided by the spell to cover Petunia and the other members of her family, protection that will end with Harry's majority. Dumbledore likely is aware that Voldemort tends to be vengeful against those who have gotten in his way, and by being alive Petunia has protected Harry from Voldemort. Additionally, Moody and the Order expect Harry's home to be under attack as Harry leaves, and are acting to protect the Dursley family from damage caused by spells that miss their targets. We note in passing that while Harry's protection from Voldemort is extended by Voldemort's actions when re-embodying himself, that protection is unlikely to extend to Petunia.

While it would be possible to just have this house be an unexplained bastion of enforced &quot;normality&quot; and non-magical life, the author has actually gone the extra step to explain why Petunia has made the effort to so greatly deny any magical influence in her home life. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|the first book]], we hear of Petunia's jealousy of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|her sister Lily's]] magical abilities, which would seem to be almost sufficient, given what we later learn about Petunia's obsessive behaviour, notably as reflected in her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|nightly ritual cleaning of the kitchen]]. We later find, however, that Petunia [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|had applied to be admitted to Hogwarts and had been refused]]. Given this rejection by the magical world, Petunia's retaliatory rejection of anything having to do with magic is absolutely and perfectly in character.

I see you joined. Excellent. I see you're adding lots of characters. Remember to use full names for the actual page link (i.e. Ron is really Ronald). Also, please update the index! The index page is incredibly important to helping people find their way through the book. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 02:36, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Full names could get a little complicated. 1: Just the link portion of the wiki-hyperlink, or the displayed portion as well? 2: Full names vs. popularly known names can be problematic for new viewers, e.g. Ginevra Molly Weasley who's popularly known as Ginny. Strictly interpreting your instruction, the link goes: Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley. (oops -- Percy is just that, Percy.) Call it how you want it played. --[[User:Siaru|Siaru]] 02:55, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
:::Leave complication for the links and don't show the reader usually. Your examples have it correct. Only first name and last name (yet not nicknames) as the page with the more popular name being shown to the reader. The &quot;but I know the popular name&quot; issue can be solved with redirects. If you go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] you will be redirected. As you find naming issues, create redirects to help searching readers. Thanks. You're doing great work! -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 03:03, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
:::Now that I'm thinking about it, it's starting to look stupid if too many people have their largely unknown names as the page name. &quot;Ginevra&quot; is pretty weird for people to see. And a  character like Bill Weasley really is William Weasley I'm sure, but I don't want to put it that way. We should probably just use the popular name and set up redirects from the full names. Sorry for the confusion. Nicknames such as &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; shouldn't be page names but things like &quot;Ron&quot; and &quot;Ginny&quot; can. Seems more helpful. I'll try to make changes here and there as well as modify the redirects. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 15:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

I added some spoiler warnings to the characters page. That should cover things. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 23:38, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
:: That works. Thanks. --[[User:Siaru|Siaru]] 02:00, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

Please add your name to the Muggles' Guide Author list on the main page. I'd like to get a solid team going. Also, see the Snape character page on how to model future character pages (in addition, see [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter#Project_standards]]). Another user should be helping out on filling things in. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 17:17, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

I saw you just added &quot;William&quot; Weasley. Let's stick with the commonly known names like &quot;Bill&quot; here. See my comment above. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 12:09, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

== General Overview ==

'''''The Burrow''''' is the rural home of the Weasley family, located near the fictional town of Ottery St. Catchpole.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Burrow is a wizard-built [[wikt:ramshackle|ramshackle]] multi-story dwelling that clearly needs magic to keep it from falling apart. It has a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghoul|ghoul]] in the attic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|gnomes]] in the garden and an adjacent pasture that has been pressed into use as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] pitch for years. There is a shed where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], the head of the family, explores and tinkers with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] artifacts he comes across, often with destructive results. Near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]'s kitchen is a grandfather clock with a hand for each family member and markings around the face for places they might be (&quot;home&quot;, &quot;traveling&quot;, &quot;mortal peril&quot;).

With seven children in the family, there's not much [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|money]] to go round, and a real spirit of &quot;make-do&quot; pervades the Burrow and its genteel poverty, but to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], who grew up unloved and unwanted for ten years before he re-entered the Wizarding world at the age of eleven, the Burrow is his summer-holiday spot of choice, because it is filled with a family's love in enough abundance to welcome him within.

Harry stays at the Burrow for about a month in the summer before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|his second year]] at Hogwarts, two weeks before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|his fourth year]], a month and a half before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|his sixth year]], and over Christmas of that year, and a few days before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|what would have been his seventh year]] had he returned to Hogwarts. On his first visit there, he is treated as a guest, with little to do, though he does volunteer for the chore of de-Gnoming the garden. In his last two visits, we see that he has been assigned tasks, chopping and peeling sprouts alongside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] at Christmas, and assisting with preparing the Burrow for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding in his final visit. Without the reader realizing it, this quite clearly shows how Harry is being integrated into the Weasley family, changing over the course of six years from being a guest in the house to being one of the family with associated duties. It may be instructive to note that despite his complaints, Harry does not seem particularly upset at being so included in the chores list.

== Analysis ==

The main purpose of The Burrow seems to be contrast. It is an overcrowded, cluttered, haphazard house held together with the wizarding equivalent of baling wire and bubble gum, and there is a very real shortage of money shown by the need to &quot;make do&quot;. Set against this we have Harry's nominal home at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Number 4, Privet Drive]], a very neat and clean new house, squared at the corners, perfect in every way, with enough space that an entire room can be set aside for Dudley's broken birthday presents... and absolutely horrible to live in for anyone who has any real feeling at all. The contrast between the Weasley's physical poverty and spiritual richness, set against the Dursleys' physical financial stability and spiritual emptiness, mirrors the difference between Harry's sterile life in the Muggle world, and his almost overfull life in the Wizarding world.

The Burrow is also Harry's first exposure to a functional family, and will be a model for his own family, we suspect, later in his life. It is amazing to the adult reader that Harry, growing up in the horribly flawed and dysfunctional &quot;family&quot; unit that is the Dursley household, has turned out as well as he has, and the Weasley family, tied inseparably to The Burrow, provides the family warmth and unity that Harry has been longing for since he first arrived at Privet Drive.

One point that may be worth mention is that Molly Weasley's &quot;excellent clock&quot;, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] calls it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], is, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 10|when we first see it]], &quot;the grandfather clock in the corner,&quot; but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 5|later]] is a mantel clock. (Note that it should not be confused with another clock, seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 3|on Harry's first visit to the Burrow]], which is a wall clock. The wall clock actually does indicate the time to do things, while the clock Dumbledore refers to indicates the whereabouts of the Weasley family.) There is no explanation for this, or anything to indicate it is anything but an oversight by the author, but we can suggest a reason for the change. Dumbledore, as we know, is quite skilled with mechanical - magical hybrid devices, and has made rather a hobby of them. Clearly the clock is such a device, and as Dumbledore chooses to single it out in his speech, it certainly was something he found memorable, and thus it is possible that the clock is unique. As the fifth book ends, the Wizarding world abruptly becomes a much more dangerous place, and it is likely that Molly finds the grandfather clock somewhat less than useful; she clearly prefers to have the clock with her at all times, rather than leaving it in the parlour where it is out of her immediate view — in fact, when we see the clock in book six, it is being carried around with the laundry that Mrs. Weasley is then doing. It is not at all far fetched to guess that Mrs. Weasley has had the workings re-built into a smaller compass purely so she could keep it, and updates of her family's status, with her at all times.

It is noted in ''A History of Magic'' by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] that Ottery St. Catchpole &quot;on the south coast of England&quot; is one of a number of villages where wizards settled in relatively large numbers after the ratification of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689. Apart from this description, we have little information about where the village is, except that it is close enough to London that it is reasonable to drive to King's Cross Station&amp;mdash;Arthur Weasley drives them there in the Ford Anglia [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|before Harry's second year,]] and Mrs. Weasley arranges a trio of taxicabs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 11|before Harry's fourth year.]]

Initially it may seem that The Burrow is not necessary to the story. In the first book, Harry discovers that he feels at home at Hogwarts, and his being away from the Dursleys is quite evidently enough for him. However, Hogwarts being a &quot;home away from home&quot; still leaves Harry without a true home, and without any exposure to a functional family. This exposure is necessary to drive Harry's development: at the start of the series, Harry quite plainly must stand on his own, nobody in the Dursley household will take his side in anything. As the series progresses, Harry learns that in order to succeed, he must accept help, and in fact ask for help, initially from Ron and Hermione, and later from many others. Harry is still fighting this internal propensity as late as the final book in the series, where he believes that he must find the final [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] on his own, and resists, at least initially, offers of help from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|the reformed Dumbledore's Army]]. How much of this willingness to accept help comes from his observation of, and integration into, the Weasley family unit? It is very hard to tell, but a large part of it could be Harry's observation of how the family survives its estrangement from Percy, and how Percy is weakened by the separation, in ways that Charlie and Bill are not. The Burrow clearly is necessary to that observation, being a place where the Weasley family are gathered for our, and Harry's, education.

== Overview ==

'''''Sirius Black''''' was sentenced without a trial to life imprisonment in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] for betraying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], and murdering their friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and twelve Muggles. In the early stages of Book 3, he has escaped and no one doubts he is trying to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Sirius is only briefly mentioned in the opening chapter – [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] has borrowed his flying motorcycle to bring baby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] to his new home, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Number 4, Privet Drive]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Sirius Black, a wizard and convicted murderer, has escaped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]]. Black is believed to be so dangerous that even Muggle TV news reports are issuing warnings about a dangerous fugitive. When Harry storms out of the Dursleys' house following an argument, he notices an ominous-looking large black dog watching him in the street. In Diagon Alley, Harry overhears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] discussing Sirius Black, a suspected [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] supporter who escaped solely to find and murder Harry. Later, Mr. Weasley asks a rather bemused Harry to promise not to look for Black.

Black breaks into Hogwarts on Hallowe'en, but when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|the Fat Lady]] bars him from entering the Gryffindor common room (he does not know the password), he slashes her portrait and escapes. Shortly after, in Potions class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] taunts Harry about never seeking revenge on Sirius Black, though Harry is confused about what he means. 

Just before Christmas, Harry overhears a conversation in the Three Broomsticks pub that Black betrayed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] to Voldemort, and afterward murdered their friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], along with twelve Muggle bystanders. Harry is shocked to learn that Black is also his godfather. Enraged, Harry vows to avenge his parents' deaths. Soon after, Black slips into the Gryffindor common room using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom's]] lost password list. He shreds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s bed curtains with a knife, but flees when Ron wakes up screaming. It is unclear why Black attempted to attack Ron rather than Harry.

During the climactic Shrieking Shack scene, Black's innocence is revealed; it is the very alive Peter Pettigrew who committed the crimes. The relationship between Sirius Black, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]], Peter Pettigrew, and Harry's father, James Potter, is also explained: they are the four Marauders who attended school together and created the &quot;Marauder's Map,&quot; a magical document that has come into Harry's possession showing Hogwarts Castle and its inhabitants. Harry realizes that the large black dog that has been stalking him is actually Black in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form (the ability to transform into an animal at will); Black has been watching over his godson, Harry. Pettigrew is also an Animagus, disguised for the past twelve years as Ron's pet rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]]. It was &quot;Scabbers&quot; who Black was attempting to kill the night he broke into Harry's dorm. When Pettigrew escapes and Black is captured, Minister for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] insists Black is guilty and orders a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]], an inhuman Azkaban guard, to immediately suck out Black's soul. Using a Time Turner, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] retrace that night's events and free Black. Later, Black sends Harry an owl message saying he is safe&amp;mdash;for now. Harry also learns it was Black who gave him a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt broomstick]] at Christmas as an anonymous gift. Black also gives written permission for Harry to visit Hogsmeade Village on school outings, and, as compensation for losing his &quot;pet&quot; rat, he donates the tiny delivery owl to Ron. Ginny Weasley names it [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Sirius returns to England after Harry writes to him about his throbbing scar and a troubling dream involving Voldemort. Fearing his fugitive godfather may be captured, Harry wanted him to stay away, but Sirius is concerned about Harry's safety. Meanwhile, Harry has been mysteriously chosen to compete in the dangerous [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] being held at Hogwarts. Hermione urges Harry to write to his godfather again, and Sirius arranges to meet him in the Gryffindor common room using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]. Sirius' floating head appears in the fireplace and warns Harry about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]], the competing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang school's]] headmaster and a former [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. It was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], a retired Auror, who arrested Karkaroff. Sirius believes that an earlier attack on Moody could have been an attempt to scare Moody from taking the Defense Against the Dark Arts post. These events may herald Voldemort's return. 

Following the Tournament's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], Sirius meets Harry, Ron, and Hermione during the next [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village weekend]]. Sirius, half-starved and in his dog form, leads the Trio to a nearby cave where he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] are hiding. Harry's letters, plus reports in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] have made recent events sound suspicious to Sirius. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley's ]] boss, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemious Crouch]] missing work sounds uncharacteristic to Sirius. It was Crouch who sentenced Sirius to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] without a trial. When Crouch headed the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] Department, he championed using desperate measures against Death Eaters, achieving some results. He was tapped as the next Minister for Magic until his son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch, Jr.]], was found with the Death Eaters who tortured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]], Neville's parents. Crouch presided over his son's trial, convicting him. Crouch lost his son, who died in prison, his wife, who passed away shortly after, and his shot as the Minister, eventually getting shunted aside to the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Sirius suspects Crouch wants to capture one last Dark Wizard to revive his career. 

Harry believes Snape is a Death Eater, but Sirius says though Snape was associated with Slytherins who became Death Eaters, he was never accused. Sirius also has no idea what the object on Karkaroff's arm could be. Sirius tells Ron to ask Percy about Crouch's illness, and also about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins']] disappearance. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] was quoted in interviews as saying that Bertha has a bad memory, though Sirius recalls she had an excellent one in school, at least for gossip. Sirius also wonders why Bagman has been offering to help Harry win the Tournament.

After Bartemius Crouch mysteriously appears and then disappears at Hogwarts, Harry writes Sirius, but his response only scolds Harry for straying out of bounds with another Triwizard Champion. Other Champions might do anything, including attacking Harry, to win. Hermione agrees with Sirius, saying that Harry is safe inside the school, though Harry is annoyed that his godfather orders him to stay put.

As Harry prepares for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], Sirius sends messages filled with adjurations to ignore events outside Hogwarts; Harry's only priority should be safely navigating the Third Task maze. Sirius continues sending messages almost entirely filled with tips and tricks for casting charms and jinxes.

Following the Tournament's final event, Barty Crouch, Jr., who has been impersonating the real Professor Moody, is apprehended. After Barty's confession, Dumbledore takes Harry to his office where Sirius, ragged and worried, awaits. Sirius feels Harry should rest, but Dumbledore insists that Harry immediately face what happened. Harry recounts Cedric Diggory's murder and Voldemort's resurrection in the graveyard. Dumbledore then escorts Harry to the Hospital Wing, telling Sirius, back is in his dog form, that he can stay with Harry. 

After Cornelius Fudge dismissed Dumbledore's and Harry's claims about Voldemort, Dumbledore requests that Snape and Sirius put aside their mutual animosity and maintain a cooperative truce. He assigns both missions; Snape's is unknown, but Sirius, still a fugitive, is to alert &quot;the old crew&quot;, then hide out at Remus Lupin's place.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

A haggard-looking Sirius greets Harry, who arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], the Black family's ancient home and now the Order of the Phoenix headquarters. Sirius is still a fugitive, and Peter Pettigrew has presumably informed Voldemort about Sirius' Animagus dog shape, effectively confining Sirius to his hated home. Harry and the Weasleys staying there have temporarily lifted Sirius' spirits. At Sirius' suggestion, and over [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley's]] objections, Harry is permitted to ask questions about Voldemort. Sirius lets slip that the Order is guarding something that Voldemort wants, but Mrs. Weasley abruptly ends the conversation.

Sirius, Mrs. Weasley, and the younger crew work to make the dilapidated house habitable again. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], the Black family's old and apparently senile [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]], who only took orders from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Mrs. Black's]] mad, shrieking portrait, grudgingly obeys Sirius' commands. Sirius shows Harry a tapestry embroidered with the Ancient and Honorable House of Black. A scorch mark shows where his name was blasted off after he rejected the family's pure-blood ethos and ran away. Sirius points out other relatives, including his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus]], an apparent Death Eater who is rumored to have been killed by Voldemort.

As the students' departure date near, Sirius grows despondent again. Harry suspects Sirius' increased depression actually dates from Harry's Ministry hearing; if convicted, Harry would probably have stayed with Sirius at Grimmauld Place rather than return to Hogwarts. Sirius, in dog form, accompanies the party to King's Cross Station to see the students off. He is evidently recognized by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], because shortly after, the ''Daily Prophet'' reports Sirius was spotted in London. A story also appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']] suggesting Sirius is innocent, though the ''Quibbler's'' journalistic standards are considered spurious.

Harry writes to Sirius complaining about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Dolores Umbridge]], who is also a Ministry spy. Sirius responds that the Order does not believe she is a Death Eater. Cornelius Fudge is paranoid that Dumbledore is building a secret wizard army to overthrow the Ministry, which is why Umbridge banned magic in Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. Both Harry and Hermione veto Sirius' suggestion to meet during the next Hogsmeade Village weekend, claiming it is too dangerous. Sirius chides Harry for being so cautious, unlike his father, James.

Sirius warns Harry that Mrs. Weasley knows about Harry's secret D.A classes, and she forbids Ron to join; she advises Harry and Hermione to forego it, though Sirius approves. While discussing possible meeting locations, Umbridge's hand suddenly appears in the fireplace, grabbing at where Sirius' floating head has just vanished.

Just before Christmas, Harry reports dreamed that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] was attacked at the Ministry of Magic. Dumbledore alerts the Order, and Mr. Weasley is found alive, but seriously injured. To prevent Professor Umbridge's interference, Dumbledore sends Harry, Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and the Twins to Grimmauld Place. On arrival, Harry whiffs cooking sherry odors clinging to Sirius. Sirius vetoes Fred and George going to the hospital, saying the Order wants Harry's ability to &quot;see&quot; things from hundreds of miles away kept secret. Harry privately tells Sirius that he observed the attack from the snake's point-of-view, and felt intense rage toward Dumbledore when their gazes met. Sirius says he will inform Dumbledore, but Harry should not dwell on it.

Mr. Weasley is expected to make a full recovery, and Sirius is overjoyed that everyone is staying for the holidays. Sirius seems unconcerned when Hermione is unable to find Kreacher, saying a House-elf is prohibited from leaving his master's home without permission. When Kreacher reappears, Harry notices that he is watching him speculatively, making Harry uneasy. Depressed that Harry is soon returning to Hogwarts, Sirius gives him a charmed mirror, saying Harry can contact him anytime with it. Harry privately resolves never to use it, fearing it will risk Sirius being captured. 

Back at Hogwarts, a surprisingly (and suspiciously) friendly Professor Umbridge summons Harry to her office. She offers him a drink that Harry suspects contains [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], and quietly discards it. Umbridge asks about Dumbledore's and Sirius' whereabouts; when Harry responds he does not know, Umbridge mentions that all Hogwarts fireplaces except hers are being monitored.

Harry peers into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] containing Snape's memories and observes the teen-aged Sirius and James mercilessly bullying Snape. Pettigrew eggs them on, while Remus Lupin, then a Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]], does nothing. Snape returns and discovers Harry viewing his memories; furious and embarrassed, he ejects Harry from his office, ending their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] lessons. Disturbed by what he witnessed, Harry contacts Sirius, who admits that he and James were uncaring, foolish, and reckless youths, but claims Snape was far from innocent. That James matured into a kind and compassionate man, does little to soothe Harry, who could never behave as his father. Both Sirius and Lupin are alarmed that Harry's Occlumency classes with Snape ended, and urge him to restart.

When Harry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius, he, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] ride [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] to the Ministry in London. But the students have been lured into an ambush&amp;mdash;a dozen Death Eaters, led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], are lying in wait. They need Harry to retrieve a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] concerning Harry and Voldemort. Sirius, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Shacklebolt]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]] arrive in time to subdue the Death Eaters. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] has also arrived and confronts Voldemort. As Sirius duels his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, her spell stuns him, sending his rigid body through a veiled stone archway. Harry rushes after him, but Lupin restrains him, saying it is too late. Sirius is gone.

Dumbledore explains later that when Harry attempted to reach Sirius using the Floo Network, Kreacher lied about his godfather's whereabouts. At Christmas, when Sirius dismissed Kreacher, he manipulated that into permission to leave the house, going to the only Black relative he felt still upheld the family's values: Narcissa Malfoy. Barred from revealing any Order of the Phoenix secrets, he could tell the Malfoys about Harry and Sirius' relationship. This allowed Voldemort to fabricate the false dream that led Harry to the Ministry. 

Harry hopes that Sirius has become a ghost, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] dispels that, saying Sirius, not fearing death, would have gone on. Luna Lovegood later tells Harry that the dead are not really gone, just waiting. She asks if Harry heard their whispering voices on the other side of the veiled archway. Harry surprisingly feels better after this conversation.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In the opening chapters, Former Minister For Magic Fudge tells the Muggle prime minister that an investigation into what happened in the Department of Mysteries is underway. Fudge seems to now agree that Sirius was probably innocent. 

Harry mourns Sirius' death but gradually is coming to terms with it. Sirius' will leaves all his property to Harry, including the house at Grimmauld Place and its contents, including Kreacher.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Sirius' flying motorcycle makes a reappearance in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Escape from Privet Drive|the Escape from Privet Drive]]. Arthur Weasley has attached a side-car for Harry to ride to safety; however, a weapon added to the motorcycle, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]]-fire thrower that acts like a rocket booster, weakens the link and the sidecar breaks off. Harry safely climbs aboard the motorcycle behind Hagrid, and the dragon-fire hastens their escape to the safe house. In their final descent, Hagrid leaps off the seat to attack a Death Eater, and despite Harry's best efforts, the motorcycle crashes and is largely destroyed.

Arthur Weasley later collects the pieces and hides them in the chicken coop at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], hoping to reassemble them and, if possible, learn how brakes work. In an after-publication interview, the author states that Mr. Weasley has reassembled the motorcycle.

Harry explores Sirius' bedroom at Number 12, Grimmauld Place after the Trio take refuge there following their flight from Death Eaters. Apparently rebelling against his parents, Sirius had fixed many large Gryffindor House posters and students' photos on the wall with Permanent Sticking Charms. Harry finds the room ransacked, but searches the mess for information about his godfather. He finds a letter written by his mother and a torn-off photo of himself at about one-year-of-age riding a toy broom. He is unable to find either the letter's second page or the missing picture portion, which seems to have contained one of his parent's image.

In Severus Snape's memories, Harry relives bits of Snape's school career. Snape is bullied by James Potter and Sirius Black on the Hogwarts Express while heading to the school for their first year. Snape also sees Sirius being Sorted into Gryffindor, as he had wanted to be. Harry witnesses Lily trying to rescue Snape from being tormented by James and Sirius, and much later, Snape in Sirius' bedroom taking the letter's second page, and tearing Lily's image from the picture to take with him as well.

Harry, needing moral support as he goes to face Voldemort, uses the Resurrection Stone that is hidden inside the Golden Snitch. Sirius' spirit appears, along with James, Lily, and Remus Lupin, who keep the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] at bay, and encourage Harry to be brave in facing his death. Both Lupin and Sirius' spirits appear to be younger and Sirius seems happy. When Harry reaches the clearing where Voldemort is waiting, he releases the Stone, and the spirits vanish.

== Strengths ==
 
Born into a wealthy and influential Wizarding family, Sirius was intelligent, handsome, charming, and witty. He was also a powerful and talented wizard who apparently acquired considerable magical knowledge. While at Hogwarts, when he and James Potter discovered that Remus Lupin was a Werewolf, they did not shun him as others would. Instead, they supported him by secretly learning to become Animagi, an extremely difficult feat, even with proper training. (They had to coach Peter Pettigrew on how to do this.) Also while at Hogwarts, Sirius helped create the Marauder's Map, a powerful magical document that shows every person within the school and their specific location. 

Sirius had rejected his family's pure-blood supremacy beliefs, despite being raised under this ethos. As a consequence, he was stricken from the Black family tree and banished. He sought refuge with the Potter family and later joined the Order of the Phoenix, along with Lily and James Potter. This eventually pitted him against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, which included close relatives, such as his cousins, Bellatrix Black Lestrange and Narcissa Black Malfoy.

Sirius was a loyal, close friend to James and Lily Potter, Remus Lupin, and also Peter Pettigrew, who later betrayed him. After escaping Azkaban prison (where he was incarcerated for crimes he never committed), his first act is to make sure his orphaned godson, Harry, is safe and well. He had great affection for Harry and took his role as godfather seriously, becoming a strong father figure to his godson in the short time they were together. Although Sirius' stunted maturity occasionally resulted in poor parental judgment and made him lax regarding discipline, when he suspected Harry was in danger during the Triwizard Tournament, he firmly ordered him to remain safely inside Hogwarts, much to Harry's displeasure and resentment.

== Weaknesses ==

At Hogwarts, Sirius was a handsome and popular student, but he, along with James Potter, was rather arrogant and sometimes bullied weaker classmates&amp;mdash;Severus Snape in particular. As an innocent fugitive who many still believed served Voldemdort and betrayed James and Lily Potter, Sirius had difficulty coping with confinement in his own house to elude the authorities. His inability to actively help the ''Order of the Phoenix'' battle Voldemort deeply frustrated him. Sirius was barely a grown man when he was sentenced to Azkaban, and it appears that the long years there stunted his emotional development and maturity, resulting in his occasionally acting more like Harry's peer than mentor. Throughout ''Order of the Phoenix'', Sirius increasingly grew mentally unstable, resulting in rash decisions and reckless behavior. His impaired mental condition, that was partially due to his harsh incarceration, was further exacerbated while he was being hunted, and later by his in-house confinement. And though safe and comfortable inside Grimmauld Place, Sirius, often lonely and isolated, numbed his anguish with alcohol. His few pleasures were brief visits with Harry and a few other close friends, and in doing what little he could to assist the Order. It should be noted that insanity and mental instability apparently ran throughout the Black family; Sirius may have been exhibiting symptoms somewhat similar to Bellatrix Lestrange. By the book's conclusion, he had psychologically deteriorated to where his faulty judgment may have contributed to his death.

Sirius, an unregistered Animagus, escaped Azkaban prison by transforming into his dog form, slipping past the Dementors that were unable to detect his canine guise. Though clever, it was twelve years before Sirius utilized this method to escape. Why he was unable to do this earlier is unknown, though his deteriorated physical and mental condition may have been a factor.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Due to his early and long incarceration and premature death a few years after his escape, Sirius never had an opportunity to marry or have children, though his handsome features no doubt attracted many female admirers during his youth. Though he was raised with the Black family's deeply-entrenched, pure-blood superiority beliefs, he rejected these views, so much so that he requested that the Sorting Hat place him in Gryffindor House rather than Slytherin, his family's traditional House. This estranged Sirius from his disapproving relatives, except for his cousin, Andromeda Black Tonks, who the family also banished for marrying Muggle-born wizard, Ted Tonks. Sirius is also close to their daughter, Nymphadora Tonks. After his mother disowned him, Sirius fled to the Potter home, staying with James and his parents. Sirius never reconciled with his family, and was forever bitter over their cruel treatment. 

Sirius learned that his younger brother, Regulus, had become a Death Eater, but once entering the Dark Lord's service, he was unable to leave after realizing just what it entailed. Although Sirius believed Voldemort or his Death Eaters murdered him, Regulus actually died in the secret sea cave after replacing Voldemort's Locket Horcrux with a fake one.

Sirius was one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters#Marauders|Marauders]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]. They created the Marauder's Map while in school together. Though James was his best friend (becoming godfather to James' son, Harry), Sirius was also quite close to Remus, though less so with Peter Pettigrew, who had ingratiated himself into the other three's inner circle. An illegal Animagus, Sirius' nickname (Padfoot) is derived from the large, black dog form he assumed when transformed.  

Both Sirius and James intensely disliked [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], and often bullied him when they were all students at Hogwarts. Sirius once tricked Snape into going to the Shrieking Shack while Lupin was confined there during his werewolf transformation, though James intervened, saving Snape's life. Snape never forgave Sirius (or James) for his dangerous prank, and the two remained particularly antagonistic with one another, always at daggers points; once, Harry witnessed a heated encounter between the two at Grimmauld Place that could have erupted into wizard's duel, prevented only by the Weasley family's timely arrival.

Sirius' second closest relationship was with his godson, Harry. Being imprisoned almost immediately after James and Lily Potter were murdered, it was twelve years before Sirius was able to fulfill his godfather role after escaping Azkaban prison. Sirius' then-anonymous gift of the Firebolt was quite obviously an attempt to reclaim this role, though we don't understand it as such until the end of the third book. Initially, Harry, like others, believed Sirius caused his parents' deaths and sought revenge. After Sirius' innocence is proved in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', godfather and godson instantly bonded. Although Sirius deeply loved and protected Harry, his stunted maturity and mental deterioration sometimes impaired his parenting abilities, causing him to sometimes act as Harry's pal rather than his guardian. Harry deeply grieved beloved godfather's death and later christens his first-born son, &quot;James Sirius&quot;, to honour his lost father and godfather.

== Analysis ==

The first time the &quot;young Sirius Black&quot; is mentioned largely goes unnoticed, as we have no idea who he is. All we know is that he loaned his flying motorcycle to Hagrid. While Sirius himself changes little throughout the series, Harry's understanding about him, and thus ours, gradually evolves as plot twists are revealed. In ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' it is learned that Sirius is an escaped murderer, then that he is a wizard, and he apparently intends to kill Harry. It is hinted that he has done something that would inspire Harry to seek revenge, but it is not until Christmas that Harry learns that Sirius betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, then, when confronted by their friend Peter Pettigrew, killed Pettigrew and twelve incidental Muggles. Not only does Black apparently want to kill Harry, but Harry also discovers that Black is also his godfather, the man who is supposed to be his protector. Sirius is believed to be in Voldemort's inner circle, and even his second-in-command.

Once Sirius traps Harry in the Shrieking Shack, we learn that Sirius is innocent and it is actually Peter Pettigrew who supported Voldemort; Pettigrew was made the Potters' Secret Keeper and then betrayed them to Voldemort. When Voldemort fell, Pettigrew faked his own murder, framing Sirius, then went into hiding, disguised as the Weasley family's pet rat, Scabbers. When the truth is revealed, proving Sirius' innocence, he assumes a surrogate-father role to Harry. Soon, though, Pettigrew, and the truth, escape, and Sirius becomes a hunted man again.

This revelation is why we choose to withhold Sirius' true fidelity in the information box above. In fact, Sirius is consistently loyal, first to his friends, James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, and later to James' son Harry, and Albus Dumbledore. Sirius is initially portrayed as Voldemort's faithful follower, and despite his upbringing in a hotbed of pureblood wizards and anti-Muggle beliefs, Sirius is actually always loyal to Dumbledore's cause. Revealing this information too early would ruin readers' enjoyment of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''.

In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' the first cracks in Sirius' mental stability begin appearing. While Sirius advises Harry about the Triwizard Tournament, that advice sometimes seems rather odd. In particular, the reader may wonder why Sirius feels that Harry must compete in the Triwizard, as it seems that some malign influence forced his entry. Would it not be better to have him somehow left behind in the Tournament, keeping him safe from the worst risks? Sirius counsels about what may be the most dangerous course, blithely assuming that Dumbledore will catch Harry should he fall. During the cave episode, Sirius seems slightly less than sane, possibly caused by his subsistence on rats and hiding in such harsh conditions. However, when Viktor Krum is attacked, Sirius shows just what a responsible and protective guardian he can be when he scolds Harry for straying outside Hogwarts' grounds with an opponent. He sternly orders Harry to stay inside Hogwarts' safe boundaries, though Harry feels Sirius is employing a double standard, forcing him to stay put when Sirius likely would have ignored the rules if he had been in the same situation. 

It is in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' that Sirius' character truly begins unraveling. Being a fugitive kept him confined to 12 Grimmauld Place for long periods with only his mad mother's portrait and the irritable and apparently senile House-elf, Kreacher for company. When Harry arrives for Christmas, he smells sherry clinging to Sirius, so we can assume Sirius uses alcohol for solace. Sirius' extreme pleasure at having company over the holidays is sad and also pathetic. Molly having to remind Sirius that Harry is not James returned, early in that book, is dismissed by Sirius, but seems all too valid; Sirius does appear to treat Harry as he would James, as a compatriot rather than as his ward. It is likely that Sirius' emotional development was stalled during his twelve-year incarceration in Azkaban, and it has possibly even regressed. Although Sirius remained tragically flawed by his delayed emotional development, he was still a good influence and acted as a protector and father figure for Harry. It is debatable whether or not more could have been done to help Sirius. Leaving him confined in his house for long periods, isolated, and with little interaction or purpose in life, clearly added to his decline. Perhaps finding him a more active and substantial role within the Order of the Phoenix and providing regular companionship could have helped stabilize his condition. 

It should be noted that the House of Black provided many ardent Voldemort supporters, both during his original ascent to power and during his return. The Black family's blood purity ethic would have made Voldemort's beliefs attractive to them. It was probably generally assumed that this belief extended to Sirius and that he was also a Voldemort supporter, though he (like his cousin, Andromeda Black Tonks) had rejected his family and was now loyal only to Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.

== Overview ==

'''''Remus John Lupin''''' is a wizard who joins the cast of characters in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' as the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher.

Lupin's birthday is March 10th, according to the author.

=== Etymology === 

The etymology of the character's name is:
* '''Remus''': In Roman legend Romulus and Remus were the founders of Rome who were raised by a she-wolf.  
* '''Lupin''': Derived from Latin &quot;lupinus&quot; ''of a wolf''.
This is an example of the author's use of perhaps excessively appropriate nomenclature. The events which made this name so correct for Lupin must have occurred at some time after he was named. While this might raise a few eyebrows in mature readers, we remind students that this is primarily a book series for children, and as such having names that directly link to characteristics of the named actors is appropriate.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Remus J. Lupin is introduced on the Hogwarts Express, where he spends almost the entire trip sleeping. Even asleep, however, he assists [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and his friends; his presence prevents [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] from engaging in any mischief. When a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] hunting the fugitive, Sirius Black, enters the compartment, Lupin awakes and repels it with a Charm. He then provides chocolate to the frightened students as a restorative and sends an owl ahead to inform the school nurse that Harry may need medical attention. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] later commends his actions, saying that at last they have a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows medical remedies.

At the Welcoming Feast, Dumbledore announces that Professor Lupin is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher &amp;mdash; something Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] already guessed. In his first-ever lesson with Harry's class, Lupin demonstrates an unexpected ability in subduing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]]. He also gives [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] a much-needed boost in confidence by having him lead an exercise to ward off a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]]. Lupin's practical, hands-on teaching methods are popular with students, making him an instant favourite.

When Harry later asks why Lupin prevented him from tackling his own Boggart, Lupin says he feared it would turn into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and frighten the class. Lupin is impressed that Harry's worst fear is not Voldemort, but Dementors. Shortly after, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], brings Lupin a potion and leaves. Harry suggests that Snape, who has long coveted the Defence Against the Dark Arts job and apparently despises Lupin, may have poisoned the potion, but Lupin drinks it without hesitation.

After Dementors cause Harry to faint and fall off his broom during a Quidditch match, he asks Lupin to teach him how to repel them. Lupin shows Harry the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] charm. During these lessons, Harry learns that Lupin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]] were schoolmates. During the next Quidditch match, Harry successfully conjures the charm to repel the Dementors, although it is actually Malfoy and his cronies in disguise. Lupin congratulates Harry on his Patronus, but he is rather shaken by the shape it took.

Lupin plays a major role in the  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]] scene. Upon entering the shack, he immediately disarms Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who have overpowered Sirius Black. Certain that Black is innocent, Lupin returns the Trio's wands and holsters his own as a reassuring gesture that he trusts everyone. Lupin tells them about the friendship between himself, James Potter, Sirius Black, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], the four ''Marauders'' who created the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]]. Severus Snape bursts in, accusing Lupin of abetting Black, but the Trio knock him unconscious with a combined charm. Both Lupin and Black then unmask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], Ron's rat, as Peter Pettigrew in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form. James was also an Animagus, as is Sirius. It was Pettigrew who betrayed James and Lily to Voldemort. As they prepare to execute Pettigrew, Harry intervenes, saying that his father would not want his two best friends to become murderers; instead, the Dementors can have him. While heading to the castle, the full moon rises. Lupin, who has forgotten his potion, transforms into a dangerous werewolf. Black, in his Animagus dog form, is unable to subdue Lupin but chases him away into the Forbidden Forest. Black is captured by Snape and imprisoned in the castle; Harry and Hermione rescue him, and he escapes on Buckbeak, a Hippogriff wrongly sentenced to death.

Denied the fame that Black's capture would have bestowed upon him, Snape takes petty revenge by revealing to the entire school that Lupin is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|werewolf]]. Lupin resigns his post, knowing parents will object to having such a person teaching their children. As Lupin packs to leave, he tells Harry that his father's Animagus form was a stag, the same as Harry's Patronus. That is why Lupin was so affected when he saw it at the Quidditch match.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Lupin does not directly appear in the fourth book. After Voldemort's return to power and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]]'s departure, Dumbledore tells Sirius Black to alert &quot;the old crowd,&quot; naming Lupin as one of their number, and instructs Sirius to lay low at Remus' until Dumbledore gets in touch with him again.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===
Lupin returns in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' when he arrives at the Dursleys to escort Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place]], the Order of the Phoenix headquarters. Lupin stays at Grimmauld Place with Sirius Black, leaving occasionally to carry out unknown tasks for the Order. Harry only sees him at Grimmauld during the school holiday or when he communicates with him and Sirius via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]]. When Harry watches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s memories in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], he sees his father and Sirius tormenting Snape. Disturbed by James' bullying, he secretly uses the fireplace in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s office to contact Sirius and Lupin and asks them about his father's behavior. Lupin says that the young James (and also Sirius) was a bully, but that he eventually outgrew it. His explanation does little to soothe Harry.

Lupin participates in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle against the Death Eaters]] in the Department of Mysteries at the book's conclusion. When Harry runs after a stricken Sirius, whose body has floated through a mysterious veiled archway to death, it is Lupin who forcefully restrains him, saving him from the same fate.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In the sixth book, Lupin acts as a spy for the Order of the Phoenix by infiltrating a dangerous werewolf pack headed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] recruited. In the ending, Lupin helps [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|fight the Death Eaters]], who have invaded Hogwarts to murder [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. It is also revealed that Order of the Phoenix member [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] is in love with Remus. However, Lupin tells Tonks it is too dangerous to be romantically involved with a werewolf, that he is too old for her, and says she deserves someone better. However, Lupin and Tonks are later seen holding hands, which indicates that they have overcome these obstacles and have started a cautious relationship.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Lupin is among the guards escorting Harry and the Harry Potter decoys from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley residence]] to a safe house. As the escape plan is being outlined in the Dursley kitchen, Tonks is seen wearing a ring; we discover that she and Lupin are married. The Order's plan to move Harry was uncovered, and Lupin arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] with an injured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George Weasley]] in tow. As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] tends George's wound, Lupin quizzes Harry to confirm his identity. After the other Harry decoys and protectors have arrived, Lupin leaves with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] to search for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]], who is missing and presumed dead.

Lupin and Tonks are at the Burrow for Harry's birthday, but they quickly depart when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] warns them that he is arriving shortly with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]. At Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, Lupin tells Harry that Werewolves are presently in very poor standing with the Ministry. During the wedding reception, as the Ministry falls and Death Eaters break the existing protective spells surrounding the Burrow, we see Lupin and Tonks, back-to-back, casting protective spells.

A few days after Harry, Hermione, and Ron have settled into Grimmauld Place, Lupin visits. He chastises Ron and Hermione for dropping their guard too quickly when he first identified himself. He knows the Trio has a secret mission, and offers his help. Asked about Tonks, he reports that she is pregnant and is safe at her parents' house. Harry is angered that Lupin wants to go adventuring while Tonks and her unborn child are left at home. Parents, he says, should not abandon their children. Heated words are exchanged, and firing a Jinx that knocks Harry down, Lupin angrily storms out.

In March, Ron tunes in the pirate wireless program &quot;Potterwatch&quot;. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], as &quot;River&quot;, introduces &quot;Romulus&quot;, easily identifiable by his voice as Lupin, who provides an update on Harry. Lupin says that it is certain that Harry is still alive, as his death would be trumpeted far and wide by the regime as a way of eliminating a rallying point for the resistance. Lupin further says that, if Harry is listening, he should follow his instincts, which are nearly always right. Harry and Hermione are both left in tears by this avowal of reconciliation. Lupin goes on to say that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] had been arrested, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], who had held a &quot;Support Harry Potter&quot; party in his house, had escaped arrest and was now at large.

When Harry escapes Malfoy Manor and retreats to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], Lupin visits, announcing that Tonks has given birth to a boy they named Teddy. Surprisingly, given their previous acrimonious parting, Lupin is pleased to see Harry and asks him to be Teddy's godfather, which Harry accepts.

Just prior to the final battle with Voldemort at Hogwarts, tension mounts in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] stubbornly insists on joining the fight and by Percy Weasley's unexpected arrival to reconcile with his family. Fleur attempts to ease the situation by asking Lupin about the new baby; Lupin produces a photograph, although no one seems interested in seeing it. Finally, after Percy is forgiven and Ginny is ordered to stay put inside the Room of Requirement, Lupin goes to the Great Hall to command the forces defending the school grounds. Although Tonks arrives, and we see her looking for Lupin as she takes part in the battle, Lupin is not seen again until the battle is over, and his and Tonks' bodies are lying among the dead.

After reliving Snape's memories in the Pensieve, Harry realizes that it was always his fate to face and be killed by Voldemort. Finding his courage unequal to this, and unable to produce a Patronus to pass the Dementors in the Forbidden Forest, Harry summons Lupin's spirit, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]]. Acting as Patronuses, the four spirits shield Harry as he travels through the Forest to Voldemort's encampment. When Harry reaches the Death Eaters, he drops the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]] that summoned the shades, causing them to vanish.

== Strengths ==
Remus Lupin is a talented and powerful wizard as well as extremely intelligent. He is thoughtful and tends to think through a situation before acting. He often demonstrates great self-control, remaining calm in stressful situations. Although Lupin has been as an outcast, he is kind and extraordinarily loyal to his friends and allies, especially Dumbledore and Harry.

Lupin was considered by most students and teachers to be the best [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts|Defense Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts during the series. He brought patience, understanding, and humor to the class and greatly encouraged his students, especially [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Harry_Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Neville_Longbottom|Neville]].

Lupin is a true Gryffindor, bravely risking his life to infiltrate Fenrir Greyback's werewolf pack to act as Dumbledore's spy, and loyally served in the Order of Phoenix. After realizing that Sirius Black was innocent, he immediately went to his aid in the Shrieking Shack where Pettigrew is unmasked as the true traitor.

== Weaknesses ==
As a young boy, Lupin became afflicted with lycanthropy after being bitten by the werewolf [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]]. Every full moon an afflicted person transforms into a wolf-like creature, and, like a rabid dog, is unable to control their actions. Werewolves, transformed, will more or less mindlessly seek out unafflicted humans to bite and infect them. Although there is no cure, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|a potion]] has recently been discovered that allows them to retain their sanity during transformations. Lupin, taking this potion, is able to curl up quietly in his office and rest, rather than rampaging through the Forbidden Forest. However, this potion must be taken every day for about a week before a full moon, and it is effective only for one lunar cycle; if the potion is missed, the werewolf again becomes dangerous. 

Because they are so dangerous, werewolves are generally feared and shunned by the wizarding community, making them outcasts. Despite this, Albus Dumbledore arranged for the young Remus to attend Hogwarts, where he was confined during full moons. Though Lupin's condition was kept secret, he was always shy and insecure, and made relatively few friends. As a result, the adult Lupin is mostly a loner and has had difficulty finding employment; he always expects to be treated badly.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Lupin, a werewolf since he was a young boy, had mostly lived a solitary life with relatively few close friends. As a student at Hogwarts, he was nicknamed &quot;Moony&quot; and was one of the four Marauders, along with his fellow Gryffindor Housemates, James Potter (Prongs), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), and Sirius Black (Padfoot). The four became particularly close friends, and though Lupin's condition was kept hidden from students, the other three discovered his secret. They illegally became Animagi, initially to support him, but also to accompany him during his werewolf transformations, releasing him from his monthly confinement in the Shrieking Shack. As the werewolf potion had not been invented yet, Lupin was extremely dangerous when transformed; the other three Marauders, protected while in their animal forms, kept Lupin in check during their nighttime sojourns into the Forbidden Forest and the surrounding countryside. Lily Evans (later Lily Potter) also became Lupin's close friend and confidant while they were at Hogwarts, unconcerned and non-judgmental regarding his condition. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who the other Marauders detested, was also a Hogwarts student at that time. After James and Lily were murdered (as Peter Pettigrew presumably was), and Sirius was sentenced to Azkaban, Lupin was once again mostly friendless.

Lupin greatly admired Professor Dumbledore, and was always grateful for his allowing him to attend Hogwarts, despite his being a werewolf. Dumbledore continued to help Lupin by hiring him as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in book 3, knowing Lupin would be a highly competent instructor. Lupin was an immediate favourite, except with Slytherin students, who continually mocked his shabby robes. Not only the students liked him; he was also well-regarded by the faculty, due to his congenial personality and evident competence. Only Snape disliked him, still holding a grudge against Lupin for his close association with his two Hogwarts nemeses: James Potter and Sirius Black. Snape also coveted the DADA position that Lupin occupied. Despite Snape's animosity, he diligently prepared Lupin's monthly werewolf potion, though, angry when Lupin aided fugitive Sirius Black's escape, later informed students about Lupin's condition, forcing Lupin to resign.

Lupin also joined the Order of the Phoenix, and grew close to Arthur and Molly Weasley, also members. He was on friendly terms with &quot;Mad Eye&quot; Moody, another key Order of the Phoenix member who appeared to regard Lupin favourably. Sirius Black and Lupin were reunited after Sirius escapes Azkaban prison, though he was killed two years later during the Battle at the Ministry. In later books, Lupin became a reassuring, stable presence to Harry. While Harry's godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], had more claim to Harry's affection, Harry was occasionally alarmed by Sirius' impetuous and sometimes erratic behavior. Harry would have liked having more time to talk with Lupin, who by then was often away on Order of the Phoenix business, giving Harry less opportunity to spend time with him.

Lupin was close to Harry, and became more so after Sirius' death, though never in the same way as Harry and Sirius were. Sirius had been Harry's father-figure, while Lupin was like an uncle. Lupin continued to guide Harry, who was still developing as a wizard. In ''Deathly Hallows'', they had a brief falling out, however, when Lupin intended to leave Tonks, believing he was an unfit husband and father, and that she would be better off without him. Harry, having lost so many loved ones, was furious that Lupin would consider abandoning his wife and unborn child during such perilous times. Though Harry's harsh words deeply wounded Lupin, causing him to storm out in anger, he later realized Harry was right, and he returned to Tonks. He and Harry eventually reconcile, and Harry became godfather to Lupin and Tonks' newborn son, Teddy.

The burgeoning relationship between Lupin and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] began at the end of ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. Perhaps characteristically, Lupin tried to prevent it, believing he was an unsuitable match and that it was too dangerous a time to consider starting a family. This shows another side to Lupin: he cared so much about the larger picture that he sometimes neglected the smaller one. By refusing to risk bringing a child into the mess that seemed to be their future, he caused pain to himself and to Tonks in their present. He and Tonks overcame these differences and married, having a son soon after.

== Analysis ==

===Professor Lupin===

Unlike with some previous Defence Against the Dark Arts instructors, the other professors are pleased with Professor Lupin's appointment – [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Poppy Pomfrey]] comments approvingly about him knowing remedies, and in a later book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] refers to him as a &quot;''competent'' teacher&quot; – high praise indeed from her. The one exception is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who, apart from coveting the Dark Arts position for himself, still harbours deep resentments against Lupin for his association with the other Marauders during their Hogwarts years, though it was James Potter and Sirius Black who tormented Snape.

Lupin immediately wins the entire class' respect, first by putting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] to flight, and second, by teaching a truly useful and practical first lesson. His caring about, and warmth towards his students becomes visible by numerous small actions – he calls students by their first names, rather than their surnames as is traditional in the Engish school system – and also by larger things: he has Neville take the first turn at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]], and grants him last shot as well, thereby boosting his confidence. He also freely explains why he prevented Harry from facing the Boggart, and tells Harry that his reaction to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] does not indicate weakness. His volunteering to teach Harry to fight Dementors reflects his nature; he cares, so he will help.

===Loyalty to Dumbledore===

Growing up as a werewolf made Lupin into a loner and outcast but he was immensely loyal to his friends. After Lupin became a werewolf, his parents believed it impossible for him to attend Hogwarts. However, Dumbledore was sympathetic, and told the Lupins that he would never deny Remus an education as long as certain precautions were implemented. After Lupin left Hogwarts, he found it nearly impossible for a werewolf to find a job in the wizarding community. Dumbledore eventually offered him the position as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Because Dumbledore was so kind to him, Lupin proved to be a devoted ally to the Headmaster when the Order of the Phoenix was re-formed, risking his life to carry out Dumbledore's mission to infiltrate Fenrir Greyback's werewolf pack.

===School years===

When Lupin's three best friends, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew discovered he was a werewolf, they decided to support and protect him during his transformations. Because a werewolf is only dangerous to humans, they secretly learned to become [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]] (transforming into an animal at will). An Animagus must register with the Ministry of Magic, although the three never did. During a full moon, they used their new powers to roam Hogwarts' grounds, and later Hogsmeade village, with Lupin in his wolf-like form. When Lupin was with them, he had more control over his actions during his transformations. He was not entirely harmless, however, and his friends carefully guarded him.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#Why are werewolves shunned by people?
#Lupin mentions that he was a Gryffindor prefect, in part so that he would rein in the other three Marauders. Why didn't Lupin try harder to keep his friends out of trouble when they were at Hogwarts?
#Hermione identifies Lupin on the Hogwarts Express by the name embossed in peeling letters on his case, &quot;Professor R. J. Lupin&quot;. Since one is designated Professor only when starting teaching, and Lupin is freshly appointed, why is the embossing old enough to be damaged already?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry loses many paternal role models throughout the series. His father, James, was murdered by Voldemort when Harry was only one-year-old. In ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', his godfather, Sirius Black is killed by Bellatrix Lestrange; his body floats through an arched stone portal covered by a fluttering curtain called the Veil – both literally and metaphorically a veil that he passes beyond, never to return. In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore is killed. In response, Harry feels he can no longer rely on any one person to be his mentor, although, to a lesser extent, Mr. Weasley helps fulfill this role.

It also becomes apparent that Harry has formed a similar attachment to Remus Lupin ever since ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. However, as Harry spends little time with Remus in the later books, this relationship progresses little beyond ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Harry has largely outgrown his need for a father figure, and while he continues to like and respect Lupin, he does not cavil at accusing him of cowardice and abandoning his wife and unborn child. While we are unable to see Lupin's complete reaction to this well-founded accusation, when his son is born, Lupin has not only forgiven Harry, but asks him to be the child's godfather. This leads us to believe that, when given time to reflect on Harry's words, Lupin found them true and accepted their message, no matter that it was delivered hurtfully.

== Overview ==

'''''Peter Pettigrew''''', almost invariably referred to by his nickname &quot;Wormtail&quot;, was a friend of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] at Hogwarts. Unpopular, meek, and magically mediocre, he ingratiated himself with James, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] as a means to enhance and protect himself. At Hogwarts, the foursome became known as &quot;The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marauders|Marauders]].&quot; Immediately following [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s disappearance, Sirius Black was convicted (without a trial) and sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison for Pettigrew's murder.

Pettigrew's wand is chestnut and dragon heartstring.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

While he appears in this book, his identity has not yet been revealed.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

While he appears in this book, his identity still remains unknown.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

At the conclusion, it is revealed that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] rat [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]] is actually Pettigrew in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form. After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] force him back into his human form, they attempt to execute him for betraying James and Lily Potter to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] intervenes and spares his life, believing his father would not want his two best friends to become murderers. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] later tells Harry that his merciful act created a powerful magical pact; Pettigrew now owes Harry a Life Debt that may override his loyalty to Voldemort. As Pettigrew is escorted back to the castle to be turned over to the Dementors, the full moon rises. Lupin transforms into a werewolf; having forgotten to taken his potion, he becomes dangerous. Sirius changes into his dog form to protect the others. During the resulting commotion, Pettigrew escapes and sets out to be reunited with his master, Lord Voldemort.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

In the early parts of the book, Pettigrew cares for Lord Voldemort, who has partially regained his body. We see him in the first chapter, in the Riddle house, where he is heard in conversation with Voldemort, and with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|muggle]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]]. There, they are discussing the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|one Bertha Jorkins]], and plans for the death of one Harry Potter, with the assistance of Voldemort's &quot;one ''true'' servant&quot; at Hogwarts. Pettigrew is somewhat upset that Voldemort does not seem to see him as a true servant, saying that he has cared for Voldemort in their travels, though Voldemort dismisses this, saying that Pettigrew was only there because he wanted to have some of Voldemort's power. 

Shortly after Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Mr. Crouch]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Harry has a dream in which he sees Pettigrew being tortured by Voldemort for having messed something up.

At the conclusion, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] are transported from the Triwizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] maze to a cemetery where the Riddle family is interred. Pettigrew instantly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] Cedric on Voldemort's command, and bonds Harry to a tombstone. During a ritual to restore Voldemort to full power, Pettigrew drops Riddle Sr.'s bone, some of Harry's blood, and his own severed hand into a large cauldron&amp;mdash;Voldemort emerges fully restored. The Dark Lord uses Pettigrew's Dark Mark to summon the remaining Death Eaters and rewards his servant with a magical silvery hand. Harry barely escapes back to Hogwarts with Cedric's body.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]] then reveals to Harry that Pettigrew had brought [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] to Voldemort and had assisted in her torture and murder; through Bertha, they had learned of Barty's still being alive and free, and had traveled to Mr. Crouch's home and placed Bartemius Crouch under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]; and it had been Barty and Pettigrew who had captured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]]. Pettigrew had been responsible for Mr. Crouch gaining his freedom and making his way to Hogwarts; he had been suitably punished for his lapse of attention, and Barty had eliminated the problem by killing Bartemius, his father.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Pettigrew appears in this book, much younger, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], friends of Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and James Potter. In this episode, James and Sirius are tormenting a young [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]; neither Remus nor Pettigrew takes part in this, though they are present.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Pettigrew is seen only in the first chapter of the book, where he is acting as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s servant, and possibly spying on Snape for Voldemort. Snape orders him to bring drinks for his guests; Pettigrew complains that this is not why he was sent to Snape, but Snape overrules him. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] starts outlining why she has come to see Snape, Snape stops her. He fires a spell through the bookcase and apparently catches Pettigrew listening in; Pettigrew is heard to yelp and retreat.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

At the beginning of the book, Voldemort is interrupted by loud moaning from under the room in which they are meeting. Voldemort dispatches Pettigrew to quiet their &quot;guest.&quot;

Harry is captured by Snatchers, and is brought to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], along with Ron, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]]. All except Hermione are taken to a downstairs room which is acting as a prison by Pettigrew. There, they find Voldemort's &quot;guest&quot;, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] appears, Harry has him take Dean, Luna, and Ollivander to safety. Pettigrew is sent to investigate the noise of their departure. Finding nobody in the prison except Harry and Ron, Pettigrew attempts to stop Harry overpowering him, but hesitates in killing him because of his life debt. In retaliation for this hesitation, his silver hand chokes him to death.

== Strengths ==

Pettigrew was given a silver hand by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], and this hand may have certain special abilities, apart from its apparent superhuman strength.

He is also an unregistered Animagus, taking the form of a rat.

== Weaknesses ==

Peter Pettigrew's loyalty is first and foremost to himself. He is loyal to others only when it serves his own interests and purpose. His friendship to James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black was mainly because he was weak, and they protected him. He betrayed them when he decided that his best course lay with Voldemort. In Book 3, he vainly attempts to renew his friendship with Sirius and Lupin when his life is on the line. His appeal to Harry only partially works. Although Harry prevents Black and Lupin from executing him, Harry intends to turn Pettigrew over to the Dementors, making death a more appealing option.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Pettigrew is a very venal character, largely out for the main chance. He tends to ally himself with whoever he sees as being the strongest at the moment, but his loyalty is entirely to himself; he will be loyal to someone as long as nobody comes along who he thinks will do a better job of protecting him.

Before his identity is revealed, he is in disguise as Scabbers, Ron's rat, and like most rats he remains loyal to Ron only as long as he feels Ron can protect him, and as long as he receives some benefit from the association. Until the third book, Scabbers defends himself and Ron against Ron's attackers, but in the third book Crookshanks seems intent on killing him. With the earlier appearance of Sirius Black, association with Ron becomes untenable, so Pettigrew fakes his death, incriminating Crookshanks, and tries to make his own way. It is telling that when he is rediscovered, Scabbers attempts repeatedly to escape from Ron.

== Analysis ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] says &quot;There isn't a one of them (wizards) that turned out bad that wasn't from Slytherin.&quot; Although his statement is somewhat hyperbolic, it seems there is a counter-example. Peter Pettigrew was a friend of James Potter, who was in Gryffindor House; it can be assumed that Sirius Black and Remus Lupin were also Gryffindors, and thus so was Peter, as the books suggest that friendships rarely cross House boundaries. When Hagrid spoke, it was unknown that Peter had turned to the dark side — it appeared he had died at the hands – or wand – of Sirius Black while he was attempting to somehow capture Black. At the time, Sirius was believed to have been Voldemort's second-in-command and had betrayed the Potters. However, the revelation of this &quot;fact,&quot; as it is made in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]] pub in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] comes as a surprise to Hagrid &amp;ndash; his outburst when receiving the news suggests strongly that he had no idea Black was supposedly so high in Voldemort's council. So as far as he was aware at the time he made his blanket statement, Hagrid was correct; the counter-examples mentioned were not known to him at the time.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Will Pettigrew be an asset to Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''?
#Will Pettigrew be true to his debt?
#As Gryffindor house favours courage and bravery above all other attributes, why was Pettigrew chosen for this house? At no point in the series does he demonstrate these features, but rather the opposite, so why did the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] place him in Gryffindor?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Many questions have been raised about Peter Pettigrew's actions. Although Voldemort never trusted him, Pettigrew was the first to return to him, and Voldemort has since chosen him to execute some of his more sensitive missions. So, the question should be asked, during many pivotal events in the series, what was Pettigrew doing?

Let us look at the events on the day the Harry's parents were murdered. Voldemort's intent was to kill Harry, at which he failed. But the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]] he used is harmless to chattels, only killing people, as we can easily see in the Riddle mansion which remained totally undamaged despite the three people within it being murdered by the same curse. And yet, when Sirius Black recounts that day, he states that he saw &quot;the destroyed house... and their bodies&quot; – though possibly not Voldemort's body. And why would the house be destroyed? Would Voldemort have traveled to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] alone? Or would he have brought a lieutenant along? Who better than Pettigrew, who had delivered the secret to Voldemort? And what would Pettigrew have done if his master failed? After the third curse, there is a silence... a silence so long that finally, Pettigrew enters the house to see if something has gone wrong. There, he finds his master apparently dead... and, quite possibly, goes briefly mad, destroying everything that he can lay his wand on, but avoiding Harry, who somehow managed to kill Voldemort. He then departs, carrying Voldemort's body (possibly) and wand (probably), and hides them; he then confronts Sirius, and using his own wand, blows up the street and makes good his escape, leaving Sirius to take the blame. (Later information is inconclusive on this subject. The damage is not as extensive as we are led to believe, and we do not know whether there was a body to remove or not. As Voldemort's body remains after his Killing Curse rebounds in the last chapter of the final book, it is very likely that his body was also present in this instance. It is reasonably certain that Peter did recover the wand, at the least, as he had it when he was nursing the returned Voldemort. It is also entirely possible that, finding his master dead, Pettigrew blasted his way out through the house's side, that being the quickest way to get himself, and possibly Voldemort's body, out of there.)

Twelve years pass, during which Pettigrew hides himself within a Wizarding family, the Weasleys, so that he can remain in touch with the Wizarding World's news. This period ends in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. As a rat cannot wield a wand, Voldemort's wand must have been concealed somewhere during this time.

Between ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' and the start of school in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', Pettigrew locates and rejoins Voldemort, retrieving Voldemort's wand first, while also fetching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] to take her to Voldemort, then assists in her murder; carries Voldemort to Riddle Manor, where Frank Bryce is murdered, then to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.'s]] house, and assists in recruiting him and placing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch Sr.]] under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]; and tends to Voldemort's immediate physical needs. During ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', we know that Barty Crouch Jr. is in Bartemius Crouch Sr.'s house, along with Voldemort and Bartemius. Voldemort will not let him leave, as he still needs too much care. (Of course, once Bartemius escapes, Voldemort has to return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]].) But we rarely see him during ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. In particular, at the Battle in the Ministry, he is conspicuous by his absence. Many escaped Death Eaters are there, as is Voldemort himself. Where is Pettigrew? Is he somewhere within the ministry that can be reached by a rat? And while he is at the house in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Spinner's End|Spinner's End]] at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], where is he through the rest of that book? He cannot follow Snape to Hogwarts. What tasks might he be doing for Voldemort?

We also have one outstanding issue: wands. While tending to Voldemort, Pettigrew apparently uses Voldemort's wand. But once Voldemort has returned fully, he needs his own wand. What wand can Pettigrew use? He cannot just buy one. If it is suspected that he is actually alive, he is certainly a &quot;person of interest&quot; and would be arrested on sight. His original wand was returned to his family, presumably, along with his severed finger. As he must conceal that he is alive, that wand is unavailable. What use to Voldemort is a wizard without a wand, particularly a weak on like Pettigrew? Could this have something to do with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander's]] disappearance?

As it turns out, we never learn what, if any, mission Pettigrew has during ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' or ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. He seems to be performing menial duties for Voldemort in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. And though Ollivander is required to make him a new wand, that is more of a side issue; Voldemort actually captured Ollivander for information regarding why Harry's and Voldemort's wands behaved as they did during the graveyard duel.

:Good point. Limoncello can be made from a variety of alcohols, but some of the best is made with pure spirit - like the Everclear sold in the USA - and diluted back as appropriate. It can also be made with grappa, for a darker limoncello with other flavour contributors. Would you care to update the recipe with your thoughts?

== Webtender ==

The recipe seems to have been taken wholesale from [http://www.webtender.com/db/drink/5094 Webtender]. They do not claim copyright on individual recipes, so it's not a copyvio that needs to be removed, but it still seems like it would be a good idea to adapt it better to this site. Improving the grammar would be a good start. As well as changing the recipe to better match the classic method, as the comment above indicates.

&lt;b&gt;[[Wikipedia:Neurofibromatosis_type_I|Neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1)]]&lt;/b&gt;, along with Neurofibromatosis type II (a.k.a. MISME syndrome), Tuberous Sclerosis, Sturge-Weber, and Von Hippel-Lindau compromise the phakomatosis or neurocutaneous syndromes, all of which have neurologic and dermatologic lesions. This grouping is an artifact of an earlier time in medicine, before the distinct genetic basis of each of these diseases was understood.

==Etiology== 
&lt;b&gt;[[Wikipedia:Neurofibromatosis_type_I|Neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1)]]&lt;/b&gt;, also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is the result of a defect on Chromosome 17.

==Prevalence==
1 in 3000-4000 people.  Half are caused by new mutations (mutation rate is 1 case per 10,000 population).

==Inheritance Pattern==
*Autosomal dominant
*100% penetrance

==Mortality/Morbidity==
*Mean age of death is 54.4 years, compared to 70.1 for the general US population.
*Malignant transformation of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor is 3-15%.

==Diagnostic Criteria==
*Need at least 2
**&gt; 6 cafe au lait spots (larger than 5 mm in children, larger than 15 mm in adults) 
**&gt; 2 pigmented iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules) 
**Axillary, inguinal freckling (Crowe sign) 
**&gt; neurofibroma (or 1 plexiform neurofibroma) 
**optic nerve glioma 
**first-degree relative with NF1 
**dysplasia of greater wing of sphenoid

==Radiologic Findings==
Radiologic Findings:

*Musculoskeletal:  Sphenoid dysplasia (empty orbit sign), pseudarthrosis, ribbon rib deformity, bowing of long bones  
*Spine:  Kyphoscoliosis in thoracic spine, vertebral scalloping, enlarged neural foramina, lateral thoracic meningocele 
*Nerve sheath tumors:  neurofibromas (dumbbell lesion), plexiform neurofibroma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 
*GI tract:  neurofibromas in stomach and bowel which may lead to obstruction/intussusception, small bowel leiomyoma, small bowel malabsorption 
*Eye:  Lisch nodules, optic glioma 
*Skin: cafe-au-lait spots, cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, freckling

== General Overview ==

'''''Hogsmeade''''' is the wizarding village near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The Hogwarts Express stops at Hogsmeade village. It is the only purely Wizard occupied town in Britain.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While we first hear of Hogsmeade in the first book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], at that point it is simply a passing reference to Hogsmeade Station, the terminus of the Hogwarts Express. The fact that there is an actual town there, and the significance of that town, is not explored until the third book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]

Located near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Hogsmeade is &quot;the only non-Muggle settlement in Britain&quot;, and the northern terminus of the Hogwarts Express train line from London.  It was founded by Hengist of Woodcroft, who was fleeing because of the Muggles' oppression, at about the same time as Hogwarts was founded. Hogwarts students that attend the third year or above may, on selected weekends (so-called '''Hogsmeade weekends''') and with parental permission, visit the town and patronize its many shops. 

A memorable feature of Hogsmeade is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], infamous as the &quot;most severely haunted building in Britain&quot;.

=== Hogsmeade merchants ===

*'''Dervish and Banges''', selling and repairing magical items or equipment

*'''Gladrags Wizardwear''', clothes shops
**with shops in London

*'''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|The Hog's Head]]''', a small inn off the main street

*'''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Honeyduke's Sweetshop|Honeyduke's Sweetshop]]''', selling a wide variety of candies, fudges and blocks of chocolates
**owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ambrosius Flume|Ambrosius Flume]] and his wife, who both live over the shop

*'''a post office'''
**has three hundred owls, including some very small Scops owls for &quot;Local Deliveries Only&quot;

*'''Madam Puddifoot's''' tea shop
**owned by Madam Puddifoot
**couples of Hogwarts students are drawn to this shop for an idyllic tête-à-tête

*'''Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop''', selling quills and stationery

*'''The Shrieking Shack''', the &quot;most severely haunted building in Britain&quot;

*'''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|The Three Broomsticks]]''', a pub that also caters to the under-age students
**owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]]
**A favorite drink among the students is butterbeer. Other drinks include gillywater, mulled mead, red currant rum, cherry syrup and soda with ice and an umbrella, and firewhisky for the mature drinkers.

*'''Zonko's Joke Shop''', selling items that can be used for jokes and tricks
**favorite shop of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]]
**the items sold include Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and Nose-Biting Teacups, among other things
**in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 19|book 6]], this shop closes for lack of business when Hogwarts cancels further Hogsmeade weekends

== Analysis ==

As mentioned, Hogwarts students in their third year and later, with parental permission, may visit Hogsmeade on selected weekends. These Hogsmeade weekends, occurring every month or two, are eagerly anticipated by all eligible students, and the school is practically vacant on those days. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is particularly dismayed when he is unable to secure permission from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and must remain behind while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] head off to sample the joys of the village. Harry does eventually get to the village with assistance from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], and later is granted permission by his godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]].

In the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], it is noted that Hogwarts is run on a fairly typical boarding school model. In a boarding school situation, the Town visits typified by the Hogsmeade weekend are used as a way of relieving pressure on the students. The school, acting ''in loco parentis'' for the students, is responsible for them, and therefore must be able to control them at all times. However, keeping them entirely on the school grounds makes school feel like a prison to the students. Thus, allowing the occasional visit off the school property is a release of tension for the students, and likely for the teachers as well. In the series, it allows the introduction of characters from outside the walls of the school, such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], and to a certain extent also allows stories from outside the school to reach the students. Additionally, it provides a place where students can meet outside the confines of the school buildings, and thus supposedly away from observation by teachers.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the town seems to be falling on hard times; in particular, following [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] being injured by a cursed necklace she apparently got in Hogsmeade, all Hogsmeade weekends are canceled. Apparently, Zonko's joke shop closes for lack of business, causing Fred and George to re-think their idea of opening a branch there. The lack of student visits is bound to cause hardship for many other shops in the village as well, including the Three Broomsticks, Honeyduke's, and Madam Puddifoot's, all of which are usually filled to capacity on Hogsmeade weekends.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the town has been placed under a sunset-to-sunrise curfew by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Anyone on the streets after sunset will trigger an alarm, the Caterwaul, which will summon Death Eaters from where they stand watch, apparently The Three Broomsticks. The Hog's Head, it transpires, is suffered to remain operating as a place where business can be transacted without being watched; while the Death Eaters are not happy about not being in control there, they still have business that they prefer to carry out unmonitored by their fellow wizards, Dark or otherwise. The owner of The Hog's Head is able to face down a squad of Death Eaters by offering to close up shop and leave.

One less-obvious factor in the development of the story is the fact that Hogsmeade allows students to meet with characters who are, if not entirely in the underworld of the Wizarding world, at least somewhat more shady than you would expect to find at the school. In particular, we spend some time within the confines of the seedy Hog's Head Inn pub, and meet with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]]. Fletcher, and the areas of the Wizarding world in which he dwells, are necessary to make the story universe complete, and given that they have been introduced, will be vital also for Harry to complete his quest.

It is, in fact, this attention to detail that to a large extent makes the Wizarding world seem so complete. It would be a simpler story if there were only those wizards aligned with Voldemort, and those arrayed against him, but the world would seem to be missing something. Additionally, by painting the world as all either black or white, the author would be diluting her own message. While we see him in many other places, it is in Hogsmeade that we see Fletcher, the opportunist, and how he maneuvers through the world, whether it is the Ministry or Voldemort who is in charge of it; and it is here also that we see the Hog's Head, that survives, not by breaking rules itself, but by turning a blind eye on those who choose to.

&lt;b&gt;Tarsal coalition&lt;/b&gt; is an abnormal union between tarsal bones.  The union can be osseous, fibrous, or cartilaginous.  This causes abnormal articulation within the mid and hind foot which produces accelerated degenerative osteoarthritis of the hindfoot and midfoot.  The frequency of tarsal coalition is approximately 1% and occurs in males more than females.  It is bilateral in 25% of cases.  These numbers are generally accepted and based on symptomatic groups.  Recent post-mortem exams have been performed to attempt to discover the &quot;true&quot; incidence of tarsal coalition.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12568969&amp;dopt=Abstract Solomon, et al], report an incidence of non-osseous coalitions as high as 12.7%!

==Etiology==
Tarsal coalition is an abnormal union between tarsal bones.  The union can be osseous, fibrous, or cartilaginous.  This causes abnormal articulation within the mid and hind foot which produces accelerated degenerative osteoarthritis of the hindfoot and midfoot.  The frequency of tarsal coalition is approximately 1% and occurs in males more than females.  It is bilateral in 25% of cases.  These numbers are generally accepted and based on symptomatic groups.  Recent post-mortem exams have been performed to attempt to discover the &quot;true&quot; incidence of tarsal coalition.  Solomon, ''et al.'', report an incidence of non-osseous coalitions as high as 12.7%!

Etiologies can be congenital or acquired.  Congenital tarsal coalition is the most common and results from a failure of normal tarsal segmentation.  Congenital tarsal coalition classically presents in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life as a painful flatfoot deformity also known as &quot;peroneal spastic flatfoot.&quot;  Acquired tarsal coalition can follow infection, trauma, surgery or inflammatory arthritis.

Which bones are involved?

The calcaneus, talus, navicular and cuboid are commonly affected.  A frequent written boards question asks:  Which is the most common tarsal coalition?  The answer depends on who you ask.  Resnick lists them in this order with the most frequent first:

#Calcaneo-navicular 
#Talo-calcaneal, middle facet 
#Talo-navicular 
#Calcaneo-cuboid

&lt;i&gt;MSK Requisites&lt;/i&gt; lists them this way:

#Talo-calcaneal, middle facet 
#Calcaneo-navicular 
#Talo-navicular 
#Calcaneo-cuboid

In general, calcaneo-navicular and talo-calcaneal are far more common than talo-navicular or calcaneo-cuboid.

==Radiologic Findings==

Plain films classically demonstrate a number of bony abnormalities.  These include:

1. The ant-eater sign:  elongation of the anterior calcaneal process on the lateral view of the foot.  This represents the bony bridging of calcaneo-navicular coalition.

[[Image:Tarsal1.jpg]]

[[Image:Tarsal2.jpg]]



2. Talar beaking:  dorsal beaking of the talar head may indicate underlying tarsal coalition, most commonly talo-calcaneal.  However, it can also indicate Rheumatoid arthritis, DISH and acromegaly.

[[Image:Tarsal3.jpg]]



3. Ball-and-socket mortise joint:  spherical remodeling of the talar dome.  This occurs when the mortise joint gradually takes responsibility for abduction and adduction that is lost when the subtalar joint is fused in talo-calcaneal coalition.

[[Image:Tarsal4.jpg]]

[[Image:Tarsal5.jpg]]



4. Subchondral sclerosis, cortical irregularity and joint space narrowing:  These are all indirect findings of fibrous or cartilaginous coalition.

[[Image:Tarsal6.jpg]]

==Imaging Strategies==
What are the imaging strategies?

Calcaneo-navicular:  A special 45 degree medial oblique projection will generally provide a clear view of the ant-eater sign in a complete osseous coalition.  It will also show joint space narrowing, irregularity and sclerosis in a cartilaginous or fibrous coalition.

[[Image:Tarsal7.jpg]]

&lt;b&gt;Complete osseous&lt;/b&gt;



[[Image:Tarsal8.jpg]]

&lt;b&gt;Cartilaginous or fibrous coalition&lt;/b&gt;



Talo-calcaneal:  The Harris-Beath view, a penetrated posterior oblique image (aka, the penetrated axial view), with the patient standing on the cassette and the beam angled between 35 and 45 degrees to the cassette, is designed to reveal coalition between the sustentaculum and the talus at the middle facet.

[[Image:Tarsal9.jpg]]

CT is usually definitive.  It will clearly show any osseous coalition.  It will also demonstrate the joint space narrowing, sclerosis and irregularity of cartilaginous or fibrous coalition.

[[Image:Tarsal10.jpg]]

[[Image:Tarsal11.jpg]]

Bone scan is sensitive but less specific.  It will show uptake in multiple elements of the hindfoot and midfoot because of altered mechanics and weight-bearing.

==Therapy==
What difference does it make?  What can we do about it?

Most patients with tarsal coalition have a fixed hindfoot valgus of varying severity and some loss of the normal longitudnal arch. Peroneal muscle tightness develops and the patient complains of vague dorsolateral foot pain centered on the sinus tarsi, difficulty walking on uneven surfaces, foot fatigue and occasionally a painful limp.

There are three common therapeutic options for calcaneo-navicular coalition.  
#Interval casting:  The least invasive approach consists of 4 - 6 week periods of casting to relieve symptoms without surgical intervention.  If this doesn't work then an operation may be necessary. 
#Resection of the calcaneo-navicular bar:  Resection is followed by fat or muscle inerposition to prevent re-unification.  Various degrees of success have been reported.  Approximately 70% report complete or near complete resolution of symptoms and do not need further intervention (Campbell's Operative Orthopedics).  But there is one more option for the other 30%. 
#Arthrodesis:  Standard triple arthrodesis, including subtalar, talo-navicular and calcaneo-cuboid joints, is performed as the definitive therapy. 

And the therapies for talo-calcaneal coalition:
#Interval casting can also relieve symptoms for this type of coalition. 
#Triple arthrodesis.

== General Overview ==

The longtime London residence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|the Black family]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|Pureblood]] wizards, Number Twelve is the house where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] grew up, and which he inherited upon his mother's death, along with its mad and treacherous [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-Elf]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]]. Decorated and furnished in gloomy, largely Slytherin themes, and filled with Dark Arts tools, tomes and objects, Number Twelve has seen use as the headquarters of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]], the covert pro-Light organization headed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. In its pro-Light use, it is protected from discovery by being placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius]] charm, with Dumbledore as its Secret-Keeper.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== Location ===

The house is located in London, between two Muggle houses. Being protected by a Fidelius charm, it is unplottable and cannot be accessed by intruders, either Muggles or wizards who don't know its secret. To access the house, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] stood between numbers eleven and thirteen, thinking that &quot;the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.&quot; The only reason this worked for him is that the note he had seen this on had been written by Albus Dumbledore, the secret-keeper for the organization; the effect of the Fidelius charm is that only those who are informed directly by the Secret-keeper can know the secret.

=== Exterior ===

Much of the time, the house is hidden to all onlookers. When it is visible, it is one in a row of similar houses, with a front door at the top of a flight of steps, badly in need of paint, and with door hardware in the shape of snakes.

=== Interior ===

Once through the front door we see &quot;old-fashioned gas lamps all along the walls, peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls, with a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll's leg, with a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall.&quot; The heads belonged to house-elves. &quot;All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.&quot;

US readers may be confused by the description of the &quot;parlour, on the first floor&quot;, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] looking down, rather than out, at the front stoop and seeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus]] with his collection of cauldrons that had &quot;fallen off the back of a broom&quot;. The house is actually laid out in the extremely vertical, UK style, with the floor naming conventional for UK buildings. Starting at the basement, then, the rooms we know about are:
* The kitchen in the basement, as is conventional for a UK house with space for servants. Often, there is access to the kitchen from an &quot;areaway&quot;, a sunken, paved yard, but not always, and apparently in the case of the Black house, not at all. What natural light there is in the kitchen seems to come from ground-level windows set high in the walls.
* The main floor, in this case, containing the entrance hall.
* The first floor, above the main floor, which contains at least the parlour, and possibly other rooms.
* The second floor, containing at least two bedrooms, one of which is occupied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]].
* An apparent third floor, containing a bedroom used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]], and possibly one used by Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]].
* The fourth floor, containing bedrooms originally occupied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus]].
* Attic space, in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] lived.

It is possible that there was additionally a formal dining room on the first floor, beside the parlour, and although we never see it, there may be an additional sitting room on the main floor. It is likely that there would be servants' bedrooms in the basement, and it is possible that Sirius' and Regulus' bedrooms were designed originally as servants quarters as well. There must be at least one more bedroom, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] sleep when they are in London on Order business; most likely this is on the same floor as the room shared by Harry and Ron. We are also told, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], who had been absent, was found in the attic, and had apparently been staying in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Sirius' mother's]] old room. This suggests that Sirius' mother, Walburga, may have slept in the attic space, but the book remains mute on whether her husband also slept up there, or whether Walburga changed rooms after he passed away.

When we are introduced to the house in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], it is dirty and infested with magical vermin.  The house elf [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] has been living there alone for at least a decade, taking orders only from the incoherent and insane portrait of Sirius' mother in the entrance hall, and has neglected his cleaning chores. The Weasleys, Harry and Hermione spend many days cleaning and removing vermin and rubbish.  Eventually the house is made more habitable but remains a gloomy place. When we meet Sirius' mother in her portrait, she screams and insults the newcomers constantly, only stopping when the owner of the house, in this case Sirius, returns her to her slumber by drawing the curtains over her portrait, an act that apparently takes considerable force.

=== Ownership ===

As mentioned, the house had been inherited by Sirius, as the last Black male descendant, on the death of his mother. As Sirius had by this time betrayed the family's Blood status by consorting with Muggles, the death of Sirius' only younger brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus]], apparently at the hands of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], must have been a severe blow to Walburga, and may have hastened her death. Sirius does not seem to be upset at having missed her death, which occurred while he was imprisoned.

At Sirius' death, at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', the house passes to Harry, according to the terms of Sirius' will. There is some question, however, of whether the house is magically entailed, such that ownership passes to the eldest surviving Black male, or failing that, to the eldest surviving Black female, who would be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]. At the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Professor Dumbledore tests this by summoning Kreacher and having Harry give him an order. If the house, with Kreacher, have passed to Harry, Kreacher will be bound to follow Harry's orders despite his hatred of Harry. As it turns out, Kreacher does follow Harry's orders, so the house has passed to Harry, and presumably may continue to be used as the headquarters of the Order.

With the death of Dumbledore, the house is once again abandoned. As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] had proven to be a traitor to the Order, and was privy to its secrets, the use of the house as Headquarters was not safe. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Hermione did end up living in the house through the month of August in the seventh year of our story, but were in turn forced to abandon it when its location was revealed to another [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]].

With the house becoming habitable under the ministrations of the changed Kreacher, it is entirely possible that Harry ended up living there once he was finished with school.

It is perhaps worth mention that Sirius, while he was a student at Hogwarts, had liberally decorated his bedroom with items relating to Gryffindor house, and had fastened them to the wall with Permanent Sticking Charms, possibly as a way of rebelling against his parents. Regulus, on the other hand, had similarly decorated his room with Slytherin house imagery.

== Analysis ==

It is a safe assumption that the house was built by Muggles and purchased or otherwise taken over by the Black family, because of how similar the house appears to be to its neighbours on either side. While we are not directly told of this similarity, we can infer it by the lack of comment on any appearance of strangeness, when Harry first sees the house. When Harry first sights [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]], he thinks how it seems to be held together by magic; the fact that he makes no similar comment regarding Grimmauld Place indicates normality of its appearance.

We are told, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], that Harry hears the Twins laughing from their bedroom above his room. From this we infer their bedroom being directly over Harry and Ron's room. The two bedrooms at the top of the house, we are told in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], belong to Sirius and Regulus. It is safe to assume in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' that Sirius is in his old room, and that Regulus' room remains empty, because when the Trio want to get in they discover that it is locked and Hermione must unlock it, and if anyone from the Order was using it they likely would have left it unlocked. It is based on this that we have inferred the layout of the house, as noted above.

The street address, Grimmauld Place, is clearly based on &quot;grim old place&quot;, an apt description of the house as it appears when we first see it. Like so many place and character names in this series, the name is clearly chosen based on the character of the house; while this might seem a bit heavy handed on the part of the author, we must recall that the books were written, at least initially, for children. We note that the author does not belabour the name's origin by having her characters comment on it.

It may be worth noting, as part of the internal consistency of the story, that the house-elf Kreacher is treated as a chattel, part of the fittings of the house, by all characters except Hermione. We can't be certain what Kreacher thinks, but his reactions throughout seem to indicate that he feels that he is a part of the house, no matter how much he disapproves of those within it. He treats Hermione the same as everyone else, leading us to believe he simply does not understand Hermione's overtures. This topic is discussed in somewhat greater depth in the articles on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elves]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Included Content ==

The Beginner reader is not expected to have fully explored the Harry Potter storyline. A Beginner reader is assumed to have read perhaps one or two of the books (maybe even none at all). Pages marked for Beginners include some short synopses of the book plots, brief introductions to some of the key characters in the series, and overviews of several important locations where many important events happen in the series.

== Excluded Content ==

Much of the Harry Potter series has yet to be explored. A great majority of the character list as well as all of the chapter summaries are beyond the Beginner level.

== What's Next ==

Once the reader has completed more of the Harry Potter series, the next step is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Intermediate|Intermediate]] level. The Intermediate level details much more of the storyline and is suited for a reader who has nearly completed reading the series.

The Intermediate reader is expected to be rather well-versed in the whole Harry Potter storyline. Much of the plot is known to the reader and he/she wishes to expand on that with analysis and commentary. Most of the character pages and sections are open. In addition, Intermediate readers have access to chapter summaries for referencing specific details.

== Excluded Content ==

Not much is kept from the Intermediate reader. Most major content is covered - filling in the gaps is all that is left. An Intermediate reader should feel knowledgeable about the topics covered in the books, but perhaps not quite grasping the full importance of scenes and character actions, referred to as the ''Greater Picture'' which is excluded until the reading of the series can be finished.

== What's Next ==

Once the reader has completed the entire Harry Potter series, the next step is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Introduction/Advanced|Advanced]] level. The Advanced level details the entire storyline. Advanced readers have access to the ''Greater Picture'' section seen on many pages - it connects all the pieces together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Included Content ==

The Advanced reader should be knowledgeable in all areas of the Harry Potter series. No topic has been left unaddressed and all commentary/analysis is understood. Every page and section is accessible, including ''Greater Picture'', to make sure that all aspects of the plot have been covered and understood in order to realize the full magnitude of scenes and relationships in the storyline.

== Excluded Content ==

Nothing is kept from the Advanced reader. The Advanced reader has free rein over all content in the Guide.

== What's Next ==

There is no step past the Advanced level. Advanced readers are asked to review analysis and questions to make sure content is understood. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Index|Index]] page should prove most useful for reference purposes.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Conce. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Conce~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

== Introduction ==
''Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics.'' -- [[w:Carl Friedrich Gauss|Carl Friedrich Gauss]] 1777 - 1855

In the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Primes|Primes and Modular Arithmetic]] section, we discussed the elementary properties of a prime and its connection to modular arithmetic. For the most part our attention has been restricted to arithmetic mod ''p'', where ''p'' is prime.

In this chapter, we start by discussing some more elementary results in arithmetic modulo a prime ''p'', and then moving on to discuss those results modulo ''m'' where ''m'' is composite. In particular, we will take a closer look at the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), and how it allows us to break arithmetic modulo ''m'' into ''components''. From that point of view, the CRT is an extremely powerful tool that can help us unlock the many secrets of modulo arithmetic (with relative ease).

Lastly, we will introduce the idea of an ''abelian group'' through multiplication in modular arithmetic and discuss the discrete log problem which underpins one of the most important cryptographic systems known today.

'''Assumed knowledge'''
''In this chapter we assume the reader can find inverses and be able to solve a system of congruences (Chinese Remainder Theorem) (see: [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Primes|Primes and Modular Arithmetic]]).''

=== Wilson's Theorem ===
Wilson's theorem is a simple result that leads to a number of interesting observations in elementary number theory. It states that, if ''p'' is prime then
:&lt;math&gt;1\cdot 2\cdot 3 \cdots (p-1) \equiv p - 1 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
We know the inverse of ''p'' - 1 is ''p'' - 1, so each other number can be paired up by its inverse and ''eliminated''. For example, let ''p'' = 7, we consider
:1 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; .. &amp;times; 6 &amp;equiv; (2 &amp;times; 4) &amp;times; (3 &amp;times; 5) &amp;times; 1 &amp;times; 6 = 6
What we have done is that we paired up numbers that are inverses of each other, then we are left with numbers whose inverse is itself. In this case, they are 1 and 6.

But there is a technical difficulty. For a general prime number, ''p'', how do we know that 1 and ''p'' - 1 are the only numbers in mod ''p'' which when squared give 1? For ''m'' not a prime, there are more than 2 solutions to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''m''), for example, let ''m'' = 15, then x = 1, 14, 4, 11 are solutions to x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''m'').

However, we can show that there can only be (at most) two solutions to x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p'') when ''p'' is prime. We do that by a simple ''proof by contradiction'' argument. You may want to skip the following proof and come up with your own justification of why Wilson's theorem is true.

Let ''p'' be a prime, and x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p''). We aim to prove that there can only be 2 solutions, namely x = 1, -1
:{|-
|align = right | &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;        || &lt;math&gt; \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                    &lt;math&gt;(x - 1)(x + 1) \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
it obvious from the above that ''x'' = 1, -1 (&amp;equiv; ''p'' - 1) are solutions. Suppose there is another solution, ''x'' = ''d'', and ''d'' not equal to 1 or -1. Since ''p'' is prime, we know ''d'' - 1 must have an inverse. We substitute ''x'' with ''d'' and multiply both sides by the inverse, i.e.
:{|-
|                 &lt;math&gt;(d - 1)(d + 1) \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align = right | &lt;math&gt; d + 1         \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;    
|-
| align = right | &lt;math&gt; d             \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; = -1 \!&lt;/math&gt;    
|}
but we our initial assumption was that ''d'' &amp;ne; -1. This is a contradiction. Therefore there can only be 2 solutions to x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p'').

=== Fermat's little Theorem ===
There is a remarkable little theorem named after [[w:Fermat|Fermat]], the prince of amateur mathematicians. It states that if ''p'' is prime and given ''a'' &amp;ne; 0 then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt;
This theorem hinges on the fact that ''p'' is prime. Recall that if ''p'' is prime then ''a'' &amp;ne; 0 has an inverse. So for any ''b'' and ''c'' we must have
:&lt;math&gt; ab \equiv ac \pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; b \equiv c\pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt;

A simple consequence of the above is that the following numbers must all be different mod ''p''
:''a'', 2''a'' , 3''a'', 4''a'', ..., (''p''-1)''a''
and there are ''p'' - 1 of these numbers! Therefore the above list is just the numbers 1, 2, ... ''p'' - 1 in a different order. Let's see an example, take ''p'' = 5, and ''a'' = 2:
:1, 2, 3, 4
multiply each of the above by 2 in mod 5, we get
:2, 4, 1, 3
They are just the original numbers in a different order.

So for any ''p'' and using Wilson's Theorem (recall: 1 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; ... &amp;times; (p-1) &amp;equiv; -1), we get
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;a\cdot 2a\cdots (p-1)a \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;1\cdot 2 \cdots (p-1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                                                  || &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;-1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
on the other hand we also get 
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;a\cdot 2a\cdots (p-1)a \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1}(1\cdot 2 \cdots (p-1))&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                                                  || &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;-a^{p-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Equating the two results, we get
:{|-
|align = right |&lt;math&gt;-a^{p-1} \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; -1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
which is essentially Fermat's little theorem.

== Modular Arithmetic with a general m ==
=== *Chinese Remainder Theorem revisited* ===
This section is rather theoretical, and is aimed at justifying the arithmetic we will cover in the next section. Therefore it is not necessary to fully understand the material here, and the reader may safely choose to skip the material below.

Recall the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) we covered in the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Primes/Modular Arithmetic|Modular Arithmetic]] section. In states that the following congruences
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv b \pmod{n_1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv c \pmod{n_2} \!&lt;/math&gt;
have a solution if and only if gcd(''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'',''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') divides (''b'' - ''c'').

This deceptively simple theorem holds the key to arithmetic modulo ''m'' (not prime)! We shall consider the case where ''m'' has only two prime factors, and then the general case shall follow.

Suppose ''m'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''p'' and ''q'' are distinct primes, then every natural number below ''m'' (0, 1, 2, ..., m - 1) corresponds ''uniquely'' to a system of congruence mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and mod ''q''&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;. This is due to the fact that gcd(''p''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;,''q''&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1, so it divides all numbers.

Consider a number ''n'', it corresponds to
:&lt;math&gt;n \equiv x_n \pmod{p^i} \!&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;n \equiv y_n \pmod{q^j} \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''r'' &amp;ne; ''n'' then ''r'' corresponds to
:&lt;math&gt;r \equiv x_r \pmod{p^i} \!&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;r \equiv y_r \pmod{q^j} \!&lt;/math&gt;
Now since ''r'' and ''n'' are different, we must have either ''x''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and/or ''y''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; 

For example take &lt;math&gt;m = 12= 2^2\times 3&lt;/math&gt;, then we can construct the following table showing the &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; for each ''n'' (0, 1, 2 ... 11)
:{|-
| &lt;b&gt;''n''&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;''n'' (mod 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;/b&gt;|| &lt;b&gt;''n'' (mod 3)&lt;/b&gt;

Note that as predicted each number corresponds ''uniquely'' to two different systems of congruences mod 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and mod 3.

and that
:&lt;math&gt;nr \equiv x_nx_r \pmod{p^i} \!&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;nr \equiv y_ny_r\pmod{q^j} \!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Arithmetic with CRT ===
Exercise 2 above gave the biggest indication yet as to how the CRT can help with arithmetic modulo ''m''. It is not essential for the reader to fully understand the above at this stage. We will proceed to describe how CRT can help with arithmetic modulo ''m''. In simple terms, the CRT helps to break a modulo-''m'' calculation into smaller calculations modulo prime factors of ''m''.

As always, let's consider a simple example first. Let &lt;math&gt;m = 63 = 3^2\ \times \ 7&lt;/math&gt; and we see that ''m'' has two distinct prime factors. We should demonstrate multiplication of 51 and 13 modulo 63 in two ways. Firstly, the standard way
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;51\times 13 \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;663 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;10\times 63 + 33\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|                            || &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;33 \pmod{63} \!&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
Alternatively, we notice that
:&lt;math&gt;51 \equiv 6 \pmod{9} \!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;51 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
We can represent the two expressions above as a two-tuple (6,2). We abuse the notation a little by writing 51 = (6,2). Similarly, we write 13 = (4,6). When we do multiplication with two-tuples, we multiply ''component-wise'', i.e. (''a'',''b'') &amp;times; (''c'',''d'') = (''ac'',''bd''),
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;51\times 13 \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;(6,2)\times (4,6) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;(24,12) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;(2\times 9+ 6, 7 + 5) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            || &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt; (6,5) \!&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
Now let's solve 
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 6 \pmod{9} \!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we write x = 6 + 9''a'', which is the first congruence equation, and then
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;6 + 9a \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;5 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align=right|&lt;math&gt;2a \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;6 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align=right|&lt;math&gt; a \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;3 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
therefore we have ''a'' = 3 + 7''b'', substitute back to get
:&lt;math&gt;x = 6 + 9(3+7b) = 33 + 63b \equiv 33 \pmod{63} \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is the same answer we got from multiplying 51 and 13 (mod 63) the standard way!

Let's summarise what we did. By representing the two numbers (51 and 13) as two two-tuples and multiplying ''component-wise'', we ended up with another two-tuple. And this two-tuple corresponds to the product of the two numbers (mod ''m'') via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

We will do two more examples. Let &lt;math&gt;m = 88 = 2^3\times 11&lt;/math&gt;, and lets multiply 66 and 40 in two ways. Firstly, the standard way
{|-
|&lt;math&gt;66 \times 40 \!&lt;/math&gt;||     &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;2640 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; =      \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;30\times 88 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;0 \pmod{88} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and now the second way, 40 = (0,7) and 66 = (4,0) and
{|-
|&lt;math&gt;66 \times 40 \!&lt;/math&gt;||     &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;(0,7)\times (4,0)\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; =      \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;(0,0) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;0 \pmod{88} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For the second example, we notice that there is no need to stop at just two distinct prime factors. We let &lt;math&gt;m = 975 = 3\times 5^2\times 13&lt;/math&gt;, and multiply 900 and 647 (mod 975),
{|-
|&lt;math&gt;900\times 647\!&lt;/math&gt;||     &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;582300 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;225 \pmod{975} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
For the other way, we note that 900 &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 3) &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 25) &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 13),  and for 647 &amp;equiv; 2 (mod 3) &amp;equiv; 22 (mod 25) &amp;equiv; 10 (mod 13),
{|-
|&lt;math&gt;900\times 647\!&lt;/math&gt;||     &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;(0,0,3)\times (2,22,10)\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;(0,0,30) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;(0,0,4) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
now if we solve the following congruences
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 4 \pmod{13} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
then we will get ''x'' &amp;equiv; 225!

'''Why?'''
If anything, breaking modular arithmetic in ''m'' into smaller components seems to be quite a bit of work. Take the example of multiplications, firstly, we need to express each number as a ''n''-tuple (''n'' is the number of distinct prime factors of ''m''), multiply component-wise and then solve the resultant ''n'' congruences. Surely, it must be more complicated than just multiplying the two numbers and then reduce the result modulo ''m''. So why bother studying it at all?

By breaking a number ''m'' into prime factors, we have gained insight into how the arithmetic really works. More importantly, many problems in modular ''m'' can be difficult to solve, but when broken into components it suddenly becomes quite easy, e.g. Wilson's Theorem for a general ''m'' (discussed below).

==== Exercises ====
1. Show that addition can also be done component-wise.

2. Multiply component-wise 32 and 84 (mod 134).

=== Euler totient ===
To discuss the more general form of Wilson's Theorem and Fermat's Little Theorem in mod ''m'' (not prime), it's nice to know a simple result from the famous mathematician Euler. More specifically, we want to discuss a function, called the Euler totient function (or Euler Phi), denoted &amp;phi;.

The &amp;phi; functions does a very simple thing. For any natural number ''m'', &amp;phi;(''m'') gives the number of ''n'' &lt; ''m'', such that gcd(''n'',''m'') = 1. In other words, it calculates how many numbers in mod ''m'' have an inverse. We will discuss the value of &amp;phi;(m) for simple cases first and then derive the formula for a general ''m'' from the basic results.

For example, let ''m'' = 5, then &amp;phi;(''m'') = 4. As 5 is prime, all non-zero natural numbers below 5 (1,2,3 and 4) are coprimes to it. So there are 4 numbers in mod 5 that have inverses. In fact, if ''m'' is prime then &amp;phi;(''m'') = ''m'' - 1.

We can generalise the above to ''m'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; where ''p'' is prime. In this case, we try to employ a counting argument to calculate &amp;phi;(''m''). Note that there are ''p''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; natural numbers below ''m'' (0, 1, 2 ... ''p''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; - 1), and so &amp;phi;(''m'') =  ''p''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; - (number of ''n'' &amp;lt; ''m'' such that gcd(''n'',''m'') &amp;ne; 1). We did that because it is easier to count the number of ''n'' 's without an inverse mod ''m''.

An element, ''n'', in mod ''m'' does not have an inverse if and only if it shares a common factor with ''m''. But all factors of ''m'' (not equal to 1) are a multiple of ''p''. So how many multiples of ''p'' are there in mod ''m''? We can list them, they are
:&lt;math&gt;0, p, 2p, \cdots , p^r - p \!&lt;/math&gt;
where the last element can be written as (''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''-1&lt;/sup&gt; - 1)''p'', and so there are &lt;math&gt;p^{r-1} \!&lt;/math&gt; multiples of ''p''. Therefore we can conclude 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi (p^{r}) = p^r - p^{r-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
We now have all the machinery necessary to derive the formula of &amp;phi;(''m'') for any ''m''.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, any natural number ''m'' can be uniquely expressed as the product of primes, that is
:&lt;math&gt;m = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\cdots p_r^{k_r} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for i = 1, 2 ... ''r'' are distinct primes and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers. For example 1225275 = 3&amp;times;5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;17&amp;times;31&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. From here, the reader should try to derive the following result (the CRT may help).

''' Euler totient function &amp;phi; '''
 Suppose ''m'' can be uniquely expressed as below
   &lt;math&gt;m = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\cdots p_r^{k_r} \!&lt;/math&gt;
 then
   &lt;math&gt;\phi(m) = (p_1^{k_1} - p_1^{k_1-1})(p_2^{k_2}-p_2^{k_2-1})\cdots (p_r^{k_r}-p_r^{k_r-1}) \!&lt;/math&gt;

With the Euler totient function we can derive a more general case of Fermat's Little Theorem, that is:

&lt;math&gt;a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod{m} \ &lt;/math&gt;

=== Wilson's Theorem ===
Wilson's Theorem for a general ''m'' states that the product of all the invertible element in mod ''m''
:equals -1 if ''m'' has only one prime factor, or ''m'' = 2''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' for some prime ''p''
:equals 1 for all other cases

An invertible element of mod ''m'' is a natural number ''n'' &lt; ''m'' such that gcd(''n'', ''m'') = 1. A self-invertible element is an element whose inverse is itself.

In the proof of Wilson's Theorem for a prime ''p'', the numbers 1 to ''p'' - 1 all have inverses. This is not true for a general ''m''. In fact it is certain that (''m'' - 1)! &amp;equiv; 0 (mod ''m''), for this reason we instead consider the product of all invertible elements in mod ''m''. 

For the case where ''m'' = ''p'' is prime we also appealed to the fact 1 and ''p'' - 1 are the only elements when squared gives 1. In fact for ''m'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 and ''m'' - 1 (&amp;equiv; -1)are the only self-invertible elements (see exercise). But for a general ''m'', this is not true. Let's take for example ''m'' = 21. In arithmetic modulo 21 each of the following numbers has itself as an inverse
:1, 20, 8, 13
so how can we say the product of all invertible elements equal to 1?

We use the CRT described above. Let us consider the case where ''m'' = 2''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;. By the CRT, each element in mod ''m'' can be represented as a two tuple (''a'',''b'') where ''a'' can take the value 0 or 1 while ''b'' can take the value 0, 1, ..., or ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; - 1. Each two tuple corresponds uniquely to a pair of congruence equations and multiplication can be performed component-wise.

Using the above information, we can easily list all the self-invertible elements, because (''a'',''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 means (''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = (1,1), so ''a'' is an invertible element in mod 2 and ''b'' is an invertible element in mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, so ''a'' &amp;equiv; 1 or -1, ''b'' &amp;equiv; 1 or -1. But in mod 2 1 &amp;equiv; -1, so ''a'' = 1. Therefore, there are two elements that are self invertible in mod ''m'' = 2''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, they are (1,1) = 1, and (1, -1) = m - 1 . So in this case, the result is the same as when ''m'' has only a single prime factor.

For the case where ''m'' has more than one prime factors and ''m''&amp;ne; 2''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''. Let say ''m'' has ''n'' prime factors then ''m'' can be represented as a ''n''-tuple. Let say ''m'' has 3 distinct prime factors, then all the self-invertible elements of ''m'' are
# (1,1,1)
# (1,1,-1)
# (1,-1,1)
# (1,-1,-1)
# (-1,1,1)
# (-1,1,-1)
# (-1,-1,1)
# (-1,-1,-1)
their product is (1,1,1) which corresponds to 1 in mod ''m''.

==== Exercise ====
1. Let ''p'' be a prime. Show that in arithmetic modulo ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 and ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 are the only self-invertible elements.

''...more to come''

=== Fermat's Little Theorem ===
As mentioned in the previous section, not every element is invertible (i.e. has an inverse) mod ''m''. A generalised version of Fermat's Last Theorem uses Euler's Totient function, it states
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m \!&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''a'' &amp;ne; 0 satisfying gcd(''a'',''m'') = 1. This is easy to see from the generalised version of Wilson's Theorem. We use a similar technique from the prove of Fermat's Little Theorem. We have
:&lt;math&gt;(ab_1)(ab_2)\cdots (ab_{\phi(m)}) \equiv b_1b_2\cdots b_{\phi(m)} \pmod m&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s are all the invertible elements mod ''m''. By Wilson's theorem the product of all the invertible elements equals to, say, ''d'' (= 1 or -1). So we get
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\phi(m)}d \equiv d \pmod m \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is essentially the statement of Fermat's Little Theorem.

Although the FLT is very neat, it is ''imprecise'' in some sense. For example take ''m'' = 15 = 3 &amp;times; 5, we know that if ''a'' has an inverse mod 15 then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;phi;(15)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 15). But 8 is too large, all we need is 4, by that we mean, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 15) for all ''a'' with an inverse (''the reader can check'').

The Carmichael function &amp;lambda;(''m'') is the smallest number such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;(m)&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''m'') for invertible ''a''. A question in the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Further Modular Arithmetic/Problem Set|Problem Set]] deals with this function.

== Two-torsion Factorisation ==
It it quite clear that factorising a ''large'' number can be extremely difficult. For example, given that 76372591715434667 is the product of two primes, can the reader factorise it? Without the help of a good computer algebra software, the task is close to being impossible. As of today, there is no known ''efficient'' all purpose algorithm for factorising a number into prime factors.

However, under certain special circumstances, factorising can be easy. We shall consider the two-torsion factorisation method. A two-torsion element in modular ''m'' arithmetic is a number ''a'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''m'').

Let's consider an example in arithmetic modulo 21. Note that using the CRT we can represent any number in mod 21 as a two-tuple. We note that the two-torsion elements are 1 = (1,1), 13 = (1,-1), 8 = (-1,1) and 20 = (-1,-1). Of interest are the numbers 13 and 8, because 1 and 20 (&amp;equiv; - 1) are obviously two-torsion, we call these numbers trivially two-torsion.

Now, 13 + 1 = (1,-1) + (1,1) = (2,0). Therefore 13 + 1 = 14 is an element sharing a common factor with 21, as the second component in the two-tuple representation of 14 is zero. Therefore GCD(14,21) = 7 is a factor of 21.

The above example is very silly because anyone can factorise 21. But what about 24131? Factorising it is not so easy. But, if we are given that 12271 is a non-trivial (i.e. &amp;ne; 1 or -1) two-torsion element, then we can conclude that both gcd(12271 + 1,24131) and gcd(12271 - 1,24131) are factors of 24131. Indeed gcd(12272,24131) = 59 and gcd(12270,24131) = 409 are both factors of 24131.

More generally, let ''m'' be a composite, and ''t'' be a non-trivial two-torsion element mod ''m'' i.e. ''t'' &amp;ne; 1, -1. Then
:gcd(''t'' + 1,''m'') divides ''m'', and
:gdc(''t'' - 1,''m'') divides ''m''
this can be explained using the CRT.

We shall explain the case where ''m'' = ''pq'' and ''p'' and ''q'' are primes. Given ''t'' is a non-trivial two-torsion element, then ''t'' has representaion (1,-1) or (-1,1). Suppose ''t'' = (-1,1) then ''t'' + 1 = (-1,1) + (1,1) = (0,2), therefore ''t'' + 1 must be a multiple of ''p'' therefore gcd(''t'',''m'') = ''p''. In the other case where ''t'' - 1 = (-1,1) - (1,1) = (-2,0) and so gcd(''t'' - 1,m) = ''q''.

So if we are given a non-trivial two-torsion element then we have effectively found one (and possibly more) prime factors, which goes a long way in factorising the number. In most modern public key cryptography applications, to break the system we need only to factorise a number with two prime factors. In that regard two-torsion factorisation method is frightening effectively.

Of course, finding a non-trivial two-torsion element is not an easy task either. So internet banking is still safe for the moment. By the way 76372591715434667 = 224364191 &amp;times; 340395637.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Subpages}}
The purpose of this book is to provide support and advice for those of us who have fallen victim (or perhaps been saved) by male pattern baldness. For more information on the causes, please refer to a different source, as the aim of this work is ''personal acceptance''.

== Why me? ==
Baldness can strike a man at any age. It has been reported that baldness can begin anywhere from the early teen years onward into adulthood. Of course, the earlier this happens, the more likely it will have a negative affect on the individual's self esteem and consequent social interactions. This results typically in one of a few possible courses of action.

# The person becomes depressed, and takes no action
# The person gets angry, and withdraws from social interaction
# The person becomes desperate, and invests large (or small) amounts of money in supposed baldness cures, treatments, and procedures
# The person pretends/acts like nothing has changed, and is unaffected
# The person takes steps to hide their hair loss without attempting to &quot;cure&quot; it.

The most common question that one facing male pattern baldness will ask himself is &quot;Why me?&quot;. The fact is, male pattern baldness is hereditary. Other forms of hair loss however, do not fit under this category. So one has to ask themselves, are any of my relatives bald/balding? One cannot simple follow the idea that baldness comes only from the mother's father. Baldness can be inherited from a father, grandfather, or even through the mother as a recessive gene.

== Is there any hope my hair will grow back? ==
Pay very close attention this. 
'''There is no scientifically proven, 100% completely effective cure for baldness.'''

Once a hair follicle has died, it will never grow back, or begin to produce new hairs. However there are many misconceptions about baldness. For example:

* If I shave my head, the hair will grow back thicker
* Hairs grow in cycles, right now my hair follicles are in a resting phase
* I'm not balding, I'm just thinning

Lets analyze these for a moment. First, the idea that shaving your head will make your hair grow back thicker is completely false. There is absolutely no evidence to support this, nor does it make any sense on a scientific level.

Secondly, yes, hair does grow in cycles. What you need to realize is that if you are visibly balding, that means you have lost at least half of your hair. This kind of hairloss is not related to the on and off growing cycles of normal healthy hair cells. It is normally to lose hairs every day, but when this amount begins to exceed what is normal, ''visible'' hairloss will occur.

Lastly, balding and thinning are the same process. They are just different stages of progression. Some people experience a thinning of hair in certain areas of the head, whilst others will experience a complete loss of hair in certain parts. If your hair is becoming thinner, this means that your hair follicles are either dying, or becoming weak and consequently only producing tiny, often colorless hairs. &lt;small&gt;Note, some people claim that in this phase, dying your hair produces the illusion of more hair. Others counterclaim that these colorless &quot;baby hairs&quot; are not able to retain the pigment from the dye.&lt;/small&gt;

As we speak, companies are currently researching a new technique that is being called &quot;Hair Cloning&quot;, and sometimes &quot;Hair multiplication&quot;. Until this becomes a commercially available and scientifically proven reality, this should not be considered as a realistic alternative to accepting your baldness.

== Will any woman ever find me attractive? ==
This may come as a surprise to those of us who have just begun to lose our hair, but the answer is yes. Even if you are young, It is a 100% certainty that you can still be attractive to women. Let's consider a few reasons as to why this is:

# Women are attracted to men for reasons beyond hair only, specifically
## Intelligence
## Charisma
## Personal Style
## Social skills
## Education
## Wealth and power
## Muscle mass/Body Physique
## Eyes, voice, etc.
# Baldness is a sign of masculinity and heightened testosterone
# Some women are specifically attracted to bald men
# Some women are completely unconcerned with hair, and instead focus on other traits

If you are only beginning to bald now, or have been bald for a longer period of time but have not taken action on the matter, a good piece of advice is to create an action plan. The most important purpose of an action plan is to build, maintain, and/or restore your confidence and self esteem.

The first step of your action plan is to accept yourself for who you are. You are an individual with a potential that is only limited by your personal desire. You can be, or you already are an attractive person to someone.

== Say no to drugs, rugs, and plugs! ==
Most men that lose their hair go through a phase where they believe that they are a special case, and that they can in fact change their fate and cause their hair to stop falling out. That they are not like every other poor fool who has lost their hair. It is during this phase that the individual is most likely to invest in products which claim to repair, restore, regrow, or otherwise cure baldness completely. Lets look at a few of the more common options that claim to repair or restore hair:

# Chemicals: Rogaine, Propecia, Avacor, etc.
# Supplements: Saw Palmetto
# Surgery: Hair transplant, scalp reduction, etc.
# Others: Laser treatment, scalp massage, etc.

Of course there is a plethora of other products and services that are targeted towards men facing male pattern baldness. But the specifics of these individual products are not important to the scope of this document and are well documented in Wikipedia articles.

Other products and services exist today which are designed to hide and conceal hair loss. Some of these options are:

* Scalp coloring products (Such as Topik)
* Hair pieces, Toupees, etc.
* Artificial hair thickening sprays

The purpose of these products again is not to cure baldness, but to conceal it's existence completely with varying degrees of success. Generally speaking, no matter what you decide to do, the end result will almost always be the same. You will have lost considerable amounts of money depending on the route you choose, your body may be permanently altered in a way that limits your future options (Surgery only) and may cause bodily harm, and you will be left unsatisfied, and with lower self confidence than before.

It is my inclination that type/ingredient/origin should be disjoint; that is, there should be a category &quot;desserts&quot; and a category &quot;pies&quot; and not &quot;dessert pies&quot;

Type of cuisine seems to fall under the &quot;by meal&quot; designation -- cakes are almost always for dessert, but failing that, the type could be cross-categorized under meals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

Chwechweechw, ahotutuo, nwiiwii, and nuidudui are names the native Africans have for centuries called &lt;b&gt;[[Wikipedia:Sickle_cell|sickle cell disease]]&lt;/b&gt;. The disease has persisted in relatively high incidence among this population because of its &quot;protective&quot; effect against malarial parasite infection. Although individuals with the sickle cell gene are not immune to infection, they are afforded an advantage at resisting serious illness. Invasion by the merozoites of the red cells of individuals with sickle cell disease or trait causes sickling of the cells which triggers their destruction in the spleen before the parasite can gain access to the systemic circulation. 

In 1910, Dr. James Harrick described a patient from the West Indies with anemia, whose red cells were &quot;sickle shaped,&quot; and thus introducing the western hemisphere this unique hemoglobinopathy.

==Etiology==
A point mutation of the B-globin gene produces a missense mutation yielding a substation of valine for glutamine at the 6th codon and the production of Hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S in the deoxygenated state undergoes aggregation and polymerization with in the red cell, leading to the sickle formation of the cell membrane along with problems of cell volume regulation and endothelial adhesion.

Sickle cell disease is autosomal recessive. In the individual with homozygous HbS, sickling causes severe organ damage and reduces life expectancy here in the United States to less than 50 years. Eight to ten percent of African-Americans carry the trait, and 0.2% of this population is affected by the disease. 

==Pathophysiology==

The primary pathological results of this hemoglobinopathy are hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and vaso-cclusive disorders. The latter two, along with their sequelae, are of most importance when considering musculoskeletal radiographic features of the disease.

*Chronic Anemia
**Marrow hyperplasia

*Acute anemia and Vaso-Occlusive Disorders
**Bone infarction 
**Secondary [[Wikipedia:Osteomyelitis|Osteomyelitis]]

==Radiologic Findings==

===Marrow Hyperplasia===
Any anemic state has the potential to cause persistent red marrow in abnormal locations. Sickle cell patients retain the majority of their marrow as red cell forming, and in severe cases even the commonly fatty marrow epiphysis may be involved. 

The systemic oxygen requirement may also cause expansion of existing red marrow, leading to enlargement of marrow spaces. As with persistant red marrow, this is a finding common to any severe chronic anemic state. The classic manifestation is the &quot;hair on end&quot; appearance and widening of the outer table of the skull by expansion of marrow in the diploic space seen on radiography and MR. 

[[Image:Sickle1.jpg|Extensive marrow hemosiderosis, AVN of the right hip and both knees, and bone infarcts in both femurs]][[Image:Sickle1b.jpg|Extensive marrow hemosiderosis, AVN of the right hip and both knees, and bone infarcts in both femurs]]


[[Image:Sickle2.jpg|Extensive marrow hemosiderosis, AVN of the right hip and both knees, and bone infarcts in both femurs]][[Image:Sickle2b.jpg|Extensive marrow hemosiderosis, AVN of the right hip and both knees, and bone infarcts in both femurs]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/b&gt; The above four MR images demonstrate extensive marrow hemosiderosis, AVN of the right hip and both knees, and bone infarcts in both femurs.

===Bone Infarction===
Flow patterns in the marrow predispose it to infarction. The slowing of blood flow through the marrow space allows for regional hypoxia and thus sickling of red cells, leading to infarction. The proximal epiphysis of long bones, especially the humerus and femer is the most common location of infarction in sickle cell patients. Vertebral osteonecrosis and the formation of &quot;fish vertebrae&quot; is a classic finding.

The most significant consequence of infaction is osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis during childhood can lead to abnormal development, and during adulthood it may cause osteoarthritis or joint distruction. Age, the presence of leg ulcers, previous ostyeonecrosis of the humeral or femoral head, and higher hemoglobin levels all raise the risk of developing osteonecrosis.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 4&lt;/b&gt; The two above films are of a 38 year old female with bilateral hip pain showing bilateral femoral head infarcts and osteonecrosis with subchondral collapse of the superior femoral articular surface.

===Osteomyelitis===
Individuals with sickle cell disease are predisposed to osteomyelitis secondary to ischemic injury of both bone and GI tract. This results in a high incidence of seeding of infarct beds with GI flora, most commonly Salmonela; as opposed to the more common cause of osteomyelitis in the general population, S. aureus.

Osteomyelitis is difficult to distinguish from bone infarction, and occurs much less commonly. Findings on plain film are nonspecific and include periostitis and osteopenia. MR is the preferred method for evaluation and demonstrates high signal on T2 weighted images and STIR. The most sensitive study is a T1 fat saturation study performed post gadolinium. Abnormal enhancement in this series is indicative of infection.

[[w:Ankylosing_spondylitis|Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)]] represents a chronic inflammatory disease, primarily affecting the axial skeleton and secondarily affecting the appendicular skeleton. It typically presents in men, 15-35 years old. Remember it as the least erosive and most ossifying arthropathy. Joint ankylosis is the hallmark, as the name less than subtlely suggests. Some details on different pieces of anatomy: SI joints are radiographically invovled first, bilaterally and symmetrically. Joint edges have a serrated &quot;postage stamp&quot; appearance due to tiny erosions, which start on the iliac side, due to the thinner cartilage, then progress to the sacral side.

==Radiologic Findings==
Erosions are much less than seen with other spondyloarthropathies. 

The synovial portion of the SI joint, i.e. the anteroinferior 1/2 to 2/3 of the joint, ankyloses first, followed by the ligamentous portion. Ankylosis of the posterosuperior ligamentous portion is considered to look like a &quot;star.&quot; 

Other findings you might see in the pelvis, if you're not overwhelmed by those SI joints and a glimpse of the spine, are ossification of ligamentous attachments in the iliac crests and ischial tuberosities, classically giving a purported &quot;whiskered&quot; look. That sounds cute doesn't it. Looks just kind of fuzzy to me. The symphysis pubis can show tiny &quot;serrated&quot; erosions like the SI joints, before it ankyloses. Purportedly, ~25% of ankylosing sponylitis eventually has symphysis pubis involvement. Probably since SI joints are the first radiographic evidence of AS and the pelvis is being imaged for that, lumbosacral AS involvement is typically seen first, as we see on the above pelvis radiograph, although apparently the thoracolumbar junction can be the first site of invovlement in the spine for AS. Involvement progresses cranially to involve the entire spine. At first, there is slight erosion of the vertebral body corners with secondary sclerosis, giving a classic squared vertebral body with &quot;ivory&quot; corners. 

The ivory corners disappear, not unlike true elephant ivory has, leaving simply square vertebral bodies. There is an explanation for these ivory corners, even if I can't explain where all the elephants' ivory went. The outer portion of the annulus fibrosus, i.e. Sharpey's fibers, ossify first. Apparently this may not always be seen radiographically, but decreased ROM will suggest this to an astute radiologist. The ossification progresses deeper to involve the longitudinal ligaments, resulting in the classic syndesmophyte seen with AS, linking adjacent vertebral bodies.

Disc spaces tend to remain normal at first, with no loss of height, but they may eventually calcify. Apophyseal joints in the spine can be involved, if they choose to, with resultant erosions followed by ankylosis. All spinal ligaments can eventually ossify giving the classic &quot;bamboo&quot; spine. 

Once you get a bamboo spine, a classic sign is that of the &quot;tram track,&quot; namely the syndesmophytes and ossified ligaments between spinout processes look like &quot;tram tracks.&quot; We get a hint of that here in the pelvis.

For further details on tram tracks, talk to MSK Fellow Durkee, as he does a thorough job at explaining trams. One point to remember, as forgetting it could give grave results, is that odontoid erosions can be seen with AS. Atlantoaxial subluxation can be seen as well. So, don't jump to conclusions and label someone with &quot;arthritis&quot; and such cervical findings with RA, when in fact they may have AS. The bamboo spine, though, would probably give away the diagnosis. 

A couple of things to be aware with AS. As with DISH, intubating someone with an ankylosed C-spine can result in horrendous fracture with paralyzing results. Similarly, fracture in the thoracolumbar region can result in pseudoarthrosis. This can also result from an area that failed to ossify. At this area one can see DDD, erosion, and bony sclerosis. These findings can resemble severe DDD, discitis/osteomyelitis, or &quot;neuropathic&quot; spinal disease. Now that you are aware of the possibility of pseudoarthrosis, you can consider that as a possible diagnosis too. 

Moving beyond the axial skeleton, the hip is the most common appendicular joint involved. Two kinds of patterns can be seen when the hip is involved, i.e. nondestructive and destructive. Kind of reminds me of relationships. The former is fortunately more common, as hard as that is to believe sometimes. In AS the hips are involved bilaterally and symmetrically, with, surprise surprise, ankylosis being the characteristic feature. There can be no joint space loss, or uniform joint space loss with axial migration of the femoral head. 

Tiny erosions can be seen, but overall the femoral head contour is preserved. Pre-ankylosis there will be a osteophyte collar with normal mineralization, while post-ankylosis the phytes go byebye and the bones become osteopenic. The destructive hip is unilateral and insidious, resulting in marked destruction of the femoral head prior to ultimate ankylosis. The shoulder is the next most frequent appendicular joint involved. Again we see destructive and nondestructive patterns. With the latter there is a normal humeral head ankylosed to the glenoid with much ossification of the coracoclavicular ligament. With the destructive type there is a &quot;hatchet&quot; erosion of the humeral head. Not that I know what a hatchet blow looks like, but I think sometimes I could benefit from having such a weapon. 

With the hatchet shoulder, ankylosis will eventually occur after much destruction has been wreaked. The knee is involved in ~30% of longstanding cases, not because they're standing, but, well you know what I mean. The AC, sternoclavicular, and sternomanubrial joints can all be involved. Purportedly only ~10% of longterm AS shows elbow, hand, and feet involvement. In all of these less involved joints, erosions, if present at all, are slight, with minimal bone sclerosis, but as you guessed, intra-articular ankylosis is the characteristic. Progression of an ankylosing joint tends to be rapid. 


==Take Home Points==
#Normal mineralization pre-ankylosis; subsent osteopenia post-ankylosis. 
#Subchondral bone pre-ankylosis. 
#Erosions are not significant part of the picture, but if seen are small and focal. 
#No subluxation. 
#No subchondral cysts. 
#Ankylosis, as the name suggests. 
#Bilateral, symmetrical. 
#First axial: SI joints, then spine, starting lumbar and progressing to cervical.  Later appendicular, in decreasing prevalence: hips, shoulders, knees, hands, and feet.

[[w:Psoriatic_Arthritis|Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)]] is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects around 20% of people suffering from the chronic skin condition [[w:Psoriasis|psoriasis]].  It occurs more commonly in patients with [[w:HLA-B27| tissue type HLA-B27]].  Treatment of psoriatic arthritis is similar to that of [[w:Rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]].  More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterised by pitting of the nails.  Psoriatic [[w:arthritis|arthritis]] is said to be a sero-negative spondyloarthropathy.

Psoriatic arthritis can develop at any age, however on average it tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of psoriasis.  For the majority of people this is between the ages of 30 and 50, but it can also affect children.  Men and women are equally affected by this condition.  In about one in seven cases the arthritis symptoms may occur before any skin involvement.

As well as causing joint inflammation, psoriatic arthritis can cause [[w:Tendonitis|tendonitis]] and a sausage-like swelling of the digits known as [[w:dactilytis|dactilytis]].


*2-17% of patients with psoriasis get arthritis 
*skin lesions and arthritis are often asynchronous: 80-85% of pts have skin lesions first 
*synovial inflammation leading to bony proliferation at joint margins 
*inflammation at the ligamentous attachments: enthesopathy

*Age of onset usually 30-45 years, no gender preference

==Prognostic Factors==
===Poor prognosis===
*late age of onset 
*five or more effused joints 
*high immunosuppressive medication use

===Good prognosis===
*ESR &lt; 15 mm/h

==Labs==
*HLA B27 positive in 60-80% of psoriatic spondylitis and 20% of peripheral PsA 
*CRP - usually elevated 
*may be elevated: acute serum amyloid A (A-SAA) 
*ANA may be mildly elevated 
*Rheumatoid factor negative (or mildly elevated with titer&lt;1/40, which is cut-off for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA))

==Pattern of Presentation==
#asymmetric oligoarthritis: &gt; 50% 
#polyarthiritis with predominantly DIP involvement (classic): 5-19% 
#symmetric seronegative polyarthritis simulating RA: up to 25% 
#sacroiliitis and spondylitis resembling Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS): 20-40% 
#arthiritis mutilans with resorption of the phalanges: 5%

Onset may be insidious (66%) or acute (33%) mimicking gout or septic arthritis

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Level 7 PDA''' (previously called Diploma) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

This qualification was developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Supporting Reader Development''' is an optional unit in the programme.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the old ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or Level 8 PDA ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.

Further information can be obtained from '''angela.lees@sqa.org.uk'''

= Objectives of reader development =

In recent years libraries have moved towards fostering reader development, a more reader-centred approach. A good definition of reader development is: 

'''active intervention to:

* increase people’s confidence and enjoyment of reading 
* open up reading choices 
* offer opportunities for people to share their reading experience 
* raise the status of reading as a creative activity'''

(See http://www.openingthebook.com/reader-centred-library)

Add alternative definitions below.

= Reader development techniques =

Reader development is not about reading “better” books, in the sense that these are more worthy literary titles - the objective is that the reader relishes the reading experience and reads the books with a sense of satisfaction. Reader development can involve:

* reading promotions
* use of genres
* literacy initiatives 
* reader centred selection skills

== Reading promotion ==

It is important at the outset to distinguish between reading promotion and reader development.

A reading promotion aims to market a small number of titles while reader development sells the whole reading experience and what it can do for you, rather than promoting individual books or writers. 

That said, however, reading promotions can still play an important role as part of a wider reader development programme, as they can alert readers to titles which they might otherwise remain unaware of.

Reading promotions may be local (within the library or local authority library service), national or even international. Reading promotions focus on small or moderate numbers of book titles which are grouped together and marketed as a list or reading pathway for the client group. This group might be adults, younger clients or clients with special needs or specific language requirements. Sometimes, language, subject or publisher links them together. 

Although reading promotions are not reader-centred (their objective is to increase sales or issues), they do bring books to the attention of readers and may attract new readers because of their display and supporting print materials. Grouping books together in a promotion centres the reader’s attention on them and will lead to increased client use of this stock.

'''Activity:''' Find some examples of recent book promotions in which your library service has participated. Discuss with colleagues what was successful or unsuccessful about these promotions.

== Current book promotions ==

There are so many book promotions that we could not attempt to give a comprehensive listing. However, here are three examples of current book promotions which could be applicable to public libraries, together with our comments on these. Maybe some of them were included in your list.

=== Richard and Judy’s Summer Reads ===	

http://www.richardandjudybookclub.co.uk/

Celebrities Richard and Judy promote reading through their Summer Reads and Book Club. Whilst this is a small range of titles, these titles receive a high profile in the media and outlets like supermarkets, bookshops, stations and airports. It is always important to be aware of what is in the media spotlight, as requests from clients will follow. Richard and Judy’s titles are contemporary paperback fiction.

=== Welsh Book Council===		

http://www.cllc.org.uk/hafan-home

This website promotes access to books by Welsh publishers and contains useful reading suggestions for readers. It is important that local/national authors and publishers are promoted to encourage and sustain the growth and development of the local/national cultural industry. In addition Welsh/Gaelic language material should be made available to meet the needs of readers.

=== Mills and Boon ===				

http://www.millsandboon.co.uk

Mills and Boon publishers are well known for their range of romantic fiction. Their website includes a large number of titles but it will only appeal to a limited group of readers and has a commercial rather than reader-centred objective.
 
= Genre =

A genre is a “family” group of books which share style, form, or content, e.g.: crime fiction.

'''Activity:''' List other fiction genres which are common in public libraries.

== Fiction genres ==

When you look round any bookshop or library, you see that it is possible to group fiction into many genres. New genres emerge all the time – a few years ago, for instance, “chick lit” was unheard of; now it is one of the best selling fiction genres. The most common fiction genre groupings are:

* literary fiction
* crime
* romance
* fantasy and sci-fi
* blockbusters
* historical
* short stories
* westerns
* defined by country,  e.g.: Canadian literature

== Arranging collections by genre ==

Many libraries organise part of their fiction collection by genre and the identifying spine labels for the different genres (e.g.: a gun for crime) will be familiar to many library clients. Libraries do this to help clients who habitually read, for example, crime novels. This means that clients regularly go to the same area of stock for their reading material and can miss out on wider reading choices.

Some might argue that arranging the non-fiction stock using a classification system removes the need for genres in this area of the library. However, many libraries use genres for some of their non-fiction stock. Common examples are biographies and travel books. 

For the client who is completely focused on one genre it is undoubtedly helpful if they find all the books in this genre in one place in the library. But the disadvantage of this approach is that it can discourage more adventurous reading. 

The client may never look beyond the few shelves which contain the selection of “his/her books”, even though other books elsewhere could be of interest to them. While some clients will always limit their reading choices to a particular genre, others can, with support, can be led to enjoy reading across a wider range.

= Literacy initiatives =

Literacy initiatives can make a significant contribution to reader development. Such initiatives exist at both local and national level.

There are many literacy initiatives related to education. These include the '''National Literacy Strategy''', '''National Priorities for Education''' and '''Literacy Hour'''. 

The ability to read fluently is an important life skill and opens doors to better job prospects, improved economic prospects and more leisure choices. In the UK, the issues are about low levels of literacy rather than illiteracy, but '''23% of adults in the UK struggle with basic literacy'''. 

The website of the '''National Literacy Trust''', http://www.literacytrust.org.uk has lots of statistical information. Good functional literacy is important to the well being of individuals as well as the economy of the country and reading/writing abilities are essential for everyday tasks such as writing shopping lists, texting and using medicines properly.

Government initiatives to improve literacy in education include the introduction of the '''Literacy Hour'''. The '''National Literacy Trust''' was established in 1993 to improve skills, confidence and pleasure in reading. The NLT goes wider than formal education and there are well-developed national networks for Adult Literacy and Numeracy support and development.

'''Activity:''' Go to http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/projects_networks and look at the details of the latest literacy initiatives applicable to libraries. Choose those of interest to your own library service and consider how you could use them as part of reader development.   

== Examples of literacy initiatives ==

In England, the '''The Reading Agency''' brings libraries and adult literacy together in partnership and promotions include '''Got Kids?''' '''Get Reading!''' and '''First Choice'''. 

The Reading Agency runs an annual literacy initiative - the 'Six Books Challenge'  aimed at adults and learners in further education. 

You can find out more at http://readingagency.org.uk/adults/quick-guides/six-book-challenge/

In Scotland, the '''Big Plus''' brand promotes adult literacy and numeracy. There is a partnership between '''Communities Scotland’s Learning Connections''' and libraries which is developing projects, collections and providing training. 

http://www.thebigplus.com/about/About_The_Big_Plus

'''Activity:''' Browse through the following literacy related websites for younger clients. Do any of them have activities which you could link into or adapt for your library service? Note: most of these sites give links to other related sites which may also provide you with inspiration.	
		


'''The Child Literacy Centre'''			http://www.childliteracy.com 

'''My home library	'''				http://www.myhomelibrary.org

= Reader-centred stock selection =

When choosing stock it is important that you consider the reading preferences of clients.  Using reader-centred selection skills in general stock selection is good practice. You will keep your clients’ reading preferences in mind as you take account of current demands, gaps in stock, levels and formats of stock and the condition and currency of stock. You may need to think about developing specific areas of stock. You may also need to select specific items or generate lists for individual clients and their meeting  their needs should be the focus. 

Later we’ll discuss what is involved in carrying out an interview with the client to establish their reading history and preferences and in building a reader-profile. Following on from that you will draw on your knowledge of the reading resources available in order to develop a reader-centred list or pathway. Here we discuss some of the resources which are available to assist you in stock selection.

Activity: Make a list of the range of resources which are available to you when you are selecting stock to recommend to a reader whose reader-profile you have established. Remember you can be accessing stock which already exists in your library service or you may be ordering new stock for the client.

== Resources == 

For stock within your library service you will use the library catalogue and themed lists such as the Quick Reads collection for emergent readers:

http://www.quickreads.org.uk/

To identify new stock you can use online sources – there are many online selection tools which are useful in locating resources which your own service does not have. Examples include:

Scottish Bibliographies Online: 		http://www.scotlandsculture.org/sbo/sbo.htm

[http://www.openingthebook.com/whichbook/ Which Book] - for widening fiction choice (with reviews from library staff) 

Other resources for assisting in stock selection include:

* catalogues of other libraries 
* bibliographies
* review journals   
* publishers’ lists
* pre-publication lists
* specialist suppliers
* showroom and bookshop visits
* trade publications

=== Library catalogues ===

Online library catalogues can assist you in your search for appropriate material. Most UK library catalogues can be searched via the Internet. 

The UK Public Libraries Page http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/ac940/weblibs.html is a useful resource, linking to the web-available catalogues. 

Some services “clump” together the catalogues of several libraries. A single-search interface is used to cross-search multiple catalogues in a single search action, such as http://www.ni-libraries.net/ for Northern Ireland or CatCymru for Wales http://library.wales.org/catcymru/

=== Bibliographies ===

A bibliography is a list of materials on a particular subject or by a particular author.

The publication, in either printed or electronic format, is usually arranged by author, date or subject, and provides information such as author, title, publisher and date of publication. This can then be used to identify sources and place orders for clients. 

Activity: Find out which bibliographies are held in hard copy in your library service and consider how each might be of use to you for reader-centred stock selection.

=== Review journals ===  

Review journals offer more information about books, articles or research than is found in bibliographies. A review will summarise the contents and make an evaluative statement about its contribution within its context. Good examples include newspapers such as: 

The Sunday Times 	http://www.timesonline.co.uk  

The Guardian 		http://www.guardian.co.uk/

Remember though, however respected the journal or reviewer, reviews are the views of one individual and so need to be evaluated carefully.

=== Publishers’ lists ===

Publisher’s websites and lists offer useful information. Caution must be exercised when using these to select material as publishers and booksellers have a commercial imperative. So you must always apply your selection criteria.

Books from Scotland  (http://www.booksfromscotland.com) is supported by Publishing Scotland’s website and highlights new books as does their Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/BooksfromScotlandcom/28776550495) and Twitter feed (http://twitter.com/scottishbooks). They also have an RSS news feed.

=== Pre-publication lists ===

These lists offer useful information about forthcoming publications. 

However, library staff know that they must be especially careful when using information from pre-publication lists as these lists may be produced many months before an item is actually published. In the interval between the pre-publication list and the actual publication of the item, the date of publication, length, format and price may change.

=== Specialist suppliers ===

Specialist suppliers are used to ensure that range and depth is developed within collections. This might be a particular interest, specialist language material, dual language material, or alternative formats such as Braille or for emergent readers.

=== Showroom and bookshop visits ===

Visits to showrooms and bookshops offer the opportunity to browse through the books. The downsides are that the range is limited to what is available in stock and that it takes considerable time and travel to select from a wide range of stock effectively and efficiently.

=== Trade publications ===

The Bookseller is a weekly trade publication, which lists new publications and forthcoming titles http://www.thebookseller.com

== Binary tree option pricing ==
=== Introduction ===
We have all heard of at least one stock exchange. NASDAQ, Dow Jones, FTSE and Hang Sheng. Less well-known, but more useful to many people, are the futures exchanges. A stock exchange allows stock brokers, also known as investment advisors, to trade company stocks, while futures exchanges allow more exotic derivatives to be traded. For example, financial options, which is also the focus of this chapter.

An option is a contract that gives the holder the choice to buy (or sell) a certain good in some time in the future for a certain price. What are options for? Initially, they are used to protect against risk. But they are also used to take advantage foreseeable opportunities, like what Thales has done&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Thales, the great Greek philosopher, was credited with the first recorded use of an option in the western world. A popular anecdote suggests, in one particular year while still in winter, he forecasted a great harvest of olives in the coming year. He had next to no money, so he purchased the option for the use of all the olive presses in his area. Naturally, when the time to harvest came everyone wanted to use the presses he had optioned! Needless to say he made a lot of money out of it.

=== Basics ===
An '''option''' is a contract of choice. You can choose whether to exercise the option or not.

If you own an option that states
:''You may purchase 1 kg of sugar from Shop A tomorrow for $2''	 
suppose tomorrow the market price of sugar is $3, you would want to exercise the option i.e. buy the sugar for $2. Then you would sell it for $3 on the market and make $1 in the process. But if the market price for 1 kg of sugar is $1, then you would choose not to exercise the option, because it's cheaper on the market.
		 
Let us be a little bit more formal about what an option is. In particular there are two types of option:	 
:''Call Option''	 
::A call option is a contract that gives the owner the option to ''buy'' an 'underlying stock' at the 'strike price', on the 'expiry date'.	 
:''Put Option''	 
::A put option is a contract that gives the owner the option to ''sell'' an 'underlying stock' at the 'strike price', on the 'expiry date'.	 
		 
In the above example, the 'underlying stock' was sugar and the 'strike price' $2 and 'expiry date' is tomorrow.	 
		 
We shall represent an option like below	 
:{C or P, $amount, # periods to expiry}	 
. For example	 
:{C,$3,1}	 
represents a call option with strike price for some unspecified underlying stock expiring in one time-unit's time. A time-unit here may be a year, a month, one day or one hour. The important point is the mathematics we will present later does not really depend on what this time-unit is. Also, we need not specify the underlying stock either. Another example	 
:{P,$100,2}	 
represents a put option with strike price $100 for some unspecified underlying stock expiring in ''2'' time-units' time.	 

Now that we have a basic idea of what an option is, we can start to imagine a market place where options are traded. We assume that such a ''market'' exists. Also we assume that there is no fee of any kind to participate in a trade. Such a market is called a ''frictionless'' market. Of course, a market place where the underlying stock is traded is also assumed to exist.
		 
==== Info -- American or European ====
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;	 
Actually there are two major types of options: American or European. An European option allows you to exercise the option ''only'' on the 'expiry date'; while the American version allows you to exercise the option at any time prior to the 'expiry date'. We shall only discuss European options in this chapter.	 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Arbitrage ===
Another very important concept is ''arbitrage''. In short, an arbitrage is a way to make money out of nothing. We assume that there is no ''free-lunch'' in this world, in other words our market is arbitrage-free. We will show an example of how to perform an arbitrage later on in the chapter.

The real meat of this chapter is the technique used to price the options. In simple terms, we have an option, how much should it be? From this angle, we will see that the arbitrage-free requirement is a very strong one, in that it basically dictates what the price of the option should be.

=== Option's value on expiry ===	 
Pricing the option is about how much is it worth ''now''. Of course the present value of an option depends on its possible future values. Therefore it is vital to understand how much the option is worth at expiry, when it is time to choose whether to exercise the option or not. For example, consider the option
:{C,$2,1}	 
it is the call (buy) option that expires in 1 week's time  (or day or year or whatever time period it is suppose to be). How much should the option be if the market price of the underlying stock on expiry is $3? What if the market price is $1?	 
		 
It is sensible to say the option has a value of $1 if the market price (for the underlying stock) is $3, and the option should be worthless ($0) if the market price is $1.	 
		 
Why do we say it is ''sensible'' to price the option as above? It is because we assume the market is arbitrage-free. Also in a market, we assume	 
* there is a bank that's willing to lend you money	 
* if you repay the bank in the same day you borrowed, no fee will be charged.	 
With those assumptions, we show that if you price the option any differently, someone can make money without using any of his/her own money. For example, suppose on expiry, the market price for the underlying stock is $3 and you decide to sell the option for $0.7 (not $1 as is sensible). An intelligent buyer would do the following:	 
	&lt;TABLE FRAME=VOID CELLSPACING=0 COLS=3 RULES=GROUPS BORDER=1&gt;	 
	&lt;TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=100 ALIGN=Middle&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=100 ALIGN=middle&gt;&lt;b&gt;Balance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;/TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;Borrow $2.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD SDVAL=&quot;2.7&quot; SDNUM=&quot;1033;&quot;&gt;+$2.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD ALIGN=LEFT&gt;$2.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;/TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;Purchase your option for $0.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD SDVAL=&quot;2.7&quot; SDNUM=&quot;1033;&quot;&gt;-$0.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD ALIGN=LEFT&gt;$2&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;/TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;Purchase sugar for $2 with option&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD SDVAL=&quot;2.7&quot; SDNUM=&quot;1033;&quot;&gt;-$2&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD ALIGN=LEFT&gt;$0&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;/TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;Sell 1kg of sugar for $3 in market&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD SDVAL=&quot;2.7&quot; SDNUM=&quot;1033;&quot;&gt;+$3&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD ALIGN=LEFT&gt;$3&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;/TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TR&gt;	 
	&lt;TD WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;Repay bank $2.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD SDVAL=&quot;2.7&quot; SDNUM=&quot;1033;&quot;&gt;-$2.7&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;TD ALIGN=LEFT&gt;$0.3&lt;/TD&gt;	 
	&lt;/TR&gt;	 
	&lt;/TABLE&gt;	 
He/she made $0.3 and at no time did he/she use his/her own money (i.e. balance never less than zero)! This is a ''free lunch'', which is contrary to the assumption of a arbitrage-free market!
		 
''' Exercises '''	 
		 
1. In an ''arbitrage-free'' market, consider an option T = {C,$100,1}.	 
:i) How much should the option be on expiry if the price of the underlying stock is $90.
:ii) What if the underlying stock costs $110 on expiry.	 
:iii} $100?	 
		 
2. Consider an option T = {C,$10,1}.	 
:i) On expiry, would you consider buying the option if it was for sell for $2 if the underlying stock costs $12?	 
:ii) What if the underlying stock costs $13.	 
		 
3. Consider the ''put'' option T = {P,$2,1}. On expiry the underlying stock costs $1. Jenny owns T, she decides on the following actions	 
:Borrow $1	 
:Purchase the underlying stock from the market for $1	 
:Exercise the option i.e. sell the stock for $2	 
:Repay $1	 
Did she do the right thing?	 
		 
4. In an ''arbitrage-free'' market, consider the ''put'' option T = {P,$2,1}. 	 
:i) On expiry, how much should the option cost if the underlying stock costs $1?	 
:ii) $3?	 
		 
5. Consider the ''put'' option T = {P,$2,1}. On expiry the underlying stock costs $1. And the option T is on sale for $0.5. Jenny immediately sees an arbitrage opportunity. Detail the actions she should take to capitalise on the arbitrage opportunity. (Hint: imitate the Action, Money, Balance table )

=== Pricing an option ===
Consider this hypothetical situation where a company, MassiveSoft, is in negotiation to merge with another company, Pears. The share price of MassiveSoft currently stands at $7. If the negotiation is successful, the share price will rise to $11; otherwise it will fall to $5. Experts predict the probability of a success is 90%. Consider a call option that lets you buy 1000 shares of MassiveSoft at $8 when the negotiation is finalised. How much should the option be?

Since the market is arbitrage-free, the value of the option at expiry is already determined. Of course
:if the negotiation is successful, the option is valued at (11 - 8) &amp;times; 1000 = $3000
:otherwise, the option should be worthless ($0)
the above are the only ''correct'' values of the option at expiry or people can &quot;rip you off&quot;.

Let ''x'' be the price of the option at present, we can use the following diagrams to illustrate the situation,
:{|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\nearrow &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;$3000 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;$x \!&lt;/math&gt;
|
|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\searrow &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;$0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
the diagram shows that the current price of the option should be $''x'', and if the negotiation is successful, it will be worth $3000, otherwise it is worthless. In similar fashion, the following diagram shows the value of the company stock now, and in the future
:{|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\nearrow &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;$11 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;$7 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|
|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\searrow &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;$5 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
You may have notice that we didn't put down the probability of success or failure. Interestingly (and counter-intuitively), they don't matter! Again, the arbitrage-free principle dictates that what we have in the two diagrams above are sufficient for us to price the option!

How?

What is the option? It is the contract that gives you the option to buy ... Wait, wait, wait. Think of it from another angle
:''it is a tradable object that is worth $3000 if the negotiation is successful, and $0 if otherwise''
This is the main idea behind how to price the option. The option must be the same price as another ''object'' that goes up to $3000 or down to $0 depending on the success of the negotiation. Hopefully, this object is something we know the price of. This idea is called constructing a ''replicating portfolio''.

A ''portfolio'' is a collection of tradable ''things''. We want to construct a portfolio that behaves in the same way as the option. It turns out that we can construct a portfolio that behaves in the way as the option by using only two things. They are
# MassiveSoft shares
# and ''money''
let's assume that ''money'' is ''tradable'' in the sense that you can buy a dollar with a dollar. This concept may seem very unintuitive at first. However let's proceed with the mathematics, suppose this portfolio consists of ''y'' units of MassiveSoft shares and ''z'' units of money. If the negotiation is successful, then each share will be worth $11, and the whole portfolio should be worth $3000, as it behaves in the same way as the option, so we have the following
:&lt;math&gt;11y + z = 3000 \!&lt;/math&gt;
but if the negotiation is unsuccessful then the portfolio is worthless ($0) and MassiveSoft share prices will fall to $5, giving
:&lt;math&gt;5y + z = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
we can easily solve the above simultaneous equations. We get
:&lt;math&gt;6y = 3000 \!&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;y = 500 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z = -$2500&lt;/math&gt;
So this portfolio consists of 500 MassiveSoft shares and -$2500. But what is -$2500? This can be understood as an ''obligation'' to pay back some money (e.g. from borrowings) on the expiry date of the option. So the portfolio we constructed can be thought of as
:500 MassiveSoft shares and an obligation to pay $2500
Now, 500 MassiveSoft shares costs $7 &amp;times; 500 = 3500, so the option should be priced as 3500 - 2500 = $1000.

Let's price a few more options.

''...''

The famous mathematician, John Nash, as portrayed in the movie &quot;A beautiful mind&quot;, did some pioneering work in portfolio theory with equivalent functions.

I suggest include in the template:

&lt;nowiki&gt;See [[Help:Development stages]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Only require date for &lt;100% ==

{{tlx|editprotected}}

If something is 100% complete, the date (although nice) should possibly be optional. How about changing the template from

&lt;pre&gt;[[image:{{{1}}}.svg|9px|Development stage: {{{1}}} (as of {{{2}}})]] [[Help:Development stages|&lt;small&gt;({{{2}}})&lt;/small&gt;]]&lt;!-- Development stage: {{{1}}} should be 00%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%; {{{2}}} should be a date like Jan 10, 2005 --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

to

&lt;pre&gt;[[image:{{{1}}}.svg|9px|Development stage: {{{1}}} (as of {{{2}}})]]{{#ifeq:{{{2|}}}|100%||[[Help:Development stages|&lt;small&gt;({{{2}}})&lt;/small&gt;]]}]&lt;!-- Development stage: {{{1}}} should be 00%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%; {{{2}}} should be a date like Jan 10, 2005 --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

An additional nicety would be

&lt;pre&gt;[[image:{{{1}}}.svg|9px|Development stage: {{{1}}} ({{#if:{{{2|}}}|as of {{{2}}}|date of assessment not known}})]]{{#ifeq:{{{2|}}}|100%||[[Help:Development stages|&lt;small&gt;({{{2}}})&lt;/small&gt;]]}]&lt;!-- Development stage: {{{1}}} should be 00%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%; {{{2}}} should be a date like Jan 10, 2005 --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Colours ==

currently the square's quarter border colours go from light gray (0%), dark red (25%), dark violet (50%), bright red (75%), to bright green (100%).

1. Shades of colours (i.e. one hue only, e.g. light to dark gray) might be considered more intuitive.

2. Instead of showing empty quarters one could work with filling the quarters to indicate the stage (all full being 100% for a 'positive' or neutral colour -- or all empty when using a 'negative' or neutral colour such as red or gray)

3. Generally, any links (incl. links to wiki pages) I expect to contain complete content -- so, 100% should be the &quot;normal&quot; stage (basically not requiring an stage image or maybe only a very subtle one -- like the light gray one :)

just my thoughts whilst understanding those images -- sorry if i probably missed some discussions ---22:01, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

== The 00% image... ==

The usage instructions message of the template currently says:

:{{{1}}} should be 0% (00%.svg), 25% (25%.svg), 50% (50%.svg), 75% (75%.svg), or 100% (100%.svg)

But if you type literally 0% in the first field the image won't be shown - you need to type 00%. That documentation bug definitely should be fixed. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 14:45, 4 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

I propose that this template should &quot;understand&quot; values other than 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% better. It should add a better fitting image for a percentage; instead of adding the image for 0% for 61% finished, it should add the 50% image (or even, other images should be added for 62.5% = 5/8 etc.).--[[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]] ([[User talk:Sae1962|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sae1962|contribs]]) 09:28, 23 February 2015 (UTC)</text>

Issues affecting the whole book(not just the root page), please discuss on the Opening theory organisation page. Have moved some of existing discussion there.

== Thanks ==

I would just like to say that I am extremely grateful for these pages. I can't afford any chess books (I don't get allowance or get paid for any chores by my parents) so the only resource I have is the internet through the library. I don't know how many people have thanked you all for taking the trouble to post this information up, but I'd like to just be another person to tell you that I've been reading all of this! I just hope that some wiki mod doesn't show up and delete the pages saying it's too much information, because I've seen articles cut down a lot because of it. Anyway, you guys can just delete this after a bit, but I just wanted to give a thank you because this is the best!

: Check out the chess articles in www.Wikipedia.org - I think there is much more over there. [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] ([[User talk:Bubba73|talk]]) 14:55, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

== Writing style &amp; content (using 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 as an example) ==

Consider, please, the difference between:

# 3. Bb5 is the most played. White puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn. While this is indeed White's best hope of an enduring attack, its aggressive appearance is misleading; the positions that result if Black defends properly require almost infinite patience from White.
# 3. Bc4 is a little more forthright and probably a better bet for beginners, provided the game does not subsequently head towards the Steve Davis Position.
# 3. d4 is aggressive. The center will completely collapse in a few moves, leading to a wide open game.
# 3. Nc3 is the dullest of the mainstream moves, not recommended for beginners if said beginners are to cultivate any interest in chess. Unless they are undead beginners, in which case they are entitled to play the (dubious but really fun) Halloween Gambit on move 4.
# 3. c3 is the Ponz(iani), a has-been. d4 doesn't need this preparation, and the b1-knight is unhappy at losing custody of c3 while Black's knight is still free to come to f6.

and:

# 3. Bb5 brings the game into the Ruy Lopez or the Spanish Game. White puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn.
# 3. Bc4 is quieter. Instead of attacking the knight, White chooses to target the weak f7 pawn.
# 3. d4 is aggressive. Subsequent play may result in a very open game.
# 3. Nc3 is the quietest continuation possible.
# 3. c3 opens the white diagonal for the queen, allows for an eventual d4 pawn push, in addition to controlling d4 and b4 (possible plants by the black knight) at the expense of hemming in the knight.

The former was turned into the latter by user Tourdeforcex, with the comment:
&quot;restoration of page: removal of unnecessary, obtuse, and fallacious statements&quot;

1) Wikibooks is unnecessary, as is the universe
2) Chess is obtuse
3) If I write something fallacious, tell me so on the talk page and we'll come to a consensus, but I fail to see any fallacy that has been corrected in the new version. (On the contrary, Bc4 is way sharper than Bb5, and there are a great many quieter continuations than Nc3 - a3, for example.)

Regarding the style: what are we trying to make here, people? An online version of ECO? A reorganisation of Wikipedia's opening material into opening explorer format? Books, and by extension Wikibooks, are supposed to get you ''interested'' in the thing you're reading about. The fact that 90% of chess books are full of the same half-assed pedestrian prose as in Exhibit B above doesn't make it any more desirable. Look at the single comment on the page's discussion page:

&quot;I was going to revert the verbiage -- but I actually like it! &quot;Unless they are undead beginners,...&quot; I love it. Adds character. Much better than Nunn's. ThreeE 02:33, 9 October 2007 (UTC)&quot;

And you can't have a noun 'at the expense of' a verb.

Another bugbear: if one move is good and another is crap, say so, using exaggeration, hyperbole and general colourful  language as necessary to make your point. Don't be like an Amazon reviewer who writes only 'balanced' reviews and gives everything three stars, stand up to modern civilisation and make some value judgements! The kind of player who would actually benefit from having &quot;3. c3 opens the white diagonal for the queen&quot; pointed out to them is the kind of player who needs guidance in their choice of move, of which there is none in Exhibit B. Not even a Wikipedia-style &quot;Kasparov tends to play this rather than this, so draw your own conclusions&quot;.  

On a related note, don't state the obvious just to fill space. For example, rather than &quot;3. c3 allows for an eventual d4 push&quot;, write &quot;d4 doesn't need this preparation&quot; - or, if it does: &quot;d4 will be a stronger move if supported by a pawn&quot;. Assume that your reader has read the advice on the front page and isn't trying to learn chess by learning openings. You'll make them feel intelligent, which is good.

Consider the position at 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...e5/2._Nf3/2...Nc6/3._Bb5/3...a6/4._Ba4/4...Nf6/5._O-O/5...Nxe4/6._d4/6...b5/7._Bb3/7...d5/8._dxe5/8...Be6 What I really want to see, which is a combination of my previous two points, is a book that tries to explain, in detail, with evidence, not just why 9. Nbd2 is a better move than 9. Qxd5 or 9. White Resigns, but ''why the best move is better than the second-best move''. 

Anyway, I'm in danger of forgetting what I wanted to say, which was that I've reinstated the &quot;unnecessary, obtuse, and fallacious statements&quot; and look forward to a healthy debate with anyone who objects to them.

:Hi Chi Sigma, I don't have much of an view on such things, if someone wants to update a page, then so be it. If you want to change it back to how it was then go for it. Pages are update quite infrequently so I'm reluctant to get involved in rights or wrongs and even if we did the other person doesn't return to put an alternative point of view. So for this reason I tend to change things I feel are incorrect but leave things that other people change. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 22:10, 2 October 2008 (UTC)


How many moves deep are we trying to take this opening theory book? Also, what are we looking for in terms of citation versus violating fair use? Is it fair use to take movelists from existing chess books, but none of the description? Or is the movelist alone a copyright violation?

Referring to the opening theory tables e.g. Chess Opening Theory/ECO volume B.

This is really awful to edit and is not particularly useful.
Simple opening moves without links may be better option.
Also the overall structure is not intuitive, putting the names/variations first then the moves leaves no allignment. Suggest

==Positive Review==
I actually really like this book so far, but found this part confusing: &quot;Why is controlling the center a good idea? That comes under chess strategy, which is discussed in the Chess Wikibook.&quot; There is a link there, but the section of the book that talks about 'Why' is not called &quot;Chess strategy&quot;, but instead under &quot;Aims of an opening&quot;.

== Good opening moves and bad opening moves ==

There is actually a very good reason why chess players open with center pawns. Here is a paper that shows that there are indeed good opening moves and bad opening moves. It describes a method of using engine analysis to compare the win probabilities of commonly used opening sequences. http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.6791.pdf

{{quote|In chess, unlike tennis, it is not possible to win by serving an ace.|Irving Chernev, chess writer}}

The opening of a game of chess is a battle between two equally matched armies. There is no known method that will secure one player a decisive advantage over the other regardless of what the opponent does. If there were, chess as a professional sport would most likely cease to exist. Winning a game of chess depends on one's opponent making inaccurate moves. The question &quot;What is an inaccurate move?&quot; can best be answered by trial and error.

Take the opening position shown in the diagram. It is White's move. Why do almost all serious players begin by moving either a central pawn or the king's knight? Simply because the results of millions of chess games have given these moves a better reputation than the alternatives. So you could say that White 'knows the secret' - except that after a handful of games have started with the same opening move, Black starts to realize that some ways of responding are better than others. Then White comes to know what to expect from Black.

Carry on this process over several centuries, bearing in mind that most chess positions contain a few potential moves that are just as good as one another (and some that are not as good but that might just throw an opponent off guard), and you will end up with enough ''opening theory'' to fill several encyclopedias. The question is who can remember the most.

==Using this wikibook==
To use this Wikibook you will need to be familiar with the rules of chess and the algebraic system of chess notation. While it is up to you how you proceed beyond that stage, most chess coaches would recommend that you gain a basic understanding of chess strategy before trying to learn any opening theory. For example, further down this page we explain that 1. e4 is a good move because it helps control the center. Why is controlling the '''center''' a good idea? That comes under chess strategy, which is discussed in the [[Chess/Basic Openings|Chess Wikibook]]. A more detailed discussion is located in the [[Chess Strategy/The center|Elements of chess strategy Wikibook]]. 

Each page in this Wikibook corresponds to a single position, which will be shown in the diagram on that page. One or more links will appear in the main body of the text, representing possible moves in that position. Choose a move, click it, and reach a new position. You can navigate backwards by clicking on moves in the directory list that appears at the top of each page below the title.

You can use the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO) code [[/ECO index|index]] if you prefer to navigate to positions that way. 

When contributing to this Wikibook, please follow the [[Chess Opening Theory/Organization|conventions for organization.]]

==White's first move==
White's first move selection is usually driven by the value of controlling the center squares of the board and allowing mobility of other white pieces. Hence, [[/1. e4/]] and [[/1. d4/]] are attractive first moves as they occupy important central squares, exert control of squares on the 5th rank, and allow White's bishops to develop. Secondary consideration is to deny Black those same benefits, thus the attractiveness of [[/1. d4/]] and [[/1. Nf3/]], preventing Black from playing 1...e5 without losing the pawn outright to a capture.

Here then are White's choices. Will White play along the popular King or Queen Pawn lines? Or will White open from a flank? Perhaps White will entertain an uncommon line to throw the game into dangerous but unexplored realms.

&lt;b&gt;Neuropathic osteoarthropathy&lt;/b&gt; refers to progressive degeneration of a weight-bearing joint, a process marked by bony destruction, bone resorption, and eventual deformity.  Onset is usually insidious.  Also known as &lt;b&gt;Charcot Joint&lt;/b&gt;.

If this pathological process continues unchecked, it could result in joint deformity, ulceration +/- superinfection, loss of function, and in the worst case scenario:  amputation.  Early identification of joint changes is the best way to limit morbidity.

==Pathogenesis==
Basically, any condition resulting in decreased peripheral sensation, proprioception, and fine motor control:
*Diabetes mellitus neuropathy (the most common in the U.S. today, resulting in destruction of foot and ankle joints), with Charcot joints in 1/600-700 diabetics.  Related to long-term poor glucose control. 
*Alcoholic neuropathy
*Cerebral palsy
*Leprosy
*Syphilis (tabes dorsalis), caused by the organism Treponema pallidum 
*Congenital insensitivity to pain
*Spinal cord injury
*Myelomeningocele
*Syringomyelia
*Intra-articular steroid injections

===Underlying Mechanisms===
*Two primary theories have been advanced:
**&lt;i&gt;Neurotrauma&lt;/i&gt;:  Loss of peripheral sensation and proprioception leads to repetitive &quot;microtrauma&quot; to the joint in question; this damages goes unnoticed by the neuropathic patient, and the resultant inflammatory resorption of traumatized bone renders that region weak and susceptible to further trauma.  Indeed, it is a &quot;vicious cycle.&quot; In addition, poor fine motor control generates unnatural pressure on certain joints, leading to additional microtrauma.
**&lt;i&gt;Neurovascular&lt;/i&gt;:  Neuropathic patients have dysregulated autonomic nervous system reflexes, and de-sensitized joints receive significantly greater blood flow.  The resulting hyperemia leads to increased osteoclastic resorption of bone, and this, in concert with mechanical stress, leads to bony destruction.

In reality, both of these theories probably play a role in the development of a Charcot joint.

===Joint Involvement===
As diabetes is the #1 cause in America today for neuropathic joint disease, the foot is the most affected region.  In those with foot deformity, approximately 60% are in the TMT joint (medial &gt; lateral), 30% MCP joint, and 10% have ankle disease.  Over half of diabetic patients with neuropathic joints can recall some kind of precipitating trauma, usually minor.

Patients with neurosyphilis tend to have knee involvement, and patients with syringomyelia of the spinal cord may demonstrate shoulder deformity.

Hip joint destruction is also seen in neuropathic patients

==Clinical Findings==

Erythema, edema, increased temperature in the affected joint.  In neuropathic foot joints, plantar ulcers may be present.  Note that it is often difficult to differentiate osteomyelitis from a Charcot joint, as they may have similar tagged WBC scan and MRI features (joint destruction, dislocation, edema).   Definitive diagnosis may require bone or synovial biopsy.

==Radiologic Findings==
First, it is important to recognize that two types of abnormality may be detected.  One is termed &quot;atrophic,&quot; in which there is osteolysis of the distal metatarsals in the forefoot.  The more common form of destruction is &quot;hypertrophic&quot; joint disease, characterized by acute peri-articular fracture and joint dislocation.

The natural history of the joint destruction process has a classification scheme of its own, offered by Eichenholtz decades ago:

&lt;b&gt;Stage 0:&lt;/b&gt;  Clinically, there is joint edema, but radiographs are negative.  Note that a bone scan may be positive before a radiograph is, making it a sensitive but not very specific modality.  

&lt;b&gt;Stage 1:&lt;/b&gt;  Osseous fragmentation with joint dislocation seen on radiograph (&quot;acute Charcot&quot;).

&lt;b&gt;Stage 2:&lt;/b&gt;  Decreased local edema, with coalescence of fragments and absorption of fine bone debris

&lt;b&gt;Stage 3:&lt;/b&gt;  No local edema, with consolidation and remodeling (albeit deformed) of fracture fragments.  The foot is now stable.

Destroyed TMT joints in the medial left foot,  with fracture and dislocation of fragments; these are classic findings.  Also note loss of the foot arch and acquired pes planus deformity.

==Treatment==

Once the process is recognized, immobilization with a total contact cast will help ward off further joint destruction.  Pneumatic walking braces are also used.  Surgical correction of a joint is rarely successful in the long-term in these patients.

It can take 6-9 months for the edema and erythema of the affected joint to recede.

= King's Pawn Opening =
===1.e4===
White's aggressive opening move opens lines for the queen and king's bishop and fights for control of the squares d5 and f5. 1. e4, the most traditional of White's first moves, is popular at all levels of the game and is the favoured opening move of world champion Bobby Fischer. Fischer called it 'best by test'. Openings with 1. e4 tend to emphasize violent tactics over slow maneuvering.

At this point Black must decide how to face White's aggression. With a pawn on e4, White's simplest plan is to play d4 on the next move, giving himself a strong 'classical' centre, so the most aggressive replies by Black challenge White's control of d4. 

:*[[/1...e5/]] challenges it directly, establishing an equal share of the centre though allowing White to maintain for longer the initiative conferred by having the first move. 
:*[[/1...c5/]], Sicilian Defence, creates an unbalanced position of attack and counter-attack and is the most popular move. 
:*[[/1...Nc6/]] is playable but does not prevent d4 since the knight cannot take the pawn without the queen recapturing. 

Alternatively, Black may challenge White's central control by targeting the newly arrived e4 pawn, either with 
:*[[/1...d5/]], with a likely exchange of central pawns leading to a wide-open game in which minor piece placement is crucial, or with 
:*[[/1...Nf6/]] Alekhine's Defence inviting White to build a large centre that may later be attacked. 
:*[[/1...f5/]], the Fred defense, is considered by many to be a poor move but leaves White many options though most lead to an imposing center for white that black will attempt to dissociate with flank pawns.

Other first moves by Black allow White to place pawns on e4 and d4, with Black conceding a spatial disadvantage in order to prepare a counterattack. 
:*[[/1...e6/]], French Defence, a popular move. Black follows up with d5.  The main disadvantage of this opening is that Black's light-squared bishop becomes blocked behind his pawns
:*[[/1...c6/]] also prepares d5, but without blocking the bishop.
:*[[/1...d6/]] and 
:*[[/1...g6/]] are related moves - where one is played, the other usually follows soon. The aim is to set up a solid but dynamic formation with Bg7 and usually Nf6 before deciding how to fight for the center. 
:*[[/1...b6/]] is occasionally played but allows White to attack quickly.
:*[[/1...a6/]] neglects the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1068157 Anatoly Karpov vs. Tony Miles] at Chessgames.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarely played moves by Black include
:*[[/1...a5/]], is also not recommended, as it weakens Black's position.
:*[[/1...Na6/]], Lemming Defence, which is too passive.
:*[[/1...Nh6/]], Adams Defence, which is also too passive.
:*[[/1...h6/]], Carr Defence, which wastes time and weakens Black's kingside.
:*[[/1...h5/]], Pickering Defence, which does not help development.
:*[[/1...g5/]], Borg Defence
:*[[/1...f6/]], Barnes Defence, weakens the Black king.
:*[[/1...b5/]], Polish Gambit, unsound because 2. Bxb5 gives White a free pawn.

===Statistics===
Approximate chances: White win 39%, Draw 29%, Black win 32%&lt;br&gt;
Estimated next move popularity: c5 41%, e5 25%, e6 13%, c6 7%, d6 4%, d5 4%, g6 3%, Nf6 2%, Nc6 0.5%, other moves less than 0.5%

===1...e5===
Black plays the classical response to 1. e4. By mirroring White's move Black has guaranteed himself an equal share of the centre and scope to develop his pieces. 1...e5 is one of the few moves that directly interferes with White's plan of playing d4. But the move's merit is also its drawback; with the position once again symmetrical, White to move has the initiative and sooner or later will be able to break the symmetry to his own advantage. The pawn on e5 is undefended and it is easy for White to develop in a way that restricts Black's possible responses, by simply threatening to capture it. Though the move is still common at every level, it has seen a modest decline in popularity during the 20th century. 

The classical move for White is 
:*[[/2. Nf3/]]
threatening Black's undefended pawn while developing one of his Kingside pieces in preparation for castling. 

Another plan is to open the f-file for an attack on Black's weak f7 point, an idea which underlies a trio of related moves the variations of which frequently transpose into each other: 
:*[[/2. f4/]], the [[Chess/King's Gambit|King's Gambit]]
:*[[/2. Nc3/]], the [[Chess/Vienna Game|Vienna Game]]
:*[[/2. Bc4/]], the [[Chess/Bishop's Opening|Bishop's Opening]]

Or, White can thumb his nose at Black's e-pawn, and smash the centre open with
:*[[/2. d4/]] in order to develop his pieces with great speed, sacrificing a pawn or two if necessary.

= Bishop's Opening =
==2. Bc4==
White targets the weak f7 pawn and keeps the possibility of playing a deadly f2-f4. Unlike in 2. Nf3, Black's e5 pawn is not under attack, giving him a wider range of choice. Black's main worry is the Qh5 threat. That's why he shouldn't play Be7 or Ne7.

The main choice is [[/2...Nf6/]], reacting to White's passivity by attacking the e4 pawn and taking the initiative. Moreover, it prevents Qh5.

Black has still the possibility of mirroring White's move with [[/2...Bc5/]].

[[/2...Nc6/]] is playable, although a bit passive.

The Calabrese Countergambit ([[/2...f5/]]) is very sharp, but may be a deadly weapon if mastered correctly.

[[/2...c6/]], the Philidor Counterattack prepares d5 but is often considered to be too slow.

[[/2...d6/]] may transpose to Philidor's Defence but not necessarily (Black should expect 3. f4).

==Vienna Game==

White's wish is to advance the f-pawn two squares to remove Black's powerful e5 pawn and strike at the heart of his position. Now it is possible to play f4 on the second move, for the King's Gambit, but when no Black piece has yet declared its intentions is there not a degree of hit-and-hope about such a move? If you have the patience to let Black build his bridge before you blow it up: welcome to the Vienna Game, a poison-tipped opening from the nineteenth century.

If you should find yourself up against the Vienna as Black, keep your nerve. The harder White tries to checkmate you, the less time he has to develop naturally and control territory; consequently if you survive the opening your hand is a little freer than in the Ruy Lopez. 

Black for the moment has no threat to respond to, save the threat of f4 which cannot be reasonably prevented. When in doubt, develop a knight:

:[[/2...Nf6/]]: Falkbeer (or Berlin) Defence
The most common reply as it prepares to counter f4 with d5, adding to the equation another variable for White to keep track of. 

:[[/2...Nc6/]]: Max Lange Defence
This allows Black to capture the pawn when it gets to f4, without having his active knight subsequently kicked by the e-pawn.

Other plausible moves are [[/2...Bb4/]] and [[/2...Bc5/]] both of which attempt to initate a counter-attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Examples of words specific to Osaka Dialect (関西弁''Kansai-ben'':

本当に　＝　ほんま / まじで　(Really?)&lt;br /&gt;
ありがとう　＝　おおきに (Thank you)&lt;br /&gt;
ばか　＝　あほう (Stupid[insult])&lt;br /&gt;
だめ　＝　あかん (Bad!/Prohibited!)

Many feel that the dialect of Osaka is fast, dirty, down-to-earth and funny. This impression is likely attributed to the fact that most comedians in Japan speak in Osaka-ben. Often in anime, Osaka accents are frequently translated as American accents from the deep south. This is often done because it's a popular belief that people from Osaka are like Texans in personality. The most famous Osaka to Southern dub, is the Azumanga Daioh anime. Amongst anime fans, the topic of whether Osaka should be translated into a southern accent is very debatable. Some believe Brooklyn accents are a more fitting equivalent.

A great book to draw upon is Richard Southwood's ''The Story of Life''.  Is definitely one of the best science books that I've even read. I would like to see an epoch-by-epoch unfolding of evolution as done by Southwood. Would be a powerful magnet to pull in and refine the articles of Wikipedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout Gout]&lt;/b&gt; is a form of peripheral arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals secondary to hyperuricemia.

Prevalence in the United States: 1.6 to 13.6 per 1000. 
Typically occurs in middle aged or elderly males (90% of cases are in males). 
It is particularly rare in premonpausal women. 
Caucasians populations are more affected than those of African heritage. 
Interestingly, gout is relatively frequent in young male Polynesians.

Hyperuricemia and gout are often associated with hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and ethanol abuse.

While all gout patients have a high serum uric acid concentration at some point in their disease progression, most hyperuricemic individuals never show clinical signs of urate crystal deposition.

==Pathophysiology==
*Uric acid under excretion (90% of cases) 
**Primary: Idiopathic reduced renal excretion 
**Secondary:     
***Chronic renal failure 
***Thiazide use 
***Alcohol 
***Hyper or hypoparathyroidism 

*Uric acid overproduction (10% of cases) 
**Primary: Enzyme defect in purine synthesis 
**Secondary: 
***Increased turnover of nucleic acids 
***Myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders 
***Hemolytic anemia 
***Chemotherapy 
***Alcohol 

==Clinical Presentation==
The natural history of progressive urate crystal deposition manifests as three classic stages.
#Acute gouty arthritis: 80% of attacks involve and single joint with severe pain, redness, and swelling.
#Intercritical gout: These are asymptomatic intervals between acute attacks most common early in disease progression. This pattern is quite uncommon in other arthritic disorders and alone is very suggestive of gout. 
#Chronic tophaceous gout: Collections of solid urate in connective tissues, which may be calcified. 

Attacks may occur for 4-6 years before radiographic evidence.

==Radiologic Findings==
===Location===
*Lower extremity &gt; upper extremity 
*Small joints &gt; large joints 
*Random distribution in hands (helpful diagnostic distinction) 
*First MTP most common (podagra) 
===Characteristics===
*Marginal, pararticular or intra-articular erosions which may have overhanging edges 
*Well-defined erosions that may have a sclerotic border 
*Joint space preserved (unless very advanced) 
*Not usually associated with osteoporosis 
*Soft tissue and bursa deposition - tophi 
*MRI - Tophus has low intensity on T1 and variable low to high intensity on T2 depending on the amount of amorphous calcification. 
*CT - Tophi have density similar to soft tissue. 
===Misc. Points=== 
*Erosions and tophi usually only with longstanding disease 
*40% of patients have concomitant CPPD 
*Can have many different appearances, but is quite common so always keep in mind.
===Images===

==Treatment==

First line is to control associated disorders such as hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and ethanol abuse.

===Acute Attack===
*Goal is to quickly alleviate pain. 
*Anti-inflammatory therapy with NSAIDs, colchicine, or Cox-2 inhibitors. 
*Should resolve symptoms in hours to days.

===Prophylactic===
*Goal is to prevent acute attacks. 
*Indomethacin or colchicine. 
*In patients without evident tophi, prophylaxis can be safely discontinued 6 to 12 months after serum urate levels have normalized.

===Antihyperuricemic therapy===

*Goal is a serum urate concentration of 5 to 6 mg/dL which is below that at which monosodium urate is saturating in extracellular fluids. 
*Uricosuric drugs and allopurinol can be used to lower the serum urate concentration.

===Surgery===

Surgery is typically only indicated to treat the complications of tophaceous disease, which include infection, compression due to the mass effect of a tophus, joint deformity, and intractable pain. Tophaceous deposits may compress nerves or erode through the skin resulting in chronic ulcers which often lead to infection.

&lt;/div&gt; duh...what's this about again?

==How the Solar System was born==
I propose to merge [[Wikijunior Solar System/How the Solar System was born]] into this article.  If there are any takers, let's try to put it in. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:46, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
:This has been done, right? --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:06, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Vote on Proofreading ==
[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] has [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Proofing and getting ready for publication|proposed]] that the time is approaching to start proofreading this wikibook.  I have [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Proofreading|proposed]] a process for proofing a page, and provided a place to [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Proofreading/discussion|talk about]] the proofreading process.

I have not seen any discussion of the proofreading process, so now I am going to ask for a vote.

== Resolution: Proofreading Our Solar System 2005-08-30 ==
Be it resolved that:
* This module, [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Our Solar System]], is essentially complete and in need of proofreading.
* We shall begin the proofreading process on this module &lt;s&gt;as of 2005-09-02&lt;/s&gt;as soon as voting is completed.
* We shall follow the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Proofreading|proposed proofreading process]]
** Including putting the &quot;proofreading notice&quot; at the top of the module
** And creating a list of tasks that people can volunteer for.

Voting will continue through &lt;s&gt;2005-09-01&lt;/s&gt;2005-09-06.
If, by the end of the voting period, the &quot;Ayes&quot; have it, any person can claim community support and begin the proofreading process referenced above (placing the notice and creating the initial list of assignments).

==Where to leave feedback?==
I'm new to this project and can't find a general discussion page about the Solar System book. If there is one, please feel free to move my comment to the appropriate place. I'd like to leave a little feedback from my daughter (nearly 8). She finds it confusing that there are so many explanations in brackets breaking up the story: is it too late to suggest little fact boxes where new words are explained separately? I think she'd also appreciate more diagrams, for example the section saying &quot;first comes Mercury, then...&quot; would be much easier to follow if there was a simple diagram next to it. [[User:84.179.32.65|84.179.32.65]] 19:34, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

It is never too late to create fact boxes or diagrams.
Anything that makes it easier to understand the book is good.
Please -- be bold! If you can find a good diagram, please find it.
I don't think you would interfere in the proofreading process by sticking it in.
If you want to suggest a change to the text (like extracting stuff into fact boxes), you can create a &quot;test version&quot; of the page or section and discuss it here.
Thanks!  We can use all the help we can get.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:09, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Havent touched the links or really deleted anything - [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 17:54 (UST), 31 October 2005

== Kids say the darndest things ==

I just had 5 kids in the age group of this book take a look and they said &quot;the words are really good, but it needs more pictures!&quot; good signs for the book!

-[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 17:54 (UST), 31 October 2005

GREAT work bringing in some kids.  Can you add some more pictures?  There are a lot of good ones available for free at NASA.  All it takes is googling NASA images, choosing, downloading to your PC, uploading to Commons and adding the &quot;public-domain NASA&quot; tag.
Thanks for offering. It will really improve the book.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

==Finishing up this module==
This module is nearly complete.  Please do not add information.  Please just proofread/copyedit the information already in the module.

When you take on assignment, please do not undo the work already completed in earlier assignments.  

If you feel this absolutely must be done, please reopen the phases of work that were completed but which you are now undoing.  

If you decide to use conjunctions to hook up existing sentences into more complex sentences, or to add words, you will undo the Phase 3 grade level work in the section you are changing.  Please remove the strikeouts and signatures from these sections of phase 3.

If you decide to add facts, this takes you back to phase 2. Please remove the &quot;done&quot; indications from phase 3 and phase 2 for those sections of the module.  For instance, the statement that Neptune's and Pluto's orbits cross needs to be fact-checked and needs a reference added in the reference list.  Then the sentence/paragraph that statement appears in needs to be checked for grade level.

If you decide to reorganize paragraphs, you need to be sure that the references travel with the facts, and you need to check the result for grade level again.

Please help move this book to completion.

Here is what I have discovered:
* Writing to grade level means I have to use short sentences and simple words. It sounds choppy.  I wouldn't write this way for adults.  But kids are still learning to read.
* WORD has a nice tool for evaluating grade level of the writing.  It's part of the grammar check, so spelling and grammar get checked at the same time.  Bonus.  Most of what I had written already passed WORD's grammar checks.

Thanks to everyone who is trying to make this book great.  I know we can all come to an agreement and all pull in the same direction to get this book done. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

Now, we send rockets into space to learn more. Astronauts travel around the Earth. Some of them have landed on the the Moon. Robots can fly to other worlds to take pictures. There are even robots on Mars now!

I would say we send astronauts and robots into space. Get rid of the exclamation point.

Rockets carry probes, telescopes, astronauts and robots into space. Astronauts have landed on the moon and robots have landed on mars.

Have robots landed on the moon?

::There are many robots that have gone to the Moon.  Most notable is the Surveyor probes, of which Apollo XII landed within just a few feet of one of the robotic missions to the Moon.  I'm not sure if the designers of that probe expected human hands to work on it after launch, but some pieces were returned to the Earth to test metal fatigue on the lunar environment, and a speculative finding of bacteria that somehow survived for several years on the surface of the Moon raised a whole lot of questions for exobiology and how to maintain a clean environment for interplanetary probes so they don't carry lifeforms with them to other worlds by mistake.

I added a note stating that 'planetary' is what these nebulae were called because through 18th century telescopes, they looked like planets.  The name stuck but they have nothing to do with planets.

Granola bars are a very tasty and easy food to make. They can be sold at the market in small bars, such as the size of a candy bar. However, by following these commonly used steps you can create your own tasty granola bars right at home.

This recipe is for ''chewy'' granola bars.

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 cup (120g) of soft [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 3/4 cup (180g) of brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/3 cup (80ml) of corn syrup
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 3 1/2 cups (900g) of uncooked [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]
* 1 cup (240g) of chocolate chips

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 350° F (180c).
# Grease 13 x 9&quot; (30cm x 23cm) baking pan.
# Combine butter, sugar and corn syrup.
# Blend in egg and vanilla.
# Add oats and chocolate chips.
# Bake 20 - 22 minutes.
# Let cool and enjoy.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
To create granola with extra taste, add a desired amount of nuts and raisin.

==Video 1==

This is the first of a series of video recordings for explaining the introspector project.

I have decided that a simple personal introduction would be the best way to explain the background and purpose of the project.

The videos will be hosted on wikibooks.org/wiki/Introspector but also posted to Youtube and other portals.

This video should be understandable to my friends and family but also interesting to fellow computer programmers.

The content will be split into modules so that people can skip over material that is not interesting to them.

We will cover many aspects of the introspector project and build a foundation for learning about computing in general.

I will explain what a compiler is, what programming languages are and try to also include the basics of computers for an introduction to computing. 

In short, a compiler translates a human written and readable instructions into machine instructions for controlling the computer.

The gcc compiler translates over 5 different languages including C, C++, Java, Fortran, Pascal and ADA into machine languages for windows based Intel machines, Linux based Intel machines, older Macintosh machines running on Motorola processors and basically every hardware on the planet. 

Later we will build up from the gnu g++ compiler to gnu tools like the gnu bash shell and Linux OS kernel.

The bash shell will be introduced as a C program that is compiled, and then as a program that you use.

We will go through the basics of the bash programming, as it has its own language, and show how the bash functions are interpreted and executed by a C program. 

We will show how bash used the C runtime library of functions to call operating system functions and control the hardware.

We will create basic programs and then show you all steps from writing source code, to compiling, linking, running and debugging the code. I want to be able to give people a feeling for all the steps involved in translation of a computer program into a running system.

One video will show you how to install the gcc compiler on cygwin windows and compile changes to it yourself.

Other videos will show you how to apply patches, how to debug the compiler and what types of patches are available.

Others will show various debugging options and dump files that are available in the compiler.

We will review some of the modules of the compiler, explain the functions provided, who wrote them and the usage of them.

We will build the course up to explaining the need for extracting data from the compiler, and the motivation for the need of the introspector.

Then we will go into RDF and the semantic web as an intelligent representation of the compiler graphs.

Later we will cover the visualization tools like graphviz and the manipulation of the graphs.

Thank you for listening and I am looking forward to your feedback.

==Management overview of the introspector==

Introspection is basically what is better know in the computer world as reflection. The term &quot;intro&quot; gives us the connotation of inside, looking inside as opposed to reflection that implies a mirror. For me, introspection means looking inside at the structure of program. This means looking at the private and internal data, and giving that data meaning, because we know about it (in that moment). 
Given all the people involved in the creation of all the parts of a program and the computer system, we cannot achieve full introspection without having access to all their knowledge. This means that there will be limits to the introspection, but we can, given a large enough set of data about the code, crack it.

So, introspection is a means, by which, when applied correctly, can help crack the code of a software and intercept the hidden and encapsulated meaning of the internals of a program.

Introspection is way, a method or process,  to break the convention of data hiding and encapsulation by injecting of data collectors into the programs where they have the most information about your software and collecting this information into an intelligible form.

The injection of data collectors involves modification of existing programs, or the modification of the execution path via the debugger. 

Given only a binary executable, it is possible to apply this technique, because we can apply introspection to the operating system, shell, and dynamic linker and loader. We can introspect the assembly processing tools and add in information. We can introspect the execution via profiling given knowledge of the processor. 

Given no access to the operating system, no access to the tool chain, it will be almost impossible to apply introspection on the machine level. There the process of introspection could be applied to the human operator, to the console and screen shots, were all interaction, all inputs and outputs to and from the system are collected. 

The whole idea is that this data collected can be cross referenced to other data collected outside by other systems. The cross referencing is the key to understanding and enriching the data and this is the information gaining and enrichment process.

The full introspection process needs information to work with. 

We concentrate only on free/open source software, because it is the only software for which we have enough public information to work on. 

Let us start by defining how the GNU Linux operating system is setup.

With a test case we can document the inputs and expected outputs of a function.
with assembly and data flow analysis we can understand the types of operations on the data that take place. We can trace where a variable is used and how.
With source code we can automate the decoding of the binaries.
With change control logs, we can automate the documentation of the sources.
With mailing lists, we can understand the discussions about those changes of the sources.
Given a source-forge ticketing system, we can also have those artifacts structured in a consistent manner. 
Now, all those aspects add in information about the program.
But when we understand all this information about how the compiler processes the source code, then we can also connect all that together, automatically.

Bash is a shell, it is a program.
The shell interacts with the operating system, the core.
The shell protects the user from the internals of the core.
strace can help intercept calls to the operating system.
the calls to the operating system can be seen as a line from the shell to the core and back.
the usage of the operating system, its resources such as memory and file system is also vital to understand a program.
The operating system usage is hidden from direct inspection.
The shell implementation is also hidden. 

Full versus Abstract Understanding :
All this hidden data is needed for full understanding. Abstract understanding can be however gained by sticking to the interface. We can build an abstract model of the processing. 
Depending on the depth of the data collected, we can gain more detailed understanding.
The internals of the processor are hard to gain access to. Each one is different. The companies try hard to protect the chips design and keep them to themselves. That gives them an advantage.

we can assume that Each tool that is available needs to have a purpose for it to survive. 
The viability of a tool is something that can be thought about and analysed.
Tools that reduce the protection of other tools can be seen as lowering the cost of access. yet these tools also have a cost themselves. we can replace one high set of barriers with another lower set of barriers, yet the barriers are still there. 

The problem has to be reduced, and this requires decision making. That involves in the first step the human pattern matching. This can also be codified, but it is still a cost.
The people also need to consume resources to survive, and therefore are not objective. 
I think that one social aspect is that people will protect their interests so that they will avoid doing things that would threaten the stability of their environment. 
The costs of learning something is something they want to get a return on. If the cost of producing or learning a tool is high, then artificial barriers will be created to make sure that others cannot easily access that. This is one of the key issues in the protection of information.
The more resources collected by producer, them more resources they have to protect themselves.
There will be a breaking point where a system will collapse into itself and start protecting itself as a survival system. 

The very fact that there are so many problems involved in technology means that only ones that are supported will survive. For them to be supported, they need to have a clear model of viability.

The program is really a set of assembly instructions that can also be analysed
each instruction is encoded in a string of bytes.
we can analyse each byte of information and gain information about it. 

In order to understand this information we need however to connect it to the information gained from other systems. This requires communication between many different systems.
The communication is difficult, because often there are many different barriers between them.

By analysis of the machine, we are able to see how the path of execution connects them.
In order to do that, we need however to have a set of tests that are understood.
Understanding of tests could just mean that we can map the test case onto a specification that we also understand. 
The specification would be split into parts that can be understood by a human. 
The language of the specification could also be parsed by language tools, and that would provide us with a graph structure that contains identifiers that could be mapped onto things found in the test.

So understanding can be defined by a complete mapping of the graph of data found about the execution of the test to the graph of data extracted from the specification.

we would first define a way to describe layers of graphs that are interconnected.
each layer would be extracted from a different tool. Each layer however would be described in a common language. the graph of RFD. 

The layer is a program itself, and the total amount of possible graph types is large. That means that a test case would represent a small subset of the total possible amount of graph data. The main point is that the connection and mapping between these graphs it the key.

Programs also do not always work efficiently, so that there might be a huge amount of processing that is not really needed to solve the test case itself. Lets assume that a profile would mark that processing path that is really executed. 

given a large test case, we can then look for overlapping parts of smaller tests cases that match the larger one. This would allow us to decompose the large graph into smaller sub-graphs. 

Then we can also assert that all this work is being done for a specific purpose. The purpose is understood and it limits the scope of the problem. We need to understand this scope to prevent from wasting resources.

we can iteratively define the system by understanding the work needed to be done by a human in the  solving a problem .we need to provide tools for them to work efficiently.

binutils allows us to process a binary program
there is a relationship between the source code and the binary, it is created via the compiler.
Understanding Source code of a program allows understanding of the program
the compiler processes the source code.
The compiler is run by the shell.
setting breakpoints in the debugger allows inspecting variables
when debugging or inspecting a program you can easily be overloaded by information
It is possible to use scripts attached to breakpoints to collect information into a file or stream
tools can be used to process the collected information to make sense of it
we often need to display a graph collected out the dependencies to understand it.
the graph structure is natural to the mind to understand
RFD is based on graphs.



==Original motivation==
The author, James Michael DuPont describes his original motivation for the program :

The original idea came from my research into Logic Programming and Program generators. I had attempted to learn Turbo Prolog as a teenager, but never quite got up to speed with it. However, I did like reading the programming manuals, and had done some example programs. The problem for me was that I did not grasp the concepts about its meaning logically, but was more like the child who was putting Nintendo games in the slot. The database assertions were the ones that threw me off, I did not understand that the statements were objects of their own.

Starting with DBASE V with all its graphical interfaces, I became quickly adept at creating databases. Then I did some DBASE III work as well. Back in the late 80s RAD was in. FoxPro, Paradox, and other environments like Alpha4 and the tool Zachary were the key for me.

RAD Interactive Program Generators and Editors use a structured model of data that allows a programmer to quickly solve programs. Meaningful Import and Export functionalities, coupled with remote network file access and locking, were all you needed to create workgroups of people interacting.

These were the original models that define the concepts that I had in mind when the program was designed. That is the model to keep in mind when looking at the introspector project. I used these tools to solve problems for business people around me in my family circle.

This original limited understanding of the implementation of the programs and focus on practical problem solving should be kept in mind.

Now, when we write a document, it is difficult to identify all the streams of data that are flowing into it from the mind of the programmer.

We should however consider it possible that we might become aware of our current situation and want to break out of a monotonic situation.
This collapsing of a mental stream into a more compact form and execution of an action of writing is an atomic task.
We can see a stream of data as a collapsing house of cards that fall down over time. The writing of symbol to the output to the keyboard is then the final committing of an action. We can then read that symbol back in as input in another stage. 
Building the house of cards together again requires more than just the cards, and this is where the need for the model is apparent. 
The model is basically all the data that you need to have to decode the message.  For the computer, that is the moment it executes a byte of instruction. So the model for that instruction would be all the data that is needed to be able to trace it back to some external model at some point in the system. 

Programs that are generated out of such a model will contain back references to their generating model in the file names, variable names, function names, even in the literal constants, the comments and various other user data sections that are available. Given such a model of the user space, we can assign a meaning to each program declaration. The meaning is defined in terms of the application model.

The purpose of the introspector is not to provide all data for all people at all times, but to provide on-demand structured data about your software program to help you quickly solve problems. The idea is that you have to get information out of a system to which you only have partial access; using the introspection process, you can extract data from the tools that process your programs by creating interceptor objects that hook into running processes and capture any data going to or from a point in the program.

The point of the program can be defined as the instruction pointer of the program. 
Given a test case that tests for a certain feature we will be able to map a given input file to a model location.

We can see this wiki as a specification. Each version of the wikipage can be seen as a resource. Each word of that version can be used as a index. 
With this indexing schema we can define all parts of a program with the wikibook.

==Example==
Let us assume that there is an implementation of a program that is specified by some document. This is executed in a process on some host.

We can define a point in the input data by its offset. This is the reference to the model. Only a register is needed to reference the model that is stored in an array.

Only by choosing and defining a formal viewpoint can you may any sense of the flood of data that is available to you from the compiler.

It's bootstrap idea works by using a version of GCC which uses a modified version of the built in tree dumper to transform print statements about the asts into live data in [[wikipedia:Resource Description Framework]] format via the [[wikipedia:Redland API]].

==Status==


Here is some information about the gcc interface
[[Introspector/GccCpp]]

== Representation of Graphs==

Various Experiments have been done and exist with a low level back end representation that is optimized for compiler graphs, 
experiments with the special [[wikipedia:data structure]] &quot;[[wikipedia:ice cube (informatics)|ice cube]]&quot; for higher speed transfer of the data. 
The ice cube is a compressed data cube, a set of vectors describing the compiler graphs efficiently.

The data was compiled directly into the program, so that the data was loaded when the program starts. 
this does not allow for changing of the data.
That was in 2003.

Later, in Jan 2005 I have created a more compact graph representation in C and algorithms for using them.
This was a good start. It stored the graphs as fixed length records that can be loaded in blocks from the file system.

'''Goal:'''

For local usage :
The final goal would be able to generate a shared object whenever needed that would generate the most compact and fastest representation of a graph for loading on that machine. 
we could also use a core dump, given that the graph data is stored in a neutral format. 

For transfer :
If you want to export a graph, then storing it as RDF/XML would be optimal.

== Database ==

Postgres Interfaces have been built, storing the graphs collected.
the database structure of the first version was based on the node types directly. with one table per node type.

Additionally I have used redland to create the database, which creates the tables to represent the graph directly.

The issue of using the database table is that you need to have the following constraints:

'''LOCALITY''': The records that occur together in the compiler should be stored in a way that they can be retrieved together.

'''Types of Records''': The types of records, and the fields that they have need to be chosen carefully.
There are very many types of records. For example there are very many types of function declarations.

It does not always make sense to use a union type for the database tables and store all the instances in the same table.

The first introspection sample is collected from gcc [[wikipedia:abstract semantic graph]]


== Integration ==

All of these tools are in a dijunct state and are not integrated yet.

== Blurb ==
The [[Introspector/Project]] has the [[Introspector/Project/Goals]] of building [[Introspector/MetaData/Manipulation/Tools]] for [[WG:Free_Software_and_Open_Source_software]] and [[Introspector/SourceCode]].

The Introspector is a new [[Introspector/ToolChain]] to extract [[Introspector/MetaData]] about your SoftwarePrograms from the GnuCompilerCollection and other FreeSoftware LanguageTools such as the PerlLanguage, the CSharpLanguage, the BashLanguage and present it to you for making your job as a programmer easier. Code MetaProgramming will become a snap with ExtensibleStyleSheet like Transformations being possible. Agents that condense software information into graphs and guis are underway.

The software is FreeSoftware in the spirit of the GnuManifesto and is revolutionary in the freedoms that it intends on granting to its users.

This MetaData includes all data collected about your software by the compiler, the make &amp; build system, the savannah/sourceforge project management and debian packaging system, the CVS changes and the mailman mailing list software.

== Scope creep ==
The Introspector's scope was originally just the GCC C compiler, but is now expanded to include the extraction of  metadata from different compilers and interpreters, such as Perl, bison, m4, bash, C#, Java, C++, Fortran, objective-c, Lisp and Scheme. Various patches will be officially submitted to allow for the Introspector to extract data in a standard form.

== File format ==
This extracted metadata are stored in ntriple rdf files, a repository categorised by the program run, the input file, the function or class declared, and the time and date of the introspection. These files are standardized and available to tools like [[eulersharp]], [[cwm]], Java, Perl, C, C++, etc. via the Redland RDF API. These rdf files can be accessed concurrently via the redland storage interface.

==Sources ==
The metadata is to be extracted from these free tools:
* AbstractSyntaxTrees of the GCC compiler
* AbstractSyntaxTrees  of the [[DotGNU/PNET/CSCC]] and [[DotGNU/PNET/C]]compiler
* PerlInternals interface 
* Bash Shell will be extended to dump its  objects into Rdf as well (based on the [[BashDB]])
* BisonParseTree with [[BisonRules]] [[BisonTokens]]
* M4MacroLanguage 
* Debian-SF sourceforge application repository [[GForge]]
* PhpLanguage
* PythonLanguage
* SilverSchemeLanguage

==Interfaces ==
We are building IntrospectorInterfaces to FreeSoftware to allow this metadata to be processed by various applications
* GUIEditor [[Glade]]
* GraphLayoutTool [[Vcg]]
* DiagramEditor  [[Dia]]
* TextEditor [[Emacs]]

== Definition Of Introspection ==


==MetaDataManipulationTools==
 include 
* DataExtractionTools
* DataRepresentation 
* DataRepository
* DataVisualizationTools
* CodeGenerationTools

== IntrospectorGui==

* HtmlFormat
* TabularText FileFormats

==IntrospectorOntology==

The introspector ontology work is in a state ready for integration. 

I have created newer versions of the ontology describing the gcc compiler nodes.

Here are the aspects of the ontology: 

1. Nodes defined in tree.def
2. Data Structures defined in c, tree.h
3. Data structures dumped in tree-dumper.c
4. Data structures access methods in the macros
5. Usage of the tree in the code of the gcc itself.

=== Dynamic Issues ===
What aspects of the tree are used to build the compiler itself.
* What aspects of the tree are used to define the tree.
* What aspects of the tree are used to fill out the tree.

=== Coverage ===
What test code is needed to exercise the compiler and execute all paths of code.
What paths are needed to fill out all aspects of the tree.
What parts of the tree are coming from user data?
What parts of the tree are coming from compiler data?


=== Built In Data ===
What data is built into the compiler itself?
What are the differences between the compiler versions?

=== Standard Headers ===

What data is created by standard headers? 
What versions of the headers are used?

=== Best Fit Ontology ===

1. What types of records are created from running the compiler?

We want to understand the types of real data collected from the compiler.
We want to see a ontology type of record for each occurring configuration of data in the output.

Ideally we would define the type of data as the full path of execution through the compiler, each instruction that affects the 
data would be recorded in the type history. 

For now, we collect the types of data that occur and create a type of each one. This is what I call the '''instance type'''.

2. What are the common fields: 

for each type of data, each set of fields there is a subset of the fields that also occur in other records.
We calculate the greatest common set of fields and relate them to the '''instance type'''.


'''Warning :'''
In OWL, a superset/subset relationship is defined where the instance type is the supertype of the more general type.
Why


3. What fields are list fields that just give order to the data?

4. What fields represent the meaning of the program?
5. What other types of records are referenced by the fields?
6. What other records via which fields reference the object of what type?


[http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/ProtegeReasonerAPI| See the Protoge Reasoner API]

==Reasoner Integration==


My goal is the usage of fact++ reasoner that is built into the gcc in a single process.


For this to work we need to handling the following issues :

1. When to feed data to reasoner

We can feed the data to the reasoner :
* We can for the first step handle the dumping functions of the gcc. 
* when it is first collected in the compiler. 
* after the compile has been finished.
* When it is triggered by user defined code being executed.
* When user defined patterns defined in RDF outside the compile occurs in the code that are matched

* We want to be able to process the data during the const folding phase


2. What data to feed to reasoner

We can create a record based on :
*  the data structures of the compiler itself.
*  the data dumper functions, base on the record type.
*  the user defined code, using attributes to mark what data is needed
*  using a rdf to describe what data is to be collected

3. How to process the results of the reasoner

* We need to be able to merge the results of many compile runs together
* We want to be able to influence the compile itself. Creating new structures.
* We want to be able to define user code that is executed during the compile (constant folding expressions) that are based on
constant data collected from the compiler.
* We want to generate new code that is compiled and linked in

==DataExtraction==
Needs to be able to:
* ExtractWiki
* ExtractMbox 
* ExtractSavannah
* ExtractCvs

==UserManagement==
A UserManagement and DeclarationManagement System is needed for the DataRepository.

Examples of IntrospectedProjects are here.

[[w:Rheumatoid_arthritis|Rheumatoid arthritis]] is the most common purely erosive inflammatory arthropathy. Rheumatoid arthritis is generally symmetric and affects proximal joints. There are no proliferative erosions as in erosive OA, psoriatic or Reiter's arthritides. Rheumatoid arthritis rarely includes any productive bone such as periostitis, enthesopathy, and osteophyte formation unless there is secondary osteoarthritis present. Rheumatoid factor is positive in 90-95% of the cases. Early in rheumatoid arthritis the RF may be falsely negative, and in older patients, the RF may be falsely positive. [MSK: The Requisites, 2nd edition, Manaster ''et al.'']

The characteristic radiographic features of rheumatoid arthritis include soft-tissue swelling, periarticular osteoporosis, joint space narrowing, articular erosions, and marginal erosions. The marginal erosions are caused by the extension of pannus into synovial pockets overlying regions devoid of articular cartilage (which would normally protect against the toxic debris and inflammatory pannus in the synovial fluid). [Musculoskeletal Imaging: Case Review, Josephy Yu, 2001]

==Radiographic Findings==

===Within the Wrist===
Early RA will demonstrate erosions in the distal radioulnar joint, ulnar styloid, radial styloid, and triquetro-pisiform joint (the latter are best seen on ball-catcher's view). Typically, the next erosions and joint space narrowing will occur in the carpal bones and MCP joints. Ligamentous rupture can lead to wrist instability resulting in ulnar translocation of entire carpus, scapholunate instability, and dorsal and volar flexion carpal instability (DISI and VISI).

===Within the Elbow===

Diffuse involvement of joint with extensive erosion in olecranon articulation and joint space narrowing with trochlea of humerus seeming to &quot;dig into&quot; olecranon. Joint effusion a

===Within the Shoulder===

Glenohumeral joint space narrowing with marginal erosions within the humeral head. Ligamentous/tendinous injury results in rotator cuff degeneration with a &quot;high-riding&quot; humeral head. Also look for lysis of the lateral clavicle and erosion at the insertion of the coracoclavicular ligament.

===Within the Spine===
The cervical spine is commonly affected; particularly look for C1-C2 involvement which can have catastrophic consequences. For instance, pannus formation near the odontoid can cause erosions in the odontoid and ligamentous laxity of the transverse ligaments. The latter results in increased predental space (greater than 2.5-3 mm which is upper limit of normal in adults) which can result in canal stenosis. Alternatively, the pannus itself can proliferate and directly compress the spinal cord. Also, ligamentous destruction can result in atlantoaxial impaction (i.e. dens goes up into the foramen magnum along with Mr. Cord--Mr. Cord doesn't like that). Other findings include erosions within the facet joints.

===Within the Hip===
Axial joint space narrowing leading to protrusio deformity at the severe end of the spectrum, diffuse osteoporosis, lack of osteophyte formation unless secondary OA occurs. In contradistinction, OA usually results in superolateral (i.e. weight-bearing) acetabular joint space narrowing, normal bone density and osteophyte formation

===Within the Knee===
Joint space narrowing, osteoporosis, marginal erosions, without osteophyte formation unless there is secondary OA (do you see a recurring theme?). There may be a joint effusion with fluid tracking into the semimembranosus-gastrocnemius bursa (AKA Baker's or popliteal cyst). Occasionally there will also be patellar tendon rupture.

===Within the Feet===
MTP joint erosions early on, particularly of the 5th MTP. Toe deformities that result include lateral deviation at the MCPs and hammer toes. Also look for retrocalcaneal bursitis with erosions in the posterior calcaneus; the retrocalcaneal fluid can obliterate the pre-Achilles fat pad (AKA Krager's fat pad).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;Intra-articular bodies&lt;/b&gt; are fragments of cartilage or bone that may occur free within the joint space.

==Pathogenesis==
&lt;b&gt;Synovial osteochondromatosis (SOC)&lt;/b&gt; is a benign proliferation of the synovium.  Etiology is unknown.  In this condition, cartilaginous metaplasia takes place within the synovial membrane of the joint.  Metaplastic synovium organizes into nodules.  With minor trauma, nodules are shed as small bodies into the joint space.  In some patients the disease process may involve tendon sheaths and bursal sacs.

Cartilaginous intra-articular bodies float freely within the synovial fluid, which they require for nutrition and growth.  Progressive enlargement and ossification occur with time.  If they remain free, they continue to grow larger and more calcified.  In severe cases, they may occupy the entire joint space or penetrate to adjacent tissues.  Alternately, they can deposit in the synovial lining, reestablish a blood supply, and become replaced by bone.  On occasion, synovial reattachment can lead to complete reabsorption of the cartilage fragment.

==Classification==
Classification is divided into primary versus secondary SOC.  Primary SOC occurs in an otherwise normal joint.  It is suggested by monoarticular involvement in a patient in the third to fifth decades of life.  Secondary SOC occurs in older patients in joints previously affected by joint disease such as osteoarthritis.  This pattern is suggested by bilateral involvement with multiple joint intra-articular bodies.

==Gross Pathology==

Cartilaginous bodies or osteocartilaginous bodies with central ossification may be noted.  They are typically spherical in shape.  Sizes range from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter.  The synovium of the involved joint demonstrates villous hyperplasia, which imparts a wrinkled appearance on gross examination.  There may be cartilaginous bodies attached to the synovium.  Synovial involvement may be focal or diffuse in nature.

==Clinical Presentation==

Chronic, progressive pain and swelling of affected joint, exacerbated by physical activity.  Joint effusion and limited range of motion are common associated features.  It primarily affects large joints, including knee (&gt;50% of cases), elbow, hip, and shoulder.  SOC is twice as common in men as women.  Some patients have intra-articular bodies resting in stable positions within joint recesses or bursae.  These patients may be asymptomatic, with SOC merely as an incidental finding at imaging.  

==Radiologic Findings==

===Radiography===
Typical finding is of multiple, smooth, oval-shaped calcified masses within the joint space or bursa.  They have a characteristic popcorn-ball appearance of calcified cartilage.  With serial imaging, masses may be found to change in size, disappear, or migrate to recessed areas of the joint.  They may pass from the main joint cavity into a neighboring synovial cyst.  For this reason, a mass may not be appreciated within the actual joint space itself.

Additional radiographic findings include joint effusion and degenerative changes such as joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/b&gt; Lateral knee radiograph demonstrating multiple large bodies within a Baker's cyst.

===CT Arthrography===

CT is best utilized in earlier stages of the disease process, before cartilaginous bodies have calcified.  CT can effectively detect non-calcified masses or those with only minimal calcification, which allows the radiologist to distinguish this condition from a simple joint effusion.

[[Image:soc2.jpg|Elbow CT of intra-articular bodies in the region of the capitulum.]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 2&lt;/b&gt; Elbow CT of intra-articular bodies in the region of the capitulum.

===MR Imaging===

MR appearance depends on composition of the intra-articular body.  Entirely cartilaginous bodies will appear isointense to muscle on T1 and hyperintense to muscle on T2 weighted images.  Partly calcified intra-articular bodies demonstrate foci of absent signal on all pulse sequences.  Like CT arthrography, MR with gadolinium may be used to detect intra-articular bodies that have not yet calcified.

[[Image:soc3.jpg|MR demonstrating multiple intra-articular bodies within the bicipital tendon sheath.]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; MR demonstrating multiple intra-articular bodies within the bicipital tendon sheath.

==Complications==

Malignant transformation to synovial chondrosarcoma.  This is a very rare complication occurring in chronic cases.  Treatment entails synovial excision and total joint replacement.

Clicking, grating, or locking may result from acute mechanical problems due to intra-articular bodies within the affected joint.  Locking of the joint may destroy articular cartilage, resulting in secondary osteoarthritis.  Symptoms such as joint stiffness and aching are the result of osteoarthritis that sets in after years of persistent joint irritation.

==Treatment==

Asymptomatic patients do not require therapy.  Symptomatic patients should undergo arthroscopic or surgical removal of intra-articular bodies.  Patients who have recurrent intra-articular bodies or in whom the entire synovial lining is metaplastic require total synovectomy

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Trauma-related:
**Fracture with avulsed fragment 
**Fragmentation of meniscus with calcification

*Degenerative joint disease related:
**Degenerative joint disease with detached spur

*Synovial proliferation:
**Pigmented villonodular synovitis

*Neoplastic:
**Synovial chondrosarcoma

*Other:
**Osteochondritis dissecans 
**Sequestrum from osteomyelitis 
**Neuropathic (Charcot) joint

Intra-articular bodies in SOC typically have popcorn calcification, with a dense sclerotic border with radiolucent central region.  This distinct radiographic appearance sets it apart from other cause of intra-articular bodies.  Number and size of intra-articular bodies can prove helpful as well.  SOC typically presents as multiple intra-articular bodies.  Few or isolated intra-articular bodies are more consistent with trauma or osteoarthritis.

[[Wikipedia:Sarcoidosis|Sarcoidosis]] is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in tissues without other known cause for granulomatous disease. The disease has a diversity of clinical manifestations, most commonly affecting the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, and eyes, but can involve any organ system, including the musculoskeletal system.

==History==
The first case of sarcoid was described by Jonathan Hutchinson over one hundred years ago at King's College Hospital in London. The first person to recognize bone involvement in sarcoidosis was Karl Kreibich in 1904. He found multiple radiolucencies, particularly in the distal end of the second phalanges, on the radiograph of a patient with sarcoid. After examining 60 histologic samples and not identifying any tubercule bacilli, he concluded that lupus pernio, the hallmark of chronic sarcoidosis and associated bone lesions, was a distinct granulomatous process unrelated to tuberculosis. 

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of sarcoid is estimated to be 10 to 20 per 100,000 people. Incidence varies among geographic regions as well as with ethnicity, with blacks having a three to four time increased risk compared to other ethnicities. In the United States, African Americans have a tenfold increased risk for sarcoid compared to Caucasians while Asians are rarely affected. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Clinical manifestations depend on ethnicity, chronicity of illness, site and extent of tissue involvement, and activity of the granulomatous process. African Americans are more likely to present acutely and to have more severe disease than Caucasians, who tend to present with asymptomatic and chronic disease. 

==Clinical Presentation==
The disease presents between 20 and 40 years of age in 70 to 90 percent of patients. About one half of cases are diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients by an abnormality on a routine chest radiograph. The most common organ system affected by sarcoid is the lung, with the most common presenting symptoms being cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Patients may also suffer from fatigue, weight loss, weakness, malaise, fever, and ocular disease. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Musculoskeletal involvement usually occurs in patients with generalized disease. Affected patients may present with an acute polyarthritis (especially of the ankle joints), usually occurring in association with erythema nodosum and occasionally with acute uveitis. Involvement of muscle and bone is less common and usually indicates a chronic and prolonged clinical course.

==Pathophysiology==
The diagnosis of sarcoid is based on compatible clinical and radiographic findings, supportive laboratory data (elevated ACE levels, anergy, elevated serum gamma globulins, positive Kveim test), and evidence of noncaseating granulomas in the absence of other causes for such lesions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The exact etiology and pathogenesis of sarcoid remains unknown. Several hypotheses exist regarding the involvement of bone in this disease, including:
*high levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 causing stimulation of osteoclastic activity and bone resorption 
*granuloma induction of a local osteoclastic reaction 
*granuloma production of an osteoclastic activating factor inducing bone resorption 

==Musculoskeletal Involvement==

===Joints===
Joint symptoms and signs occur in 10 to 35 percent of patients with sarcoidosis and occur more frequently in women than in men. Articular disease in sarcoid can be divided into two types: acute and chronic polyarthritis.

The acute pattern is seen in the first six months of symptoms and has a self-limiting course, typically resolving in 4 to 6 weeks. The knees, ankles, elbows, PIP joints, and wrists are the most commonly affected joints. The arthralgia is thought to be due to the effect of inflammatory cytokines on the joints rather than direct granulomatous changes. Monoarthritis and effusion are uncommon. Conventional radiographs of symptomatic joints are usually unremarkable or show only osteoporosis and soft-tissue swelling. Sonographic findings include joint effusions, tenosynovitis, and subcutaneous inflammation. Patients may have elevated ESR and C reactive protein.

When the acute polyarthritis manifests as periarticular ankle inflammation in combination with erythema nodosum and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the term Lofgren syndrome is given.

Six months or more after the diagnosis of sarcoid, up to 40% of patients may develop joint symptoms due to granulomatous arthritis. The granulomatous synovitis usually follows a chronic transient or relapsing course which may eventually lead to irreversible joint damage. Chronic polyarthritis is more common in women. Involved joints include the knees, ankles, PIP joints, and occasionally the wrists or shoulders. Dactylitis of the fingers may also be seen. 

Unlike the acute form of polyarthritis, which is often seen with erythema nodosum, this arthritis is commonly associated with cutaneous sarcoid. Radiographic findings related to joint disease are unusual unless there is extension of osseous disease to subchondral bone. Mild joint space narrowing and erosions can be seen but are nonspecific findings. 

Acute or chronic sarcoid arthropathy is a clinical diagnosis and MR imaging is usually not sought. However, MR imaging may be helpful for lesions that are not detected by conventional radiography. Tenosynovitis, tendonitis, bursitis, and synovitis can be seen on MR but are nonspecific findings and may require biopsy for diagnosis of granulomatous involvement.

===Muscles===

Sarcoid myopathy may demonstrate either myopathic or nodular type involvement. Discrete sarcoidal muscle lesions are reported in 1.4% of known sarcoidosis cases although muscle biopsies demonstrate skeletal muscle granulomas in 50-80% of sarcoidosis patients, usually in asymptomatic patients. 

Nodular sarcoid myopathy has a characteristic MR appearance that allows accurate diagnosis. The sarcoid nodules appear as focal intramuscular masses, usually at the musculotendinous junction, are often multiple and bilateral in distribution, and have a lower extremity predominance. Their appearance is described as a &quot;dark star&quot; with central areas of fibrosis that have low signal intensity on all sequences and peripheral areas of bright signal intensity on T2WI and enhancement on post-contrast images (Moore, et al.).

In myopathic sarcoid myopathy, there are nonspecific findings of symmetric proximal muscle atrophy with fatty replacement and increased signal intensity of involved muscle on T2WI. Corticosteroid therapy may be a confounding factor in evaluating potential sarcoid muscle atrophy with the differentation based on clinical findings. MRI may be helpful in delineating the extent of fatty replacement and indicating an optimal location for muscle biopsy.

===Bone===
Reports of bone involvement in sarcoid have ranged between 1 and 13 percent, with an average of 5 percent. An accurate percentage is difficult to obtain as many skeletal lesions are asymptomatic, screening skeletal surveys are not routinely performed, and minor cystic bone changes can be seen in normal individuals.

The general pattern of osseous lesions is summarized below:
*Distribution: often bilateral
*Site of origin: cortical with preservation of periosteum
*Location: most commonly the hands and feet, although the long bones, skull, vertebrae, pelvis, ribs, sternum, and calcaneus can rarely be affected 
*Position: usually at the ends of affected bones
*Shape: cystic or lacelike with minimal involvement of adjacent soft tissues or extensive bone erosion with pathologic fracture
*Calcification: absent


==Radiologic Findings==

Nuclear scintigraphic findings are usually positive before lesions can be seen on radiography. The radiographic manifestations of sarcoidosis vary with the region of the skeleton affected. 

===Small bone sarcoidosis===

Lesions affecting the small bones of the hands and feet typically have a lytic or lacy reticular appearance on conventional radiographs. Lytic lesions are either minute cortical defects in the phalangeal heads or larger rounded punched-out lesions involving the cortex and medulla. The middle and distal phalanges are the most frequently involved. The lytic lesions likely represent an osteoporotic process producing local and destructive tunneling. The lacy reticular pattern is seen when the tunneling of the cortex is followed by remodeling of the cortical and trabecular architecture. The concave shape of the phalangeal shafts then becomes more tubular. There is often accompanied soft tissue swelling. More localized lytic lesions are also seen, forming cystic defects that may become surrounded by a thin rim of sclerosis as they heal.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 2&lt;/b&gt; The same lacy pattern is demonstrated in the left hand of the same patient. Note the subcortical tunneling in the middle phalanx of the fifth digit.



[[Image:sarc3.jpg|A similar pattern of bone loss is seen in this radiograph of the wrist.]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; A similar pattern of bone loss is seen in this radiograph of the wrist.


In an advanced sclerotic phase, a sequestrum may be seen. Fractures are rare but may occur with extensive lytic disease. Alignment deformities may result due to pathologic fractures with bone collapse rather than secondary to actual joint abnormalities.

[[Image:sarc4.jpg|Extensive lytic lesions and subcortical tunneling. There is also acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges of the third and fourth digits.]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; Extensive lytic lesions and subcortical tunneling. There is also acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges of the third and fourth digits.


Lesions occult to plain radiography may be seen with MR imaging which may demonstrate bone marrow lesions, extension of granulomas beyond the cortex, periosseous soft tissue involvement, or fine perpendicular lines extending from the ghost cortex. Although MR imaging is not necessary for the diagnosis of small bone sarcoidosis, it may be helpful in certain clinical situations, such as differentiating the cause for dactylitis in a patient with sarcoid and gout. 

===Large Bone sarcoidosis===

Detection of sarcoid lesions involving the long bones and axial skeleton is considered uncommon. Lesions may be painful or asymptomatic. Neither bone scintigraphy nor skeletal surveys have been found to be good screening studies for sarcoid lesions.

*Radiographic images of sarcoid involving the long bones: [http://gateway.ut.ovid.com/gw1/ovidweb.cgi?QS=k%2bGrJwyZ6UwwoTy0sF7ph43XDxFRzFC9XoaGNQdXD8F6sV9zTil1QQ7vCAHdanR91vk2SJRt0d9IA1l10GRUK18PR%2bmHjP1bPs%2fQgR7zgcWGgKx7aQYNhimTvmRI_wZbmVv9Jej69G8jC Wilcox et al.: Bone sarcoidosis. Current Opinion in Rheumatology 2000, 12:321-330].

Large bone sarcoid lesions may be radiogaphically occult or seen as focal lytic lesions or sclerosis. On MR, the lesions may be indistinct or well-marginated and of varying sizes. The signal intensity characteristics are variable but the lesions typically have low intensity on T1WI, increased intensity on inversion-recovery, T2WI, and fat-saturated proton-density weighted images, and may enhance after contrast administration. Signal intensity is likely related to the activity of the disease process. There have been cases of resolution on follow-up studies with ghosts of the prior lesions having signal intensities consistent with fat or fibrosis. 

===Skull and Face===

Calvarial lesions may be expansile and can be evaluated best with CT. MR may be used to assess for associated soft tissue involvement. Facial bone involvement usually reflects the presence of granulomatous disease in adjacent structures.

*Radiographic images of sarcoid involving the petrous temporal bone: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6W9S-46DM038-B-1&amp;_cdi=6690&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_coverDate=07%2F31%2F2002&amp;_sk=999769995&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkWb&amp;_acct=C000029718&amp;_version=1&amp;_userid=582538&amp;md5=0651f86fc15f0882883288c1efcebff5&amp;ie=f.pdf Ng, Matthew and John K. Niparko: Osseous sarcoidosis presenting as a destructive petrous apex lesion. American Journal of Otolaryngology 2002, 23:241-245].


===Spine===

Vertebral sarcoidosis is rare and may have a lytic, mixed lytic and sclerotic, or rarely, a predominantly sclerotic appearance. Lesions tend to affect the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine with preservation of intervertebral disc spaces. Radiographic appearance may simulate osteomyelitis or tumor. Biopsy is often needed to establish a diagnosis.

==Treatment==

Osseous sarcoid responds poorly to corticosteroids and other drugs used in treating sarcoid. Corticosteroids decrease pain and soft tissue swelling but do not completely normalize bone abnormalities and increase the risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and avascular necrosis. Colchicine, indomethacin, and other NSAIDs may be used for symptomatic relief.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A Note on Writing Magic ==

To quote the &quot;other minister&quot;, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]: &quot;But for heaven's sake &amp;mdash; you're ''wizards!'' You can do ''magic!'' Surely you can sort out &amp;mdash; well &amp;mdash; ''anything!''&quot; Making characters omnipotent, able to do anything, sounds good, but ultimately makes the story boring. A fictional wizard who could do anything at all that he wished, ultimately would be a plot-destroying device; he would have the power to instantly get out of any predicament he is in, and readers would not be intrigued to see him wave his wand and remove all barriers yet again.

When writing fiction that involves magic of any sort, one must be extremely careful to plan and limit that magic so that barriers remain, so that the challenges faced by the hero are difficult for him to surmount. In order to captivate the reader, the hero must be seen to be stretching his abilities; the reader has to wonder how the hero is going to get out of the predicament he is in, so he can share the hero's joy at having figured it out, and his relief at escaping relatively unscathed.

It does not need to be said that the Harry Potter series shows signs of careful planning of the available magic. The need to hide the relatively small Wizarding population from the much larger Muggle world is mentioned early in the first book, and over the course of the series we learn about the measures needed to manage that concealment, and the reasons such measures are so harsh. The relative strengths of wizards and witches is very nicely managed, as is the growing strength of the characters, especially [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]. And it is of interest that Harry's most bitter battle is not against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], a wizard of great power who at least commands respect, but rather against a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|petty bureaucrat]] and her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|power-hungry boss]].

No writer is an island, at the very least a writer must have read enough of a genre to know that he wants to write in that genre. And influences do creep in, as writers adopt techniques that they appreciate. We note that in the treatment of magic, there are some similarities between this work and the ''Lord Darcy'' series by Randall Garrett. In particular, we note Garrett's mention of the difference between active and passive magic, covered in more detail in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]]; the distinction between Light and Dark magic; and the difference in types of magic, notably healing magic, covered in more detail in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]. No doubt there are other stories that similarly show reasonable limitations on magic, and it is equally possible that the seminal influence could have been some other work, but the similarities with the Garrett series do seem at least vaguely present to us.

== Spells ==

Words or phrases that cause a certain effect when using a wand or when said by a wizard. In the books, the terms Spell, Charm, Jinx, Hex, and Curse are all used; [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=24 the author explains the difference] as follows:
*''Spell'' is the generic term, used for all incantations.
*''Charms'' typically would affect the behaviour of an object but do not change its nature. Thus making a pineapple tap-dance across the desk is properly a Charm, because the object remains a pineapple; but turning a teapot into a turtle, as is done in Transfiguration, is not.
*''Jinxes'' carry a connotation of dark magic, though of a very minor sort. Jinxes, like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Rictusempra|Rictusempra]], irritate and amuse, rather than harm.
*''Hexes'' also carry the connotation of dark magic, again of a minor nature, but slightly darker than Jinxes. An example would be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrificus Totalus]].
*''Curses'' are spells that are quite firmly in the Dark Magic camp, and are purely harmful in effect.

A Stunning spell is more properly a charm, because the spelled object changes behaviour and not nature; but the name is kept because of the alliteration. These definitions are flexible; for instance the stunning spell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stupefy]] can be used either by light or dark wizards, in which case it might be seen as a charm or a hex.

=== A note on incantation pronunciation ===

It appears that there are three components to a spell: the incantation or spoken portion, the wand motion, and a mental component involving visualization of the desired effect. We learn in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' that the incantation does not need to be spoken, but can be subvocalized, and we also observe a few spells where one or two of the three components is not required. In those cases where an incantation is required, we note that it seems to be based on the Latin word for the desired effect; this, with other context, would suggest strongly that most incantations are to be pronounced with the Latin character sounds. In particular, the &quot;i&quot; is generally, though not always, pronounced as a long &quot;e&quot;, and the &quot;o&quot; is the long form of that vowel, while the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are generally the short forms of those vowels. Among the exceptions are &quot;Wingardium leviosa&quot; and &quot;Rictusempra&quot;, where the first &quot;i&quot; seems to be best pronounced as the short English &quot;i&quot;. &quot;U&quot; generally takes the long form when it is on its own, but the short form in the &quot;ium&quot; and &quot;us&quot; word endings.
