      <text xml:space="preserve">Biospheres, biomes and ecosystems 

The definition of an ecosystem is any area of nature that includes living organisms and non-living substances interacting to produce an exchange of materials between the living and non-living parts. A problem with the definition is that of a boundary, as the definition can be applied on any scale. For example, a pond with its interaction between the water, micro- organisms, invertebrates, fish and amphibians could be defined as an ecosystem. But if water birds that occasionally frequent the pond and feed on fish are included in this ecosystem, then the boundary of the ecosystem expands to include the living area of the water birds. Ecosystems can best be studied by observing the flows of energy matter through an ecosystem. The definition of the biosphere is the part of the earth in which life is permanently possible and which contains all living organisms. This includes the oceans, the surface of continents and the atmosphere. Animal and plant species are classified into communities that are adapted to a particular environment. The major biomes are, the aquatic biome, the desert biome, the forest biome, the grassland biome and the tundra biome. 

The Aquatic Biome 

Water covers ¾ of the Earth’s surface. A large number of animals and plants are adapted to living in water and it is thought that life began in water billions of years ago. The aquatic biome can be divided into salt water and fresh water.

Fresh water is essential for life on Earth. Fresh water has low salt concentrations. Fresh water environments include ponds, lakes, streams, rivers and wetlands.
Ponds and lakes are still water environment, unlike rivers and steams where water flows in a specific direction. These still water bodies can vary from a few metres in size in the case of ponds to thousands of kilometres in the case of lakes. Ponds and lakes may only contain water during the rainy season. In this case they are called seasonal. If they always contain water then they are called permanent. Ponds and lakes may have a small number of different plant and animal species as the ponds and lakes are often separated from each other by long distances and the plants and animals from one pond or lake cannot mix with the plants and animals of another pond lake.

In South Africa, there is only one natural lake. This is Lake Sibaya in Kwazulu Natal.

Ponds and lakes can be classified into zones according to the vertical layers of water.

Uppermost zone of the littoral zone, is the warmest and most productive of the zones as it receives the most sunlight, It is also a zone of high oxygen content. This zone is dominated by algae, macrophytes, snails, clams, insects, crustaceans, fishes and amphibians. Animals in this zone provide food for turtles, snakes &amp; water birds.

The middle zone is the limnetic zone. This zone is usually well lighted. This zone is usually dominated by plankton.

The last layer is the deepest layer and there is usually little light, less oxygen and the temperature is lower in this zone. This zone is dominated by animals who feed as predators or on waste sinking to the bottom.

These three clear layers do not occur in shallow lakes and ponds, as wind causes the layers to mix together. 

Streams and rivers start at headwaters. A headwater can be a spring, a region with melting snow or a lake. Water at this region is usually cleaner, clearer and colder. There are a greater number of different species in the middle regions of streams and rivers, which are wider and dominated macrophytes (water plants) and algae (microscopic water plants). The mouths of rivers are usually have murky water with a lower number of different species and lower productivity. These regions are dominated by carp and catfish who can tolerate lower oxygen levels.

Wetlands are areas of standing water that support aquatic plants. These include marshes, swamps and bogs. Plants called hydrophytes grow in wetlands and are adapted to the moist and humid conditions. These plants include pond-lilies, cattails, spruce Cyprus and Gum. These areas have a high number of different species, including amphibians, reptiles and birds. 

Salt water or marine regions covers ¾ of the Earth’s surface. The oceans provide a great service as marine plants and algae produce much of the Earth’s oxygen, while absorbing large amounts of harmful carbon dioxide. The evaporation of the seawater also provides rainwater for the land in a process called the hydrological cycle.



 

A simple representation of the hydrological cycle.

Oceans, like lakes are divided into separate zones. The deepest part of the ocean is called the abyssal zone. There is comparatively little known about the animals that live in this zone. The animals here are adapted to very cold water and the high pressure of the water. Because of the lack of sunlight in this zone, nutrients enter this zone from the shallower waters above. There is one exception however. This is the presence of hydrothermal vents in some parts of the ocean floor. This will be dealt with in more detail, later in this chapter.

The area of the ocean that is above the abyssal zone is called the benthic zone. Here less light penetrates and the water gets colder as the water gets deeper. This area is more productive then the abyssal zone since it is nutrient rich. Here you will find seaweed, fungi, sponges, sea anemones, worms, sea stars, fishes and many other animals. 

The pelagic zone is that area of ocean that is usually referred to as open ocean. Light can penetrate this zone, and microphytoplankton and seaweed at the surface are the primary producers of this zone. Many fish, as well as whales and dolphins inhabit this zone.

The intertidal zone is the zone where the ocean meets the land. Depending on the tide, this area is either covered or uncovered by water. Rocky parts of the intertidal zone are stratified, with less diverse and more hardy species inhabiting the highest areas of the intertidal zone where only the fullest tides reach. In areas of the zone that are submerged during high tide, there are more types of animals and plants such as algae, snails, crabs, sea stars and fish. The part of the rocky shore that is only exposed at the lowest tides many plants and animals are also found. There are not as much difference between zones on sandy shores. Here the sand is always moving and animals and plants struggle to establish themselves. Here animals such as clams, crustaceans, worms and shore birds are found. 

Coral Reefs

Coral reefs are found in warm shallow waters. They are found around islands and as barriers around continents. The organisms that make the coral reefs are called corals. Corals are tiny communities consisting of both algae and tiny animal cells, The corals obtain nutrients from the sun via photosynthesis as well as filtering plankton from the surrounding water. Coral reefs provide a refuge for a huge number of different animals and are therefore very important to conserve.

Estuaries

Estuaries are areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge with the ocean. Estuaries are known to be very productive and provide a relatively safe nursery for the young of many marine organisms. Plants such as algae, seaweeds, marsh grasses, and mangrove trees are found in estuaries. Many different types of animals are found in estuaries including worms, oysters, crabs, fish and waterfowl.

The desert biome

Deserts occur in areas of the planet where the annual rainfall is less than 50 cm. Animals and plants that live in the desert are highly adapted for the desert environment. Deserts cover approximately 1/5 of the Earth’s surface.

Hot and dry deserts

These deserts are usually very cold at night and hot in the day. Daylight temperatures remain hot throughout the year and get particularly hot during summer. In addition there is very little rainfall during winter. Rainfall occurs in short bursts during the year. In fact, there are some desert areas that receive no rainfall. The soil in these deserts is coarse, shallow, rocky or gravely with very little ground water. Plants that grow in deserts are particularly adapted to the conditions. These include ground hugging shrubs and short trees. The leaves of these plants tend to be short, thick and covered in a thick cuticle. The spines of cacti are actually modified leaves. Many desert plants only transpire at night so as to minimise water loss.

Desert animals include small mammals, certain insects, arachnids, reptiles and birds. Most of the desert animals stay inactive during the day and hunt or forage during the night.

Semiarid Desert

Semiarid deserts have summer daytime temperatures that seldom exceed 38° C. Night time temperatures are usually cool. The winter period in semiarid deserts is usually associated with a dry period, with even less than usual rainfall. The cool evenings allow both plants and animals to reduce water loss. Dew that accumulates on the land surface at night provides an important source of water for both plants and animals. The soil can range from sandy and fine-textured to loose rock fragments, gravel or sand. 


Plants in these semiarid desert areas often have many spines with the dual purpose of shading from the sun and for protection from predators. Many plants may also have a taste or smell that is unpleasant to predators.

Animals in semiarid deserts include small mammals such as various rodents, insects such as grasshoppers and ants, reptiles such as lizards and snakes and various birds. Many of these animals are adapted to feeding at night or staying in shady places such as burrows during the day.
 
Coastal Desert

These deserts occur in moderately cool to warm areas such as the Nearctic and Neotropical realm. A good example is the Atacama of Chile. 
The cool winters of coastal deserts are followed by moderately long, warm summers. The average summer temperature ranges from 13-24° C; winter temperatures are 5° C or below. The maximum annual temperature is about 35° C and the minimum is about -4° C. In Chile, the temperature ranges from -2 to 5° C in July and 21-25° C in January. 

The average rainfall measures 8-13 cm in many areas. The maximum annual precipitation over a long period of years has been 37 cm with a minimum of 5 cm. 

The soil is fine-textured with a moderate salt content. It is fairly porous with good drainage. Some plants have extensive root systems close to the surface where they can take advantage of any rain showers. All of the plants with thick and fleshy leaves or stems can take in large quantities of water when it is available and store it for future use. In some plants, the surfaces are corrugated with longitudinal ridges and grooves. When water is available, the stem swells so that the grooves are shallow and the ridges far apart. As the water is used, the stem shrinks so that the grooves are deep and ridges close together. The plants living in this type of desert include the salt bush, buckwheat bush, black bush, rice grass, little leaf horsebrush, black sage, and chrysothamnus. 

Some animals have specialized adaptations for dealing with the desert heat and lack of water. Some toads seal themselves in burrows with gelatinous secretions and remain inactive for eight or nine months until a heavy rain occurs. Amphibians that pass through larval stages have accelerated life cycles, which improves their chances of reaching maturity before the waters evaporate. Some insects lay eggs that remain dormant until the environmental conditions are suitable for hatching. The fairy shrimps also lay dormant eggs. Other animals include: insects, mammals (coyote and badger), amphibians (toads), birds (great horned owl, golden eagle and the bald eagle), and reptiles (lizards and snakes). 


Cold Desert
These deserts are characterized by cold winters with snowfall and high overall rainfall throughout the winter and occasionally over the summer. They occur in the Antarctic, Greenland and the Nearctic realm. They have short, moist, and moderately warm summers with fairly long, cold winters. The mean winter temperature is between -2 to 4° C and the mean summer temperature is between 21-26° C. 
The winters receive quite a bit of snow. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15-26 cm. Annual precipitation has reached a maximum of 46 cm and a minimum of 9 cm. The heaviest rainfall of the spring is usually in April or May. In some areas, rainfall can be heavy in autumn. The soil is heavy, silty, and salty. It contains alluvial fans where soil is relatively porous and drainage is good so that most of the salt has been leached out. 

The plants are widely scattered. In areas of shad-scale, about 10 percent of the ground is covered, but in some areas of sagebush it approaches 85 percent. Plant heights vary between 15 cm and 122 cm. The main plants are deciduous, most having spiny leaves. Widely distributed animals are jack rabbits, kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice, pocket mice, grasshopper mice, and antelope ground squirrels. In areas like Utah, population density of these animals can range from 14-41 individuals per hectare. All except the jack rabbits are burrowers. The burrowing habit also applies to carnivores like the badger, kit fox, and coyote. Several lizards do some burrowing and moving of soil. Deer are found only in the winter.

Humans are separated from other animals in their extensive use of materials to make things. All these materials are derived from Earth. Our bodies use materials in the process of metabolism to facilitate growth and provide energy. Outside of our bodies, we use renewable and non-renewable resources. More abstract resources that we use but do not alter are those such as scenery, wildlife, swimming in dams etc. In every ecological system there are natural limits to the total amount of living matter that can be supported
2.1. Biotic and abiotic resources
Water: Occurs in a gas, solid and liquid phase. Usually the most useful in the liquid phase and low in dissolved salts (i.e. fresh water). 97% of all the water on Earth is salt water. 3 % of water is fresh water and ¾ of this is locked up in glaciers and ice caps. ¼ is ground and surface water. Surface water is continually moving through the hydrological cycle.
Find a simple representation of the hydrological cycle. 

The cycle can be regarded as a series of storage tanks, interconnected by the transfer process of evaporation, moisture transport, condensation, precipitation and runoff. Critical water is rainfall on land, as rainfall into the sea is not useful. The distribution of rainfall on land is uneven.
Look for diagram of SA’s rainfall patterns.

Some of the rainfall on land is evaporated, some runs into the oceans, some enters the groundwater system.

1.1	Ecosphere and Biosphere.

There terms are used as the idea of ‘Nature’ is very different meaning between an ecologist and the ‘man on the street’.

Biosphere: that part of the Earth in which life is permanently possible and which contains all living organisms.

Abiotic factors: Climate, Physico-chemical composition of the environment etc. Biotic factors- Paratisism, predation, food supple etc.

Can be dependant or independent of population density.

Primary periodic factors: temperature and amount of light.
Secondary periodic factors: Cyclic variations derived from those primary factors.
(e.g. Humidity, plant food supply etc.).
Aperiodic factors: Drought, volcanoes etc.

Fundamental ecological variables:

Matter, Energy, Space, Time and Diversity.

1.Matter.

Law of tolerance – there exists a range of concentrations, called the interval of tolerances, in which all physiological processes involving that element can take place normally. E.g. Nitrates in soil.

The law of conservation of matter: In natura there is an almost perfect and permanent recycling of matter, alternating between organic and inorganic forms, which is brought about by the three categories into which living organisms can be assigned: 1. The primary photosynthetic producers, 2. The animal consumers, 3. The animal decomposers.

2. Energy: 
All living systems, are energy converters more than anything else. The utilisation and conversion of energy occur with more efficiency then even the most perfect human machines. Energy is essential for vital processes at every level: from elementary cellular mechanisms to that of the entire biosphere.

First law: The principle of conservation of energy. Energy can be neither created or destroyed, but only changed from one form to another.

The second law: 

No process involving a transformation of energy can take place without a partial degradation of the energy, which passes from a concentrated, ordered form to one that is dilute and unusable (in other words, to heat at a low temperature).

Third law: 

The unicyclic flow of energy.
Can only pass once through any given trophic level of the food chain – degraded as ir progresses, so that it is gradually dispersed and lost to the surroundings in a non- usable form (entropy). The energy upon which all ecological systems function has one external source: the sun (actually no).

A law of optimisation in the use of energy: all species that occupy a particular ecological niche use the available energy more efficiently than other species having similar requirements but less well adapted to the environmental conditions approp to that Niche. Whole ecosystems tend to evolve towards a structure consisting of communities that use the available energy most efficiently.

Lindemann’s Law: Only a fraction of the energy reaching a given trophic level in a community is transmitted to a higher trophic level.
Smaller animals generally use more energy (survace area to volume ratio).

Space:

Total mass of living organisms which can populate an ecosystem depends directly on the space available.

1.	Available area determines the intensity of the competition within and between species. The density of populations can be a limiting factor by being either too high or too low. The distribution of individuals in each species over the available space also plays a fundamental role (random, clumped or uniform). Plant eating forest insects thrive in a homo-geneous distribution of their host species rather than discontinuous afforisitation. Crop monocultures offer opportunities for some pest species to thrive.
2.	Time. Concerned in the evolution of every ecological system towards a state of maturity (characterised by the optimum accumulation of biomass and therefore of energy – per unit surface area). During the annual cycle, the length of time during which ecological factors have tolerable values determines the types of community capable of occupying and given environment. Get diagram of succession.
Diversity:

Characterises a whole community of living organisms. ‘The richness of a population’ The greater the number of species in a given community, the greater is the degree of saturation of potential niches, and thus the greater is the structural complexity of the food web. Redundancy. – if one species is compromised. Older systems are more diverse.

Ecological principles governing the use of natural resources.

Definition of a resource.

A form of energy and/or matter which is essential for the functioning of organisms, populations and ecosystems. In the case of humans: a resource is any form of energy or matter essential for the fulfilment of physiological, socio-economical and cultural needs, both at the individual level and that of the community. Human/ecosystem use of natural resources involves a permanent transformation of matter. This transformation is the result of a continuous flow and consumption and energy (from sun for biosphere or fossil feuls in regards technological civilization).
A resource may consist of one of the various forms of primary energy persent in the ecosphere. In addition, however, it may be defined as anything needed by a living organism such that an increase in its availability leads to an increase in energy flow through the organism, and thus a greater rate of energy conversion.

Principles concerning energy.

a.	Production of biomass in a given ecosystem governed by solar radiation.
b.	Energy is transformed in food webs from one form to another but is neither created nor destroyed. Both in primary producers and in animal consumers, part of the energy available is stored in the biomass, with the remainder being used up in metabolic processes.
Plants: only a fraction of the incident solar radiation is converted to biochemical energy though photosynthesis. A large proportion of biochemical energy is used for respiration while rest as biomass. In animals, the energy flow undergoes a greater number of ‘partitions’ than it does in plants. In addition to the energy needed for basal metabolism, and for growth and reproduction, there is a certain amount required for locomotion, in homeostasis, the consumption needed to maintain a constant internal temperature. Some food is never assimilated (faeces). Further consumption  of energy into the shape of other excreta and of radiated heat, associated with metabolic processes occurring at all levels or organic activity. The efficiency of energy conversion in animal biomass is low and represents a small percentage of energy consumed. All organisms make optimal use of energy by adopting a energy strategy. One category devotes a high proportion of energy intake to reproduction e.g. field mouse approx ½ energy to gestation.

Large long lived organisms store the majority of the available energy in the growth and reproduction of the adult biomass, only a small fraction going to the offspring, e.g. in the blue whale: 97 % of the energy ends up in the biomass of the adult while 3 %T of the energy ends up in the biomass of the child.

a.                          b                         c                  d
Solar radiation à Lucerne à      Calf à       Child.
                             0,24 % * a        8% * b        0.7% *c

Therefore limit to length of food chains.

In terrestrial environments, the longest chains are generally of type:

Plant – herbivore –carnivore –top carnivore.

And the most common of all:

Grass – cattle –humans.

In an aquatic environment, we can have:

Phytoplankton ---zooplankton ---microphagus fish ---predator fish –superpredator fish.

Or:

Phytoplanton –zooplankton—anchovy—mackerel—tuna—humans.

Overall energy efficiency of a food chain is a greater the shorter it is.

Phytoplankton –zooplankton—blue whale.

NB Humans could achieve greater use of energy by being vegetarians.


Principles concerning matter:

a.	In the light of human needs, no natural resource can be said to exist in unlimited quantities, whether it be mineral or biological. The availability of a resource is restricted by various abiotic and /or biotic factors. Such factors as the spatial distribution of a mineral element or biological molecule (e.g. water), the difficulties of transference from the lithosphere or from the atmosphere and many others, may combine in such a way that many chemical elements and mineral molecules which are abundant on the Earth’s surface become limiting factors for primary and secondary production because of their unavailability.
No proportional relation exists between total biomass and productivity. Environments like tropical rain forests or animal species like whales do not exhibit a distinctively greater primary or secondary productivity then more modest ecosystems or species. Ignorance of this led to the almost extinction of certain whale species for example/

b.	Both the scarcity of a mineral element and its excess through natural or human pollution, can act as factors limiting the take up of other natural resources.
c.	‘Law of the optimum’ – An increase in the availability of a nutrient, does not produce an unlimited increase in productivity. 
Get graph of ‘Law of diminishing yield’
Two types:
A.	Stimulating type.
B.	B. Non-stimulating type susceptible to law of diminishing yield.


Principles concerning space:

a.	The space available to any organism or person is limited as can’t use all space in distribution as not all suitable.
b.	The area available for ensuring that each individual is fed decreases more rapidly than the population density, as the area may be assigned to movement, nesting etc. Esp relevant for humans: roads, housing etc.

Principles governing diversity.

a.	The greater the stability of ecological factors, the greater the diversity of the ecosystem. Human activity in a natural ecosystem, because it is unforeseeable and always acyclic, inevitably has the affect of decreasing the species diversity.
b.	Tine on species diversity: Succession. The diversity of an ecosystem increases as a function of time.
c.	The biomass /productivity ratio of an ecosystem is proportional to its diversity.

H = K*B/P.

Where H is diversity, B – Biomass P is productivity and K is a constant. P = flow of energy per unit time . It takes a longer time for energy to flow in long food chains and hense linked to diversity.

d.	The ratio of B/P grows as a linear function of diversity and/or time up to an asymptotic limiting value. The B/P ratio is low for a field of field of cereal and max in a primitive tropical forest.
e.	The most diversified ecosystems are the most stable. There will be a larger number of links in the food web and more organisms with redundant functions.
f.	NB Grasslands and stability (check thesis) and redundancy lookup.
Diversified ecosystems exploit less diversified ecosystems. Forest savanna example: Forest animals mostly seek their food in neighbouring open ground (savanna) thereby preventing savanna from evolving to the more diversified stage.

Principled concerning populations.

The law of population growth in the absence of limiting factors: Rate of growth of population with time is abserved to remain constant but the speed of growth increases exponentially with time.

The law of population growth with limiting factors: The max speed of growth is attained when the size of the population is half the limiting capacity of the environment.

Stability of populations.

In the stable environment subject only to small fluctuations in its ecological factors, the populations themselves are stable. High diversity carries with it very low levels of wastage because of the great variety o niches occupied by the species forming the community. Such high efficiency in the utilisation of energy in mature and highly diversified ecosystems leaves no room for wastage of resources and there is therefore no surplus wich would permit great fluctuations in species populations. Only in species beloning to ecosystems with very simple food chains (lookup lemmings and locust plagues). That sudden explosions of population are experienced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">2.3. Energy flow within the environment

Energy on earth originates from the sun. What about undersea thermal vents? Energy on Earth allows life to exist. The sun facilitates the movements of air and water in the atmosphere. The sun also facilitated the formation of non-renewable resources such as oil and coal. Green plants at most capture 1/20 of the suns energy that reaches Earth. Plants use most of that energy for metabolisms and therefore only 1 % of energy is converted to plant tissue.

Energy flow  can be depicted in a food chain.

Plant - herbivores - carnivores
Decomposer Organisms

Energy has allowed man to become more industrialised and even allowed man to travel to the moon!

Because of energy loss, biomass normally diminishes through the stages of secondary and tertiary production.


:top carnivores
::carnivores
:::herbivores
::::primary producers


The biggest animals tend to be on top of the pyramid. The world’s biggest land and sea animals, i.e. the elephant and Blue Whale have decided to cut out the middle man, and instead of being top carnivores, feed directly on plants.

Look up an interesting article on the net.

The term power is used for energy obtained for urban and industrial purposes, measured by the rate of flow of useful energy that can be made to work. Some measures of power are the kilojoule (KJ), the megajoule (MJ) and the kilowatt (KW).

Look up article on oil demand. 

Wold consumption of energy has been doubling every 14 years. The development of new technology may rapidly change energy consumption.

Types of energy sources:

# Diversion of current energy flows:
##Solar flux (photosynthesis)
##Falling water &amp; wind
## geothermal energy
## tidal energy
# release of stored energy
##fossil fuels – oil, coal, gas. All represent stored energy from photosynthesis from the geological past and which yield energy upon combustion.
##Nuclear energy. Liberates energy contained in the nucleus of the atom.

The advancement of societies followed the access and use of energy:

#Hunter – gatherer societies. Used solar energy via food and fuel wood.
#Agricultural societies. Used solar energy and the labour of beasts  as well as wind and water power. The surplus food supported civilization and economy.
#Advanced industrial societies. ¼ used for transport, 1/5 in houses, 12 % in offices, hospitals and schools, 42 % in the industrial sector.

Different forms of energy supply:

Coal: This is the most secure and assured energy source. Causes large environmental pollution but may be utilized more as oil becomes more scarce.

Oil: Estimated to have a short remaining lifespan
Oil has more uses then just a form of fuel. Once supply has passed its peak, oil may become too important to use as a fuel.
It is estimated that the supply of oil will begin to run out by 2030.

Natural Gas: linked to petroleum.

Fossil fuels are not likely to run out soon. By 2030 most oil and gas resources will be exhausted and much coal reserved will have been depleted.

Nuclear power: This is generated when the nucleus of Uranium 235 is bombarded with neutrons – the uranium breaks into two fragments and a release of energy occurs.
1 kg of Uranium 235 can release the equivalent energy to 2500 kg of coal.


Hydropower: This is an ancient form of power generation. Basically the power that is generated is a function of volume and drop. The first large scale power generation was done at the Niagra falls. The impoundments of dams cause evaporation and silting.

Geothermal energy:

The thermal gradient is 25 degrees per KM but is steeper in some places, where there is tectonic instability. Often geothermal energy is in the form of water or steam. Heat is used to either generate electricity, or for other uses, e.g. heating a hotel in Paris and greenhouses and hotels in Iceland, for spas and crocodile farms in Japan. Italy, the USA have electrical power plants using this source.


Windpower: This has been in use since the 12’th century. The major problem is that wind speeds are so variable. Storage is important in this case. Wind could be used to hydrolize water to provide hydrogen as a fuel. A large land area is needed for wind power, 4 – 5 times that of direct solar collection. This form of energy is likely to be useful when coupled with other technology. This is the largest potential energy source.

Tidal power.
Potentially using trapped water at high tide and allowing water to ebb through turbines, thereby generating electricity.
Lookup this.

Wave power.
Few attempts and low potential for new energy source.


Biomass:
Generating power from organic waste i.e. straw, refuse, sewerage, pulp waste. Waste is fermented to give off methane. There are many such installations in use.

Solar energy:

Constant and inexaustable. The total energy falling on 100 km2 of tropics would cover all consumption. Solar energy is very diffuse, therefore needs to be converted to more palable forms of energy such as electricity or hydrogen. A common use of solar power is for the heating of water or space. Solar thermal electrical conversion uses an optical concentrator which focuses on an absorber which then transmits the heat to an electrical generating plant. Photovoltaic conversion turns radiation directly into DC current via a silicon cell. Producing hydrogen using this method may be a possibility.
Solar power would be ideal for decentralised, low output use such as remote rural areas, small localised industries, clinics, schools and homes.

Stretching the resources.

This could be done by energy conservation i.e. using less energy and better use of energy. For instance, the heat generated by powerstations could be used to heat homes, insulation in homes, public transport.


All the energy transferred undergoes a change of form that will tend to heat energy.

Deep sea bed usually regarded as unproductive. However volcanically active areas of the sea bed heat sea water in crack systems – releasing hot water loaded with metals and dissolved sulfide. These areas are associated with fantastic diversity of animals – large limpits, clams, tube worms and mussels. Get pic. How does such a productive ecosystem occur amidst such poverty? Certain bacteria derive energy from oxidation of sulfide, providing a food source for animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oil extractions and gas flumes kill birds. Burning of fossil fuels emits C02 into the environment.
Fossil fuels: Most air pollution is caused by the burning of fossil fuels for combustion energy. The three chemicals that most pollute the air are carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. Carbon monoxide is mainly produced by petrol/diesel vehicles. The percentage of carbon monoxide by car pollution is small compared to pollution due to natural causes. Carbon monoxide is seen as a poison to humans rather than bad for the ecosystem. Sulphur dioxide is much more toxic and originates from the combustion of coal and fuel oils, at sulphuric acid plants, and in the processing of metal ores containing sulphur. It is converted to a form of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere which is precipitated onto the Earth and is highly toxic to plants and causes corrosion to various manmade materials. This ‘Acid Rain’ is common in industrialised areas and at high levels can cause inflammation of the respiratory tracts of animals and people. Hydrogen Sulphide are sometimes by-products of petroleum processing, coking and paper making. Hydrogen sulphide may also be produced by anaerobic bacteria in sewerage. This pollutant is viewed more as a nuisance rather than a serious environmental pollutant.

Pollution by particulate matter: produced by industrial processes, auto exhausts, bare soil and fires. Also dust accumulates in cities and areas suffering from erosion due to overgrazing. Soot from combustion processes. This particulate matter suspended in the atmosphere causes a lowering of visibility, soiling of paintwork, corrosion of manmade materials. Many costs accrued to public health because of the aggravation of brachial illness (look up effects to townships) . The future effects of particulate matter in the atmosphere may cause some global cooling although some global warming is also possible.

Smog: Nitrous oxides are emitted into the atmosphere through the combustion of coal, oil or natural gas in power plants and pollutants from internal combustion engines. Incomplete combustion of the auto – engine is by a factor of 6 the most aggravation polluter. Nitrogen dioxide is a respiratory irritant and also absorbs sunlight, especially in the blue wavelengths, and so appears as a yellow-brown gas. It absorbs sunlight and through a chemical reaction produces ozone, formaldehyde and nitrous oxide. The high ozone levels in some cities cause respiratory problems amongst some people. Smog has also affected crops and  forests. Smog also damages infrastructure.

Because of the dynamic nature of the atmosphere, pollutants are often transported far from their source. Most sulphur compounds end up in the ocean with no consequences. Some substances seem to pose more of a threat however. One of the more worrying effects is the more efficient transmission of solar radiation, leading to fears of global warming and the increase of skin cancer from UV radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons are one such substance that is released into the atmosphere due to refrigerator cooling systems and aerosol propellants. (Show pic of CFC free cans!) This substance breaks down very slowly. The production of CFCs has been declining in recent years, and is thought to be less of a problem then carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxides produced in the atmosphere from aircraft also seem not to pose a significant threat compared to those of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide concentrations have been increasing in the atmosphere since the lat 19th century. It is estimated that 50 – 60 % of carbon dioxide lands up in the sea and the rest goes into terrestrial ecosystems via photosynthesis. The levels of carbon dioxide can be maintained or reduced by protecting and planting forests. Carbon dioxide acts to let in solar radiation but reducing the outward movement of solar radiation, causing a global warming effect. Even slight shifts in temperature can have wide ranging consequences in shifting the boundaries of deserts and suitable cultivation areas. The melting of polar ice caps could also bring about a rise in the sea level.

Something that can be classified as land, air and water pollution: Pesticides:
Used to eliminate man’s competitors and also to kill viruses and bacteria that are detrimental to our health. Ideally toxins used as pesticides should break down into harmless substances after they have done their job. In reality though, some substances persist in the environment in a toxic form. Through natural selection, some pest organisms and pathogenic life forms are becoming resistant to pesticides/antibiotics.
For example, the malaria carrying mosquito Anopheles is showing some immunity to 
DDT. A bacteria strain, known as Staphylycoccus, is often unaffected by penicillin.
Some pesticides accumulate in the environment, with concentrations becoming more 
concentrated in organisms higher up on the food chain (example of whales etc.). 
Chemicals such as copper sulphate have been used for hundreds of years as a pesticide. Sodium chlorate is a well-known weed killer. Modern pesticides are more often complex organic molecules. The most widespread of pesticides are those of the organochlorine group. DDT belongs to this group and was first used in a widespread fashion after the second world war. DDT is highly toxic to most species of insects, but fresh water fish are also vulnerable. All pesticides in this group are long live(10-15 years) and persist in food chains, causing sub-lethal and lethal effects at various
- trophic levels. (Example of DDT being at a universal concentration in the environment.). DDT appears to be distributed across the whole world, even in Antarctica. DDT appears to make the egg shells of some birds too thin and the eggs break. Low dosesof DDT affect the behavior and reproduction of fish and amphibians. Although DDT is the most well known of the organochlorine pestices, there are more such as BHC, dieldrin, adlrin, endosulphan and heptachlor which are as toxic. Although most of these have been banned in many countries, substitutes have been developed that are more specific and are less persistant. Interestingly, most people in the USA are not fit for human consumption as they have a too high concentration of DDT.

Noise pollution: relevance for chapter 2. Air, water. Noise levels in many urban industriased areas known to be bad for peoples health. 

Warefar: Chapter 2: Air and land and water. Warfare is usually about resources and pre-empts rapid use of these resources. Iraq war and burning of oil wells. Vietnam and destruction of forests. The transmission of disease when in North America blankets infected with smallpox were sent as gifts to the Indians. Zimbabwe, civil war and shooting of wild animals. Vietnam and bombing of rural areas – destroyed trees and crops , made soil more arid and killed wildlife and some erosion. Biocides were used in large scale in Vietnam in order to deny cover and sustenance. About 10 percent of South Vietnam was sprayed one or more times. Forest is taking a long time to re-establish and hampered by high water table. At least 3 sensitive species were affected and malerial mosquitos thrived.

Nuclear explosion will cause immense damage and contamination of ecosystems. The initial explosion will destroy much of an ecosystem, but also miles around the site there will be large amounts of radiation. This radiation will create malformations and mutations in animals due to mutations of genes, which produce important proteins. These malformations could range from impotence to life-threatening scaring. Such consequences can destroy entire ecosystems within months if not days. 

Conclusion to chapter 2: Pollution is causing ecosystems to become dominated by generalist species- forest – hardy shrubs and weeds, sensitive phytoplankton to sewage plant algae , diversity In birds, plants and fish to much lower diversity. Dominated by hardy species. From stable populations to instable populations of pest species – certain insects and rodents. Ecosystems that require constant tinkering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Petroleum installations produce some lethal effluent problems. Open cast mines also cause acidification of water (look up some SA examples). Open pit mining causes eutrophication of streams from top soil nutrient dumping.

Contamination by oil:

Crude oil spills are most serious pollution source, The flammability of oil, its toxicity to plants and animals and the aesthetic effects of oil make it a serious polluting agent. In the marine environment, there are two main sources of contamination. One is the chronic effects of losses from refining, shipments, tanker cleaning and other accidental spills. The second source are the acute incidents where a large amount of oil is lost during an accident. Oil can kill organisms directly through coating and asphixiation, and kill be poisening via contact or ingestion. Water –soluble toxic compounds can be lethal to fish and invertebrates and result also in the destruction of the sensitive eggs and larval forms of fish. Disruption of the body insulation of birds. Oil may have an effect on food chains, if one major prey or predator species is effected. Aquatic areas affected by chronic oil spillage may have a lowered species biodiversity and fluctuations in oxygen concentration. Oil may inhibit photosynthesis by phytoplankton. Polar regions are most at danger from oil spills, as the low temperature slows down the breakdown of oil and polar aquatic organisms tend to have long life cycles. Coral reefs are also in grave danger from oil spills as they recover slowly and affected coral reef may be eroded away. Many cleanup techniques are aimed at cleaning up the intertidal zone for the benefit of tourism but to the detriment of other parts of the ecosystem. Emulsifiers and chalk make oil contamination a danger for the benthos and open ocean and scraping of beaches causes much biological damage.

PCB’s . These are a group of organic substances in paint, inks and cabonless copy paper. These substances are long lasting and soluble in fats. It has been found at high trophic levels in food chains and effect the metabolism and waterproofing of sea birds. People where effected in Japan with high levels of PCB’s causing skin ailments.

Eutrophication

The introduction of large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus into surface fresh waters is a major cause of eutropication. In un-impacted ecosystems phosphorus is scarce and is a limiting factor to population growth of species within an ecosystem.
Large inputs of phosphorus into an aquatic ecosystem may cause a aquatic macrophyte bloom, after which nitrogen may become the limiting factor. After nutrients in the water are depleted, these macrophytes start dying and decaying, causing anaerobic conditions within the aquatic ecosystem. This process has resulted in changes in the fauna of impacted ecosytems, generally in lower biodiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creation of derelict land.

This is land damaged by industrial or other development so that the land is incapable of beneficial use without treatment. Mining is the main cause of derelict land. Industrial processes such as smelting also cause derelict land. Derelict land may contribute to dust, soil erosion and the subsequent siltation of rivers. Treatment of derelict land is typically expensive.

Organic wastes.

Many organic wastes may result in the exposure to the environment to a certain element that is usually a limiting substance that is  biologically important to certain species. For example, sewage which causes outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and dysentery. Treatment of sewage water should ideally kill the agents of the mentioned ailments. The level of sewage contamination is usually indicated by the concentration of Eshcherichia coli, which is a harmless bacteria but a good indication of sewage contamination.

Detergents

More phosphorus is added from ‘hard’ synthetic detergents whose foaming reduces photosynthesis and inhibits the oxygenation of water.

Agricultural wastes.

Fertilisers are applied in large amounts to crops in modern times, releasing large concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment. Causing the eutrophication of fresh waters. Nitrates entering the ground water may also metabolic disorders in domestic animals and children if used for drinking. Domestic livestock produce a lot of waste including sewage waste, much more in fact then their human owners.

Lead. 

The industrial production of lead increased in the 1940’s when lead was first used as an additive in petrol. Most lead produced is now used in this way (modern times?).
Lead released into the atmosphere has a residue time of about a month before falling out. The concentration of lead is highest near highways and smelters, but the atmospheric form ensured a wide distribution. It has been shown that there is an accumulation of lead in the Greenland ice cap. Lead poisening has been implicated in causing mental imparement in humans.

Mercury

Mercury is used in the production of chloride and caustic soda, and as a fungicide. There are two pathways in which mercury and contaminate the environment. The first is the contamination of food, mostly grain, which can cause the death of animals and man. The contamination of water with mercury causes the uptake of mercury in fish.

Cadmium




Waste heat- relecvance to chapter 2 section 3: commonly by power generating plants – e.g. waste heat in Lake Antario (Canada) – hot water can cause changes in biota. A body of water at 30 degrees is essentially a biological desert and many game fish require temperatures of &lt; 10 degrees for successful reproduction. A temperature rise of 10 degrees will double the rate of many chemical reactions and so the decay of organic matter, and the solution rate of salts are all elevated by heating. The metabolic rate of animals is increased and so they require more oxygen which, however, is lower in concentration and the require higher temperatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Minerals – ores like iron, aluminium and copper. Catalysts and harders – sand gravel cement, clay salt sulphur and diamonds – all non-renewable but mostly available for re-use. Distribution is uneven.

The US citizin is responsible for the use of 7.25 kg of lead, 3.55 tons of stone, sand and gravel, 227 kg of cement, 91 kg of clay, and 91 kg of salt. Luckily, not many nations consume as much. The rate of consumption of more minerals since 1950 then in the previous recoded history of the world. Due to technological advances, some believe there will be no major shortages in mineral supply, e.g. atomic power will provide the energy to extract minerals from presently unviable sources such as the sea. This point of view has been attacked. Unless technology develop to utilize the following abundant supplies: iron, aluminium, magnesium, silicates, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sunlight, to provide all our mineral needs.


71% of Earth’s surface. The salinity of the sea has been stable for the last 2000 million years. Organisms in the sea play an important role in removing minerals from the liquid state to solid state. Mineral resources: Those dissolved in the water, thos deposited in the sea bed. The utility of dissolved elements is proportional to the concentration in the water and the relative cost of mining the mineral on terrestrial sources. NaCl, Mg and bromine are at present the only minerals in sea water that exceed 1 part per million. Sediments and sedimentary rocks on the continental shelves are sources of certain materials such as petroleum and natural gas. Manganese nodules in sediment. They occur as a layer with a mean depth of 4000 – 5000 m. There are reports of large deposits of sulphide ores of zinc, copper and iron on the sea floor. A small proportion of the worlds wealth by mining comes from the sea but this is likely to increase.

Biological resources: There are limiting factors on the biological productivity of the sea. The euphotic zone in which photosynthesis can occur is only about 60mm??cm?? deep, primary producers are scattered very thinly otherwise they would shade each other, therefore are self limiting. CO2 also scarse in sea water and depends on mixingdynamics. Plankton are generally unable to control their regional movements and considerable patchiness in their presence and productivity. Food shains generally simple and short lived. As animals grow, their diets change so that food chains are continually forming and disappearing. Detritus and bacteria are important food sources in shallow water and probably have a important role in deeper water since there are 10 grams of dead and 100g of dissolved carbon for every gram of living carbon in the water column, and the dead organic carbon can only be made available again via bacterial activity. Open oceans are the least productive and can be considered biological desserts because of the small size of autotrophic zone in relation to the heterotrphic zome in which the cycling of nutrients takes place. The distribution of productivity suggests that nutrients may be a limiting factor. Coastal zones are productive because of sources of nutrients. There are also upwelling zones (West coast etc.). Tidal flats and estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. The standing crop is always relatively low because of the high turnover (i.e. short life spans). It is not viable to harvest phytoplankton or zooplanton (taste, processing, low density, silicated shells). Third trophic level yields many more desirable species e.g. flounders, haddock, cod, herring, sardines and certain whales and further along the food chain, tuna, salmon, swordfish, seals and certain whales. There are also detritus feeders I.e. sole and crustacea. (up to date harvesting estimates and SA example?). Asian countries most consume sea food. The extension fo fisheries could involve : the exploitation of untapped spacies, better capture techniques, extending operation into unexploited areas. The fertilisation of low nutrient areas may in the future be employed to increase productivity (lookup?). Krill may become a viable food source as most whale populations have been decimated.

Oysters and mussels in Hong Kong and Philippines and Japan, are vulnerable to contamination. True aquaculture involves genetic manipulation and the chosen species by keeping them captive throughout their breeding cycle. This is very difficult and requires unpolluted sea water and a suitable coastal site and waste heat, needs much skill.

Over exploitation of biological resources.

The population must not be overcropped to the point that its reproduction no longer provides sufficient individuals to constitute a resource. Requires the rational management of the resource. Serious declines have occurred in the past: Asian and Californian sardine, North West pacific salmon, Yellow fin tuna are presently taking strain. Interim regulatory measures are sometimes applied to such species, regulating catch and net size, but these measures are difficult to enforce and therefore certain species have been overfished. It may  not be possible for an overfished species to regain its place in energy pathways of the ecosystem. Sea mammals have been exploited: Japan and porpoises. Certain seals. Whaling: most prolific example of over-exploitation. Japan and the USSR (former) still killing whales. 

Pullution: Sea had had some deliberate and accidental spills and continues to be used as a garbage bin: radio isotopes and industrialised effluents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darwin begins this chapter by explaining Wallace's views on man's evolution, i.e, that with the development of human intellect allowing him to make tools and shelters against a variety of climates, man would not have been as exposed to natural selection except as it related to his intellect. The more intelligent and creative people were more likely to survive.

Darwin restates the point that the desire for the praise of peers led to habitual social behavior. This can be seen in animals like dogs as well as &quot;savages&quot; and probably helped to naturally select those who worked with others of their species. He also touches on the question of the beginning of civilization and why some cultures progress and others don't. 

Under &quot;Natural Selection and Civilized Nations&quot; Darwin points out that civilization has led to activities that enable the weaker members of society to survive and multiply while war carries off the fittest. He also discusses the relative merit of primogeniture and inheriting wealth.

In the subsection on &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; Darwin states that the more intelligent will have a greater effect on society through their works as well as their children. He quotes statistics on the mortality rates of married and unmarried men and contradictory evidence on the effect of moral behavior on population growth. He also warns that natural checks to population increase among the morally inferior will not always keep them from overwhelming and reversing the progress of a society.

Looking at ancient Greece or sixteenth century Spain, he wonders what had stopped those cultures from taking over Europe. The United States appears to Darwin as a very good example of natural selection. At the same time Darwin acknowledges that progress comes from education of the young and &quot;a higher standard of excellence...embodied in the laws, customs and traditions of [a] nation...&quot; This in turn comes from a desire for approval which is a social instinct. 

Finally Darwin holds that all &quot;civilized&quot; societies arose from &quot;barbarous&quot; ones. As examples he points to ways of writing, superstitions and trials by combat which have persisted through the ages.

Is this supposed to be a Wikibook or a Wikiproject?

* If it's a book, then it should not be labelled a Wikiproject in [[Template:New]], nor on the page [[World Records]].
* If it's a project, then it should not be listed in [[Template:New]], but rather on [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]]; it should include only 'records' relating to the Wikibooks site, and should live in the 'Wikibooks' namespace.

Also note that additions to [[Template:New]] should be at the top of the list, as specified in the text of that page. I also recommend using the '/' rather than the ':' delimiter for page naming.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sb2k4. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sb2k4~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

__NOTOC__
'''Flammkuchen''' or '''''Tarte flambée''''' is a well-known Alsacian speciality.  It is like pizza in that a thin crust of dough is baked in a very hot oven, but its topping is primarily crème fraîche, onions, and bacon.  Like many traditional regional dishes there are innumerable ways of preparing it.  Here is one example.

==Ingredients==
===Starter for the dough===
* ¼ cup flour
* ¼ cup moderately hot water, about 110 degrees F (45 deg C)
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 package yeast

Some recipes, like the one used by restaurants in Strasbourg, do not use yeast in the dough.

===Dough===
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup beer (home brew)
* 6 tablespoons (¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons) milk

===Topping===
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 1 medium onion (3 ounces) (85 g), finely chopped
* 1 cup crème fraîche, commercial or home made (see note)
* ½ teaspoon salt 
* ¼ teaspoon pepper
* 4 pinches nutmeg
* 3 ounces bacon, cut into matchsticks

==Procedure==
# Mix the starter ingredients together in a small bowl, cover tightly, and set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes.
# When the starter is light and bubbly, mix the beer and milk into the mixture.
# Put the flour and salt into a food processor, then, with the motor running, add the yeast mixture through the feeding tube.  Process the dough until it forms a ball.  Add very small amounts of additional flour or milk if necessary.
# Process the ball until it is smooth, elastic, and warm, about 45 seconds to 1 minute.
# Butter a medium-sized bowl, roll the ball around in the butter, then cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled.  Punch down and let rise a second time.
# While the dough is rising, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a nonstick skillet.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, over low heat for 5 minutes or until golden brown.  Let cool.
# Combine the crème fraîche, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Add the cooled onion.
# Heat the remaining oil in the skillet and fry the bacon until lightly browned, stirring constantly.  Remove and drain through a strainer.
# Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 deg C) (or as hot as it will go) If using a pizza stone, preheat the oven for at least 30 minutes.
# Lightly oil a 14 x 16 inch (35 x 40 cm) baking sheet.  Roll the dough until slightly smaller than the baking sheet.  Place it on the sheet. If using a pizza stone you may roll the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper.
# Spread the onion mixture over the dough, leaving a very small raised rim all the way around, then dot with the bacon.
# Bake for 4 to 20 minutes depending on oven temp. Tart should is lightly browned &amp; bubbling. Burned/blackened edges are traditional.  Serve very hot.

'''NOTE:''' To make crème fraîche, combine 1 cup heavy cream with 2 tablespoons buttermilk, stir, cover with plastic wrap, and leave at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours, or until it has become very thick.  Refrigerate, and it will become even thicker.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Momentum and Energy ==

----
[[w:Momentum|Momentum]] is a physical quantity that is equal to the [[w:mass|mass]] of an object multiplied by its [[w:velocity|velocity]]. Momentum is related to energy, and like [[w:energy|energy]] it remains conserved in a [[w:closed system|closed system]] (a system where no energy enters or leaves). Classically, momentum is defined as such:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

where the bold P and v indicate [[w:vector|vector]]s.

Where [[w:kinetic energy]] is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;E=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, 

&lt;math&gt;2E/\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

Also note

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dE}{dv}=p&lt;/math&gt;

That is, momentum can be used to measure the change in kinetic energy as an object changes velocity.

== Force and Momentum ==

----
[[w:Force|Force]] is defined as the mass of an object multiplied by its [[w:acceleration|acceleration]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Acceleration is the [[w:derivative|derivative]] of velocity, which is the vector form of distance over time. Thus, the integral of acceleration is velocity:

&lt;math&gt;\int adt=v&lt;/math&gt;

Using this, we can easily see how the integral of Force is momentum:

&lt;math&gt;\int Fdt = m\int adt = mv = p&lt;/math&gt;


== Conservation of Momentum ==

----

Recall the main result from [[Physics with Calculus/Mechanics/Center of Mass|Center of Mass]] that for a system of particles

&lt;math&gt; F = M \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d MV}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

where F is the sum of the external forces, M is the total mass, and V is the velocity of the center of mass (that is, the time derivative of the center of mass).  If F = 0, we have &lt;math&gt;MV = \sum_i m_i v_i = const&lt;/math&gt;.  If we define &lt;math&gt;m_i v_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the momentum of a particle then we have the law of conservation of momentum -- that the total momentum is conserved when there are no external forces.  In other words, the momentum you start out with will be the momentum you end up with. Say you're playing pool, and you go to smack the 8-ball in the right corner pocket. As a challenge, however, your opponent rolls the 8-ball across the table. The conservation of momentum can be summed up with a simple equation:

&lt;math&gt;\sum p_i = \sum p_f&lt;/math&gt;

As you smack the cue ball toward the 8-ball and your opponent rolls the 8-ball across the table, you give the cue ball some velocity v_1 and the 8-ball a velocity v_2. The initial momentum for the entire system is therefore:

&lt;math&gt;m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = \sum p_i&lt;/math&gt;

Being the pool player with some sweet skills that you are, the cue ball smacks the 8-ball and it goes flying into the pocket. Right after the collision, the momentum of the system is:

&lt;math&gt;m_1v_1' + m_2v_2' = \sum p_f&lt;/math&gt;

Can you guess what we can do next? Since we know that the momentum of the system is conserved, we can set these two equations equal to each other:

&lt;math&gt;m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = m_1v_1' + m_2v_2' = \sum p_i = \sum p_f&lt;/math&gt;

Now, there are a plethora of ways to solve these equations, depending on what values are given or determined through experiment. If we determine the masses and the initial velocities plus one of the final velocities, we can solve the equation by simple algebra this way:

&lt;math&gt;(m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 - m_1v_1')/m_2 = v_2' \Rightarrow (m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 - m_2v_2')/m_1 = v_1'&lt;/math&gt;

The &quot;&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-2%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot; symbol here means &quot;implies&quot;. Obviously, if you can solve for v1' here you can solve for v2'.

----

Now let's try something a bit harder. Say that we're poor college students and can't afford to purchase machines that measure velocity. Instead, however, we can measure forces and masses. We intentionally hit the cue ball with a force of 3N and roll the 8-ball with a force of 1N. If we want to find momentums now, we'll have to calculate them using our given information. Well, we can use the nifty equation

&lt;math&gt;\int Fdt = \int madt = mv = p&lt;/math&gt;

(I just integrated F = ma over time). Our momenta are therefore easily calculated:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{t_1}^{t_2} 3\, dt = p_1\quad and\quad \int_{t_1}^{t_2} 1\, dt = p_2&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that because the integral of force is momentum, momentum is equal to the area under the curve of force (by time). In other words, when you smack a cue ball you exert some force over some time interval. If you were to plot this, the momentum of the cue ball at the end of the time interval would be the total area under that curve to that point. 


----

The principle of conservation of momentum can, of course, be applied to a situation where two colliding objects creates one big object. Say that your billiard balls were made of a clay, and just as your cue ball hit the 8-ball, they stuck together to form one large mass of clay. the conservation of momentum equation would now look like

&lt;math&gt;\sum p_i = m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = \sum p_f = (m_1 + m_2)/v'&lt;/math&gt;

==Continuous Systems==

Now is a nice time to look at an interesting class of problems involving continuous mass distribution.  The classic example is a rocket that burns fuel and ejects exhaust at a velocity v ''relative to the rocket.''  If the rocket starts out with mass &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; and burns fuel at a rate of b, what is the velocity of the rocket as a function of mass burned (or equivalently time since the mass burned is bt).

Consider the rocket at two times t and t + dt.  At t it has a velocity forwards of u, and mass M.  At t + dt, it has velocity u + du and mass M - dm and has expelled a small mass dm at velocity u - v forward (so that it is traveling at -v relative to the rocket).  Using conservation of momentum,

&lt;math&gt; Mu = (M - dm) (u + du) + (u-v)dm&lt;/math&gt;.

This simplifies to

&lt;math&gt; du = v \frac{dm}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

noting that the product of two small things is really, really small and we can safely take &lt;math&gt;du dm&lt;/math&gt; to be zero.

Integrating gives

&lt;math&gt; \Delta u = v \ln(\frac{M}{M_0})&lt;/math&gt;.

Or, if we want to find u as a function of time, just substitute &lt;math&gt; M = M_0 - bt&lt;/math&gt;.

As you can see, the conservation of momentum provides a powerful tool for problems such as these.  If we wanted to find the velocity of a rocket that's going away from earth, we have to note that the conservation of momentum does not quite hold, but that &lt;math&gt; p(t + dt) = p(t) + Fdt&lt;/math&gt; which is the same thing as F = ma.

Using differentials (or deltas if you're a stickler for that kind of thing) is a very useful technique that will allow you to write a differential equation for most systems (all if you're very clever), so it is a trick well worth remembering.

In most parts of the world winters are not a big issue.  Howerver, once you go north/south of certain latitudes then keeping your chickens going through the winter is a big deal.


== Winterizing your Shelter ==
If you are using an existing shed that has wall cavities(in between the outside siding, and the inside wall) you can fill those up with sawdust, and that helps.

== Heat ==
Depending on the size and cold tolerance of your chickens heating can be very important or just a nice add on.  If your shelter is small enough and insulated well the heat produced by your chickens might be enough to keep them warm.  If this is not the case then it might be necessary to put heating in.  A heat lamp can help add warmth to the chickens shelter.  The cold tolerance of chickens varies. However, some chickens can be quite happy in -20 celcius.

== Butchering all your chickens in the fall ==
One option of getting your chickens through the winter is to not do it.  If you are raising chickens for meat purposes then this is an option worth considering.  For instructions on doing this look in the [[Raising_Chickens/Death/Butchering|Butchering]] section of this book.

== Helping/auxiliary verbs ==

hi,
''There are no helping verbs in German.'' That's not right. Do you mean auxiliary verbs? What about ''Ich habe gesungen'', ''Ich bin gegangen'' or ''Ich werde kommen''? haben and sein and werden are auxiliary verbs! [[m:User:Louisana]]


As native German I can second that - there are auxiliary verbs, and they are quite necessary. Imagine English w/o auxiliary verbs.. --[[User:84.62.175.68|84.62.175.68]] 14:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

Hi! I'm a native German, too, and I deleted that assertion. I think I'm right to suppose that a &quot;helping verb&quot; is an &quot;auxiliary verb&quot; (at least the English Wikipedia article redirects there), so it turns out to be wrong. Those who know German, please read [[:w:de:Hilfsverb]]. --[[User:Langec|Langec]] 20:29, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Closeness of English and German ==
Can someone with some knowledge clear this up:


German and English are very close to each other. Here are some major similarities:
* Both languages have the same 26 letters: A - Z.
...
As you can see, German is very much like English. There are, however,  differences:
* German has more letters than and different pronunciations from English (see Lesson 1).

:: There is more truth to the second statement. In addition to the ascii alphabet we have vokals with those funny dots on top and the sharp s. However, I wouldn't base the proximity of languages on the number of letters. After all, Finnish uses the same letters as English but linguists have a hard time to find any similarity at all.--[[User:KaiMartin|KaiMartin]] 00:36, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

==Identical Words?==

&quot;Many words, such as Football and Sandwich are the same in English and German. &quot;

Really? One of the first German words I learned was Fußball... not really the same as English. [[User:Terrafire|Terrafire]] 15:25, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
:Hi Leo, I (a German) can confirm that. Sandwich is another bad example, because this word has been imported from English to German; it is not a native German word. Otherwise, you could also name &quot;kindergarten&quot; or &quot;autobahn&quot;, which would be ridiculous ;-) I'd suggest to leave that point out. --[[User:Langec|Langec]] 20:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::I replaced the examples with words like Text, Zoo, Handball, Park, Position, Garage, ... I guess some of these words are imported from Latin, Greek, and French into both languages. In that sense they might be bad examples, but they are considered normal German/English words now. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:25, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

== Contents ==

I can not find the special German method of showing completeness anywhere in the German Wikibook.  The section stating that they do things differently should be revised.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 09:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

== More guttural ==

&quot;German is more 'guttural'. In German, you talk in the back of your mouth.&quot;

What is the reasoning behind this statement? In both Standard German and English, there are no consonants with Epiglottal, Pharyngeal, or Uvular articulation (regional varieties of &lt;r&gt; aside). Is the reasoning based on the number of sounds in the back of the mouth, i.e. /k, g, h, ŋ/ in English vs /k, g, ç, x, h, ŋ/ in German? Or maybe the frequency of these sounds?

Regardless, &quot;In German, you talk in the back of your mouth&quot; is an imprecise--if not outright false--statement. --JS

:I removed the statement since I didn't know what it refers to. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:22, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

== English has genders? ==

In what possible sense do English words have genders?

:Please sign your comments with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The way I understand that statement is that you have to use pronouns of the right gender to refer to nouns: &quot;The '''man''' walks on the street. '''He''' wears a hat. A '''woman''' follows him. '''She''' doesn't wear a hat. The '''street''' doesn't really care. '''It''' has seen many men and women.&quot; But maybe the statement should be removed. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 07:03, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
:And think of phrases like &quot;'''brother''' sun and '''sister''' moon&quot;, '''the''' sun and '''the''' moon, while referring pronouns are &quot;'''he'''&quot; for sun and &quot;'''she'''&quot; for moon. In German the other way round: *'''Schwester''' Sonne und '''Bruder''' Mond&quot;, '''die''' Sonne und '''der''' Mond. --[[Special:Contributions/93.83.23.30|93.83.23.30]] ([[User talk:93.83.23.30|discuss]]) 19:26, 6 June 2013 (UTC)</text>

= King's Knight Opening =
===2. Nf3===
Black's valuable center pawn is threatened with capture, but White's pawn remains safe. The question for Black at this point is whether to challenge White's e4 pawn or support his own pawn.

:*[[/2...Nc6/]] is the natural move, combining defence of the pawn with control of the d4 square and refusing to commit another pawn. The extent of this move's popularity is such that the typical player of 2. Nf3 as White is already thinking beyond it to their third move, safe in the knowledge that any variation by Black will play into their hands.

In fact Black has a few other options, though all have their downsides.

:*[[/2...d6/]], Philidor's Defence, is the other safe option to defend the pawn. It restricts the f8 bishop to the e7 square, and grants White an advantage in territory, but it builds a fortress that cannot be easily battered down.

:*[[/2...f6/]]?, Damiano's Defence, is a wasted move. After 3. Nxe5, the knight cannot be captured as 3...fxe5 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ is most embarrassing. Black's best play is 3...Qe7, but white still has the better game. 

If Black decides to go after White's pawn, he has:

:*[[/2...Nf6/]], Petrov's Defence. Black refuses to be cramped, but his symmetrical tendencies are unlikely to lead to a very active position either, unless White feels compelled to try and win the game by breaking the symmetry.

:*[[/2...f5/]]?!, the Latvian Gambit. The Latvian Gambit is perhaps the most vocally disagreed-about opening in chess. Depending on who you read, Black has either lured White into a minefield of tricks and traps leading almost inevitably to a violent death, or given away a pawn for nothing.

:*[[/2...Qe7/]], the Câmara Defence. The idea here is a possible transposition to the King's Indian Defense by following up with moves like g6, Bg7 and d6 or c6.

:*[[/2...d5/]]?!, the Elephant Gambit. It is generally considered unsound, because if White plays accurately Black does not get sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. However, if White doesn't play accurately, Black's position can soon become overwhelming. It is considered sounder yet less dangerous than the Latvian Gambit.

== Overview ==

'''William &quot;Bill&quot; Arthur Weasley''' is the eldest son of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]; he is two years older than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], the second son. He is tall with long, red hair tied into a ponytail and a fang earring, both of which which his mother disapproves of. At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] he was in Gryffindor House and Head Boy in his seventh year. After Hogwarts, Bill worked as a curse-breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank in Egypt.

Bill Weasley's birthday is 29 November. His birth year is not given in the series, but internal evidence suggests 1971.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Bill is first mentioned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] while they are journeying to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express. He is said to have been Head Boy while at school, and is now working for Gringotts in Egypt as a curse-breaker.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Bill continues to work at Gringotts in Egypt.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The Weasley family visits Bill over the summer holidays in Egypt.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Bill is waiting at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Weasleys' kitchen table]] when Harry arrives by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']]. This is our first time seeing him, dressed in his usual unconventional attire. Having only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] as an example, Harry had expected Bill, a former Head Boy, to be somewhat stodgy; but Bill can only be described as cool. 

Bill is home because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] has procured tickets to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. He is attending with the family and Harry and Hermione, but rather than travel by Portkey with his father and the younger Weasley children, he instead [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] to the campsite with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]]. Bill apparently enjoyed the match, discussing it at some length with the others at their campsite later that evening. When a riot breaks out during the night, he, along with Charlie, Percy, and Arthur attempt to break it up before any Muggles are hurt, collecting himself an injury in the process.

In the following week, he is seen several times around the Weasley home, usually being nagged by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|his mother]] about his long hair and fang earring. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] calls Arthur about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], Bill takes part in the conversation where we learn about Moody's history. Charlie and Bill accompany the family to the Hogwarts Express to see the children off, and Bill alludes to something mysterious happening soon at Hogwarts. Apparently Charlie and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] also know about it, but say nothing, much to the annoyance of Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]].

We next see Bill just before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. As Harry's family has no interest in watching him compete in the Tournament, Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|his mother]] have come in their place to cheer him on. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], upon seeing Bill waiting for Harry, seems unbothered by the long hair or the fang earring. Harry spends the day touring Hogwarts with Mrs. Weasley and Bill, and listening to Mrs. Weasley's reminiscences about her Hogwarts days; Harry waves to Bill and Mrs. Weasley before entering the maze.

As Harry arrives in the hospital wing after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s return, Bill, along with Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], is demanding that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] tell them where Harry is. Everyone stays by Harry's bedside as he is given sleeping potion.

Bill is still present when Harry is awoken by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]]'s arrival. After Fudge's departure, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] tells Mrs. Weasley that he needs to send an urgent messenger to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] about what has happened, and to start gathering allies within the Ministry. Bill volunteers to carry the message to his father, and departs.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Bill is first seen when Harry arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. When Harry, Ron, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]] head to the kitchen for dinner, Bill is there, cleaning up after the Order of the Phoenix's meeting. 

During conversation before and over dinner, we learn that Bill no longer works as a curse-breaker and has taken a desk job at Gringotts so that he can be closer to home to work for the Order. He has also started giving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] lessons so that she can, &quot;eemprove 'er Eeenglish&quot;.

At Christmas, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] is attacked at the Ministry, he is taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] stays until he is out of danger, then returns to Grimmauld Place to update everyone on his condition, and says that Bill is sitting with Arthur.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry arrives at The Burrow after meeting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], Fleur Delacour brings him his breakfast, during which she announces that she and Bill are engaged to be married the following summer. Ron, Hermione, and Harry agree with Ginny that Molly Weasley dragging [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] under Bill's nose is unlikely divert Bill's attention; Tonks also seems too depressed since the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]] to be interested in Bill. Bill is apparently living at The Burrow and is there for Harry's birthday. He mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Florean Fortescue|Florean Fortescue]] has departed his ice cream store in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

Bill, who works for Gringotts, retrieves some money for Harry from his vault, saying that due to tight security measures, it could take Harry several hours to get into Gringotts.

Bill and Fleur are at the Burrow at Christmas; Mrs. Weasley is mildly upset that Tonks, though invited, has chosen to stay away. She believes Bill's presence is keeping Tonks from spending Christmas with them.

Bill is present during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|battle under the Astronomy Tower]]; he was evidently one of the Order members guarding Hogwarts while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] was absent. Bill is viciously mauled by the werewolf, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]]. Fortunately, as Fenrir was not transformed at the time, Bill did not become a werewolf, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] is unable to completely heal his face, and he remains permanently scarred. Molly Weasley believes Fleur will break the engagement, being he is no longer as handsome as he was. Fleur is indignant at this suggestion, proclaiming she is pretty enough for them both, and the wedding is still on. This declaration marks the beginning of Molly and Fleur's reconciliation.

Though there is fear that Fenrir's attack may have turned Bill into a werewolf, the only permanent damage he suffers is his scarred face and a new craving for very rare steaks.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Bill begins the summer with a mission to help protect Harry. The protective charms at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Number 4, Privet Drive]] end when Harry reaches his majority, so shortly before his birthday, the Order of the Phoenix gathers to transport Harry to a safe house. Seven groups will travel separately to one safe house, with six groups having a Harry Potter decoy and a protector, and one group with the real Harry and his protector, Hagrid. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] is used to transform the decoys into Harry's likeness. Bill is a protector, while Fleur assumes Harry's identity. Though attacked by Death Eaters, they make it to their destination and from there to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]]. 

Once there, Bill assists in tending to his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George]], whose ear was severed by Snape's Dark spell. After leading a moment of respect for the fallen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]], Bill departs to help search for his body, though it is never found.

The day after Harry's birthday, Bill and Fleur Delacour are married. The celebration is interrupted by news arriving, via [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], that the Ministry has fallen, and that Death Eaters are on their way to the Weasleys'.

When Ron becomes fed up with Harry's mission for Dumbledore, he leaves. He is unable to return to The Burrow, however, because his decoy (a ghoul disguised to look like him) is there, pretending to be Ron suffering from Spattergroit – or so the authorities would believe. Instead, he goes to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], Bill and Fleur's seaside home, and spends Christmas there. On his return to Harry and Hermione, he tells them about Shell Cottage.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are captured by Snatchers and imprisoned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] along with several others. Harry pleads for help from someone he sees in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s magic mirror, and shortly is joined by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. Needing a safe place to transport [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]], he remembers Ron telling him about Shell Cottage, and orders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] to take them there. Shortly afterwards, Ron, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], Harry, and Dobby follow; Dobby, mortally wounded by Bellatrix Lestrange, dies there, and Bill assists Harry in burying him near the cottage, and helps care for the recuperating Ollivander and Griphook.

Once Ollivander has recovered enough to travel, Bill takes him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]]'s. Later, Bill is present when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] arrives at Shell Cottage to announce the birth of his and Tonks' son, little Teddy Lupin. As that celebration is winding down, Bill cautions Harry about making any deals with Griphook. Goblins, he says, believe that ownership of Goblin-made items remains with them, regardless if a human paid for it. Goblins conisder it a rental rather than purchase, and the goods should be return to the maker when the original &quot;owner&quot; dies.

Bill is present at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], he is among the last few arrivals through the tunnel from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]], and is present when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] arrives to reconcile with his family before joining the fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

It is in this book that we learn that his name is actually William, rather than (as we might suppose) Bilius, apparently a favoured name among the Weasleys.

== Strengths ==

Bill Weasley is a clever, powerful, and resourceful wizard. He is loyal to his family and to Harry Potter. He also belongs to the Order of the Phoenix and plays a significant role in the fight against Lord Voldemort.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Bill met Fleur Delacour when he accompanied his mother to Hogwarts to support Harry Potter during the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, in which she was also a Champion. Fleur was attracted to Bill immediately, eyeing him from a distance. Shortly after, Bill moved back to England to work for the Order of the Phoenix, taking a desk job at Gringotts. Fleur was working part-time at the bank, and the two began dating shortly after. 

After a year together, Bill proposed, and Fleur accepted. His mother felt it was too soon for him to marry, and worried that he was only doing it in response to Lord Voldemort's return. In addition, Fleur's blunt personality, apparent self-centeredness, and tendency to speak her mind irritated both Molly and Ginny. Mrs. Weasley became convinced that their mutual feelings were based more on physical attraction, as well as the adventurous side each possessed &amp;mdash; him as a Curse Breaker, and her as a Triwizard Champion. After Bill is attacked and disfigured by the werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, during the Battle Under the Astronomy Tower, Fleur showed her true feelings by declaring that she loved Bill no matter what he looked like, and by her insistence that she would tend his injuries. Her declaration convinced Mrs. Weasley that her son had made the right choice, and the two women finally put aside their differences. 

Bill and Fleur married on August 1, 1997, and soon settled into Shell Cottage, near the sea. Following the war, Bill and Fleur had three children, Victoire, Dominique, and Louis Weasley.

== Overview ==

'''''Charlie Weasley''''' is the second son of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]. He is three years older than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], the Weasley's third son. He was a Prefect in his fifth year at Hogwarts, and Quidditch Seeker on the Gryffindor house team. After graduation, he went to work with dragons in Romania. If he stayed for the full seven years, he would have left Hogwarts the year before Harry arrived.

According to the author, Charlie's birthday is 12 December. His birth year is not given in the series, but internal evidence suggests 1973.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Charlie is mentioned in passing on the Hogwarts Express as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] lists his brothers who have attended Hogwarts before him.

At tea with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on the Friday of their first week, Hagrid asks Ron how Charlie is doing, saying that he always liked Charlie, who was good with animals.

In commenting on Harry's proficiency on a broom, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] says &quot;He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive. Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.&quot; Later that day, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] tell Harry that they've heard about him; they are on the team as well, they're Beaters, and George tells Harry, &quot;We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant.&quot; A few times after that, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]] compares Harry's skills as Seeker favourably with Charlie's.

The Weasley children, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], Fred, George, and Ron, stay at Hogwarts over Christmas because their parents are visiting Charlie in Romania.

When it becomes apparent that something is going to have to be done about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s pet dragon, Norbert, Harry hits on the idea of sending Norbert off to Ron's brother Charlie. Though he does respond to Ron's letter, Charlie does not directly appear, but four of his friends do end up spiriting Norbert away in the night.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Charlie is waiting at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Weasleys' kitchen table]] when Harry arrives by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']]. It is mentioned here that he has a large, healing burn on one arm.

Charlie is at home because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] has managed to get tickets to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and will be going to the Cup with the rest of the family. Being old enough to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]], he does so, arriving at the campsite about noon with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]]. He goes to the stadium with the rest of the Weasley family, and apparently enjoys the match, discussing it at some length with the rest of the family on their return to the campsite. When the riot breaks out that night, he goes with Bill, Percy, and Arthur to try to break it up before the Muggles get injured, and in the process collects an injury.

In the following week and a bit, we see him a few times around the Weasley family home, doing homely tasks like darning a fireproof balaclava. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] calls Arthur to tell him about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], Charlie is part of the conversation where we learn about Moody's history. 

Charlie travels with the rest of the group to the Hogwarts Express, and alludes to something mysterious that will be happening at Hogwarts. Apparently Bill and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], who have accompanied the group to the platform, know about it as well, but none of them will say anything, much to the annoyance of Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]].

We see Charlie again at the run-up to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], where he is one of the wizards brought in to wrangle the dragons needed for that task. He speaks briefly to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], unaware of Harry's presence under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], but suggesting that Hagrid was unwise to bring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] to see what her champion would be facing.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While Charlie Weasley is mentioned as being in the Order of the Phoenix, Arthur Weasley says that they have chosen to leave him in Romania, so that he can bring wizards from other countries into the organization.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Apparently, Charlie is unable to return to Hogwarts from Romania in time to play a part in the first part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle of Hogwarts]], but he arrives with the reinforcements and is part of the forces who eventually defeat the Death Eaters.

== Strengths ==

Charlie has a gift with animals, especially dragons. He was also a skilled seeker, with Oliver Wood believing he could have played for England if he had chosen to.

== Weaknesses ==

== Analysis ==

One issue that has been mentioned repeatedly on the Harry Potter fan sites is that, as stated [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=63 here], Charlie is three years older than Percy, so possibly the last time he will have flown for Gryffindor would be in his seventh year, the year immediately preceding Harry's arrival. In that case, the twin's statement in the first book that they haven't won a game since Charlie left, would be true only because they hadn't played any games since Charlie left. While this does rather nag at the reader, and the author has never explained it, there is one unexplored possibility: Charlie's chosen profession does not seem to require any [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level studies]]. So Charlie, as the Twins did after him, might not have chosen to wait out the seventh year of school. In fact, as he would have come of age shortly before Christmas of his sixth year, he could well have left school then, leaving Gryffindor without his services as Seeker for the last two matches of that year and the three matches immediately before the series opens. It is more likely, though, that if he had chosen to leave school early, he would have left at the end of his sixth year, leaving Gryffindor 0 for 3 in Quidditch the year before Harry arrived.

It is also said in the first three books that Gryffindor hasn't won the Quidditch cup in seven-eight years. You'd think that if Charlie was as good as he was said to have been Gryffindor would have won at least a few times during that period, but if we follow his 1973 age, this would've made him only a second year the last time they won. Given that second year students are rarely given a spot on the teams, this seems unlikely. The narration in general seems to imply that Charlie is four or five years older than he actually is. This is likely to be a simple mistake much like with the age of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]].

== Overview ==

'''''Percy Ignatius Weasley''''' is the third son of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]. He is two years older than the twins [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George]]. He became a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]] in his fifth year at Hogwarts, which was Harry's first year, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy]] in his seventh year. After graduation, he went to work in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

According to the author, Percy's birthday is 22 August. His birth year is not given, but internal series evidence suggests 1976.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Percy first appears at the train station with the other Weasley family members as they are leaving for Hogwarts. He is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], and seems inordinately proud of the fact; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] try to take him down a few pegs, without success. Once [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is Sorted into Gryffindor House, he ends up sitting next to Percy; Percy does tell him a few things about what is going on, but the feel is very much parent-to-child, rather than student-to-student as we would expect to see with any other student. After the arrival feast, he leads the Gryffindor first-years to the dormitory and tells them the password.

We don't see much of Percy for the rest of the book. He appears at Christmas, briefly, and he is seen at the Leaving Feast telling people that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is his brother, but otherwise appears very little.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

While Percy is a prefect again this year, he doesn't spend so much effort publicizing the fact; apparently, as he has been a prefect for a full year now, he no longer feels the need to broadcast this fact. He does seem to have gotten a lot stuffier over the summer, though.

Harry spends the latter part of his summer break at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], the Weasley's home. While he is there, the other Weasley brothers mention that Percy is acting oddly, remaining shut up in his room. Ron mentions that he had wanted to send a message using Percy's owl, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermes|Hermes]], because the Weasley family owl, [[Muggles' Guide  to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]], has gotten old and unreliable, but that Percy had refused him, saying that he needed Hermes himself.

At Christmas, the twins have bewitched Percy's Prefect badge so that it reads &quot;Pinhead&quot;. Percy is oblivious to this change, but does wonder why everyone is laughing at him.

When Harry and Ron are disguised as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], and are looking for the Slytherin common room, they run into Percy, who threatens them with detention for wandering the corridors. Percy also gives Ron and Harry a House points penalty when he sees them leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s bathroom.

Harry asks Percy for help selecting courses to take for his third year. Percy is very little help; his attempts to advise Harry, though presumably meant well, are so full of pomposity that Harry can't get anything useful out of them.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]] are Petrified by the monster in the Chamber, Percy is apparently very deeply shocked. Fred and George suggest that this is because Penelope was a Prefect as well, and Percy had thought that Prefects were invulnerable.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], at breakfast one day, seems to be deeply disturbed about something, and is about to tell Harry and Ron something, but Percy arrives and scares her off. He says that he knows what Ginny was going to say, and that it had nothing to do with the Chamber.

In the Chamber, after the defeat of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], Ginny tells Harry that she had meant to tell Harry that she thought she was the one who was opening the Chamber, but Percy's appearing at the table had driven her away – she simply couldn't tell Harry that while Percy was there.

Finally, on the train home, Ginny reveals that the thing Percy had thought she was going to reveal was the fact that he had a girlfriend. She had walked in on them in an empty classroom once, and Percy had made her promise not to tell. The girlfriend was Penelope Clearwater, which explains why her being Petrified was such a shock to Percy.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry receives a birthday card from Ron. Included in the card is a clipping from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] regarding the Weasleys winning a prize and vacationing in Egypt. In the picture, Harry sees Percy wearing his new Head Boy badge. Ron says that Percy is, if possible, even more pompous and insufferable than before.

Harry spends the last few weeks of his vacation in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], in the Leaky Cauldron. On the last day before school starts, the Weasleys and Hermione show up to do their school shopping. When they meet in the Leaky Cauldron later, Percy is as pompous as a Lord Mayor; the twins are trying to take him down a few pegs by imitating him, but it doesn't seem to work. Later, Percy is upset because he thinks someone has damaged his picture of Penelope Clearwater; in fact, she has developed some spots and is trying to hide under the picture frame. He then starts tearing the room he shares with Ron apart because his Head Boy badge has gone missing; it turns out that Fred and George have nicked it so that they can &quot;improve&quot; it. When Fred shows it to Harry, it says &quot;Bighead Boy&quot;.

When Harry is unable to visit Hogsmeade, Percy tries to console him by telling him that he won't be missing much. Harry does not find Percy's brand of consolation much use.

After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s first attempt to break into Gryffindor Tower, all the students are returned to the Great Hall to sleep while the school is searched. Percy is mentioned as being one of the prefects patrolling the Great Hall to ensure that nobody misbehaves. After this, Harry finds that there is almost always a teacher within earshot of him, and that Percy seems to be following him around. He already understands the reason for this, as he overheard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] talking about how Black wants to kill Harry. But he still finds the rather heavy-handed guard a bit oppressive.

On the second occasion that Black breaks in, it is Percy that initially orders everyone back to bed, an order that is ineffective.

Finally, at the end of the book, it is revealed that Percy has received decent NEWT scores, and graduates.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Percy has graduated from Hogwarts and begins working for the Ministry of Magic, where he is an assistant to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]]. When we first see him, he is closeted in his room at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], and complaining about the noise everyone is making as he is working on a report about substandard cauldrons being imported from overseas. At dinner, he keeps dropping hints about some top-secret project he's involved with. It appears that he hopes that someone will ask him about it, so that he can make himself seem more important by refusing to divulge information.

Percy [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], joining Harry, Hermione, Mr. Weasley, and the younger Weasleys. While waiting for the start of the match, Percy sees his boss, Mr. Crouch, walk by, and dashes up to offer him a cup of tea. Mr. Crouch accepts, but calls Percy &quot;Weatherby&quot;; the twins in particular make fun of Percy because his boss doesn't even really know his name.

In the riots after the match, Percy assists Bill, Charlie, Mr. Weasley, and the Ministry wizards working to quell the riot.

Afterwards, once everyone has returned home, Mr. Weasley says he's going to have to head in to the office to handle the fall-out from the riots. Percy officiously decides to go in as well, saying something about Mr. Crouch wanting his cauldron bottom-thickness report. It appears that Percy has been moved from cauldron bottoms to general damage control, because he later laments the number of claims for compensation that have been coming in, and that exploding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howlers]] have scorched his desk.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], Percy is present, filling in for Mr. Crouch, who he says is ill and has gone home to rest. He also tells Harry that he has been promoted to be Mr. Crouch's personal assistant, and that Mr. Crouch is sending in instructions by owl. Mr. Crouch is still incapacitated in February, when it comes time for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], and Percy fills in for him as judge. Percy's pompous pose somewhat cracks when Harry comes to the surface of the lake with Ron; Percy runs out into the water to help Ron ashore.

Shortly after this, Ron, Harry, and Hermione visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who has returned and is living in a cave outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. Sirius comments how odd it is that Mr. Crouch is sick, he had never taken time off work before, and asks Ron to ask Percy for any additional information he might have about Mr. Crouch's illness. Percy, when he finally replies around Easter, is quite testy, and provides no additional information.

Some time after Mr. Crouch appears on the grounds at Hogwarts asking for Dumbledore, and then disappears, Percy is reportedly &quot;called in for questioning&quot;, presumably by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]]. There is some question whether Percy should have been able to detect the severity of Mr. Crouch's ailment from the tone of his messages. We don't hear about the end result of that questioning, though when the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] occurs, Percy is no longer judging in Mr. Crouch's stead. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic]], is there in his place.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Percy is promoted again, this time to the post of Assistant to the Minister for Magic. This ends up being a sticking point, as the rest of the Weasley family sees this as Percy being seconded to spy on his family, all of whom are notorious for their support of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], and presumably share his belief in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s return. After a tremendous argument, in which Percy says that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s lack of ambition is why they never have enough money, Percy packs his things and moves to London.

Percy is the scribe at Harry's trial before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]] for underage use of magic. After Harry is cleared of all charges, Harry is talking to Mr. Weasley outside the courtroom. Percy walks by and does not notice, or pretends not to notice, his father.

Shortly after the start of the school year, Percy sends Ron a letter, scheduled to arrive late at night rather than with the morning post. In this letter, Percy congratulates Ron on becoming a prefect, and says that Ron may want to cut Harry loose as a friend because Dumbledore's time in power at Hogwarts may be limited, and it might be a good idea to start getting in touch with the new power structure. If he has any questions, he can always ask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], a &lt;!-- check quote --&gt;&quot;thoroughly delightful person&quot;. He also suggests that Ron should check [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] the next morning, because he might see someone there he knows. Ron, angrily, tears the letter into bits and throws it into the fire. The next issue of the ''Daily Prophet'' does have a picture of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|the Minister for Magic]] and Dolores Umbridge, on a story about Educational Decree number Twenty-Three, and Percy is in the background.
 
[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] is upset at Christmas, first because Percy has sent back his Christmas present unopened, and second because he doesn't seem to have cared that his father was injured.

When Fudge comes to the school to witness the arrest or expulsion of Harry for running an illegal student group, Percy tags along as scribe. Percy is present when Dumbledore claims responsibility for the organization known as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], and once Fudge has heard Dumbledore's &quot;confession&quot;, he sends Percy off to forward a copy to the Prophet.

Although Percy will remain Fudge's assistant, presumably, we don't hear from him again through the course of this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

New Minister of Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]], wants to recruit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] as the Ministry of Magic's &quot;Poster Boy.&quot; Knowing that Harry is staying with the Weasleys at the Burrow, he ''uses'' Percy as an excuse to visit them over Christmas.  When they arrive, the Minister tells Molly and Arthur that they were in the area, and Percy wanted to stop in and see his family.  Claiming he doesn't want to intrude on the family reunion, Scrimgeour asks Harry to show him around the garden. He then attempts to persuade Harry to help the Ministry of Magic improve its public image. When Harry refuses, Scrimgeour departs, taking Percy. Percy has evidently not done too well reconciling with his family; as he departs, apparently he is wearing mashed parsnips, for which Fred, George, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] all claim credit.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry and Ron are in the Ministry of Magic, we see Percy briefly. He steps onto an elevator (&quot;lift&quot; in the UK edition), then notices that he is sharing an elevator with his father and quickly leaves.

Percy redeems himself and admits he was wrong during the final battle for Hogwarts. He even jokes and tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s puppet Minister of Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], he &quot;resigned&quot;, immediately after Jinxing him. At Fred's death, he throws himself over the body to shield it from any further harm, then, with Harry's help, drags the body out of the way from danger. He then sprints off to save a group of students who were being chased by a Death Eater.

In the epilogue, Harry thinks he hears Percy expounding about broomstick regulations as he walks along [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]], and is quietly glad that the enveloping steam makes it unnecessary for him to stop and say hello.

The author created a family tree for the Weasley children as part of a television show highlighting her work. There, it was revealed that Percy married a woman named Audrey and the couple had two daughters, Molly and Lucy.

== Strengths ==

Percy is very committed to be perfect in whatever it is he is doing and is a hard worker for the Ministry of Magic. Much like the rest of the Weasley family, he seems to be a talented wizard, evidenced by his appointment as prefect and Head Boy.

== Weaknesses ==

Percy appears blind to his work superiors' failings. He is also so obsessed with rules that he never questions the reason behind them...he just obediently follows.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Percy Weasley's pompous and arrogant behavior often allowed for criticism and taunts. However, he did manage to get a girlfriend during his 6th year, Penelope Clearwater. Though details are few, he did spend the summer of 1992 in his room, writing to Penelope. His affection for her was reiterated when she was petrified by the Basilisk, when he showed deep shock.

Towards his superiors in the Ministry, Percy is almost fawning, rushing to get a cup of tea for Bartemius Crouch, despite Crouch not even correctly recalling his name, and sycophantically praising each utterance from Fudge. Percy seems to be the typical bureaucratic yes-man, destined to remain forever an underling, though perhaps ending up as second fiddle to the top man, in this case the Minister for Magic. We believe this is meant to indicate Percy's ambition, and perhaps illustrate also the shallowness of his character, as he climbs the career ladder at the Ministry in the only way he knows.

We are led to believe that it is this ambition, and Percy's inability to understand that there are things in life other than job hierarchy, that lead to the estrangement between him and the rest of his family. Percy reportedly says as much when he leaves the family home between Harry's fourth and fifth year at Hogwarts. We are never absolutely certain what causes Percy's change of heart; possibly the distastefulness of the work he finds himself doing in a Death-Eater controlled Ministry of Magic makes him homesick. However, it is true that he is reconciled with his family by the end of the final book, though Harry's comments in the epilogue suggest that his stuffy and pompous personality remains largely unchanged.

== Overview ==

'''''Fred and George Weasley''''' are the twin older brothers of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. They are around two years older than Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and were in Gryffindor, following in the footsteps of their family. They are tricksters, always inventing new tricks and playing practical jokes on their schoolmates and teachers. Their best friend is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]]. Fred and George Weasley [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7 were born] on April 1st, 1978.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

We first meet Fred and George in King's Cross Station, where they are part of the group of Weasleys that help Harry find his way onto [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]] – Fred is heard claiming to be George, illustrating their nature as pranksters. They later assist Harry to get his trunk on board the train, recognize him, and shortly thereafter introduce themselves and Ron to Harry. They then depart to talk to Lee Jordan, leaving Harry and Ron to talk together.

When Harry is made Seeker of the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch team]], Fred and George congratulate him and tell him that they are on the team also, as Beaters. Fred and George play in the match against Slytherin, of course, alongside Harry.

At Christmas, Fred and George elect to stay at Hogwarts, along with Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]]. It is mentioned that they bewitch some snowballs to fly around and repeatedly hit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] in the back of his turban.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] lose a hundred and fifty House points between them in the adventure surrounding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback]], Ron tries to cheer them up by telling them that Fred and George are always losing points for Gryffindor, but as they have never lost quite that many points in one shot, his attempts rather fail.

The twins are mentioned in passing a few times, also, in the context of Quidditch practice and Quidditch games.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Fred and George appear early in the story, with Ron, driving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s flying Ford Anglia and coming to rescue Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']]. They have a plan to get everyone back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], which is rather foiled when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] is awake and waiting for them upon their return. As punishment, after breakfast, the Twins and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] are sent to de-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|Gnome]] the garden; Harry volunteers to assist them. Mrs. Weasley pulls out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s book on pest removal; Fred suggests that Mrs. Weasley is sweet on Gilderoy. George says they know how to de-Gnome a garden, and they go out and proceed to do that. As they finish, Mr. Weasley returns home; Mrs. Weasley tells him about the twins borrowing the car, in the apparent expectation that he will punish them for it; he simply asks how it went, then weakly says it was very bad in response to the anger of his wife.

When booklists arrive, it is apparent that whoever is teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts is fond of Gilderoy Lockhart, because the textbook for that course seems to be his entire works. Fred suggests that the new Defence teacher is likely a middle-aged witch; George says that the lot of them won't come cheap, to which Mrs. Weasley replies, &quot;We'll manage.&quot; After making plans to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] the next day, the twins, Harry, and Ron go up to a paddock that the Weasleys own to practice Quidditch. Fred remarks, disgustedly, that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] had refused to play; if he keeps up as he has been, he is likely to become [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy]].

Once they are all in Diagon Alley, the Weasleys and Harry split up on their separate errands. Mrs. Weasley feels that she needs to tell the Twins to stay out of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Harry does meet up with them and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], in Gambol and Japes Joke Shop. Fred and George are back with the family in Flourish and Blotts, and are present when the fight between Mr. Weasley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] breaks out. When Mrs. Weasley comments, &quot;''What'' Gilderoy Lockhart must have thought...&quot; Fred points out that he was trying to figure out how to add it to the publicity for his book-signing.

In the Quidditch match against Slytherin, a Bludger seems to have decided that it is going to concentrate on Harry. Despite Fred and George's best efforts, it seems to have chosen to attack Harry repeatedly. Harry tells Fred and George that he'll have to deal with it himself, he can't ask them to stay up there and let the rest of the team take a beating from the remaining Bludger. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]] agrees, and so reluctantly, Fred and George leave Harry on his own and rejoin the game.

Later, the entire school seems to be convinced that Harry is the Heir of Slytherin. Harry is extremely cheered that Fred and George can keep making jokes about the situation.

Finally, on the Hogwarts Express homewards, Fred and George learn from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] that Percy has a girlfriend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]]. It seems that the Twins are going to have some fun with him about that.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry is staying in Diagon Alley for the end of his vacation, when the Weasleys turn up. Percy, as the twins had predicted, is Head boy, and is insufferably pompous. The twins are trying to take him down a notch by imitating him. After dinner, Percy is frantic because his Head Boy badge has vanished; Harry runs into Fred and George, who say they had taken it to &quot;improve&quot; it. It now reads &quot;Bighead Boy&quot;.
 
At breakfast on their first day back at Hogwarts, in response to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]'s imitations of Harry passing out from the effects of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], Fred and George mention that he had been up at their end of the train during that period, and had not been so brave himself.

Feeling that his need is greater than theirs, on the last [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] weekend before Christmas Break, Fred and George give Harry the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]]. This allows Harry to reach Hogsmeade undetected. There, he overhears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]], Hagrid, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] discussing the events surrounding the arrest of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] as they were then understood.

After the apparent death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], Fred and George attempt to cheer him up by reminding him that only days before, Ron had said he was useless. During the party after the Quidditch match a few days later, Fred and George bring Butterbeer back to the Common Room, alluding privately to Harry that it was thanks to the creators of the Marauder's Map.

At the end of the year, Fred and George are even seen studying occasionally, much to the amazement of anyone who knows them. They do, in the end, manage a handful of OWLs each, and profess themselves happy with that result.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Fred and George arrive at the Dursleys' with Ron and Mr. Weasley. They are coming to take Harry to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. They ask if Harry is packed; it turns out he is, so the twins go up to his room to retrieve his trunk, while Arthur unsuccessfully attempts to engage the Dursleys in conversation. Returning with Harry's trunk, Fred drops a bag of sweets; these roll around in all directions, and Fred takes a moment to gather them all up. He returns to The Burrow; George follows, with Harry's trunk. Before Harry leaves, though, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] finds one of the sweets that Fred had dropped; it turns out to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|Ton-Tongue Toffee]], which expands Dudley's tongue to be several feet long. On his return to The Burrow, Mr. Weasley is uncharacteristically angry with the Twins, saying that it is exactly this sort of thing that makes Wizard - Muggle relations so hard. Fred protests that they didn't do it because he was a Muggle; George chimes in saying that they did it because he was a great bullying git. Arriving on the scene, Mrs. Weasley asks if this is more Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Ron and Harry beat a hasty retreat to Ron's room; Harry asks what Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes are, and Ron tells him that the twins were starting up a mail-order magical jokes business, but that Mrs. Weasley had found their order forms and destroyed them and their stock.

Fred and George, along with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione, have to travel to the Quidditch World Cup by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]], because they are too young to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]]. Fred and George are upset by how early they have to get up. As they prepare to leave, Mrs. Weasley asks if they are taking Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes stuff with them. Ignoring their protests, Mrs. Weasley [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summons]] charmed toffees out of hiding places all over the twins clothing. They set off to Stoatshead Hill very disgruntled, not even saying goodbye.

Once at the camp site, and settled in, Mr. Weasley flags down [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludovic Bagman]], who, after some discussion with Arthur, asks if anyone would like to make a small bet on the outcome of the match. The twins place a bet amounting to their entire life savings on Ireland to win, but the Bulgarian Seeker, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], being the one to catch the Snitch. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch Sr.]] stops by the campsite, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] is almost falling over himself to be hospitable to his boss. It appears, though, that Mr. Crouch cannot even remember Percy's name, calls him &quot;Weatherby&quot;. After Crouch's departure, the twins make fun of Percy relentlessly, saying that if he works hard, one of these days Crouch might even learn his name.

The match ends as the twins had predicted, with an Irish victory but Krum holding the Snitch, and the twins request their payment from Ludo.

After the match, there is a riot; Mr. Weasley sends Harry, Ron, Hermione, the twins, and Ginny off into the nearby woods, out of the way. In the darkness, they get separated; we don't see the Twins and Ginny again until Harry returns to the tent.

On their return to The Burrow, Mrs. Weasley is extremely relieved; she had been fearing the worst, only having heard that there were riots, and not knowing if her family had survived. She was particularly concerned that her last words to the twins before they left had been angry.

In the next few weeks, before school starts, the twins seem somewhat subdued. On the last day before school, the two of them are working quietly over a bit of parchment. Mrs. Weasley asks if that's another order form; Fred parries by saying if the Hogwarts Express were to crash the next day, she wouldn't want her last words to be an unfounded accusation, surely?

The next morning, Fred and George recognize [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] when his name is mentioned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] in a call for Mr. Weasley. They travel to the train station in Muggle taxis, and Fred and George are unsuccessful in getting any information out of Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], who accompany them to the station, about the big event at Hogwarts will be. Arriving at Hogwarts, the twins are astonished to hear that Quidditch will be canceled for the year, and then dismayed to find that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] that will be taking its place is closed to those less than 17 years of age – the twins at this point are 16. On the way to the dormitory, they are already plotting with Lee Jordan on ways to avoid the age restriction.

The twins also tell Harry and Ron after the first day that classes with Moody are incredible. He has been battling the Dark Arts, and knows what it is all about. They do not elaborate further, but Ron bemoans the fact that his first Defence Against the Dark Arts class is not until Thursday.

We later see Fred and George working together on a parchment, and George scratching out a line, saying that it made it sound like they were accusing him. Later still, Fred and George are discussing over breakfast what to do about someone who does not answer them.

Once the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] is set up, Dumbledore draws an age line around it to prevent underage wizards from putting their names in. Fred and George, with Lee Jordan, decide to take a little Aging Potion, trying to fool the line that way; but shortly after Fred and George cross the line, and before they can put their names into the Goblet, it kicks them both out, awarding them both long white beards.

At the party in Gryffindor tower after Harry's victory in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]], Fred and George provide food. Hermione asks them if it had come from the castle kitchens, Fred says it did. She asks how to get into the kitchens, and George asks if she's planning to lead a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-Elf]] rebellion. Hermione does not answer.

As the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] approaches, Ron and Harry are bemoaning their difficulty in getting dates. Fred and George, who have come to borrow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]], wonder what the problem is; as if to demonstrate the simplicity of the proceedings, Fred calls over to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]], &quot;Oi! Angelina! Want to come to the ball with me?&quot; She accepts. Fred and George then, having been told Pigwidgeon is not available, go off to find a school owl.

Fred and George seem to try and corner Ludo Bagman on the dance floor at the Yule Ball, but he evades them. Asked about it by Harry, Ludo says that the twins were asking for marketing advice. At the first Hogsmeade weekend in the new year, the twins again try to corner Bagman at the bar of the Three Broomsticks, but he again brushes them off.

Fred and George escort Ron and Hermione away from the library, where they are trying to help Harry find a spell that will allow Harry to breathe underwater, which is required for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]]. They have been summoned by 

We see Fred and George sending off a letter to someone. They are deep in conversation as they head up to the Owlery, George cautioning Fred about sounding like they are blackmailing someone. Asked by Harry, Ron, and Hermione who they are blackmailing, the twins parry. After they leave, Ron says that the twins are really serious about raising money for their joke shop venture. He doesn't think the twins would do anything illegal to secure funding, but he's no longer sure.

Finally, on the Hogwarts Express heading back to London, Fred and George assist Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Jinxing Draco, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] when they arrive in Harry's compartment to taunt him about the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. Pushing Draco and his cronies out into the corridor, they join Harry, Ron and Hermione for the rest of the journey back. Late in the trip, they reveal that the person they have been corresponding with all year was, in fact, Ludo Bagman. Ludo had paid off their bet with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Leprechaun|Leprechaun]] gold, which had vanished. They had initially thought this was an oversight on Ludo's part, but as the year went on, Ludo refused to make good on his payment, and in the end even refused to give back their initial bet. It appears that Ludo had pulled the same trick on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblins]], and instead of repaying them (as he did not have the money) had bet with them again on Harry to win the Triwizard Tournament. Harry's having tied with Cedric was not good enough for the goblins, and they had demanded full payment. Ludo had run away. After Ron and Hermione had left the compartment in London, Harry gives Fred and George his winnings from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] to start their new business, a joke shop. They protest, but Harry says that by the look of things, they will need jokes soon enough.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Fred and George are deeply involved in testing products and doing market research for their joke shop, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. Several times, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] gets upset with them because they are using the first-year students as test subjects; at one point, she threatens to tell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|their mother]] if they continue.

Fred and George are present at the initial meeting of what is then known as the Defence Association at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]] exhibits skepticism about what Harry can teach them, Fred and George produce a sharp metal object and suggest a few places that they could use it on Zacharias.

At Quidditch practice, Ron manages to throw a Quaffle hard enough to give [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] a nosebleed. Fred, attempting to cure this, gives her what he believes to be the cure end of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Nosebleed Nougat]], but gets confused and instead feeds her a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood Blisterpod|Blood Blisterpod]]. As a result, Katie loses enough blood that she nearly loses consciousness and has to be escorted to the Hospital Wing.

Immediately after the first Quidditch game of the season, Draco Malfoy, seeing that Madam Hooch is occupied, starts insulting the Weasley family. Enraged, Fred and George are only kept from attacking him by their team mates: Fred is being held back by Angelina, Alicia, and Katie, while Harry is holding George. When Malfoy expands his insults to include Harry's family, Harry loses control and, with George, attacks Draco. As a result, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] hands Harry, Fred, and George a lifetime ban from Quidditch.

Once [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] has been removed as Headmaster, Fred and George no longer feel constrained to limit their antics. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]], a member of Professor Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad, attempts to dock them House points, they force him into an old, broken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]]. They tell Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they had almost decided against coming back to school, and that expulsion holds no fears for them; so their pranking will be turned up several notches. Shortly after this, they set off a truly massive quantity of fireworks in the Entrance Hall, and so Umbridge, on her first day as Headmistress, has to spend the entire day going from classroom to classroom extinguishing fireworks.

Harry later decides that he needs a distraction so that he can get into Umbridge's office and use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] via her fireplace, the only unmonitored fireplace at Hogwarts. Fred and George provide this distraction by turning a large part of one hallway into a swamp; but they are caught. Umbridge threatens them with the worst that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] can do, but they reclaim their brooms, and leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] with the instruction to &quot;give her (Umbridge) hell&quot;, they fly off into the sunset.

At the end of the novel, they are at the train station, wearing new suits made of dragon skin. Apparently they have opened their new store in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], and it is doing extremely well.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

The Weasley family, visiting Diagon Alley with Harry to purchase school supplies, visits the Twins' joke shop. Every other store is covered in the drab posters from the Ministry regarding Death Eaters, but Fred and George's shop window is uncovered and blazing with color, light, and activity. Once inside, they find the place is packed; Fred, showing Harry around, offers him the run of the place, saying anything he wants, he can have on the house (because he gave them the funds they needed to rent the building and set up their shop.) Ron is not so lucky, George demands that he pay full price, less the odd Knut because he is family. George also shows Harry the back room with the more serious stuff: Shield Hats, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Decoy Detonator|Decoy Detonators]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]], among other things. George reveals that quite apart from their joke line, they are doing a brisk business selling Dark-fighting gear to the Ministry. Returning to the front, they find Ginny looking at items designed for young witches. Fred and George ask her about her current relationships, and she responds that it is none of their business.

When Ron is poisoned on his birthday, Fred and George have just arrived in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] to look into buying Zonko's Joke Shop, which has closed down. Given that Hogsmeade weekends at the school have been canceled, though, they decide it would not be a wise investment. They do, however, stop by the school; they had planned to give Ron a birthday present, but had hoped it would have been a rather happier event.

After Dumbledore is killed, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] states that they were standing right outside the Room of Requirement when Malfoy lead the Death Eaters out of the room; seeing them, Malfoy threw something into the air that made everything go black, upon which Ron remarks in disgust that it was Fred and George's Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, and says that he is going to &quot;have a word with them about who they let buy their products.&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Fred and George both take [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to transform them into simulacra of Harry, as part of Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Escape from Privet Drive|escape from Privet Drive]]. George has his ear cursed off by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|the Sectumsempra curse]]. When he recovers, he seems in good spirits, making jokes about his new, earless appearance.

Fred and George are both ushers at the wedding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|their brother Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], along with Harry (in disguise) and Ron. Fred manages to arrange to seat the younger guests on the Delacour side of the family, all of whom seem to have some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] in their ancestry.

In their travels, Harry, Ron, and Hermione make good use of several products from Fred and George's joke shop. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Skiving Snackboxes]] are used to incapacitate Ministry employees so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione can sneak into the Ministry. Harry uses a Decoy Detonator to draw attention away from the door of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s office. And the Trio use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]] to listen in on another party while they are camping in the wilderness; this is how they learn about the Sword of Gryffindor.

In March, Ron manages to tune in the pirate wireless program &quot;Potterwatch&quot;. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], as &quot;River&quot;, introduces &quot;Rodent&quot;, easily identifiable by his voice as either Fred or George, and who protests his alias, saying he wanted to be known as &quot;Rapier&quot;. &quot;Rapier&quot; debunks some of the propaganda and fear surrounding Voldemort, saying that in order to be in all the places he is reported as being, there would have to be about nineteen of him.

When Remus Lupin is assigning duties for the defence of Hogwarts, Fred volunteers himself and George for the duty of defending the secret passages into Hogwarts.

As Harry is on his way to the Room of Requirement, where he now believes Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem is hidden, he passes Fred, guarding a hole behind a plinth where a statue had fallen, along with Lee Jordan and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hannah Abbott|Hannah Abbott]].

Fred is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|killed]] during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]] when a massive explosion blows a hole in the wall of the castle. He is buried in the stone rubble coming off the castle walls.

Harry later learns from Snape's memories that Snape had not intended to curse George's ear off; he had been aiming for the arm of the Death Eater who was about to curse George's guardian.

== Strengths ==

They are very loyal, very smart, and they can produce magic of a similar quality to Hermione's. They can easily work hard and with great dedication to produce surprisingly advanced magic when they want to. They are also very talented Quidditch players. They have an amazing sense of humour. Ron mentions [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 9|at one point]] that when he was three, Fred had turned his teddy bear into a spider. As the twins at that point would have been only four or five years old, and would not have had wands or formal training of any sort, this level of conscious magical ability is apparently incredible.

Extremely sensitive to situations, they know where &quot;the line&quot; is – exactly how much mayhem they can cause before it becomes necessary to actually discipline them. Despite having been &quot;chief troublemakers&quot; for six and a half years, it is only during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge's]] tenure as Headmistress that they get into any serious trouble, and then, it is a deliberate change in policy: they have decided that they don't need further formal schooling, and elect to make Umbridge's early days in office as difficult as possible, without concern for consequences.

== Weaknesses ==

Fred and George have very few weaknesses. One significant one is a tendency to avoid consequences. Their final days at school are marked with a number of fairly major pranks, specifically including setting off a large number of fireworks inside the school, and turning one corridor into a swamp. When they are caught, they elect to depart the school, leaving others to clean up the mess. Similarly, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]], then a member of Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad, attempts to dock them House points, they force him into an old, broken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]], without considering where or whether he might come out.

Fred and George, although talented and intelligent, have little interest in academic achievement.  In their fifth year they only pass 3 O.W.L.s each and never finish their seventh year.

Their concern for each other could be considered a weakness also. George had his ear cut off as he was helping disguise Harry's escape from Privet Drive; Fred, realizing George was hurt, was almost unable to speak until George regained consciousness.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Fred and George have a very typical twin-brothers relationship with each other, almost seeming to think the same thoughts at the same time. Of the two, though, Fred is quite clearly the ringleader; he usually speaks first, he is usually the driving force behind many of the pranks they pull off, and generally seems to be the leader of the pair.

The twins have earned the grudging admiration of the staff of the school. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], for example, when cleaning up the swamp they left in the hall as they departed, left a small corner of it in place, saying that it was a nice bit of magic, and apparently feeling that it needed to be commemorated in some way. The staff seem to feel that the Twins deserve respect for the ingeniousness of the magic that they perform as part of their pranks, probably coupled with their awareness of how much they can get away with while still being humorous and not excessively disruptive. The quality of their pranks, and their abilities as Quidditch Beaters, has earned them the respect of their fellow students as well.

The twins seem to keep their own company and the company of Lee Jordan, by and large. There are few, if any, hints of romantic entanglements. Fred, as noted, did go to the Yule Ball with Angelina Johnson; however, there is no apparent romantic interest apart from this one event. For the final year of writing the seventh and final book, the author was followed by a camera team from the British TV network ITV. After completing the seventh book, the author drew up a chart of the Weasley family tree, which showed that George had married one Angelina, quite possibly Angelina Johnson, and had two children with her, named Roxanne and Fred. 

Fred's death seems to have been very unpopular with the series' fans. A significant amount of fan-written fiction alters the Battle of Hogwarts to allow Fred to survive; much of it then has Fred marry Angelina, and has George show a romantic interest in Alicia Spinnet, an interest that is suggested nowhere in the seven books.

== Analysis ==

Fred and George are nominally equal; however, it seems Fred is mainly the ringleader. With few exceptions, whenever any activity is started, Fred speaks or moves first. This could have something to do with Fred's name falling earlier in the alphabet, so that it seems natural to put his name first. George is more sensitive, but when angered, is more violent, although it takes more to enrage him than Fred. George is 'the brains' and Fred is the 'operator'; Fred usually has the ideas and more drive for pranks, while George takes precautions so no one is hurt, and makes sure that the pranks will work. George is actually quite smart, more so than Fred, but Fred never revised (US:studied) for exams, so neither did George; as a result, they both earned three O.W.L.s each.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

*Uncommon disease characterized by hyperplastic synovium, large effusions and bone erosions. 
*Benign lesions involving synovium membrane of joints and tendon sheaths.  Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath of the hand and foot is considered a form of PVNS. 
*Characterized by fibrous stroma, hemosiderin deposition, histiocyte infiltrate and giant cells. 
*Etiology remains unknown but leading theory is that it is an inflammatory reaction of the synovium. 
*Two types of PVNS can occur: localized nodular form (predominantly hands and feet) or a diffuse form of the synovium.

==Clinical Presentation==

*Incidence is approximately 1.8 cases/1 million people per year. 
*No environmental, genetic or occupation predilection. 
*Generally occurs in patients between 20 and 45 years of age. 
*Insidious onset and non-specific presentations make it a diagnostic challenge. 
*Typically monoarticular increased swelling and pain, although there are rare cases of polyarticular involvement.     
*Joint effusion, occasionally a palpable diffuse synovial mass,  and joint stiffness. 
*Approximately 50% report an antecedent history of trauma. 
*Knee is the most commonly affected joint , followed by the hip, ankle, and small joints of hands and feet, shoulder and elbow.      
*Aspiration of the joint yields blood-stained fluid from hemorrhage.  

==Radiologic Findings==

Radiographs may be entirely normal or show minimal and non-specific findings.  

Classic radiographic appearances include bone erosions and single or multiple juxta-articular subchondral &quot;cysts&quot; and are commonly seen on both sides of the joint. 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs1.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


In the hip, bone lesions typically develop at the junction of the femoral head and neck, and acetabulum. Additionally, erosions are more commonly seen than in the knee due to the tight capsule of the hip joint.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs2.jpg]]

[[Image:pvs3.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


In the bones of the hands and feet, where the localized nodular form prevails, the cysts appear as sharply marginated radiolucent defects in multiple bones. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs4.jpg]]    

[[Image:pvs5.jpg]]

[[Image:pvs6.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Giant Cell Tumor of the tendon sheath in the wrist and toe is considered PVNS of the tendon sheath


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs7.jpg]]

[[Image:pvs8.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


MRI is highly sensitive and specific for PVNS.  Characteristic findings include joint effusion, low signal on both T1 and T2, and gradient echo secondary to hemosiderin deposition, hyperplastic synovium, bone erosions and preservation of bone density.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs9.jpg]]

[[Image:pvs9b.jpg]]

[[Image:pvs10.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


On CT, the cystic erosions appear as decreased signal of the marrow.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs11.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Arthrography is another imaging modality that can be used in the diagnosis of PVNS and may show a richly vascular process,increased articular cavity, joint effusion or synovial villae.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pvs12.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Bone scan with Tc Pertechnetate may be useful for detecting inflammation of the synovial membrane.


==Differential Diagnosis==

*Osteoarthritis 
*Rheumatoid Arthritis 
*Gouty Arthritis 
*Psoriatic Arthritis 
*Amyloidosis 
*Tuberculous Arthritis 
*Synovial chondromatosis 
*Synovioma 
*Systemic lupus erythematosus 
*Avascular Necrosis (hip only)

==Treatment==
*Localized form is best treated by local excision of the nodular lesion. 
*Synovectomy with curretage of osseous lesions is performed for diffuse form. 
*Due to relatively high rate of local recurrence, some have advocated adjuvant radiation therapy.

&lt;b&gt;Melorheostosis&lt;/b&gt; is &quot;...a rare bone disorder (of unknown etiology) whose initial manifestations include swelling of joints, pain, and limitation of motion. Eventually profound muscle contractures, tendon and ligament shortening, and soft tissue involvement with severe growth disturbances may ensue. Scoliosis, joint contracture and foot deformities may be seen.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Encyclopaedia of Medical Imaging Volume III:1&lt;/i&gt;).

Melorheostosis usually presents in a sclerotomal distribution.


==Clinical Presentation==

Early clinical findings include joint swelling, limitation of motion and pain. Contractures, ligamentous and tendinous shortening and even soft tissue involvement may ensue.([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=4076865&amp;dopt=Abstract Monomelic melorheostosis of the hand] by Brenner, Wannske).

*Radiographic findings are often limited to a single limb where more than one bone is often involved.  The lower extremity is more often affected than the upper extremity.  The axial skeleton is often spared. 

*The classic finding is that of &quot;peripherally located (cortical) hyperostosis...in one bone or a series of bones.  The appearance of the osseous excrescences extending along the length of the bone simulates that of candle wax flowing down the side of the lit candle&quot;  Resnick:  Bone and Joint Imaging, Second Edition. W.B Saunders Company 1996. 

*The appearance of the lesion(s) gave the anomaly its name, which is &quot;taken from the Greek words for member (melos) and flow (rhein). There is usually a distinct demarcation between the affected and normal bone. Dense, sclerotic linear areas are seen mainly in the cortex but also extending into the cancellous bone.  It may co-exist with osteopoikilosis and osteopathia striata as well as with tumours or malformations of blood vessels or lymphatics. Soft-tissue ossifications at the site of the joint are common.&quot; ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgicmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10555508&amp;dopt=Abstract Bone dysplasia series] by Azouz, Greenspan).

===Other Modalities===

Scintigraphy is positive and shows moderately increased uptake.  Characterization can be accomplished with advanced cross-sectional imaging with Computed Tomography and MRI, but these rarely add value.

The forme fruste of melorheostosis can mimic other pathology such as osteoma, myositis ossificans and parosteal osteosarcoma. 

Treatment includes surgical resection of soft tissue associated lesions and in extreme cases amputation may be necessary

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pathophysiology==

&lt;b&gt;Osteochondral defect (OCD&lt;/b&gt;) (old name = osteochondritis dissecans) may result directly from trauma or secondarily from loss of blood supply to an area of subchondral bone, resulting in avascular necrosis. The overlying cartilage, which is nourished by synovial fluid, remains intact to variable degrees. As the necrotic bone is resorbed, the overlying cartilage looses its support. Without its cartilage cover, the bony fragment may become dislodged into the joint. Although trauma is thought to be the inciting event, a discernable cause is identified in only a minority of cases (21-40%). Repetitive microtrauma is likely the cause of the majority of cases.

==Epidemiology==

Overall incidence of osteochondral defect in the general population is estimated to be 15 to 30 per 100,000 people.  Males are involved 3 times more often than females. Average age at presentation is 10-20 years, but OCD may occur at any age. Involvement is bilateral in 30-40% of cases. 

==Distribution==

&lt;i&gt;The first three are in decreasing order of frequency.&lt;/i&gt;

*&lt;b&gt;Knee (75% of cases)&lt;/b&gt;:  
**Lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle (75%)
**Weight-bearing surface of medial femoral condyle (10%)
**Weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle (10%)
**Anterior intercondylar groove or patella (5%)

*&lt;b&gt;Elbow&lt;/b&gt;: Anterolateral aspect of the capitellum is the most common site in the elbow.

*&lt;b&gt;Ankle&lt;/b&gt;:  4 to 14 times more common in the talus (56% posteromedial, anteromedial 44%) than the tibial plafond. 

*&lt;b&gt;Rare sites&lt;/b&gt;: Tarsal navicular, femoral capital epiphysis, shoulder (humeral head and glenoid), scaphoid.

==Imaging Findings==

===Conventional radiographs===
May be normal. When visible, seen as lucencies in the articular epiphysis (which may have a well-demarcated rim of sclerosis) or loss of sharp cortical line of the articular surface. Plain films cannot adequately evaluate assess articular cartilage and stability.

===Computed tomography===
Island of subchondral bone demarcated by a rarefied zone.

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
All abnormalities on plain film or CT should be evaluated for stability by MRI.  MRI is the most accurate method for staging lesions (short of arthroscopy). 

MRI classification of OCD:
#Marrow edema (stable).
#Articular cartilage is breached. Low-signal rim surrounding fragment indicates fibrous attachment(stable).
#Pockets of fluid around undetached and undisplaced osteochondral fragment (unstable).
#Displaced osteochondral fragment (unstable).

===Arthrography (CT or MR)===
Arthrography provides additional information about size of lesion and can assess stability of lesion and integrity of overlying cartilage.

===Nuclear Medicine===
Nonspecific mild to marked increased uptake in involved bone.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 5&lt;/b&gt; Coronal reformation of CT performed with intra-articular contrast demonstrates no contrast surrounding fragment, suggesting stability.

==Management==
Conservative treatment (low-intensity physical rehabilitation) is recommended for stable (stages I and II) lesions. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve or crepitus (suggesting detachment) develops, then arthroscopy is recommended to evaluate stability of the lesion. Depending on findings at arthroscopy, a loose body may be removed, a fragment may be excised, cartilage may be debrided, or lesion may be drilled to promote revascularization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This section is an academic review of major contributions to consciousness studies. Readers who are interested in the current philosophy of consciousness will find this in Part II and readers interested in the neuroscience of consciousness should refer to Part III.''

The Greeks had no exact equivalent for the term 'consciousness', which has a wide range of meanings in modern usage, but in the thinkers below we find an analysis of phenomenal consciousness and the source of many ideas developed by later Socratics, especially the Stoics, and by Christian thinkers like Augustine.


==Aristotle (c. 350 BC) ''On the Soul''==
(De Anima)
http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Aristotle/De-anima/

[[Image:Aristoteles_Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|Aristotle]]Aristotle, perhaps more than any other ancient Greek philosopher, set the terms of reference for the future discussion of the problem of consciousness.  His idea of the mind is summarised in the illustration below.[[Image:Constudaristotle.png|right]]

Aristotle was a  physicalist, believing that things are embodied in the material universe:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;... That is precisely why the study of the soul [psyche] must fall within the science of Nature, at least so far as in its affections it manifests this double character. Hence a physicist would define an affection of soul differently from a dialectician; the latter would define e.g. anger as the appetite for returning pain for pain, or something like that, while the former would define it as a boiling of the blood or warm substance surround the heart. The latter assigns the material conditions, the former the form or formulable essence; for what he states is the formulable essence of the fact, though for its actual existence there must be embodiment of it in a material such as is described by the other.&quot;(Book I, 403a)&lt;/font&gt;

The works of Aristotle provide our first clear account of the concept of signals and information. He was aware that an event can change the state of matter and this change of state can be transmitted to other locations where it can further change a state of matter:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;If what has colour is placed in immediate contact with the eye, it cannot be seen. Colour sets in movement not the sense organ but what is transparent, e.g. the air, and that, extending continuously from the object to the organ, sets the latter in movement. Democritus misrepresents the facts when he expresses the opinion that if the interspace were empty one could distinctly see an ant on the vault of the sky; that is an impossibility. Seeing is due to an affection or change of what has the perceptive faculty, and it cannot be affected by the seen colour itself; it remains that it must be affected by what comes between. Hence it is indispensable that there be something in between-if there were nothing, so far from seeing with greater distinctness, we should see nothing at all.&quot; (Book II, 419a])&lt;/font&gt;

He was also clear about the relationship of information to 'state':

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into itself the sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived of as taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has, i.e. in what ratio its constituents are combined&quot;(Book II, 424a)&lt;/font&gt;

Aristotle also mentioned the problem of the simultaneity of experience. The explanation predates Galilean and modern physics so lacks our modern language to explain how many things could be at a point and an instant:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;... just as what is called a 'point' is, as being at once one and two, properly said to be divisible, so here, that which discriminates is qua undivided one, and active in a single moment of time, while so far forth as it is divisible it twice over uses the same dot at one and the same time. So far forth then as it takes the limit as two' it discriminates two separate objects with what in a sense is divided: while so far as it takes it as one, it does so with what is one and occupies in its activity a single moment of time. (Book III, 427a)&lt;/font&gt;

He described the problem of recursion that would occur if the mind were due to the flow of material things in space:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;...mind is either without parts or is continuous in some other way than that which characterizes a spatial magnitude. How, indeed, if it were a spatial magnitude, could mind possibly think? Will it think with any one indifferently of its parts? In this case, the 'part' must be understood either in the sense of a spatial magnitude or in the sense of a point (if a point can be called a part of a spatial magnitude). If we accept the latter alternative, the points being infinite in number, obviously the mind can never exhaustively traverse them; if the former, the mind must think the same thing over and over again, indeed an infinite number of times (whereas it is manifestly possible to think a thing once only).&quot;(Book I, 407a)&lt;/font&gt; 

Aristotle explicitly mentions the regress:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;..we must fall into an infinite regress or we must assume a sense which is aware of itself.&quot; (Book III,425b)&lt;/font&gt; 

However, this regress was not as problematic for Aristotle as it is for philosophers who are steeped in nineteenth century ideas. Aristotle was a physicalist who was not burdened with materialism and so was able to escape from the idea that the only possibility for the mind is a flow of material from place to place over a succession of disconnected instants. He was able to propose that subjects and objects are part of the same thing, he notes that thought is both temporally and spatially extended:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;But that which mind thinks and the time in which it thinks are in this case divisible only incidentally and not as such. For in them too there is something indivisible (though, it may be, not isolable) which gives unity to the time and the whole of length; and this is found equally in every continuum whether temporal or spatial.&quot; (Book III,430b)&lt;/font&gt;

This idea of time allowed him to identify thinking with the object of thought, there being no need to cycle thoughts from instant to instant because mental time is extended:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;In every case the mind which is actively thinking is the objects which it thinks.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He considered imagination to be a disturbance of the sense organs:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And because imaginations remain in the organs of sense and resemble sensations, animals in their actions are largely guided by them, some (i.e. the brutes) because of the non-existence in them of mind, others (i.e. men) because of the temporary eclipse in them of mind by feeling or disease or sleep.(Book III, 429a)&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

And considered that all thought occurs as images:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;To the thinking soul images serve as if they were contents of perception (and when it asserts or denies them to be good or bad it avoids or pursues them). That is why the soul never thinks without an image.&quot;(Book III, ).&lt;/font&gt;

Aristotle also described the debate between the cognitive and behaviourist approaches with their overtones of the conflict between modern physicalism and pre twentieth century materialism:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Some thinkers, accepting both premisses, viz. that the soul is both originative of movement and cognitive, have compounded it of both and declared the soul to be a self-moving number.&quot;(Book I, 404b)&lt;/font&gt;

The idea of a 'self-moving number' is not as absurd as it seems, like much of Ancient Greek philosophy.

Aristotle was also clear about there being two forms involved in perception. He proposed that the form and properties of the things that are directly in the mind are incontrovertible but that our inferences about the form and properties of the things in the world that give rise to the things in the mind can be false:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Perception (1) of the special objects of sense is never in error or admits the least possible amount of falsehood. (2) That of the concomitance of the objects concomitant with the sensible qualities comes next: in this case certainly we may be deceived; for while the perception that there is white before us cannot be false, the perception that what is white is this or that may be false. (3) Third comes the perception of the universal attributes which accompany the concomitant objects to which the special sensibles attach (I mean e.g. of movement and magnitude); it is in respect of these that the greatest amount of sense-illusion is possible.&quot;(Book III, 428b)&lt;/font&gt; 

Imagination, according to this model, lays out things in the senses.

==Galen==

The 'physicians' (most especially Galen) incorporated ideas from the Hippocractics and from Plato into a view in which 3 (or more) inner senses--most basically memory, estimation, and imagination--were associated with 3 ventricles in the brain.

''This is a '''stub''' that needs further expansion''.

==Homer (c. 800-900 BC) The ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''==
[http://www.bartleby.com/22/ Odyssey]

[[Image:Homer_Musei_Capitolini_MC559.jpg|thumb|left|Homer]]Panpsychism and panexperientialism can be traced to, at least, Homer's Iliad. Just reading the book allows us to experience what a different focus of consciousness feels like. It is a way of being, being a Homeric Greek, thus distinct from being a modern man. Both states of consciousness result in different ways of experiencing the world.

As we read the Iliad, we are drawn into the book through the images it creates in us and the feelings it evokes in us through the meter and the language. The reader becomes the book. 'The reader became the book, and the summer night was like the conscious being of the book' (Wallace Stevens). That experience of becoming the book, of losing yourself in the book, is the experience of a different aspect of consciousness, being an Homeric Greek.

Homer frequently ascribes even our emotions to the world around us. The ancients do not just fear but fear grips them, for example: &quot;So spake Athene, and pale fear gat hold of them all. The arms flew from their hands in their terror and fell all upon the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice&quot; (Odyssey book XXIV).

The German classicist Bruno Snell, in 'The Discovery of the Mind'  provides us with 'a convincing account of the enormous change in... human personality which took place during the centuries covered by Homer (to) Socrates.'(The London Times Literary Supplement).  Snells book establishes two distinct aspects of consciousness. He says 'The experience of Homer differs from our own'(p.v). 'For Homer, psyche  is the force which keeps the human being alive'(p.8). When the psyche leaves, the owner loses consciousness. The Homeric 'psyche' is where pan-psychism originates. It begins in a conception of consciousness as a force that is separate from the body. Snell compares Homer to the tragedy of Orestes, which focuses on the individual. Homer concentrates on the action(process) and the situation in preference to the agent'(p.211)  Orestes is in a different  state of consciousness, 'a new state of consciousness'(p.211).

[[Image:Plato.png|thumb|left|Plato]]Plato's most interesting contributions to consciousness studies are in book VI of  ''The Republic''.  His idea of the mind is illustrated below.

[[Image:Constudplato.png|right]]

He believes that light activates pre-existing capabilities in the eyes:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to see; color being also present in them, still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colors will be invisible.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

However, it is in the metaphor of '''the divided line''' that Plato introduces a fascinating account of the relationships and properties of things.  He points out that analysis deals in terms of the relationships of pure forms:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on -- the forms which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind?&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Notice how he introduces the notion of a mind's eye observing mental content arranged as geometrical forms. He proposes that through this mode of ideas we gain understanding:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term understanding, and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and reason.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

However, the understanding can also contemplate knowledge:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;..I understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon them, although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Plato's work is not usually discussed in this way but is extended to universals such as the idea of the colour red as a universal that can be applied to many specific instances of things.

In &quot;Plato's Cave&quot; (Book VII) Plato describes how experience could be some transfer from or copy of real things rather than the things themselves:

[[Image:Plato's_allegory_of_the_cave.jpg|thumb|right|Plato's Cave]]&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened: — Behold! human beings living in a underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;I see.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others silent.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Yes, he said.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Very true.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;No question, he replied.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;That is certain.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And now look again, and see what will naturally follow it, the prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, — what will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them, — will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This early intuition of information theory predates Aristotle's concept of the transfer of states from one place to another.

==Parmenides (c. 480 BC) ''On Nature'' ==

==Siddhartha Gautama (c. 500 BC) Buddhist Texts ==

[[Image:BuddhaHead.JPG|left|thumb|Buddha]]Siddhartha Gautama was born about 563BC. He became known as 'Buddha' ('the awakened one') from the age of about thirty five. Buddha handed down a way of life that might lead, eventually, to an enlightened state called Nirvana.  In the three centuries after his death Buddhism split into two factions, the Mahayana (greater raft or vehicle) and the Theravada (the way of the elders). The Mahayana use the slightly derogatory term Hinayana (lesser raft or vehicle) for Theravada Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism gave rise to other sects such as Zen Buddhism in Japan and Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet. Mahayana Buddhism is more like a religion, complete with god like entities whereas Theravada Buddhism is more like a philosophy.

Theravada Buddhist meditation is described in books called the Pali Canon which contains the 'Vinayas' that describe monastic life, the 'Suttas' which are the central teachings of Theravada Buddhism and the 'Abhidhamma' which is an analysis of the other two parts or 'pitakas'. Two meditational systems are described: the development of serenity (samathabhavana) and the development of insight (vipassanabhavana). The two systems are complementary, serenity meditation providing a steady foundation for the development of insight. As meditation proceeds the practitioner passes through a series of stages called 'jhanas'. There are four of these stages of meditation and then a final stage known as the stage of the 'immaterial jhanas'.

'''The Jhanas'''

The first jhana is a stage of preparation where the meditator rids themselves of the hindrances (sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt). This is best achieved by seclusion. During the process of getting rid of the hindrances the meditator develops the five factors: applied thought, sustained thought, rapture, happiness and one-pointedness of mind. This is done by concentrating on a practice object until it can be easily visualised. Eventually the meditator experiences a luminous replica of the object called the counterpart sign (patibhaganimitta).

Applied thought involves examining, visualising and thinking about the object. Sustained thought involves always returning to the object, not drifting away from it. Rapture involves a oneness with the object and is an ecstacy that helps absorption with and in the object. Happiness is the feeling of happiness that everyone has when something good happens (unlike rapture, which is a oneness with the object of contemplation). One-pointedness of mind is the ability to focus on a single thing without being distracted.

The second jhana involves attaining the first without effort, there is no need for applied or sustained thought, only rapture, happiness and one-pointedness of mind remain. The second jhana is achieved by contemplating the first jhana. The second jhana is a stage of effortless concentration.

The third jhana involves mindfulness and discernment. The mindfulness allows an object of meditation to be held effortlessly in the mind. The discernment consists of discerning the nature of the object without delusion and hence avoiding rapture.

In the fourth jhana mindfulness is maintained but the delusion of happiness is contemplated. Eventually mindfulness remains without pleasure or pain. In the fourth jhana the meditator achieves &quot;purity of mindfulness due to equanimity&quot; (upekkhasatiparisuddhi).

'''The Immaterial Jhanas'''

The first four jhanas will be familiar from earlier, Hindu meditational techniques. Once the fourth jhana has been achieved the meditator can embark on the immaterial jhanas. There are four immaterial jhanas: the base of boundless space, the base of boundless consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

The base of boundless space is achieved by meditating on the absence of the meditation object. It is realised that the space occupied by the object is boundless and that the mind too is boundless space. The base of boundless consciousness involves a realisation that the boundless space is boundless consciousness. The base of nothingness is a realisation that the present does not exist, the meditator should &quot;give attention to the present non-existence, voidness, secluded aspect of that same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space&quot; (Gunaratana 1988). The base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is a realisation that nothing is perceived in the void.

In Theravada Buddhism the attainment of the fourth jhana and its immaterial jhanas represents a mastery of serenity meditation. This is a foundation for insight meditation.

Buddhism is very practical and eschews delusions. It is realised that serenity meditation is a state of mind, a steady foundation that might, nowadays be called a physiological state. It is through insight meditation where the practitioner becomes a philosopher that enlightenment is obtained.

==What is Basting?==
Basting is a method where you use a liquid to moisten food, particularly meat, while you are cooking it. This liquid could be anything from pan dripping, to melted fat or any other liquid. Doing this keeps the meat or other food moist and can improve the color or flavor of the food which you are cooking.

==How to Baste?==
It is actually quite simple you can use which ever tool you may have in your kitchen ranging from a simple spoon to a [[Cookbook:Baster|baster]]. You then simply scoop up which ever liquid you are choosing to use and pour it over the top of the meat, etc., during the cooking process to ensure a great result with both color and flavour.</text>

'''Caramelization''' is when a sugar, such as sucrose or starches, chemically splits and changes to a golden, amber, deep brown, or charred color. This term is often used interchangably with the Maillard reaction, but in reality, they are quite different. A well-known use is to create a sugar crust on Creme Brulees that creates a pleasing texture differential.</text>

==Meaning==
The chopping technique is used in the cutting up of a food item when no specific shape is required. Chopping may be coarse or fine in which case it should be specified in the recipe - ''coarsely chopped'',  ''finely chopped'', etc. 
==How to==
To chop parsley, for example, grip the handle of a chef's knife. Pinch the part of the blade closest to the handle.  With your other hand, if you are chopping something like a chiffonade, hold the target food steady. If doing something like nuts, place your palm in the middle of the blunt end. Rock the knife up and down rapidly, keeping the tip on the work surface, and gradually move the blade sideways over the food item on the chopping board. In order to ensure that all of the product is properly chopped, rearrange the pile from time to time if you are doing nuts or vegetables and continue until you have reached the desired degree of fineness.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Uncle G's 'bot. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Uncle G's 'bot~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I am the [[Wiktionary:robot|'bot]] account under which all of [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]]'s automated and semi-automated editing tools run.

I am not currently flagged as a 'bot.  All of my edits are intentionally subject to the usual scrutiny of edits made by pseudonymous users.

The tools are written in [[w:C Plus Plus|C++]], [[w:cmd.exe|cmd.exe]] script, and [[w:REXX|REXX]].  No, they are not currently available to others.  

== Editing tools in development ==
These are the tools currently in development.  They are not in active production use.  Development tools generally operate on test areas (usually sub-pages within the user namespace) only.
== Editing tools in production use ==
These are the tools currently in production use.  Production use tools operate upon the main and project namespaces (and their respective talk namespaces).  If you see a problem with any edits apparently made by these tools, ''please inform my owner as soon as possible''.
=== TRANSWIKI.exe ===
TRANSWIKI is a [[Wiktionary:semi-automatic|semi-automatic]] tool for performing transwikification between arbitrary wikis, where the various source and destination server, page, and transwiki log names are supplied as arguments.
=== MOVE-TO-WIKIBOOKS.btm ===
MOVE-TO-WIKIBOOKS is a wrapper script around TRANSWIKI.exe that fills in most of the arguments for the specific case of transwikification from Wikipedia to Wikibooks.

=== SANDBOT ===
SANDBOT is a bot that regularly, and thanklessly cleans out the sandbox.

Microprocessors do a lot of things, but before buying one it is very important to ensure it will be the right one for the specific application(s) in which it will be used. Compare with [[CACS:Glossary/Computer|Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). There is an urgent need to ensure that sufficient information about usage and instructions are available.

==An example==
Reference: &quot;Commodore 64 Personal Computer Programmer's Reference Guide&quot; published in 1982 by Commodore Business Machines, Inc. There is a detailed description of that computer's &quot;brain&quot;, the 6510 microprocessor chip's specifications, starting at page 402. This microprocessor looks like an insect with a rectangular body, and 20 legs on each of two sides of that body. 
* The power supply should normally be close to 5 volts DC, although the absolute maximum voltage range is minus 0.3 to plus 7.0 Volts, with about 125 milliamps (mA) normally used.
* A 2-phase non-overlapping clock signal is required as well, also at about 5 Volt.
* There are 16 connections to the address bus, and an address can therefore be any number between 0 and 65535 (=2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;minus 1)
* The data bus has 8 connections, so that any address can have any number between 0 and 255 (=2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;minus 1) in it.
* A part of the external [[Electronics/RAM and ROM|memory]] can be used as a set of instructions, the rest being available for data; there is a lot that this microprocessor can do.
* For example, feeding in the instruction 169 followed by 123 will put the number 123 into a small memory (address 780) called the Accumulator; this is called &quot;Accumulator addressing&quot;. There are also &quot;Immediate addressing&quot;, &quot;Absolute addressing&quot;, &quot;Zero page addressing&quot;, &quot;Indexed zero page addressing&quot;, &quot;Indexed absolute addressing&quot;, &quot;Implied addressing&quot;,&quot;Relative addressing&quot;, &quot;Indexed indirect addressing&quot;, &quot;Indirect indexed addressing&quot;, and &quot;Absolute indirect&quot;.
* Various kinds of calculations are possible, some of them quite involved, using proper software. This microprocessor can be used also in very many other applications.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Voxel-Based Morphometry'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

== Criticisms of VBM ==
There are many criticisms that can be made of VBM.  In particular, the accuracy of the spatial normalisation used by SPM is an issue that upsets many people.  Spatial normalisation in SPM uses only about 1000 parameters, and only fits the overall brain shapes.  It is unable to warp one brain so that it exactly matches another.  In order to compensate for this inaccuracy, the data are smoothed, where the amount of smoothing should partially depend on the accuracy of the inter-subject registration.  There are many ways of assessing the &quot;accuracy&quot; of spatial normalisation.  One approach is to look at the amount of overlap among the different tissue classes.  What this shows is that e.g. grey matter is matched with grey matter.  It does not indicate that e.g. the various sulci of the different subjects are in alignment.  For example, with a registration model that has too much freedom, a sulcus of one subject could be warped so that it appears to becomes a different sulcus of another subject. For the purpose of comparing brain images with mass-univariate statistics, the objective of spatial normalisation should not be about making the brains of different subjects appear identical, but should be about bringing homologous regions as closely into alignment as possible.  There is indication that models with too much freedom can be worse than models with less freedom.  For example, the evaluations of Hellier et al, whereby registration accuracy of different approaches are compared indicated that the spatial normalisation of SPM2 was as accurate as that of any of the other methods.  The average distances between registered sulci were 9.9, 10.3, 11.5, 10.7 and 10.8mm for other methods.  The average distance obtained by the simplistic approach in SPM2 was 8.7mm.  Obviously, there is still plenty of scope for improvement, but for an almost fully automated approach, it does not do too badly.  There are many inter-subject registration, and tissue segmentation programs out there.  These can also be used for preprocessing if the functions within SPM are found wanting.  In particular, surface based approaches may prove to be superior.

Another criticism is that shape is multivariate, so any kind of morphometry should be based on multivariate statistics, rather than mass-univariate tests.  I (John Ashburner) largely agree with this.  Unfortunately, the results of multivariate analyses can not be communicated quite so easily among the brain imaging community - especially if the results are limited to the 2D pictures required by papers.  The community wants to localise a limited number of discrete volumetric differences (rather than have a full characterisation of the differences).

Another one is that different ways of doing an analysis give different results.  The reason for this is that a different analysis is asking a different question, to which the answer is likely to be different.  In particular, the choice of &quot;global normalisation&quot; method will dramatically change the resulting pattern of blobs.  Note also that different preprocessing will also give different results.  The most &quot;accurate&quot; preprocessing will give the most accurate interpretations of the results and the most sensitivity.  Less accurate preprocessing will give less accurate interpretations. The fact that different registration or segmentation algorithms produce different results is exactly analagous to the fact that the use of different landmarks give different results for other kinds of morphometric analyses.  Registration can never be perfect, so some spurious volumetric differences will be found.  If one averages over larger regions (i.e. smoothes using a larger FWHM), then the effect of misregistration is reduced.  It is therefore possible to be confident that any differences are really volumetric.  If the arguments against VBM were taken seriously, then all manual volumetric analyses are wrong because structures can never be outlined with 100% accuracy.

The non-stationary residual variance from the t-tests is also a problem for interpreting results.  This causes blobs to move towards brain regions with low residual variance, and away from regions with high residual variance; [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/matthias.reimold/mascoi/ MASCOI] may help with this problem. Many people see significant differences outside the brain because the residual variance approaches zero as one moves towards regions without any grey matter; this is one motivation for using some kind of mask (the other is to reduce the severity of the multiple-testing problem).  Ask your local statistician for further explanations.

== Interpreting Results ==
The most general interpretation is that there is a significant difference in intensities in the preprocessed images in this region.  The hard bit is to determine what may have caused these differences. The two possible explanations are:

1) The structure is smaller in one group than the other.

2) There is some other significant difference between the anatomies of the groups that shows up in the analysis in this region.  There are loads of possibilities here.

Generally, we hope that the pre-processing has sensitised the tests to the
first explanation, but other causes can never be discounted.  e.g. one group
has bigger ventricles, which will systematically influence spatial
normalisation.  Another possibility is that there is a contrast difference,
and maybe the structure shows up better (and is therefore better segmented as
grey matter) in one group rather than the other.

The t statistic is proportional to the difference between the groups, divided
by the square root of the residual variability.  If there is the same
volumetric difference, but more variability in the grey matter, then the
statstics in the grey matter will be less significant.  There are also likely
to be issues relating to estimated residual smoothness.  If the residuals are
more smooth, then the correction is less severe so the corrected stats are
more significant.

The statistics are more sensitive further away from regions of greater
variability.  In VBM, this means a tendancy for the most significant
difference to be shifted away from the centre of a structure.

The contrast  images (con_*.img)  that are estimated with VBM are the same as
if you took the unsmoothed preprocessed data, made a difference image, and
then smoothed this difference image.  The initial difference is mostly at the
edges, but is blurred (by the smoothing) so that it covers a larger region.

== &quot;Modulation&quot; ==
Spatial normalisation expands and contracts some brain regions.  Modulation
involves scaling by the amount of contraction, so that the total amount of
grey matter in the modulated GM remains the same as it would be in the
original images.

If you take the limiting case of extremely precise (not necessarily extremely accurate) registration and segmentation, the pre-processed concentration images are likely to be all identical.  An analysis of these data would not show you anything.  I therefore tend to
interpret unmodulated data as a representation of registration error, rather than an attempt to preprocess the data in order to sensitise the t tests to more meaningful volumetric differences.

Shapes are multivariate.  The volume of one structure is likely to be related
to that of another.  For example, smaller brains may have smaller putamen.
If you include &quot;globals&quot; in the model by proportional scaling, then this
could be accounted for.  Similarly, the size of a putamen may, or may not,
correlate with the size of surrounding structures.  A modulated analysis
attempts to correct the volumes for regional expansion/shrinkage during
spatial normalisation.  An unmodulated analysis would really be comparing
volumes after scaling out the volume changes in neighbouring regions.  The
definition of a neighbouring region is vague, and is dependent on the
precision of the spatial normalisation.

For example, consider that spatial normalisation is able to register only to
the resolution of the temporal lobe, and everything in this brain region
expands or contracts by roughly the same amount.  If one group has hippocampi
that are large w.r.t. the volume of the temporal lobe, then this procedure
would be more sensitive to such differences.  Unfortunately, it is not
straightforward to say exactly what the scale of the spatial normalisation
is, so the results of such an analysis are a little bit arbitrary.

== VBM in Practice ==

'''Basics'''

Start MATLAB, make sure SPM is in your path (e.g. run pathtool and add the SPM directory), and type ''spm pet'' to get the GUI up.

=== Unified Segmentation in SPM5 ===

'''Preliminaries'''

(EDITORS: add stuff about DICOM import?)

First ensure that your images are reasonably well aligned with the template: click ''Check Reg'', go to the ''SPM5/templates/'' directory and choose  ''T1.nii'' then go to the directory with your dataset and select the images. If they are not approximately in registration, then you will need to use the ''Display'' button and then adjust the values (''up'', ''pitch'', etc.) then click ''Reorient'' and reselect the image(s).

'''Segmentation'''

Clicking the ''Segment'' button will bring up a page of options; you must select your files (under ''Data''), and you will probably want to change the ''Output Files'' options. Unless you have reason to do otherwise (these notes are meant for beginners!) select ''modulated normalised'' for the tissues that you are interested in, don't save bias corrected, and don't do cleanup. Leave all the ''Custom'' options as they are. You can now save the job (as a .mat file) if you want, and/or click ''Run'' to segment the images. As a '''very''' rough estimate, allow 30 minutes per image.

'''Smoothing'''

Click ''Smooth'', select the images (Modulated normalised/Warped tissue Class images are prefixed with ''mwc''), leave the ''data type'' option as ''same'', and choose the smoothing width. This is a difficult decision... commonly used widths are 8 to 12 mm, you may have to experiment to decide what works best for your scans/subjects, though there is an argument that the kernel width should match the expected size of the difference for which you wish to search. Unless you have very good reasons to do otherwise enter the same number three times, since you normally wish to smooth equally in all directions (i.e. with an isotropic kernel).

'''Statistics'''

This is hard to give a short introduction to, since it very much depends on your experiment, but to give a very simple example of an unpaired two-group t-test: click ''Basic Models'' near the top-left of the GUI, then choose the two-sample t-test factorial design. Enter the scans, and enter any covariates that you want (e.g. age, Total Intracranial Volume, etc. See [[#Obtaining Covariates]] below). Now for masking... it's probably best, if this is your first attempt at VBM, to select ''absolute threshold masking'' and enter a value of 0.05. Rather like smoothing though, exactly what masking to use is a somewhat difficult decision. Set the output ''Directory'' where you want the results to be written. It's probably best to leave the other options alone on a first attempt, though maybe check the [[#Globals]] section below...

Click ''Run'', check the design matrix that appears, and then click ''Estimate'' on the left, and choose the SPM.mat file in the directory you just chose for output. Then click ''Results'', and choose this file again.

Now you need to worry about the general linear model contrasts, which can be quite a complicated area. For a simple unpaired two-group t-test with no covariates, a t-contrast of [-1 1] will give a right-tailed (group2 &gt; group1) t-test; [1 -1] will give a left-tailed (group1 &gt; group2) t-test, and an F-contrast of either [-1 1] or [1 -1] will give an F-test (group2 &lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt; group1) equivalent to a two-tailed t-test.

After defining and choosing your contrast, you'll then be asked about masking it with others (say no, unless you know you want this kind of analysis). Next you'll be asked about how to correct/adjust for multiple comparisons. If you have no idea, I'd select FDR, and leave the default of 0.05; better still, read the Genovese and Nichols articles on FWE and [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/FDR/ FDR]. You should then be presented with the standard Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) plot of the significant regions. Clicking one of the ''p-values'' buttons on the left (probably want ''volume'') will produce a table of results, while selecting ''overlays... sections'' and choosing e.g. the T1 template will allow you to move around in the brain viewing the significant areas.

=== Optimised VBM in SPM2 and SPM99 ===
This is not necessary for SPM5 because the Segment button should do everything in a single unified model.  &quot;Optimised VBM&quot; was a half-baked procedure invented in about 10 minutes in order to provide a quick short term solution for improving the spatial normalisation in SPM.  It does improve the spatial normalisation though, and should also give better inter-subject registration (and therefore better results) for fMRI data.
If you want to do ''optimised VBM'' in SPM2 or SPM99, then the procedure is:

'''Segment the original images'''

This involves an implicit registration of a template to the image. The
transformation that is estimated here is used to overlay the prior
probability maps, which assist the segmentation.  Before doing this step,
you may need to reorient the images via Display.  This is so that the affine
registration has better starting estimates.  A search for the keywords ''reorient Display''
at [[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?S1=spm]] will give you all the hints
about this that you need.


'''Clean up the grey matter.'''

This is only for SPM99.  In SPM2, this procedure is combined with the
segmentation.  The seg1 and seg2 images are entered into the program, and
the result is a brain_*.img, which has values of 1 for brain, and 0 for
non-brain.  The resulting brain_*.img is used to remove a few misclassified
voxels from the *_seg1.img file.  This is done using ImCalc, selecting the
seg1_, seg2_, seg3_, abd brain_ images, entering an output filename, and the
following expression:

        ''i1.*i4./(i1+i2+i3+eps)''


'''Estimate warps from the GM.'''

The reason for the first segmentation and cleanup is so that a set of
spatial normalisation parameters can be estimated by matching GM with
GM.  In SPM99, you would disable 'Mask brain when registering?', and
set the resolution for the spatially normalised images to be higher than
the current defaults. The template would be an image of grey mater, which
could be the one in the apriori directory, or it could be a &quot;custom&quot;
made template.

Apply these warps to the original T1 image.  This gives you a spatially
normalised T1 image, which should have a resolution of about 1mm isotropic.
The original *_seg* and brain_* images could be deleted at this stage.


'''Segment the spatially normalised T1.'''

Tell the segmentation routine that the image is spatially normalised, so
no affine registration is done.


'''Clean up the grey matter.'''

The same as above (only for SPM99).


'''Modulate'''

Spatial normalisation expands and contracts some brain regions.  Modulation
involves scaling by the amount of contraction, so that the total amount of
grey matter in the modulated GM remains the same as it would be in the
original images.

'''Smooth.'''

Best if you do this by about 12mm.


'''Stats.'''

The whole idea behind the pre-processing is that the t-tests are sensitised
to volumetric differences in the GM.  Remember that your results could reflect
other differences among the images.

== Custom Templates ==
Spatial normalisation in versions of SPM prior to SPM5 required templates that had similar contrasts to the image to be matched with them.  The reason for this is that the objective function is based on the mean squared difference between the images.  This only makes sense if the intensities of the different tissue types correspond between the images (with an additional scaling factor that is estimated, which rescales the overall intensities).  In SPM5, the segment button allows spatial normalisation to be achieved using a different objective function, which does not rely on a simple relationship between the intensities of a pair of images.  For full details about the mechanism, I would suggest taking a look at Ashburner &amp; Friston. ''Unified segmentation''.
NeuroImage '''26'''(3):839-851 (2005).

The idea is that the segmentation of SPM5 warps a set of tissue probability maps so that they overlay on to the image to segment.  After warping, these will represent (part of) the prior probability of each voxel belonging to a particular class.

Ideally, these tissue probability maps should represent the prior probabilities for the population under investigation, and are made by averaging a large number of spatially normalised tissue class images of different subjects (wc*.img).  I suspect that if you don't have a large number of subjects, then the tissue probability maps released with SPM5 would be more representative than an average made up of only about 20 subjects.

== Globals ==

The mass univariate testing approach assumes that all voxels in an image are
independent (apart from the GRF correction part).  The use of &quot;globals&quot; is a
compromise in order to model dependencies between each voxel and some global
measure.

Most people who study shape use a multi-variate framework.  Shape is based
on the relationship between the positions of corresponding features, after
accounting for size, position and orientation.  Unfortunately, we do not
have enough subjects to do a full multi-variate analysis, so we restrict our
analyses to being mass-univariate, and possibly use a &quot;global&quot; as a confound,
or use some kind of proportional scaling.  We attempt to answer a more
clinically interesting question by limiting our investigation to identifying
regions of increased or decreased GM.

&quot;Globals&quot; are a compromise (fudge) that is needed to introduce some
kind of multi-variateness into the analysis.  People generally want to see a
map of significant blobs, so a mass-univariate approach (SPM) is usually
adopted.  In reality, shape (and hence relative volumes) is really
multivariate.  The volume of one structure is related to the volume of
another.  Bigger brains may (on average) have bigger hippocampi.  Brains with
globally thicker grey matter are more likely to have grey matter that is
thicker at a particular sulcus.  Also, brains where the segmentation (for
some reason) overestimates the amount of grey matter, are also likely to
appear to have more grey at a particular region.

Unfortunately, this multi-variateness is not a simple linear relationship. For
example, bigger brains are likely to have proportionally more white matter
than grey.  For brains that are globally different, it becomes very difficult
to interpret exactly what the differences mean in a mass univariate way.  Basically, it is not clear what to use as globals for any particular
experiment.  This will depend on what theory you have about your subjects.

Proportional scaling converts volumes into values that are a proportion of
total brain/GM volume.  For example, you may be able to say that a region
around some point contains 3% of the total GM volume.  If you are interested in
differences in such measures, then a proportional scaling model may be
preferable.  Alternatively, if you want to localise regions where the trends
in GM volume differ from the total GM volume, then an ANCOVA model may be
preferable.

Using no &quot;globals&quot; and a &quot;modulated&quot; analysis is intended to show regions
of absolute volumetric difference in grey matter. Using total grey matter as a confound will show regions of absolute difference
that can not be explained by the total grey matter differences.


You can include additional columns in your design matrix that model various
effects of no interest (e.g. an ANCOVA correction for some global measure).
This allows you to localise differences that can not be explained by these
uninteresting effects.

For example, in a group comparison, one group's brains may be bigger than
those of the other group.  In a situation like this, you may only be
interested in patterns of volumetric differences that differ from those of
the total brain size.


Using proportional scaling to total grey matter will show differences where
a region contains a disproportionately large or small region of total grey
matter.  For example, a structure may normally represent 2% of the total
brain grey matter, but in patients it may represent 1.5%.

The males versus females test is a tricky one.  Human males are generally
bigger than females, with bigger heads.  If you were doing an analysis of nose
sizes, then it is likely that males would have bigger noses. Maybe you would
want to know if this extra size was still significant if total head size was
taken into account, either by modelling head size as a covariate, or by
proportionally scaling the noses such that they were rendered proportional to
the total head size (giving us a measure of nose as a percentage of head volume).

Normally, a brain with e.g twice the volume of another brain will not have
twice as much grey matter.  The relationship between grey and white-matter
volume approximately obeys a power law, with a 4/3 exponent (Zhang &amp;
Sejnowski, PNAS 97(10):5621-5626, 2000).  If we use a proportional scaling
model based on whole brain volume, our null hypothesis is that grey matter
volume varies linearly with brain volume.  This is simply not true, although
it may serve as a useful first approximation.

The choice of model is up to the investigator, and it really does depend what
you want to test.  I would really rather not be give any firm recommendations.
When a VBM experiment is written up, the model should be accurately described.
Different models will give different results, which may appear to conflict
with each other.

In the case of dementia, the total intra-cranial volume is often used to
proportionally scale the data.  Thus, each structure/region is treated as
a proportion of intra-cranial volume.  Head sizes vary, so this normalisation
should reduce the residual variance from the model.

== Obtaining Covariates ==

'''Globals (total segmented tissue volumes)'''

''spm_global'' is not a good way of computing &quot;globals&quot; for VBM, as it was intended to compute a kind of average brain intensity by excluding &quot;non-brain&quot; voxels (with the assumption that these are below a certain fraction of the pre-exclusion mean), and computing the mean of what is left.

The function ''spm_get_volumes'' can be used to integrate over tissue segmentations, returning volumes in litres. The differences between native space (''c''), DARTEL-Imported (''rc''), '''modulated''' normalised (''mwc'') and smoothed modulated normalised (''smwc'') segmentation volumes are usually very small. The main difference is the amount of the spinal cord included in the white matter segment, which depends on the field of view of the images. Manual segmentation protocols (e.g. as in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559495 Whitwell et al., 2001]) often set an arbitrary cut-off, such as the most inferior slice (in MNI space) that includes cerebellum; this is perhaps closest to the results of ''mwc'' or ''smwc'' images.

'''Total Intracranial Volume'''

To get TIV, one option is to sum the volumes of GM, WM and CSF, for example using ''spm_get_volumes'' on each tissue class and then adding these results. Use of this approach with the ''mwc'' segments from the New Segmentation Toolbox in SPM8 performs very well compared to manual or other automatic measurements ([http://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260%2811%2900238-X/fulltext Ridgway et al., 2011]).

'''Other covariates e.g. from spreadsheets/textfiles'''

You can specify any variables in the MATLAB workspace as covariates. If you have covariates in a text-file you can read this into MATLAB first, e.g. using ''textscan'' or ''textread''. One approach for importing from spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft Excel) is to use the program to save as ''.csv'' (comma-separated values) and then to use MATLAB's ''csvread'' to get variables from the CSV file.

== Data from different scanners ==
You can generally model out the effect of using different scanners or scan sequences by modelling confounding effects in the design matrix.  Note that if you are doing a comparison of one group versus another, where one group is collected on one scanner, and the other group is collected on another, then modelling out the scanner effect will also model out the difference between your groups. See Stonnington et al. 2008 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.066]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../First Order|First Order Differential Equations]]

First-order differential equations basically relate an ''x'' value, a ''y'' value and a gradient, ''y''' at the point (''x,y''). As there are 3 variables, it is impossible to represent the solution to a DE in a 2D form. However, we can draw diagrams in 2 dimensions to represent the solutions by eliminating one of the variables.

There are two main ways of doing this, slope fields, described below, and [[../Isoclines 1|isoclines]], which are related to slope fields.

== Slope Fields ==

A slope field is a set of sections of tangents to solutions of the DE arranged over the ''xy'' plane. It attempts to show the solutions of a DE not by showing one or more solutions, but by showing a ''representation'' of all solutions across the ''xy'' plane.

The gradient of a (straight) line is defined as the change in ''y'' divided by the change in ''x''. By setting the change in ''x'' to 1, we have the change in ''y'' equal to the gradient, which is ''y''&amp;#39;, the subject of the DE. Some rearrangement may be required to get the DE in to the required form, ''i.e.''

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we draw a line at a point P(''xy''), with the ''x'' component equal to 1, and the ''y'' component equal to ''y''&amp;#39; at that point, we have part of the tangent to the solution passing through that point. The solutions to the DE will follow these lines' slopes.

By drawing these lines at intervals across the ''xy'' plane, we can get a good idea of what the solutions to the DE look like. Notice that at no point did we have to actually solve the DE, we just plug in the values of ''x'' and ''y'', at the points and we have slope field. This is especially useful when the DE is not solvable, for example

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x^x.&lt;/math&gt;

Despite being theoretically easy to evaluate, slope fields are difficult to do without a computer, as even a small slope field has hundreds of lines, and the plotting of these is not practical by hand (even if possible). Often, the tangent sections are scaled for clarity so that they do not interfere with each other.

===Example 1: ''y''&amp;#39;=''1''===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:315px;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Slope_Field_1.svg|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 1: Slope field of y'=1]]
[[image:Slope_Field_1b.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 2: Some solutions of y'=1]]
&lt;/div&gt;
Consider the DE

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

This is probably the simplest DE there is (other than ''y''&amp;#39;=0). It simply states that the gradient of the solution is always 1. This clearly leads to the general solution

::&lt;math&gt;y=x+C, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where C is our constant of integration.

The slope field of this DE (right) is composed of lines with an ''x'' component of 1 and a ''y'' component of ''y''&amp;#39;, ''i.e.'' 1, spaced across the ''xy'' plane. The solutions to this DE, such as

::&lt;math&gt;y=x\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
::&lt;math&gt;y=x+1\,&lt;/math&gt;

clearly follow the slope field. Some solutions are shown in Fig 2, and the similarities can readily be seen.

Notice that the solutions do not necessarily touch any of the lines in the slope field. These lines are only a subset of the infinite number of possible tangents that could be drawn to the infinite number of solutions.

If the DE was

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=k,&lt;/math&gt;

then the gradient of the slope field would be ''k'', as would the gradient of the solutions.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===Example 2: ''y''&amp;#39;=''x''===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:315px;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Slope_Field_2.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 3: Slope field of y'=x]]
[[image:Slope_Field_2b.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 4: Slope field and some solutions of y'=x]]
&lt;/div&gt;
This slope field will be more complex, as the gradient of the tangent sections will vary, depending on where the section is along the ''x''-axis. The ''x'' component of the lines is still 1, but the ''y'' component is now ''x'', making the gradient more positive the higher ''x'' gets, and more negative the lower ''x'' gets.

The solution to the DE

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x&lt;/math&gt;

is

::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{2}x^2+c&lt;/math&gt;

A set of these solutions is drawn along with the slope field in Fig. 4 to show how the two relate.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===Example 3: ''y''&amp;#39;=sin ''x''===

This is the last example of a DE where the derivative is equal to a function of ''x'' only. The DE is

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\sin x&lt;/math&gt;

The slope field is shown in Fig. 5 below.

[[image:Slope_Field_3.png|thumb|center|500px|Fig.5: Slope field of y'=sin x]]

The solution to the DE is

::&lt;math&gt;y=-\cos x + C \,&lt;/math&gt;

and a set of solutions overlaid on the slope field looks like this:

[[image:Slope_Field_3b.png|thumb|center|500px|Fig.6: Slope field of y'=sin x overlaid with some solutions]]

===Example 4: ''y''&amp;#39;=''y''===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:315px;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Slope_Field_4.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 7: Slope field of y'=y]]
[[image:Slope_Field_4b.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 8: Slope field and some solutions of y'=y]]
&lt;/div&gt;
Now we come to the trickier problem of DE where the derivative is related to the dependent function, ''y''. The easiest one is when ''y''(''x'') is constant, but this has already been covered, as it is the same as ''x'' being constant (see Example 1).

In the slope field, the ''x'' component of the lines remains 1, but the ''y'' component is equal to ''y''. A common mistake is to assume that because the gradient is a function of ''y'', the ''y'' component is set to 1. However, this will mean that the lines no longer represent the gradient as defined by &amp;Delta;''y''/&amp;Delta;''x''.

The inclination of the lines will increase as ''y'' becomes greater, but will not change if ''x'' changes. The slope field looks like Fig. 7.

The solution is as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=y&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{y}dy=\int 1 dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ln y=x +C \, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=Ce^x \,&lt;/math&gt;

This makes sense as the exponential function is the only function not to change when differentiated or integrated. Fig.  8 shows some solutions superimposed on the slope field.

This is a good example of where a slope field can be slightly misleading. The even spacing of the field (an artificial property, as the points with lines are chosen on an evenly spaced grid) does not convey the fact that as C increases linearly (as they do in Fig. 8), the solutions get further and further apart. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===Example 5:  ''y''&amp;#39; =  sin ''y''===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:315px;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Slope_Field_5.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 9: Slope field of v'=-0.01v+sin y]]
[[image:Slope_Field_5b.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 10: Slope field and some solutions of v'=-0.01v+sin y]]
&lt;/div&gt;
This is a difficult integration to do (I used a computer), but the slope field is still easy to draw: the ''y'' component of each line depends on the sine of the ''y'' value. This repeats every 2''&amp;pi;'' units up the ''y'' axis, but between ''&amp;pi;'' and -''&amp;pi;'', the slope field looks like Fig. 9.

The general solution to

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\sin y&lt;/math&gt;

is

::&lt;math&gt;y=\pm 2 \arccot e^{-x-C}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, even though I didn't actually do the DE myself, and I have no idea if it is correct or not, I can compare it to the slope field, as in Fig. 10. This high degree of agreement between the two strongly suggests that the solution to the DE is correct. This is a very useful way of checking a result if you have access to a computer or a good graphing calculator.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

===Example 6: ''y''&amp;#39;=''xy''===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:315px;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Slope_Field_6.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 11: Slope field of y'=xy]]
[[image:Slope_Field_6b.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 12: Slope field and some solutions of y'=xy]]
&lt;/div&gt;
This is the last example of an slope field that I will do, and it involves a derivative related to both x and y:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=xy.&lt;/math&gt;

The slope field looks like Fig. 11, and the ''x'' components of the lines are still all 1, despite, the presence of both ''x'' and ''y'' in the DE. This will never change.

The slope field along with its solutions is shown in Fig. 12.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

The next method of graphing First-Order DEs is using [[../Isoclines 1|isoclines]], which have a significant relationship with slope fields.

::&lt;big&gt;Next: [[../Isoclines 1|Isoclines]]&lt;/big&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Return to Exponential Growth ==

Remember the population growth problem, where &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=(B-D)P&lt;/math&gt;?  Now that we can solve linear equations, we can also solve variations where a factor &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is added in.  The new equation is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=(B-D)P+f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and can be solved by the linear methods taught in the last section.

=== Immigration ===

Lets say that 1000 people move into a city, in addition to the normal population growth.  This can be interpreted by making &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1000&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us a linear differential equation to solve

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=kP+1000&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}-kP=1000&lt;/math&gt;


Step 1:  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(t)dt}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int kdt=kt+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(t)dt}=Ce^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting C=1, we get &lt;math&gt;e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;


Step 2: Multiply through

&lt;math&gt;e^{kt}P'+e^{kt}P=1000e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3: Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} e^{\int P(t)dt}y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} e^{kt}P=1000e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4: Integrate

&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dt} e^{kt}P)dt=\int 1000e^{kt}dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{kt}P=\frac{1000}{k}e^{mt}+C&lt;/math&gt;

Step 5: Solve for y

&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{1000}{k}+\frac{C}{e^{kt}}&lt;/math&gt;

See how the answer is a constant addition to the normal solution, as expected.


===Hunting===

Lets say the government allows 10 animals to be killed a year.  This makes &lt;math&gt;f(t)=-10t&lt;/math&gt;.  How does this effect the solution?

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=kP-10t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}-kP=-10t&lt;/math&gt;


Step 1:  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(t)dt}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int kdt=kt+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(t)dt}=Ce^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting C=1, we get &lt;math&gt;e^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;


Step 2: Multiply through

&lt;math&gt;e^{kt}P'+e^{kt}P=-10te^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3: Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} e^{\int P(t)dt}y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} e^{kt}P=-10te^{kt}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4: Integrate

&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dt} e^{kt}P)dt=\int -10te^{kt}dt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{kt}P=\frac{-10(kx-1)e^{kx}}{k^2}+C&lt;/math&gt;

Step 5: Solve for y

&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{-10(kx-1)}{k^2}+\frac{C}{e^{kx}}&lt;/math&gt;



== Mixture problems ==

Imagine we have a tank containing a solution of water and some other substance (say salt).  We have water coming into the tank with a concentration &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, at a rate of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;.  We also have water leaving the tank at a concentration &lt;math&gt;C_o&lt;/math&gt; and rate &lt;math&gt;R_o&lt;/math&gt;.  We therefore have a change in concentration in the tank of 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=R_iC_i-R_oC_o&lt;/math&gt;

Thinking this through, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_o&lt;/math&gt; are constants, but &lt;math&gt;C_o&lt;/math&gt; depends on the current concentration of the tank, which is not constant.  The current concentration is &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{V}&lt;/math&gt; where V is the volume of water in the tank.  Unfortunately, the volume is changing based on how much water is in the tank.  If the tank initially has &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; volume, the volume at time t is &lt;math&gt;V(t)=V_0+t(r_i-r_o)&lt;/math&gt;. This makes the final equation

&lt;math&gt;x'=R_iC_i-\frac{R_ox}{V_0+t(R_i-R_o)}&lt;/math&gt;

which is an obvious linear equation.  Lets solve it.

&lt;math&gt;x'+\frac{R_ox}{V_0+t(R_i-R_o)}=R_iC_i&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1:  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(t)dt}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{R_o}{V_0+t(R_i-R_o)}=\frac{R_oln((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)}{R_i-R_o}+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(t)dt}=Ce^{\frac{R_oln((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)}{R_i-R_o}}=C((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting C=1, we get &lt;math&gt;((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}&lt;/math&gt;


Step 2: Multiply through

&lt;math&gt;((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}x'+((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}\frac{R_ox}{V_0+t(R_i-R_o)}=((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}R_iC_i&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3: Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} e^{\int P(t)dt}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} ((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}x=((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}R_iC_i&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4: Integrate

&lt;math&gt;\int (((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}x)dt=\int (R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}R_iC_idt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}x=\frac{C_iV_0((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_i}{V_0}}}{(R_i-R_o)}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 5: Solve for y

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{C_iV_0((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_i}{V_0}}}{(R_i-R_o)((R_i-R_o)t+V_0)^{\frac{R_o}{R_i-R_o}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Ugly, isn't it.  Most of the time when dealing with real world mixture problems, you'll plug in much earlier and use numbers, which makes it easier to deal with.

Recall that a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[Set Theory/Orderings|totally ordered]] if there exists a relation &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; satifying for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in X&lt;/math&gt;

# &lt;math&gt;(x\leq y)\and (y\leq x)\implies x=y&lt;/math&gt; (antisymmetry)
# &lt;math&gt;(x\leq y)\and (y\leq z)\implies x\leq z&lt;/math&gt; (transitivity)
# &lt;math&gt;(x\leq y)\or (y\leq x)&lt;/math&gt; (totality)

The usual topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined so that the open intervals &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; form a base for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out that this construction can be generalized to any totally ordered set &lt;math&gt;(X,\leq)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; be a totally ordered set. The topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;  on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; generated by sets of the form &lt;math&gt;(-\infty, a)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(a, \infty)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''order topology''' on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pennbradly. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pennbradly~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">I suggest breaking this up into Italian/Euro pastas and Asian pastas (at least within the page). While they are fundamentally similar, they quite different in usage, tastes, and textures. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:52, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
:I agree that Asian noodles shouldn't be here. I suggest putting the Asian noodles on a page called Noodles, and keeping the pasta page for Italian pasta. The distinction isn't perfect (spaghetti are technically noodles, and ramen are technically a pasta), but that would make it the easiest for people to find what they want. People expect Italian stuff under Pasta and Asian stuff under Noodles, I think. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:05, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:My definitions: Pasta is Italian-style material, no matter what the shape. Noodles are string-like, and may be made of any starchy material. Spaghetti, udon, soba, and ramen all fall into both categories. Elbow macaroni is only pasta. Rice noodles are not pasta. The main Cookbook page should probably list both. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:57, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I don't really think udon and ramen should fall under pasta (maybe a cultural difference, the Dutch word &quot;pasta&quot; has no connotations of Asian cuisine). I agree with Kellen that the two should be broken up because they are used in very different ways. I'd personally prefer one page for Italian pasta exclusively, since all Italian pasta's have so much in common (the recipe for pasta dough, for instance, is the same for any pasta). I think for the sake of simplicity it would be good to keep the Pasta page for Italian Pasta, with a link at the top of the page to whatever page would hold the Asian pasta's. Although, as I said, my understanding of the word Pasta may not agree with the universal one. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:51, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:::My understanding is that the word &quot;pasta&quot; has come to mean the vast category of shaped foods made from flour and water. (Wikipedia agrees; see [[w:Pasta|Pasta]].) Noodles are a sub-group of pasta, as are non-noodles like couscous. So, I would like to see one main pasta page, with links to region (Italian, Asian, etc.) I agree that they should be seperated in some way; there are just too many kinds of pasta to keep in one list. Wikipedia splits them up by shape, but it would probably make more sense for a cookbook to split them up by country. --- [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 21:22, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:::: I'm beginning to see that using the Pasta page for Italian Pasta exclusively isn't going to work. I suggest moving this page to Italian pasta and starting the main Pasta page afresh. I think the Asian Pasta's can be divided into Chinese Noodles and Japanese Noodles (&quot;Japanese Pasta&quot; doesn't really sound right, I don't think the Asian cuisines have any non-noodle pasta). Those are the only categories of Pasta I can think of. Miscelaneous stuff, like couscous, can just a link on the main Pasta Page. Would a Noodle page with cross references be necessary? Or should that just be a redirect? [[User:Risk|risk]] 00:12, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::::: I'm certainly OK with using this page just for Italian pasta. That might not be perfectly accurate, but it's probably what people expect. While I admit that ramen and udon might be pasta, I sure don't imagine them when someone says pasta. Noodles are definitely ''not'' a sub-group of pasta, mainly because of rice noodles. In any case, Noodles and Pasta should be distinct and should link to each other. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:08, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::: So, why are rice noodles not pasta? They seem to fit the definition to me. --- [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 05:41, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::: I agree that, technically, many kinds of noodles are pasta. Pasta is a term usually reserved for products with wheat flour as their base (and sometimes potatoes), but not those based on rice, mung beans, etc. So we can't draw a tidy partition that encompasses either all pasta or all noodles. We could simply redirect [[Cookbook:Pasta]] and [[Cookbook:Noodle]] to to a new page called [[Cookbook:Pasta and noodles]]. Having two separate pages would invite unneeded duplication, because of the overlap. Also, where would wonton wrappers and rice-based spring roll wrappers go, otherwise? [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:14, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

== Handmade Pasta/Noodles ==

There will (probably) be people (like me) who will want to look up such information as pertaining to the making of pasta/noodles as opposed to the prep of ready-made pasta/noodles, and among those people there would be those who do not have or do not desire the use of a pasta-making machine for that purpose.

==Merged==
[[Cookbook:Italian Pasta]] and [[Cookbook:Pasta of Italy]] have been merged here.

Talk merged from [[Cookbook talk:Italian Pasta]]

It doesn't exists such a pasta named veggeroni, not as far as Italy is concerned :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">* {{todolink|Music Theory|todo-list of Music Theory}}
1.Non-tonal, post-tonal, modern and contemporary music, 20th century music would be more correct terms for what is called as atonal music. Atonal implies in a negation of tonal music that is not true.

2.Is it really neccessary to say that some people think that it is ugly and other people don't?

[[User:Hutchies|Hutchies:]] I've edited this page extensively to make it more complete as an overview of alternatives to tonality in 20th-century music; I've left the title as-is though, because I do think that although (like most generic titles) it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy, it's still the most commonly used term for this period (and with the revisions to the text it's more appropriate now).
:The title of the Wikibook is Tonal Music Theory. I've looked around for how to rename the title of a book, and it seems like we should have consensus here before such a request is sent to the bot who deals with this. It sounds like you folks are all about adding sections about atonality/non-tonality/serialism/post-tonality/modernism/post-modernism or whatever you care to call it. If that's the consensus, then the title of the book should be changed. I don't have a problem with that at all. Also, it seems that people want to add information about non-Western music. This is, in my mind, another indication that the title of the book should be changed to simply '''''Music Theory'''''. Or maybe just '''''Music'''''. Now that I think about it, wouldn't it be better if we simply limit the scope of this book to common practice styles? And create other books for other styles? Something to think about. I don't care either way, since I've got this burnin' feelin' to start the counterpoint section. --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 08:32, 28 May 2007 (UTC)



1.Hutchies is right; atonal is an erroneous term for some great music, but it is the term that is still used in most schools of music, so I believe that it is fine for this book as long as the other terms are presented alongside it.

2.I believe that this textbook could go much beyond what it is now, and include sections on musical form and analysis (including various forms of pop, jazz, rock, etc. as well as classical forms) as well as information on counterpoint and voice leading in various situations.  Orchestration and Arranging may be too far outside the scope of this book, but might grow as its own section here until someone transfers it to its own textbook.  Of course, some of this would be very difficult to do without the aid of graphics and media files.

3.I'd like to see media files being included of simple things such as scales, chords, and examples of each musical genre.

:http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Music_markup for easy finding, if something like this was enabled then I would use it.  [[User:Tuxide|Tuxide]] 18:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

==Cleanup-NC==
Now that this book has been moved to Music Theory, I am marking it as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cleanup-NC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; because its naming conventions doesn't abide to [[WB:NP]].  Links to individual pages should be &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Introduction/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Music:Introduction]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  [[User:Tuxide|Tuxide]] 18:35, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
: Yeah, I know. I've got it on my todo list. Over then next week or so I'll rename these pages correctly. [[User:Derek Parnell|Derek Parnell]] 00:17, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
:: I could've done it myself, but there was one conflicting thing I noticed.  Some link to the pages in the [[Western Music History]] book instead of this one such as Baroque, but others do not such as Classical.  I suppose all can be moved except Baroque, but I really don't know what should be done in this case. [[User:Tuxide|Tuxide]] 06:09, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
:: I went ahead and renamed the red links, since those don't require moves.  [[User:Tuxide|Tuxide]] 06:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)


This whole section is dreadful! I will edit when I have time, but the inaccuracies are legion.  For instance, the modes are defined against a C major scale without the 12-tone equal-tempered system - much less the major, or C major scale - ever specified.  The twelve-tone equal-tempered system is never mentioned as the foundation of Western music theory.  Stylistic peculiarities are listed as &quot;theory,&quot; when actually music theory fundamentals are objective descriptions of the tonal system, and are only style-specific as one moves from fundamentals to more advanced concepts.

Anything labeled &quot;music theory&quot; needs to be defined in terms of a specific pitch universe; i.e., the fundamentals of the Western, equal-tempered system vs. Javanese slendro or the system of Hindusthani thats. Music theory describes the fundamental materials and procedures of the pitch (and rhythmic) system in question.  Most of the genre divisions listed in this section differ in terms of form, style, and musical function, but not in terms of how they employ basic theoretical idioms.

==Wiki Notation==
I wonder if there is a way to notate music as a wiki, instead of using pictures. In this way somebody could edit any mistakes in the music and nobody would have to install music notation software in their computer ( and learn to use it ). Gus 2007-02-01 12:21

:Hey Gus, I'm both a computer professional and an amature percussionist with an interest in composition on my PC; so I'll see what I can dig up on this topic.  But my gut feel is that most browsers won't support this so it'll need to happen as a generated image, server side. Which probably means Mediawiki will need to update their system. (Perhaps not... I'll download and install Mediawiki tonight and see what they let you customize) If they let you execute external programs to generate images I'll look into the myriad of open source notation generators and give a brief summary of the pros and cons of each, unless this isn't the place for that discussion...  I'll keep you posted. -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 00:55, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

::There is a mediawiki extension for the GNU Lilypond rendering engine, for rendering music notations. However, that extension isn't installed here (or on any wikimedia project, for that matter). If there was enough support, we might be able to convince the developers to activate the extension for en.wikibooks, but we would probably need several votes from community members. If you want to get this issue started, you can post a note about it on [[WB:SLT|Staff lounge]], and we can start voting on the idea. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
::: Thanks for the heads up. I believe I found that extension -- [http://wikisophia.org/index.php?title=Wikitex WikiTeX] -- on Wikisophias site.  The extension appears to support many &quot;LaTex&quot; object/drawing extensions, not just Lilypond. Whiteknight, is this the item you were referencing? -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 01:36, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
::::Probably, and thanks for fixing my typo. I remember reading something about it on meta the other day, and sort of forgot about it until i saw this discussion today. If the extension supports more types of media besides music notation, it might be a benefit to the entire wikibooks project, not just the music books. Bring it up at the staff lounge. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::Whiteknight, what's the status on this? I'd like to be able to write up/edit a music notation page. But I'm not familiar or comfortable enough with the image insertion proceedures to do this yet. It strikes me that using a &quot;built-in&quot; wiki tool for music notation rendering would be easier than creating examples in an engraving program, and exporting them as images to be uploaded and embedded into a page... --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 08:10, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

==Musical Styles==
Is it okay for me to add another style under there (Electronica, including ambient, IDM, trance, etc.) although there is a Miscellaneous Styles section? I feel that electronica deserves its own section because of its uniqueness. I also plan on writing the section. --[[User:MagiNinjA|MagiNinjA]] 06:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
:Dude, I say go for it. I know nothing about that style of music, but if you're willing to write it, knock yourself out! --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 08:32, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

== Page Formatting ==

I noticed some areas on this TOC page where the formatting seems a little off. I will go through it and fix up some things if people want, but i dont want to step on any toes. Let me know if you are interested and I will see what I can do. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:46, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

It seemed like someone came in and copy/pasted the page code onto itself, so all the TOC entries were listed twice... I fixed this and removed the &quot;Music Theory/&quot; part of each section title. I am brand spanking new to the Wiki scene, so I figured I'd act first and ask for forgiveness if necessary - if I stepped on toes, or if this is against Wikiquette, please don't hesitate to let me know. This book has been languishing in &quot;disrepair&quot; for so long that it finally got to me, so I decided to dust out the cobwebs. Countless other issues with this book which are driving me batty! I'll work on them as diligently as I can. --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 08:06, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

== Content Organization ==

Schoenberg (In &lt;u&gt;Theory of Harmony&lt;/u&gt;) makes three distinctions in the pedagogy of music: Harmony, Counterpoint, and Form. I think this would be the most beneficial chapter/unit breakdown for this book. For those ''without'' any knowledge of music whatsoever would have an introductory chapter/unit from which to gain knowledge of the basics of musical notation and so on. What say you all, if there are still authors about? Again, the idea is:
*Fundamentals (of Western Music)
*Harmony
*Counterpoint
*Form&lt;br&gt; --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 08:32, 28 May 2007 (UTC)


:I just wrote up a potential &quot;contents&quot; section for the fundamentals chapter/unit. Here
:*Fundamentals of Common Practice Style
:*#	Notation
:*##		Staves
:*##		Clefs
:*##		Note-length values
:*#	Pitch

::I agree; there's to much overlap throughout this book. We need to have clear sections about each subject. [[User:Herr Beethoven|Herr Beethoven]] ([[User talk:Herr Beethoven|talk]]) 14:31, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

==Organization==
This book is not organized. It starts off talking about pitch and rythym and harmony. It first needs to start with basic notes and rests and then scales then chords etc. I'll help out with the basics organizing it when I can. - Portlandiaman

:yeah, its really disorganized and confusing.  please fix, thx

Reggaeton is not western music,
please create a section just like western music for latin music so we can put all music of latin origin thank you</text>

==Epidemiology==
*M&gt;F 2:1
*3% of upper respiratory tract cancers

==Anatomy==
*For the purpose of staging, is divided into four subsites: septum, floor, lateral wall, and vestible.

*''Nasal vestibule'' is the anterior nasal cavity extending from the nostrils to the internal nasal valve.

*''Lateral wall'' of nasal cavity includes the superior, medial and inferior turbinates, the nasolacrimal duct, and the osteomeatus.

*5-12% incidence of nodal mets at diagnosis.

*Draining lymphatics of nasal vestibule include Level I, facial and preauricular.

'''Staging:''' see [[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Sinonasal/Staging|Staging]]

==Histology==
'''Nasal Cavity'''
*SCC 50%
*Esthesioneuroblastoma 13%.
*Melanoma 10-15%

'''Nasal Vestibule'''
*SCC 80%

==Treatment of Carcinoma of Nasal Vestibule==
*Tumors of the nasal vestibule are typically considered separate from nasal cavity tumors, because they are essentially skin cancers and as such have a different natural history
*Definitive radiation therapy preferred over primary surgical approach for T1-2N0 SCC of nasal vestibule because of good local control of xrt and major cosmetic sequellae of surgery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* '''Considering Fossil Fuel's Full Cost:'''  Looking at the long term impact of our present use of fossil fuel may help considerably in properly valuing it, and thereby encouraging the healthy development of sustainable energy sources.  If one simply notes that our posterity will not have the source to use in '''emergencies''', it would proabably be a big step in that direction. Even our present ability to imagine can bring up significant and persisting concerns, given natures ways, humanity included.  That being done, one tends to include the cost of replacing it in some substantive sense so our posterity may address such concerns.  On the whole, fossil fuels are probably most validly used as an emergency material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
&lt;b&gt;Necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/b&gt; is a rare, often fulminant, rapidly progressive infectious process primarily involving the fascia and subcutaneous tissue. The pathophysiology involves the rapid spread of infection along the fascial planes, fascial necrosis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous blood vessels, leading to cutaneous gangrene.

Approximately 500 to 1500 cases reported annually in the US. The most often associated comorbities are diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease. It is most often peripheral, involving the lower limb.

Delay to diagnosis is one of the most prominent predictors of mortality (along with diabetes). Prognosis for necrotizing fasciitis depends heavily on early recongnition and determination of the extent of necrosis in the preoperative planning.

Clinical studies are lacking that compare different imaging modalities to the gold standard of fasciotomy. These series are typically small and only look at a handful of cases.

==Clinical Findings==

Patients usually present with the triad of exquisite pain (often out of proportion to physical findings), swelling and fever. Tenderness, erythema, and warm skin are commonly the only signs of early disease. Distinction between uncomplicated infectious cellulitis or fasciitis, and necrotizing fasciitis is important. The former entities are treated with high-dose antibiotics without the need for surgical debridement. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency.

Classification schemes describe the syndromes associated with necrotizing fasciitis and have overlapping features

*&lt;b&gt;Type I:&lt;/b&gt; mixed infection of anaerobes plus facultative species such as streptococci or Enterobacteriaceae. Acute, rapidly developing infection of the deep fascia, marked pain, tenderness, swelling, and often crepitus.

*&lt;b&gt;Type II:&lt;/b&gt; infection with group A streptococci. Acute infection, often accompanied by toxic shock syndrome, rapid progression of marked edema to violaceous bullae and necrosis of subcutaneous tissue, absence of crepitus.

==Radiologic Findings==

===Plain Films===

Plain films: Gas on plain films is thought to be an inconsistent sign, seen is well less than half of cases.

Image above looks like postmortem of neurofibromatosis not necrotizing fasciitis.  Might want to check your data saved under &quot;NF&quot;

===MRI===

MRI: In identifying necrotizing fasciitis on MRI, findings include involvement of the deep fascia and demonstration of fascial necrosis.
#Fascial inflammation or fluid accumulation is demonstrated by low intensity on T1 and high intensity on T2.
#Fascial necrosis is evidenced by the lack of contrast enhancement of the involved area upon the administration of gadolinium.

MRI also plays a role in determining the extent of fascial involvement to aid in the preoperative assessment. However, Arlan et al. point out that the findings in MRI can be nonspecific and most preoperative decisions should be based on clinical status.

[[Image:nf4.jpg|T1W and T2W MR of the lower extremity showing fascial thickening and fluid accumulation between the subcutaneous tissues and fascial layer (respectively) in this patient with necrotizing fasciitis.]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; T1W and T2W MR of the lower extremity showing fascial thickening and fluid accumulation between the subcutaneous tissues and fascial layer (respectively) in this patient with necrotizing fasciitis.

===CT===

Contrast enhanced CT can help define the extent of disease and possible complications, especially in sites that are difficult to study. However, large clinical studies correlating CT findings with pathologic findings are lacking.

===Ultrasound===

Some believe there is limited use for ultrasound in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Its main limitation being when the anatomic sites are difficult to ascertain (too deep) by US. However, in their series, Yen et al. found ultrasound to have a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 93% (positive predictive value of 83%). Their criteria included diffuse thickening of the subcutaneous tissue accompanied by a fluid accumulation more than 4 mm in depth along the fascial layer, when compared to the normal limb.

===Summary===
Although one can see findings of necrotizing fasciitis on practically any imaging modality, none of these findings are absolutely specific. The optimal diagnostic approach consists of pooling all of the sometimes contradictory clinical and imaging data and making the best estimate from that. When in doubt, one should approach these challenging patients with a high index of suspicion and err on the side of patient safety. In other words, if there is sufficient likelihood that a patient has necrotizing fasciitis (your mileage may vary), surgical intervention should proceed as soon as possible.

==Treatment==
Fasciotomy: Obviously the gold standard. Timely intervention in those cases where clinical suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis is high is imperative. Fasciotomy allows both for confirmation of the diagnosis with histology, but also rapid iniation of treatment. Typical findings include gray discoloration of the fascia and resistance to blunt dissection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;Fibrous dysplasia&lt;/b&gt; is a benign, developmental anomaly of the bone-forming mesenchyme in which the medullary cavity is replaced with fibrous material, woven bone, and spindle cells. Virtually any bone in the body can be affected. It is a nonhereditary disorder of unknown cause. Fibrous dysplasia does not spread or proliferate, and malignant transformation is rare (0.5%).

==Pathophysiology==

Fibrous dysplasia is caused by abnormal proliferation and maturation of fibroblasts; it has been likened to a localized developmental arrest because all the pregenitors of normal bone are present, but they do not differentiate into their mature structures. Benign fibrous tissue with abnormally arranged, dysplastic trabeculae of immature woven bone replaces normal bone. The lesions are medullary but may replace both cancellous and cortical bone.

==Epidemiology==
*Age:The peak age of diagnosis is 5 to 20 years
**Two thirds of patients with polyostostic disease are asymptomatic before the age of 10 
**With monostotic disease, patients as old as 20 - 30 years are asymptomatic

*Race: No specific racial predilection

*Sex: The incidence is equal in males and females.

==Clinical Findings==
The followling four disease patterns are recognized:
#Monostotic form 
#Polyostostic form 
#Craniofacial form 
#Cherubism

===Monostotic form===
Approximately 80% of cases of fibrous dysplasia are monostotic. The typical sites of involvement are the proximal femur, tibia, ribs, and facial bones. This form most frequently occurs in those aged 10-30 years. The degree of bone deformity is relatively less severe compared with that of the polyostotic form.

===Polyostotic form===
About 20% of cases of fibrous dysplasias are polyostotic. In polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, the distribution of lesions is unilateral in up to 90% of cases; monomelic and widespread distribution are less frequent. Most bony lesions occur in the lower extremities, including the pelvis, legs, and feet. Rib, spine, or skull lesions are also often seen. Common deformities include leg-length discrepancy (lesions are in the longer leg) and bowing of the weight-bearing bones due to the weakened structural integrity of the bone. This bowing phenomenon can lead to a varus angulation of the proximal femur, the shephard's crook deformity.

The polyosttotic form is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome - sexual precocity in girls, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and cafe-au-lait spots with serpiginous borders (&quot;rocky coast of Maine&quot;). Up to 30% of women with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia may have the full spectrum of the McCune-Albright syndrome.

The clinical course ranges from asymptomatic to multiple pathologic fractures, rapidly progressive deformities, severe pain, and debilitation. Malignant transformation has been documented but is rare.

===Craniofacial form===

This pattern of the disease occurs in 10-25% of patients with the monostotic form and in 50% with the polyostotic form. It also occurs in an isolated craniofacial form. Sites of involvement most commonly include the frontal, sphenoid, maxillary, and ethmoidal bones. The clinical manifestations include frontal bossing, facial asymmetry, inferolateral orbital displacement, and blindness.

===Cherubism===

This special variant of fibrous dysplasia is an autosomal-dominant disorder of variable penetrance. It occurs in children and is more severe in boys. Regression may occur after adolescence. The jaw is broad and protruding. Involvement of maxilla and mandible is symmetric.

===Other features===

Fibrous dysplasia may be associated with endocrinopathies in 2-3% of cases - hyperthyoridism, hyperparathyroidism, and precocious puberty. The polyostotic fibrous dysplasia can be associated with intramuscular myxomas (usually adjacent to the affected bone). This association is known as Mazabraud syndrome.

==Radiologic Findings==

Plain radiography is the first line study. CT may be required to assess complex regions such as the spine, pelvis, chest, and facial skeleton. Bone scintigraphy has a limited role in the detection of subtle pathologic fractures. MRI may be necessary to assess cord compression when the spine is involved.

*Radiolucent expansile medullary lesions. The lesions are medullary but may replace both cancellous and cortical bone. 
*The abnormal area may be sharply circumscribed and marginated by a thick layer of reactive bone, or it may blend gradually with the adjacent normal bone. 
*Degree of lucency depends on the amount of osteoid 
*&quot;Ground-glass&quot; appearance is due to dysplastic microtrabeculae, which are no thicker than 0.1 mm. 
*Bowing deformities: biomechanically insufficient bone - shepherd's crook deformity of the femur (coxa vara). 
*Base-of-skull lesions tend to be sclerotic (in contrast to lucent lesions elsewhere)

Therapy is often restricted to the orthopedic management of complications.

Radiographic findings in the extremities include acroosteolysis, soft tissue calcifications (calcinosis), and atrophy of the distal finger tips. Compared with hand involvement in scleroderma, foot involvement has a later onset and is relatively less frequent but can be disabling. Soft tissue changes included flexion deformities, generalized or localized atrophy, and dystrophic calcifications. In a study by Bassett et al.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6786024&amp;query_hl=8&lt;/ref&gt;, resorption of distal phalanges was the most common bony change in patient's with scleroderma, though osteolysis in other sites (feet, ribs, and mandibles) was also frequent. Nearly 20% showed radiographic evidence of inflammatory arthritis and joint destruction that could not be attributed to overlap with [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Joint_Disorders/Rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]] or mixed connective tissue disease.

Radiographic findings of other organ systems include fibrosis in the lungs and abnormal esophogram related to dysmotility.

[[Image:scleroderma.jpg]]

==Differential Diagnosis==

The differential diagnosis for acroosteolysis includes diseases that affect peripheral nerve sensation such as diabetes, leprosy, syrinx, myelomeningocele and congenital insensitivity to pain; injury such as frostbite, thermal or electrical burns, or snake bite; trauma; psoriasis; congenital abnormality such as with Hadju-Cheney; metabolic causes such as [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Primary hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]]. Soft tissue calcifications in the extremities can also be seen with dermatomyositis, heterotopic ossification, and metastatic calcification ([[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Primary hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]], chronic renal disease). 

==Treatment==

No treatment for acroosteolysis. The treatment for scleroderma varies depending on organ involvement and is beyond the scope of this discussion, but includes anti-inflammatory medication, both non steroidal and steroids. 

==Prognosis==

Depends on the type and degree of systemic sclerosis. There is no cure for scleroderma and most people die from involvement of the heart, lungs and/or kidney . Involvement of visceral organs is not uncommon such as GI tract (esphageal and small bowel dismotility).

As each book has a front cover, so to, does a Wikibook have a '''title page'''.  You can create a title page separate from table of contents for your book to provide a short description of scope of your book.

== Abstract ==
A book's cover should describe the purpose of the book, and thus, there should be a short paragraph explaining what the book is trying to teach, and the topics that it may cover.  In short, the title page should summarize the entire book to the best of your ability. You can also a cover image for decorative purposes.

== Example ==
* [[How To Build A Computer/Cover]]

== Naming conventions ==
As per [[WB:NP|naming conventions]], if your book is named ''Book'', then title page should be named ''Book/Cover'' and book table of contents should be named just ''Book''.

== What should go on the title page? ==
As a rule, link to the table of contents should be placed on your title page. Title pages should also link to a book's specific manual of style. There should be also a link to list containing the names of all the users actively working on the project - it can be placed in manual of style, foreword or separate &quot;Authors&quot; page.

It's good to point a central discussion page for the whole book so that contributors have one place for discussing book-related issues.

If a [[Help:Print versions|print version]] or [[Help:Print versions#PDF versions|PDF version]] of your book is available, you can announce it using {{tl|print version}} and {{tl|PDF version}} templates or just add a normal link to them.

Cover images should be kept to a minimum, and should not dominate your title page.  This is as if your book is nominated for [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|book of the month]] or [[WB:COTM|collaboration of the month]], the cover image is used to represent your book on the main page.

If wikibook is listed in categories and has interwiki links, all of them should be placed at cover page, not table of contents.

== Cover page and table of contents ==
If a book has a cover page, its table of contents should not contain any interwiki links or categories. You should provide link to the cover at the top of book TOC page like:

&lt;small&gt;[[Programming:C plus plus/Cover|&lt;&lt; Cover and interwiki]]&lt;/small&gt;

== How to link to title page ==
If you use only default backlinks for pages using slash-convention, all chapters of your book will automatically link to table of contents, not cover page. If you use custom [[Wikibooks:Templates/Navigation|navigation templates]], you should also not link to cover page.

External links, like links from bookshelves, should point to the book cover, not table of contents.

== Cataloging ==
The main page of your book is where the important information regarding how the book is in relation to other books, or Wikibooks in general, resides.  If your book needs to be transwikied or is [[WB:RFD|put up for deletion]], then that information will be on the book's title page.  Our category system will also only categorize title pages of the books.

Like a library, each Wikibook must be categorized.  Currently, the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office|card catalog office]] organizes books by their bookshelf, by the Dewey Decimal Classification system, as well as the Library of Congress system.  If you are unaware of how your book is to be categorized, please place a link to your book at the CCO's main page and other Wikibookians will help you categorize your book.

== Title page and print version ==
If you are preparing a [[Help:Print versions|print version]] of your book, include the title page in it.

Some things from title page should not be included in print version - like interwiki, categories and some templates (for example, {{tl|print version}}). Hence, you should put them inside &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. You are also encouraged to add some information visible only in print version (using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; ... &lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag), similar to:
{{TextBox|
Current, editable version of this book is available in Wikibooks, collection of open-content textbooks at URL:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Book_name&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 1D neighborhood ==

Since in 1D there are no shapes, the definition of the neighborhood is usually very simple.

=== Radial neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata radious neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|Radial neighborhood]]

Usually the neighborhood in 1D is described by its ''radius'' &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the number of cell left and right from the central cell that are used for the neighborhood. The output cell is positioned at the center.

; Formal definition

Formally the radial neighborhood is the set of neighbors
:&lt;math&gt; N = \{-r,-(r-1),\dots,-1,0,1,\dots,r-1,r\}&lt;/math&gt;
or simply the neighborhood size &lt;math&gt;k=2r+1&lt;/math&gt; with the output cell at the center &lt;math&gt;k_0=r&lt;/math&gt;.

;Symmetries
* reflection symmetry

=== Stephen Wolfram's notation ===

In Wolframs's texts and many others the number of available cell states &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; and the radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are combined into a pair
:&lt;math&gt; (|S|,r) \,&lt;/math&gt;

;See also
* Stephen Wolfram, [http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/ca/83-statistical/ Statistical Mechanics of Cellular Automata (1983)]

=== Brickwall neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata brickwall neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|Brickwall neighborhood]]

An unaligned neighborhood, usually the smallest possible &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt;. The output cell is positioned at &lt;math&gt;k_0=0.5&lt;/math&gt; between the two cells of the neighborhood. It is usually processed by alternatively shifting the output cell between &lt;math&gt;k_0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_0=1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

== 2D neighborhood ==

=== von Neumann neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata von Neumann neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|von Neumann neighborhood]]

It is the smallest symmetric 2D aligned neighborhood usually described by directions on the compass &lt;math&gt;N=\{N,W,C,E,S\}&lt;/math&gt; sometimes the central cell is omitted.

; Formal definition

Formally the von Neumann neighborhood is the set of neighbors
:&lt;math&gt; N = \lbrace \{0,-1\}, \{-1,0\}, \{0,0\}, \{+1,0\}, \{0,+1\} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
or a subset of the rectangular neighborhood size &lt;math&gt;k_x=k_y=3&lt;/math&gt; with the output cell at the center &lt;math&gt;k_0x=k_0y=1&lt;/math&gt;.

;Symmetries
* reflection symmetry
* rotation symmetry 4-fold

* [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ mathworld]] - [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/vonNeumannNeighborhood.html von Neumann Neighborhood]]

=== Moore neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata Moore neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|Moore neighborhood]]

Is a simple square (usually 3×3 cells) with the output cell in the center. Usually cells in the neighborhood are described by directions on the compass &lt;math&gt;N=\{NW,N,NE,W,C,E,SW,S,SE\}&lt;/math&gt; sometimes the central cell is omitted.

; Formal definition

Formally the Moore neighborhood is the set of neighbors
:&lt;math&gt; N = \lbrace
\{-1,-1\}, \{0,-1\}, \{1,-1\},
\{-1,0\},  \{0,0\},  \{+1,0\},
\{-1,+1\}, \{0,+1\},  \{1,+1\} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
or simply a square size &lt;math&gt;k_x=k_y=3&lt;/math&gt; with the output cell at the center &lt;math&gt;k_0x=k_0y=1&lt;/math&gt;.

;Symmetries
* reflection symmetry
* rotation symmetry 4-fold

=== Margolus neighborhood ===

reversible

see also [http://sjsu.rudyrucker.com/~kwanghyung.paek/paper/]

=== Unaligned rectangular neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata unaligned rectangular neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|Unaligned rectangular neighborhood]]

An unaligned (brickwall) rectangular neighborhood, usually the smallest possible &lt;math&gt;k_x=k_y=2&lt;/math&gt;. The output cell is positioned at &lt;math&gt;k_{0x}=k_{0y}=0.5&lt;/math&gt; between the four cells of the neighborhood. It is usually processed by alternatively shifting the output cell to &lt;math&gt;k_{0x}=k_{0y}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{0x}=k_{0y}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

== Hexagonal neighborhood ==

=== Hexagonal neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata hexagonal neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|Hexagonal neighborhood]]

;Symmetries
* reflection symmetry
* rotation symmetry 6-fold

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

=== Small unaligned hexagonal neighborhood ===

[[Image:cellular automata unaligned hexagonal neighborhood.png|thumb|150px|right|Unaligned hexagonal neighborhood]]

; Formal definition
Formally the small (3-cell) unaligned hexagonal neighborhood represented on a rectangular lattice is the set of neighbors
:&lt;math&gt; N = \lbrace \{0,0\}, \{1,0\}, \{0,1\} \rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

;Symmetries
* reflection symmetry
* rotation symmetry 3-fold

;Speed of light

Is the maximum speed information can travel inside CA.It depends on the size and shape of the neighborhood and it may depend on the direction.

For asymmetric 1D CA (left and right direction)

:&lt;math&gt; c_L = k_0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; c_R = k-k_0-1 &lt;/math&gt;

The following poem is written in Hendecasyllabic.  It is an introductory, dedication poem written by the poet [[Wikipedia:Catullus|Gaius Valerius Catullus]].

it is commonly referred to as &quot;Catullus 1&quot;  or by its first line.


:Cui dono lepidum novum libellum
:arida modo pumice expolitum?
:Corneli, tibi: namque tu solebas
:meas esse aliquid putare nugas.
:Iam tum, cum ausus es unus Italorum
:omne aevum tribus explicare cartis...
:Doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis!
:Quare habe tibi quidquid hoc libelli—
:qualecumque, quod, o patrona virgo,
:plus uno maneat perenne saeclo!

      <text xml:space="preserve">I do not understand the sentence
&quot;This section is dedicated to the calculation of the fundamental group of S1 that we can consider contained in the complex topological space&quot;.
Is &quot;complex topological space&quot;.the space of complex numbers? Why not use RxR? Would the topology be any different?

Is it true that the specialty of S1 (compared with S2 or higher dimensions) is that there is not enogh &quot;room&quot; for a
&quot;film&quot; between loops with different numbers of turns?

Artie01: Hi! I'm not the author of the above sentence, but I think I can explain it a bit. By the &quot;complex topological space&quot; I presume he/she means the complex numbers C, equipped with its standard topology. (Remember that stricly speaking, you can't just specify the underlying set --- you have to specify the topology on that set too.) As you suggest, there's no practical difference between C and RxR as topological spaces (when both have their usual topologies). I'd guess that the author discusses things in terms of C since the proof of the main theorem ---  \pi_1 S^1 is isomorphic to Z --- views S^1 as the unit circle in C.

As for your second question: there are lots of intuitive ways to view the difference between the fundamental group of S1 and those of all other spheres. I like to think about a loop of stretchy string that's constrained to lie on the surface of S^n. For n &gt; 1, it's clear that, no matter how crazy the loop is, we can always contract it down to a single point. But on S^1, no matter how we twist or stretch the string we can never unwind it.

Hope this helps...

== Missing check of &quot;independence of representant&quot; ==

When we define the fundamental group (or actually any group really) using a quotient, we also need to show the operation does not depend on the choice of representant, i.e. is well-defined.  I currently lack the time to edit the article, so if someone want, feel free and go ahead.  I'll put it into my todo list but no guarantees [[Special:Contributions/94.112.136.34|94.112.136.34]] ([[User talk:94.112.136.34|discuss]]) 14:50, 15 June 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">For heat engines the thermal efficiency is the mechanical work output for each unit of heat input. For the [[Carnot cycle]] it is 

&lt;math&gt;\eta_c = 1 - \frac {T_0}{T_{max}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;T_0 = &lt;/math&gt; ambient absolute temperature

&lt;math&gt;T_{max} = &lt;/math&gt; maximum cycle absolute temperature

Actual engines using other cycles will have lower efficiencies than the Carnot cycle since they have irreversible processes such as heat flow across finite temperature differences and non-adiabatic compression and expansions, as well as friction.

Heat engines use as high a temperature as possible to maximize the efficiency and are limited by temperature capabilities of real materials used to make the engines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The propulsive efficiency is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\eta_p =  \frac{PropulsiveWorkDeliveredToVehicle} {MechanicalWorkGeneratedByEngine}&lt;/math&gt;

The mechanical work generated by the engine is crudely split between the work difference between the input and exit mass flows from the engine as well as to the work imparted to the vehicle. For a jet engine in the air frame of reference the input mass flow has zero kinetic energy. Thus for a jet engine with a constant relative exit velocity (a close approximation of  a turbojet) the propulsive efficiency increases with aircraft velocity.

Mathematically the propulsive efficiency :

&lt;math&gt;\eta_p =  \frac{2 u_0}{u_e + u_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;u_0 =&lt;/math&gt;  velocity of the vehicle


&lt;math&gt;u_e =&lt;/math&gt;  velocity of the exhaust

Thus reducing the exhaust velocity will give a higher propulsive efficiency.  The thrust of the engine is given by

&lt;math&gt;F = \dot{m} ( u_e - u_0 )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \dot{m} &lt;/math&gt; is the mass flow through the engine. Thus to  for a given thrust the exhaust velocity can be decreased if the mass flow is increased. This is usually doen by adding a fan or a propeller to the turbojet, resulting in a [[turbofan]] or [[turboprop]] engine. The reduction in exhaust velocity also reduces the exhaust noise, but has the disadvantage that the thrust reduces more markedly with speed than for a turbojet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Specific impulse is defined as the thrust (N) divided by the fuel weight flow rate (N/s). The resulting measure is usually quoted in seconds and defines the weight fraction  that is necessary to give a particular delta V for a rocket or range for an aircraft with a given lift to drag ratio.

For a jet engine the specific impulse can be determined from the specific fuel consumption. For example an engine that has an SFC of 15mg/N-s will have a specific impulse of 6800s. Current turbofan engines have cruise SFC below 15. 

For a chemical rocket the specific impulse ranges to about 500s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gas turbines are based on the Brayton cycle. 

All jet engines and gas turbines are heat engines that convert thermal energy into useful work. The useful work may be in the form of mechanical power, as from a shaft which may be used to drive a propeller, a vehicle, a pump, an electric generator, or any other mechanical device. In Jet engine applications the work is in producing compressed air and combustion products which are then accelerated to provide reaction propulsion.

==Thermodynamic cycles==

===[[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Brayton cycle|Brayton Cycle]]===


The Brayton cycle is the fundamental constant pressure gas heating cycle used by gas turbines. It consists of 

0-2: isentropic compression 

2-3: constant pressure heating

3-4: isentropic expansion

4-0: constant pressure cooling (absent in open cycle gas turbines)

[[Image:brayton-cycle.png|&lt;b&gt;Figure 2.1&lt;/b&gt;: Ideal Brayton cycle]]

===[[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Ramjet cycle|Ramjet cycle]]===

A ramjet uses the open [[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Brayton cycle|Brayton cycle]]. In the diagram below a [[Jet Propulsion/2D supersonic intake|2D supersonic intake]] is shown downstream of which is a divergent subsonic diffuser. Fuel is then injected into the compressed air and evaporates producing a mixture that is ignited when it reaches the flame front. The flameholders provide the turbulent circulation necessary to stabilize the flame, since deflagration velocities are usually much smaller (&lt;10m/s) than the average velocity of air in the combustor. The combustion products are then exhausted through the nozzle.

To understand how thrust is produced if we assume that the flow of fuel is negligible compared to the air mass then the exhaust flow will be at approximately the same Mach number as the input flow. However the total temperature of the exhaust is much higher and the exit velocity will be correspondingly higher than the input velocity. This difference in velocity (and momentum) produces thrust.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ramjet-schematic-kk-20050816.png|||600px|]]&lt;/center&gt;

The temperature rise in the intake-diffuser is related to the freestream Mach number &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{T_0}= 1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Maximum efficiency is reached if temperature rise in combustor is small.

&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac {[(\gamma-1)/2] M_0^2}{1+ [(\gamma-1)/2] M_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = c_p/c_v \approx 1.4&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of specific heats of air.

Ramjets are inefficient at [[wikipedia:subsonic|subsonic]] speeds and their efficiency improves at supersonic speeds. 

At [[wikipedia:hypersonic|hypersonic]] speeds the compression and dissociation processes make full diffusion unattractive and supersonic combustion is being researched. A [[wikipedia:Scramjet|Scramjet]] slows the air down to low supersonic speeds and then burns high flame velocity fuels such as hydrogen or methane.

===[[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Turbojet cycle|Turbojet cycle]]===

Adding a compressor to a ramjet powered by a turbine in the exhaust allows increased combustor inlet temperature, and a consequent increase in possible thermal efficiency. The turbine however is limited in the temperature it can handle, so maximum power is also limited. 

In the [[Jet Propulsion/T-S diagram|T-S diagram]] below the presence of the compressor allows us to raise the combustor inlet temperature (3). The raising of the combustor segment increases the cycle area and the thermal efficiency.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:turbojet-cycle-kk-20050810.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Addition of an afterburner (5-6) allows thrust augmentation as can be seen from the increased area of the diagram shown below. The [[wikipedia:afterburner|afterburner]] operates in the higher entropy range and has lower efficiency than the base turbojet. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:turbojet-afterburner-cycle-kk-20050810.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

===[[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Turbofan cycle|Turbofan cycle]]===

A [[wikipedia:turbofan|turbofan]] diverts some of the pressure energy of the core flow to power a fan which moves a larger mass flow, providing an increase in thrust and propulsive efficiency.

Turbofans normally have two or three shafts. Since the diameter of the fan is larger the same tip speed can be achieved at a lower rpm than the smaller diameter compressor and two shafts become necessary. The alternate method is to employ a gearbox to step down the shaft speed which is used in some smaller turbofans.  In most turbofans however a multistage LP turbine is used to extract the same energy with smaller stage loadings and lower tangential velocity. The smaller diameter HP compressor is run with one or two turbine stages with higher tangential velocity than the LP turbine.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:tfan-pw6000-kk-20050816.png|||600px|]]&lt;/center&gt;

===[[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Cycle Losses|Cycle Losses]]===

The compression incurs several loss mechanisms:

: Shock: 

: Separation 

: Tip clearance

: Seal clearance

: Blockage

: Whirling

Older versions of Game Maker (6.1A and below) can be downloaded from the [http://www.gamemaker.nl/old.html old Game Maker Pages].  It is recommended that you download the zipped version as some tutorials on this site will assume you have the sprites included in it.

Once you have downloaded Game Maker open the zipped folder and double click on gmaker.exe.  This will bring up the setup.  Click through it, being careful to read the Licensing Agreement.  That's it! You've Installed Game Ma

==Version 7==
Version 7 is the latest version of Game Maker and can be found at the YoYo Games [http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/try Download Page].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Child packages ==

What tried to explain the author of the &quot;child packages&quot; section? I don't understand anything. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:32, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, that section is not very clear, and should be rewritten. Other sections are merely stubs, and need to be expanded. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 09:20, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

::Started. I have tried to keep some of the info of the original child packages subsection. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 00:58, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

== Standard with ==

What's wrong with this section? There's nothing in it!

Perhaps it would be a good idea to cover the actual useful functions of ada before moving on to other sections?

:There is nothing wrong with that section, just nobody has written it yet. You're right, for the good of the wikibook it would be better to cover the basic features of Ada, but every contributor volunteers with what he/she finds more interesting. If you want to write the with section you are, of course, welcome. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:36, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

=== The &quot;With Type&quot; Section ===

I'm not sure about the heading (the &quot;with type&quot; proposal has
been abandoned in favor of &quot;limited with&quot;); the final example demonstrates &quot;use type&quot;.
Thoughts? [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 18:39, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

I changed the heading to &quot;Making operators visible&quot; because this is what this section is about. CG, 4 May 2007

== Private packages ==
This page presents private packages all wrong.  The syntax for a private package is:

&quot;private package P is...&quot;

and this wiki page actually presents a private /type/ within a public package incorrectly as a &quot;private package&quot;.

--Justin Gombos (April 2008)

:The terminology was a bit confusing between &quot;private part&quot; and &quot;private package&quot;. I hope it is solved now. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 19:26, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

== Packages and compilation units ==

The discussion starts off on the wrong foot by talking about separate compilation. This confuses packages with compilation units, and the article never recovers.

It's probably true that maybe the majority of packages are separate compilation units, and that the majority of separate compilation units are packages. However, it's also true that there are many packages that aren't compilation units, and many compilation units that aren't packages. The ability to separately compile a package is a language feature that is used in almost every Ada program, but packages are not at all the same thing as separate compilation.  [[User:DougP|DougP]] ([[User talk:DougP|talk]]) 22:50, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

The paragraph on separate compilation:

:A note to C/C++ users: Yes, you can use the preprocessor to emulate separate compilation — but it is only an emulation and the smallest mistake leads to very hard to find bugs. It is telling that all C/C++ successor languages including D have turned away from the independent compilation and the use of the preprocessor.

This is basically FUD --- it's unnecessary vilification of C and C++. It's not even true; C and C++ do separate compilation in exactly the same way that Ada does. It doesn't belong here.

Iste curso de conversation in interlingua es multo
simile a un pecia de theatro pro le radio. Illo
es principalmente le historia de duo protagonistas,
Catherina e Petro, qui travalia pro Marex Mundial,
un compania specialisate in systemas de transporto
urban. Le curso es in octo partes, e cata parte
ha sex scenas.

Ante cata scena appare un summario de su contento.
Post le major parte del scenas il ha un parve exercitio
que explica alcun characteristicas del interlingua
usate in le scenas. Le curso ha un guida qui apprende
le interlingua parlate exactemente como vos e qui
explica le scopo del exercitios.

Vos pote leger iste curso, preferibilemente con
altere personas como si vos habeva un conversation
con illes. Eventualmente io spera que un gruppo
de interlinguistas con alcunes del talentos de actores
professional facera registrationes de iste curso
e lo distribuera gratis per le Rete.

Le linguage conversational es assatis differente
del linguage destinate solmente a esser legite,
e io spera que post studiar iste conversationes
vos potera conversar liberemente plus facilemente
con altere personas in interlingua.

===Scena 2===
Strasbourg, in le officios de Marex Mundial:
Un femina cerca Petro e essaya trovar su officio.
Faciente isto, illa vide un obrero qui porta via
tote le cosas in le camera 215, apparentemente le
officio de Petro. Illa comencia un conversation
con le obrero pro essayar discoperir proque ille
porta via tote le contento del officio. Le obrero
sempre responde que ille non sape alcun cosa, que ille
solmente face lo que on le ha instruite. Iste es
un exemplo perfecte de un conversation multo frustrante
e del multe manieras de usar le linguage pro dicer
nihil.

Catherina: Bon die.

Obrero: Bon die.

Catherina: Io cerca senior Petro Minelli.

Obrero: Ah.

Catherina: Iste es su officio?

Obrero: Ah, io non sape.

Catherina: Eh, illo es le officio duo centos
dece-cinque.

Obrero: Eh, si. Iste es ille officio.

Catherina. Multo ben. Io crede que iste es le
officio del senior Minelli.

Obrero: Ah, si, il es possibile, ma io non sape.

Catherina: Que face vos?

Obrero: On me ha date le instruction de portar
via tote le cosas in iste officina.

Catherina: Que significa isto? Le senior Minelli
ha cambiate de officina?

Obrero: Io mesme vermente non sape alcun cosa. Tote
lo que io sape es que illes vole vacuar iste officio.

Catherina: Esque io pote lassar un message pro
ille?

Obrero: Non hic. Io debe portar toto via. Si
vos vole lassar un message, va al reception.

Catherina: Ma nemo es illac.

Obrero: Io sape. Illes es retardate, como sempre.

Catherina: Tunc il es obvie que le senior Minelli
ha vadite a un altere officio.

Obrero: Io simplemente non sape.

Catherina: Vos porta via toto de iste officio?

Obrero: Si, toto.

Catherina: Tunc ille non pote travaliar hic?

Obrero: Vermente, io non sape alcun cosa. Certemente
vos ha ration.

Catherina: Ma ubi es su nove officio?

Obrero: Como io ha dicite, io ha nulle idea.
On me ha date instructiones de vacuar iste officio,
e io porta tote le cosas via.

Catherina: E ubi los mitte vos?

Obrero: Foras, in le vestibulo.

Catherina: E postea?

Obrero: Postea? Io non sape ubi tote isto vadera.

Catherina: Ben. Gratias.

Obrero: Il esseva un placer.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Game Maker is an object-oriented programming language; the most basic parts are Sprites, Sounds, Backgrounds, Objects, and Rooms.

==Coordinate system (X,Y)==
As in graphs that you do in school. In Game Maker it is done in pixels and it is quite easy to lose track. In most places (sprite room editor etc.) you will get the chance to find and move in x,y coordinates. If the concept is new to you, you won't know what these are yet but it will make sense when you become more accustomed to Game Maker.

Note- Game Maker uses Cartesian system of graphing, so only x and y values are supported. What about z? z is going on to 3d, so we won't talk about that here.

==Sprites==
Sprites are images which can be imported from most image file types and are graphical representations of objects within the game. A sprite can be static, animated or stepped when used in Game Maker. A program that you can use to make the sprites is MS Paint. In Advanced Mode, you can create a sprite from scratch, or edit a finished one.

==Sounds==
Sounds are an audio file imported within the game, and may be taken from a variety of file types (including MIDI and .Wav files). The user can create positional sounds so that when the player walks into a dungeon eerie music plays to set the tone of the area. You can also add sounds to buttons, so that when the user presses a key on their keyboard a sound is emitted. Sounds in general like background music may also be added.

Example : sound_play(some_soundfile);

==Backgrounds==
Backgrounds are images which can be imported from most image file types.  Backgrounds can either be tiled horizontally or vertically, stretched to the width of the room or used as tiles to 'build' the look of the room. Like Sprites, in Advanced Mode, you can create your own background or edit it.

==Objects==
An object is a piece of code in your game world and may be programmed to do a variety of things, ranging from simply occupying space in order to prevent the player from advancing along a path to being as complex as a programmed enemy with hundreds of lines of code to give it a small amount of artificial intelligence. Objects are commonly represented with sprites, though they may be rendered invisibly by not selecting a sprite for them.

===Instances===
An Instance is an actual physical representation of an Object within the game world. Whereas the Object is the piece of code which provides the template for how a given Instance acts, the Instance is the actual thing with which a player interacts.

:For example, in Super Mario Brothers there was only one Goomba programmed. It was programmed to walk left until it fell down a hole or got squished by an overweight Italian plumber named Mario. The actual Goombas that Mario is interacting with when he's running through World 1-1  are Instances of that original programmed Object.

==Rooms==
A Room within the game is a piece of the game world which is rendered as a single area during gameplay. Any global effects due to objects within a single room (for example, the rain effect generated by the use of particles) will be rendered throughout the room. You will use Objects to make the rooms.

=== Step ===
Every game runs in steps. Each step is 1/30th of a second. 0.06 reoccurring. Unless you have changed the room speed, then it will be different; or if there are too many object/particles and other things that eat up your Frames Per Second. Lets get to the point, a lot of step events happen every single second.

Basically everything is mathematical in here. There's not much math for ''you'' to do, if any at all. However if you try to relate everything back to a math lesson you had at some point in your life, things begin to make sense a lot faster.

== Instance ==
Is what the player sees in-game, the actual thing. So say you have a robot in your game, who would twist at the torso, and run with his legs. one object would govern the torso and one object would govern the legs. kind of like a tree. Sprites make objects, which in turn make instances.

So in whatever game you are playing take age of empires (which is a 2d real time strategy game, if you were wondering, and is capable of being made in Game Maker) the catapult or battering ram you see in-game is an instance of the object battering ram.

== 3D ==
When you learn how to program in game maker, you &quot;can&quot; create 3d things. 3d in game maker, goes slower than 2d, so you have to be careful. But assuming that you are new, we will not go into depth about game maker's 3d functions. 3d functions are available only to registered game maker users. To prepare a 3d game, all you have to type is d3d_start() . Then after that... Have fun with lots of head aches!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Interlingua conversation course is very similar
to a radio drama. It is principally the history
of two protagonists, Catherina and Petro, who work
for Marex Mundial, a company specializing in urban
transport. The course is in eight parts, and each
part has six scenes.

Before each scene there is a summary of its content.
After most scenes there is a short exercise that
explains some of the characteristics of the Interlingua
used in the scenes. The course has a guide who
is learning spoken Interlingua exactly like you
and who explains the purpose of the exercises.

You can read this course, preferably with other
people as if you were having a conversation with
them. Eventually I hope that a group of Interlinguists
with some of the talents of professional actors
will make recordings of this course and will distribute
them free on the Internet.

Conversational language is somewhat different from
language destined only to be read, and I hope that
after studying these conversations you will be able
to hold free conversations with other people more
easily in Interlingua. (Harleigh Kyson Jr.)


==Part 1==

===Scene 1===
Petro is giving a ride in his car to one
of his colleagues. After navigating through some
very dense traffic, Petro and his colleague arrive
at the offices of Marex Mundial. Petro's colleague
leaves the automobile and says thanks to him. Petro
then goes away to park his car. Entering the office,
Petro says hello to different people. One of his
colleagues, Franco, asks Petro's advice about a
translation that he wants to make. Petro recommends
an agency but tells Franco that he will give him
the details later. He has to do all his work without
his secretary, who is on vaction.

'''Petro:''' Ah, the weather's nice today.

'''Petro's colleague:''' Yeah, but it's changing a little.

'''Petro:''' We're late.

'''Petro's colleague:''' Not too much. We've almost
arrived. I like Strasbourg. What do you think
of it?

'''Petro:''' I find it nice. Where do you want me to
leave you?

'''Petro's colleague:''' I work right over there.

'''Petro:''' This place here, is it okay?

'''Petro's colleague:''' Yes. This is perfect. Thanks
for having driven me here.

'''Petro:''' It was a pleasure.

'''Petro's colleague:''' Have a nice trip.

'''Petro:''' Thanks. You too.

'''Porter:''' Good morning, Mr. Minelli.

'''Voice 1:''' Good morning, Petro.

'''Petro:''' Good morning.

'''Voice 2:''' Hi.

'''Petro:''' Good morning, Mrs. Ducotto. Is everything
okay?

'''Voice 3:''' Good morning, sir. Everything's going
just fine, thanks.

'''Petro:''' Hi, Franco. How are you?

'''Franco:''' Fine, thanks. Say, (have you got a
moment) / (do you have a moment)?

'''Petro:''' Right now?

'''Franco:''' Yeah. Just a moment, no longer.

'''Petro:''' Yes, certainly.

'''Franco:''' Come into my office. You look very well,
really.

'''Petro:''' Ah yes. It's a nice day. The weather is
good. The sun is out. That's why I'm feeling
so good. What can I do for you?

'''Franco:''' Hey, take a look at this transport ad.
I have to have it in English, German, Italian, and
Spanish.

'''Petro:''' Is it a simple translation?

'''Franco:''' Not completely simple. It has various
technical words.

'''Petro:''' From Interlingua to French, English, German,
and Spanish?

'''Franco:''' And Italian.

'''Petro:''' But it's in Interlingua?

'''Franco:''' Ah, yes, it's in Interlingua.

'''Petro:''' Very well, you could give it to an agency.

'''Franco:''' Yes, but do you know of a good agency?

'''Petro:''' Generally we use the Interglossa agency.

'''Franco:''' Interglossa. How is that word written?

'''Petro:''' Capital I, en, tee, ee, are, gee, el, o,
ess, ess, ay.

'''Franco:''' Do you know their telephone number?

'''Franco:''' Uh, not by memory. But I ought to have
it somewhere in my office.

'''Franco:''' Can I ask Alice for the number?

'''Petro:''' She is on vacation at this moment.

'''Franco:''' Ah? Okay. You are all alone, it seems.

'''Petro:''' Yes.

'''Franco:''' Completely alone, all day long, poor Petro.

'''Petro:''' It doesn't bother me. Good, you want the
phone number of Interglossa. There is also another
agency.

'''Franco:''' Oh yes? I must find an agency as soon
as possible because I need the translations before
the end of the week.


====Exercise 1: Greetings====

'''Guide:''' ''Good morning, and welcome to this course. This series of recordings has the goal of allowing you to listen and learn. Listen to the recordings several times, and you will find spoken Interlingua progressively easier. I myself am in the same situation as you. I am also learning Interlingua. Thanks to this series of lessons, we will be able to learn it together. Now I would like to hear once again the different ways of saying &quot;Good morning&quot; to someone in the office in the morning.''

'''A woman:''' Good morning.

'''A man:''' Good morning.

'''A woman:''' Hi.

'''A man:''' Hi.


'''Guide:''' ''Yes. This is easy. There are other things a person can say, aren't there?''

'''A woman:''' How are you?

'''A man:''' Fine, thank you. And you?

'''A woman:''' I'm also very well, thanks.

'''A man:''' Good morning. How's everything going?

'''A woman:''' Everything is going very well, thanks.

'''A man:''' Good morning. Is everything going okay?

'''A woman:''' Very well, thank you, and you?

'''A man:''' Everything's going well, thanks.


====Exercise 2: The names of letters====

'''Guide:''' ''Petro spelled out the word &quot;Interglossa&quot; in the first scene. I now want to learn with you the names of the letters in Interlingua. First we are going to listen to the names of the different letters, and afterwards we are going to give the spelling of some words in Interlingua:''

'''A man:''' Ay, bee, see, dee,

'''A woman:''' ee, eff, gee, aitch,

'''A man:''' I, jay, kay,

'''A woman:''' Ell, em, en,

'''A man:''' Oh, pea, cue,

'''A woman:''' Are, ess, tea,

'''A man:''' You, vee, double you,

'''A woman:''' Ecks, why, zee.


'''Guide:''' ''Good. This is enough for now. Let's try to pronounce the letters for the city &quot;Strasbourg.&quot;''

'''A woman:''' Capital ess, tea, are, ay, ess, bee, oh,
you, are, gee.

'''A man:''' What is the spelling of &quot;Franco&quot;?

'''A woman:''' Capital eff, are, ay, en, see, oh.

'''A man:''' And what is the spelling of &quot;Petro&quot;?

'''A woman:''' Capital pea, ee, tea, are, oh.


'''Guide:''' ''That's easy enough. Let's now go to the second scene, where there are two people in Petro's office. I would like to know what they are saying to each other.''

==Scene 2== 
Strasbourg, in the offices of Marex Mundial:
A woman is looking for Petro and is trying to find
his office. As she does this, she sees a worker
who is taking away everything in Room 215, apparently
Petro's office. She starts a conversation with
the worker to try to discover why he is taking away
all the contents of the office. The worker always
answers that he doesn't know anything, that he is
only doing what he has been told. This is a perfect
example of a very frustrating conversation and of
the many ways of using language to say nothing.

'''Catherina:''' Good morning.

'''Worker:''' Good morning.

'''Catherina:''' I am looking for Petro Minelli.

'''Worker:''' Ah.

'''Catherina:''' Is this his office?

'''Worker:''' Uh, I don't know.

'''Catherina:''' Uh, this is office number two hundred
fifteen.

'''Worker:''' Uh, yes. This is that office.

'''Catherina:''' Very well. I believe that this is the
office of Mr. Minelli.

'''Worker:''' Ah, yes, that is possible, but I don't
know.

'''Catherina:''' What are you doing?

'''Worker:''' I have been told to take away everything
in this office.

'''Catherina:''' What does this mean? Mr. Minelli has
changed his office?

'''Worker:''' I myself really don't know anything. All
I know is that they want to empty this office.

'''Catherina:''' Can I leave a message for him?

'''Worker:''' Not here. I have to take away everything.
If you want to leave a message, go to the reception
area.

'''Catherina:''' But nobody is there.

'''Worker:''' I know. They are late, as always.

'''Catherina:''' Then it is obvious that Mr. Minelli
has gone to another office.

'''Worker:''' I simply don't know.

'''Catherina:''' You are taking everything out of this
office?

'''Worker:''' Yes, everything.

'''Catherina:''' Then he can't be working here?

'''Worker:''' Really, I don't know anything. You certainly
must be right.

'''Catherina:''' But where is his new office?

'''Worker:''' As I have said, I don't have any idea.
I have been given instructions to empty this office,
and I am taking away everything.

'''Catherina:''' And where are you putting it?

'''Worker:''' Outside, in the hall.

'''Catherina:''' And afterward?

'''Worker:''' Afterward? I don't know where all this
is going to go.

'''Catherina:''' Fine. Thank you.

'''Worker:''' It was a pleasure.


====Exercise 3: Numbers====

'''Guide:''' ''It seems that the number of Petro Minelli's office was two hundred fifteen. Let's now practice some numbers in Interlingua.''

'''A woman:''' Is this office number two hundred fifteen?

'''A man:''' Yes. You are right. This is two hundred
fifteen.

'''A woman:''' Is this office number three hundred twelve?

'''A man:''' Yes indeed. Three hundred twelve.


'''Guide:''' ''I now would like to practice all the numbers in Interlingua:''

'''A man:''' One, two, three, four, five.

'''A woman:''' Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

'''A man:''' Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

'''A woman:''' Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty.

'''A man:''' Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three,
twenty-four, twenty-five.

'''A woman:''' Thirty, forty, fifty, sixty.

'''A man:''' Seventy, eighty, ninety, one hundred.

'''A woman:''' Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred.

'''A man:''' Nine hundred eighty-nine, a thousand.


'''Guide:''' ''Fine. Here's Petro. He's coming.''

Catherina es un empleato temporanee. Illa comencia
un explication de su presentia. Ma quando Petro
invita que illa continua su conversation in su officio,
Catherina essaya dicer a ille que on ha portate
via omne le cosas que se trovava in illo. Ante
que illa pote explicar se plenmente, le telephono
de Petro sona. Franco es in le linea, e ille essaya

de traduction. Quando Petro entra in le officio,
ille trova Catherina in illo.

Petro: Bon die

Catherina: Bon die.

Io ha besonio de trovar un numero de telephono.

Catherina: No, io no lo ha vidite.

Petro: Io crede que Alicia generalmente la mitte

Catherina: Il habeva alicuno hic ante multo pauc
tempore.

Petro: Qui?

Catherina: Io non sape. Un obrero. Ille portava
omne via.

Petro: Illo es un exasperante.

Catherina: Illo es forsan pro le projecto Geneva.

Petro: Ma io non comprende proque on portarea via
omne illo sin dicer me ullo antea?

Catherina: Ille vadeva via ante cinque minutas.

Petro: E mi caffetiera? Illo es mie, ille caffetiera.
Illo non pertine al compania. Illo es mie.

Catherina: Illo es forsan foras, in le corridor.

Petro: Io spera que illo es ver. Si io non lo
trova, io irascera.

Catherina: Cerca in le corridor. Le obrero ha
mittite omne in le corridor.

Petro: Illo es ver. Ecce mi cosas. Mi sede, mi
bureau. Illo es anque mie.

Catherina: Io non vide ulle caffetiera.

Petro: Oh, illo va haber mal consequentias.

Catherina: Illo es illac?

Petro: No. Io non lo vide.

Catherina: Proque non parlar sur illo al chef del
officio?

Petro: Illo es exactemente lo que io va facer.

Catherina: Omne isto passava ante solmente dece
minutas.

Petro: Ma como pote io travaliar? Nulle bureau,
nulle tabula, nulle ... nulle.

Catherina (ridente): Nulle caffetiera.

Petro: Isto non es amusante de ulle maniera.

Catherina: Excusa me. Io non poteva prevenir me
de rider.

Petro: Iste circumstantias non pote continuar.
Io va vider Georgio immediatemente.

Catherina: Attende.

Petro: Ascolta. Vos pote attender un pauco?

Catherina: No. Non vermente. Io ha multe cosas
a facer.

Petro: Non pote vos attender un parve minuta?
Isto essera sufficiente pro resolver omne isto.

Catherina: Ma io anque poterea perder troppo tempore
multo facilemente.

Petro: Multo ben, forsan io poterea vider vos plus
tarde, nonne?

Catherina: Le problema es que io ha arrangiate
mi agenda pro vider vos hodie.

Petro: Ascolta, non potera vos esser hic un pauco
plus tarde? Forsan in un hora plus o minus?

Catherina: No. Ma forsan io poterea retornar le
fin del postmeridie.

Petro: Isto esserea conveniente pro vos?

Catherina: Si, si. Multo ben.

Petro: Ben. Io va resolver omne isto immediatemente.

Catherina: Multo ben. Io comprende vostre problema.

Petro: Tunc nos nos videra iste postmeridie. A
que hora?

Catherina: Que nos dice verso quatro horas?

Petro: Quatro horas. Multo ben. Nos nos videra
tunc.


EXERCICIO 4: Confirmar e contradicer.

Guida: Povre Petro! Nulle bureau. Nulle idea
de lo que passa. Io pote comprender pro que ille
ha resentimentos. Ma io volerea reaudir le diverse
manieras de indicar que un persona ha ration o torto.

Illa: Iste es vostre officio?

Ille: Si. Illo es le mie.

Illa: Vos es le senior Johano Bosco?

Ille: Si, io es ille.

Illa: Vos cognosce mi nomine?

Ille: No. Io non lo cognosce. Attende. Vos es
le secretaria temporanee?

Illa: No.

Ille: Vos travalia hic?

Illa: Si, io travalia hic.

Ille: Tunc vos es le secretaria temporanee.

Illa: No.

Ille: Ma tunc qui es vos?

Illa: Esque vos es le senior Johano Bosco?

Ille: Si, io es ille.

Illa: E vos non me cognosce?

Ille: No. Io non vos cognosce.

Illa: Face un conjectura sur mi identitate.

Ille: Io crede que vos es un secretaria, e io pensa
que vos es temporanee. Vos es un secretaria?

Illa: No. Io non es un secretaria.

Ille: Vos es temporanee?

Illa: No, de nulle maniera. Io non es secretaria
temporanee.

Ille: Vos travalia hic?

Illa: Si, illo es ver.

Ille: Vos travalia pro iste compania?

Illa: Si, vermente.

Ille: Vos travalia pro me in iste momento?

Illa: No, io non travalia pro vos.

Ille: Vos es mi nove assistente?

Illa: No, io non es vostre nove assistente.

Ille: Vos es mi nove secretaria?

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: Strasbourg, in the offices of Marex Mundial:
Petro and Catherina have their first conversation.
She soon understands who he is, but he believes
that Catherina is a temporary employee. She starts
explaining her presence. But when Petro invites
her to continue her conversation in his office,
Catherina tries to tell him that everything inside
it has been carried away. Before she can explain
herself fully, Petro's telephone rings. Franco
is on the line, and he tries to find out some more
detailed information on the translation agency.
As Peter enters the office, he finds Catherina there.

Petro: Good morning.

Catherina: Good morning.

Petro: Have you seen the telephone book? I need
to find a telephone number.

Catherina: No, I haven't seen it.

Petro: I believe that Alicia generally keeps it
over there, in that part of the office.

Catherina: I just got here. Isn't there anybody
here?

Petro: No. Alicia, my secretary, has gone. She
is on vaction. That, at least, is a good piece
of news.

Catherina: Really?

Petro: No. I wasn't speaking seriously. Ah, here
it is.

Catherina: Are you Mr. Petro Minelli?

Petro: Yes. And you? Are you my temporary secretary.

Catherina: No, I'm not your secretary.

Petro: Oh, fine. Excuse me. Who are you then?

Catherina: My name is Catherina De Sanctis.

Petro: Excuse me. I thought you were .... Good,
what can I do for you?

Catherina: My name doesn't mean anything to you?

Petro: No. Why? Should I know it?

Catherina: The Geneva project, does this mean anything
to you?

Petro: Yes. Vaguely. Why?

Catherina: Well, I am here because of it.

Petro: Yes, I understand. Let's go into my personal
office. I was just now going there.

Catherina: Mmm. Your office is not there now.

Petro: What?

Catherina: They have moved everything in it. There
was a worker there not long ago who was leaving.

Petro: Excuse me. (The telephone rings.) Yes?
yes. It's me. Ah, Franco. Yes. The telephone
number of the translation agency. Here it is.


SCENE 4: Strasbourg, in the offices of Marex Mundial:
Petro and Catherina continue their conversation.
She still is trying to explain to him that there
is nothing in his office. Petro becomes more and
more agitated, especially because he can't find
his coffee maker, which is his personal property
and does not belong to the company. Catherina suggests
that he talk with his supervisor, and he does so
immediately afterward, asking Catherina to wait
for him. Catherina says that she can't do this
because this matter will probably take a long time.
Finally, they agree to see each other once again,
at four o'clock in the afternoon.

Petro: (Talking with Franco on he phone) Good,
you now have the telephone numbers of two agencies.
Both have a good reputation. Very well, Franco.
That's fine. Yes. See you later. (To Catherina)
Excuse me for such a long delay. I am very sorry.

Catherina: Don't worry. It's not at all important.

Petro: Let's go to my office.

Catherina: But, your office is not ...

Petro: It's not what? What do you mean? Where
are all my things?

Catherina: I was going to tell you exactly what
I know about all that.

Petro: My office is empty.

Catherina: Yes, exactly.

Petro: But, what's going on?

Catherina: There was someone here not very long
ago.

Petro: Who?

Catherina: I don't know. A worker. He took
everything away.

Petro: That's exasperating.

Catherina: It is perhaps for the Geneva project.

Petro: But I don't understand why someone would
take everything away without telling me anything
beforehand.

Catherina: He went away five minutes ago.

Petro: And my coffee maker? It is mine, that coffee
maker. It does not belong to the company. It is
mine.

Catherina: It may be outside, in the hall.

Petro: I hope that is true. If I don't find it,
I'm gonna get mad.

Catherina: Look in the hall. The worker put
everything in the hall.

Petro: That's true. Here are my things. My chair,
my desk. That's also mine.

Catherina: I don't see any coffee maker.

Petro: Oh, things are going to get nasty.

Catherina: Is it over there?

Petro: No, I don't see it.

Catherina: Why not talk about it to the office
supervisor?

Petro: That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

Catherina: All this happened only ten minutes ago.

Petro: But how can I work? No desk, no table,
no ... no.

Catherina (laughing): No coffee maker.

Petro: This is not at all funny.

Catherina: Excuse me. I couldn't keep myself from
laughing.

Petro: All this just can't go on. I am going to
see Georgio immediately.

Catherina: Wait.

Petro: Listen. Can you wait awhile?

Catherina: No. Not really. I have many things
to do.

Petro: Can't you wait just a minute? That will
be long enough to take care of all this.

Catherina: But I also could lose too much time
very easily.

Petro: Very well, maybe I could see you later on.

Catherina: The problem is that I arranged my schedule
to see you today.

Petro: Listen, can't you be here a little later?
Perhaps in an hour, more or less?

Catherina: No. But perhaps I could return by the
end of the afternoon.

Petro: That would be convenient for you?

Catherina: Yes, yes. Fine.

Petro: Good. I'll then take care of all this
immediately.

Catherina: Very well. I understand your problem.

Petro: Then we can see each other this afternoon.
At what time?

Catherina: Let's say around four o'clock.

Petro: Four o'clock. Very well. We will see each
other again then.


EXERCISE 4: Confirming and contradicting.

Guide: Poor Petro! No office. No idea of what's
going on. I can understand why he feels resentful.
But right now I would like to hear the various ways
of indicating that a person is right or wrong.

A woman: This is your office?

A man: Yes. It is mine.

A woman: You are Mr. Johano Bosco?

A man: Yes. That's me.

A woman: Do you know my name?

A man: No. I don't know it. Wait. You are the
temporary secretary?

A woman: No.

A man: You work here?

A woman: Yes, I work here.

A man: Then you are the temporary secretary.

A woman: No.

A man: But who are you then?

A woman: Are you Mr. John Bosco?

A man: Yes, that's me.

A woman: And you don't know me?

A man: No. I don't know you.

A woman: Make a guess about who I am.

A man: I believe that you are a secretary, and
I think that you are temporary. Are you a secretary?

A woman: No, I'm not a secretary.

A man: Are you temporary?

A woman: No, not at all. I am not a temporary
secretary.

A man: Do you work here?

A woman: Yes, that's true.

A man: You work for this company?

A woman: Yes, that's right.

A man: You are working for me right now?

A woman: No, I don't work for you.

A man: Are you my new assistant?

A woman: No, I am not your new assistant.

A man: You are my new secretary?

A woman: No.

A man: Then I'm wrong.

A woman: In that you are right.

Guide: Since the afternoon is now here, let's go
back to Petro and Catherina.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ramjet-schematic-kk-20050810.png]]

A ramjet uses the open [[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Brayton cycle|Brayton cycle]]. In the above diagram a [[2D supersonic intake]] is shown downstream of which is a divergent subsonic diffuser.

The temperature rise in the diffuser is related to the freestream Mach number &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{T_0}= 1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Maximum efficiency is reached if temperature rise in combustor is small.

&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac {[(\gamma-1)/2] M_0^2}{1+ [(\gamma-1)/2] M_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = c_p/c_v \approx 1.4&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of specific heats of air.

Ramjets are inefficient at [[wikipedia:subsonic|subsonic]] speeds and their efficiency improves at supersonic speeds. 

At [[wikipedia:hypersonic|hypersonic]] speeds the compression and dissociation processes make full diffusion unattractive and supersonic combustion is being researched. [[wikipedia:Scramjet|Scramjet]] slow the air down to low supersonic speeds and then burn high flame velocity fuels such as hydrogen or methane to try to get net thrust.

Includes lip and oral cavity.

==Anatomy==
Divided into specific areas:
*&lt;u&gt;Mucosal lip&lt;/u&gt; - vermillion surface only
*&lt;u&gt;Buccal mucosa&lt;/u&gt; - membrane lining inner surface of the lip and cheeks to the attachment of mucosa to alveolar ridges and pterygomandibular raphe
*&lt;u&gt;Lower alveolar ridge&lt;/u&gt; - mucosa overlying the alveolar ridge of the mandible. Extends from lower buccal gutter to free mucosa of the floor of the mouth. Posteriorly goes to ascending ramus of the mandible
*&lt;u&gt;Upper alveolar ridge&lt;/u&gt; - mucosa overlying the alveolar ridge of the maxilla. Extends from upper buccal gutter to junction of hard palate. Posteriorly goes to upper end of pterygopalatine arch
*&lt;u&gt;Retromolar trigone&lt;/u&gt; - mucosa overlying ascending ramus of mandible from posterior surface of last molar tooth to apex, adjacent to tuberosity of maxilla
*&lt;u&gt;Floor of mouth&lt;/u&gt; - semilunar space over mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles. Extends from inner surface of lower alveolar ridge to undersurface of tongue, and posteriorly to base of anterior pillar of the tonsil. Contains ostia of submaxillary and sublingual salivary glands
*&lt;u&gt;Hard palate&lt;/u&gt; - semilunar area between upper alveolar ridge and mucous membrane covering the palatine process of maxillary palatine bones. Extends from inner surface of superior alveolar ridge to posterior edge of the palatine bone
*&lt;u&gt;Oral tongue&lt;/u&gt; - extends anteriorly from circumvallate papillae to undersurface of the tongue at the junction of the floor of mouth. It consists of tip, lateral borders, dorsum, and undersurface

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th edition (2009)'''
&lt;br&gt;'''''Tumor'''''
*T1 - 2 cm or less
*T2 - &gt; 2 cm but &lt;= 4 cm
*T3 - &gt;4 cm
*T4 (Lip) - Invades through cortical bone, inferior alveolar nerve, floor of mouth, or skin of face (i.e. chin or nose)
*T4a (Oral cavity) - Invades through cortical bone, into deep (extrinsic) muscle of tongue, maxillary sinus, or skin of face
*:Note: extrinsic muscles of the tongue are: genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and palatoglossus
*T4b - Involves masticator space, pterygoid plates, or skull base, or encases internal carotid artery

*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 2008''' PMID 18720518 -- &quot;Nomogram for deciding adjuvant treatment after surgery for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.&quot; (Gross ND, Head Neck. 2008 Oct;30(10):1352-60.)
**[http://skynet.ohsu.edu/nomograms/postrt/oral.html Nomogram link]
**Nomogram. 590 patients with oral cavity SCC at MSKCC, validated using 417 patients from HACC Sao Paulo. Concordance index 0.693


==Induction chemo-RT + Surgery vs Surgery Alone==
*'''DOSAK''' -- induction chemo-RT vs surgery alone
**Randomized. 268 patients, oral cavity/oropharynx T2-T4 N0-N3. Arm 1) Induction RT 36/18 with cisplatin 12.5 mg/m2 vs Arm 2) Surgery
**'''1994''' PMID 7930766 -- &quot;Preoperative radiochemotherapy and radical surgery in comparison with radical surgery alone. A prospective, multicentric, randomized DOSAK study of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and the oropharynx (a 3-year follow-up).&quot; (Mohr C, Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 1994 Jun;23(3):140-8.)
***Outcome: Locoregional recurrence induction 16% vs surgery alone 31%; OS 72% vs 81% (SS); 1-year OS benefit 4.5% and 2-year OS benefit 8.3%


'''''Retrospective'''''
*'''Cologne; 2008''' PMID 18188519 -- &quot;Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and radical resection for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Outcome of 134 patients.&quot; (Eich HT, Strahlenther Onkol. 2008 Jan;184(1):23-9.)
**Retrospective. 134 patients, resectable SCC of oral cavity, Stage II-IV (Stage IV in 70%). Neoadjuvant chemo-RT 39.6/22 + carboplatin 70 mg/m2. Radical resection + neck dissection (R0 88%, R1 5%, R2 2%). Post-op RT in 18%. Median F/U 6.1 years
**Outcome: pCR 14%. Local recurrence 29%, regional recurrence 10%, DM 12%. 2-year OS 65%, 5-year OS 45%
**Toxicity: Grade 3-4 in 5%
**Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemo-RT with radical surgery is safe and effective

==Pre-op RT vs. Post-op RT==
*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43). 
**'''10-years; 1991''' PMID 1993628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized study of preoperative versus postoperative radiation therapy in advanced head and neck carcinoma: long-term follow-up of RTOG study 73-03.&quot; (Tupchong L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Jan;20(1):21-8.)
***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). &lt;u&gt;Oral cavity (14%)&lt;/u&gt;, oropharynx (17%), hypopharynx (43%), supraglottic larynx (26%) 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting

==Surgery + RT vs Primary RT==
*'''Scottland''' (1991-1993) -- Surgery + post-op RT vs radical RT
**Randomized. ''Trial closed prematurely after significant survival benefit for combined arm.'' 35 of expected 350 patients, 4 institutions, oral cavity/oropharynx, excluded T1N0.  Arm 1) Surgery + postop RT 60/30 vs Arm 2) radical RT 66/33 alone. Only 50% and 41% of patients respectively received XRT as planned, mainly due to machine breakdown
**'''1998''' PMID 9704176 -- &quot;Early closure of a randomized trial: surgery and postoperative radiotherapy versus radiotherapy in the management of intra-oral tumours.&quot; (Robertson AG, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1998;10(3):155-60.) Median F/U 1.9 years
***Outcome: OS combined arm 53% vs. RT 11% (HR 0.24, SS); DSS 65% vs 33% (SS). Residual local disease 0% vs. 53% (SS)
***Conclusion: Surgery with postop RT superior to radical RT alone

==Surgery + RT vs. Chemo-RT==
*'''Singapore''' (1996-2000) 
**Randomized.

**55 pts treated with IMRT (49 post-op, 1 neoadj, 5 definitive). Chemo in 6 pts (3 receiving definite RT, 2 postop, 1 neoadj). 
**Median f/u 17 months. 9 pts with LRF. Median time to LRF 4 months. All but 1 of the failures was in the high risk region (CTV1 or CTV2). 
**Areas at high risk for recurrence include:
**#Primary tumor bed
**#Infratemporal fossa (via inferior alveolar N and mental N). &quot;The infratemporal fossa should also be included in the radiation field for tumor adjacent to these nerves with extensive perineural invasion and for tumor invading the pterygoid muscle, which is most commonly seen in patients with retromolar trigone cancer or tonsil cancer.&quot;
**#Area between primary oral tongue cancer and regional lymph nodes. Should be included in the high risk region for post-op RT.
**#Contralateral neck. Contralateral neck should be included for post-op RT of the oral tongue.
**Conclusion: &quot;Intensity-modulated RT is effective for oral cavity SCC. Most failures are in-field failures. Further clinical studies are necessary to improve the outcomes of patients with high-risk features, particularly for those with extracapsular extension.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">These are just general nutritional guidelines. Since there is variation between individuals, there are individual needs. These suggestions should create a healthier life for most people; however, some people will have to consult a nutritionist for a diet to fit their needs. Also, it should be noted that being in good health does not equal being the media's image of beauty. Most people cannot fullfill the Super-Model or Super-Ripped image that's often seen in advertisements or on TV. In fact, some people are most healthy when they are carrying a higher-than-average level of body fat recent scientific evidence suggests that being slightly over-weight (not over-fat) may, in fact, be more healthy than being average weight or underweight.

Please remember, these nutritional guidelines are not a weight loss guide, although many people will lose weight if they are followed. These are guidelines for more healthy living, and that means eating this way should improve your energy levels, your immune system, your ability to heal, and your mood! It is all to important to emphasize this point: eating and exercising correctly will do you no good for being healthy if you are not happy with the genetics you were born with, in other words, you may carry additional body fat naturally and it's unhealthy to try and lose it. Since mental health is as important as physical health it is vital to realize that you need to be happy with yourself!
While exercise is very important to good health, to get into optimal shape a proper nutrition regimen must be mantained. As the old cliche goes, &quot;You are what you eat&quot; more specifically, your body is fueled by what you eat, and your body is built and repaired by the macronutrients you eat. Like any responsible car owner knows, if you put dirty lead-based fuel into your car or build it with bad parts it runs less smoothly, and the car is more prone to failure than if you use unleaded fuel or good parts. This is a great analogy to the human body, if you eat dirty foods, your body will not perform as well as it could and it will be prone to illness and injury. 

The human body is designed, or has evolved to run well on certain fuels. Unfortunately, McDonald's french fries are not it. When considering the evironment which our ancestors lived in, it is easy to see what types of foods our bodies are meant to be fed. For example, the carbohydrates that they ate were mostly berries, nuts, beans and legumes. All of these are very high in fiber and low in sugars. In contrast, the typical western diet is low in fiber and high in sugars. Low-fiber diet is believed to cause many health problems, including chronic constipation, hiatal hernias, intestinal infections, colon cancer, and digestion problems. High sugar diets are believed to be the leading cause of adult onset diabetes as well as obesity. These problems are almost entirely absent in &quot;hunting and gathering&quot; cultures that eat much like our ancestors ate.

Our ancestors also hunted or fished for meat. Unlike farm raised animals, hunted animals and fish are much more lean, or have less fat. Fat is not necessarily a bad thing and the human body needs a certain amount, and recent research suggests that plant fat (oils) and fish fats are extremely healthy; however, animal fat or saturated fat is unhealthy in large quantities and is one of the leading factors in heart disease and obesity.

In fact, our ancestors most likely got their fat intake mostly from plants. The unsaturated fats in plants have been found to increase metabolism, and improve the efficiency of food as a fuel source. This is much like what an octane booster does in a car, it helps to break down the fuel into a usable source while wasting less of it.

Like a car, the human body needs many things to run well. The engine in the car needs to have clean oil, it lubricates the engine and allows it to use fuel more efficiently. In the human body, water does much the same thing. Adequate water intake (hydration) is vital for the human body to use its fuel. For all useful purposes, hydration specifically refers to drinking water and no other liquid. Other liquids contain impurities that can intefere with water intake, they can also be consumed, but drinking water alone is vital. A good rule of thumb in water consumption is to have 1 cup of water per 15 lbs of body weight. The water intake should also be spread throughout the day, and is easy to attain if you drink a glass or two of water with every meal.

It is a good idea to eat at least 5 meals a day. These shouldn't be the standard sized meals, but smaller meals. Eating about as much calories as you eat in 3 meals spread over 5 or more meals a day keeps the body fueled. Unlike a car, the body runs better when it is constantly fueled. This is because our body is more advanced than a car, and it will store the energy as fat instead of using it, depending on the conditions it is given. That happens to be (not counting the time asleep), for the average male, more than 4 hours without a meal, and for females, more than 3 hours without a meal.

All meals do not have to be created equal. A meal can consist of a 120 calorie energy bar, or it can be a 400 calorie sandwich. The important thing is to stop eating when you feel satiated (no longer hungry) instead of stuffed (full), and to eat the right kinds of food.

The right kinds of food are conveniently provided by the US Department of Agriculture in their recent revision of the food pyramid. In this revision, the different food types are better separated. Such as, whole wheats (high fiber, low sugar) are separated from white grains (low fiber, high sugar), and lean meats (poultry, tuna, lean beef) are separated from fatty meats (most red meats, bacon).

In the new food pyramid nutritional intake is as follows:

* Whole Grains - Eat at most meals, no limit
* Plant Oils - No limit
* Vegetables - In abundance
* Fruits, 2-3 times daily
* Nuts and Legumes, 1-3 times daily
* Poultry, Eggs, Fish, 0-2 times daily
* Dairy or Calcium, 1-2 times daily
* Red Meat - Eat sparingly
* White Pastas, Potatoes, White Rice, Sweets and White Breads - Eat sparingly

As you can see, the new food pyramid covers many of the principles covered in the &quot;body as a car&quot; section. First, it emphasizes whole grains and vegetables which are high in fiber and low in sugars (aka complex carbohydrates). It also suggests our octane booster, or the plant oils. It shows to rarely eat starchy foods, like white pastas; this is because they contain a lot of sugars (aka simple carbohydrates) which are correlated with diabetes and obesity. As with most things, there are some exceptions in the food pyramid left out most likely for simplicity. For example, it focuses on high-fat, high-calorie nuts as protein sources, ignoring the use of leaner cuts red meat of which contain less fat than poultry and for which no health problems have been proven, and suggests that the consumption of no non-dairy animal products is healthy, when in fact such a diet tends to be lacking in iron

Ideally one should not aim to lose weight (lowing your BMI) but rather to create an ideal body fat percentage (see table below) based on there age, build and individual needs. Aside from fatty tissue, the majority of one's weight comes from muscle tissue(s), bones, and organs (body composition is the percentage of &quot;other stuff&quot; to fat within the body). Losing muscle mass is not a very good idea especially when trying to reduce body fat percentage. If one is trying to become healthy the more muscle mass you have, the more energy you expend even while resting, as well, muscle mass helps to protect your body from injury, thusly having adequate muscle mass can assist in maintaining a healthy body composition. As a positive side-effect, requiring more energy to sustain, which, in turn the body can draw from stored body fat and give you a &quot;thinner&quot; look. It is important to remember that safe fat loss should not involve the loss of more than 1-2 pounds (0.5-1kg) per week. In most cases, if one is losing weight very rapidly (more than 2 pounds or 1kg per week), then most the lost weight is due to lost water. In this case, the lost weight is very easily replaced once you rehydrate yourself.

As well, losing more than 1-2 lbs per week is counter-productive. In addition to the fat that's lost is atrophy of muscle (losing protein within the muscle fibers thus decreasing the mass of muscles), and losing muscle mass lowers your metabolism and causes the body to go into &quot;starvation mode&quot; in which it stores food as fat more easily. This might result in weight loss, but it will also result in a higher percentage of body fat and worse overall health. It will also be temporary, and will most likely result in greater fat and weight gains. 

It should be mentioned again though: weight loss should not be an important factor in a healthy lifestyle. The only concern should be good health and being happy. Being in good health requires proper exercise and nutrition of the body and the mind. To achieve this is to change your lifestyle which is not just &quot;going on a diet&quot;. It requires learning about nutrition and exercising, making goals and a plan for those goals, and following through with them.

One last thing to wrap up the basics about nutrition: sunshine. Sunshine is a must: it has been proven to improve mood, prevent depression, and produce vitamin D! In fact, there is no way to get an adequate amount of vitamin D from food alone, you must be out in the sun to produce it. Sunlight chemically reacts with your skin to make vitamin D.  

Though contrary to popular belief, being outside in the sun &quot;unprotected&quot; is healthy for you in small doses. These doses range from between 10 and 45 minutes a day, depending on your skin tone and UV index. The rule of thumb is, the darker your skin tone, the more time you need to spend in the sun for adequate vitamin D production. Of course, remember that prolonged exposure to the sun unprotected is dangereous, and for anything longer than this time period you should wear sunscreen.

septimana.

(Petro e Catherina sorti ex le edificio.)

Portero: Ecce le claves de vostre automobile, senior
Minelli.

Petro: Ah, si. Gratias. Il haberea essite multo
plus facile si alicuno me habeva notificate un pauco
plus antea de maniera que io poteva haber me preparate
plus facilemente!

Guida: Petro pare un pauco surprendite. Io volerea
saper le natura de omne iste historia. E io anque
volerea saper exactemente lo que va passar a ille.
Il ha solmente un sol maniera de discoperir isto:
ascoltar le secunde parte.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: Strasbourg, in the offices of Marex Mundial:
The scene starts out with a conversation between
Catherina and the director, who congratulates her
because she has been selected for the Geneva project.
She thanks him for all the help that he has given
her. She then explains that she must leave to talk
with Petro.

We then find her in Petro's office, and he expresses
his regrets for having to go away suddenly that
morning. When they start understanding each other,
the worker returns to take away everything that's
still in Peter's office. Catherina and Petro protest,
but the worker does not listen, and they then have
to look for another office to continue their
conversation.

Catherina: Thanks a lot for your help.

The Director: It was a pleasure. It is very
interesting for you, that Geneva project, isn't
it?

Catherina: Yes. I find it really fascinating.

The Director: And you are young for such important
work ... The people at Trans Infra must think a
lot of you.

Catherina: It is simply that this is the type of
work that I really like.

The Director: Would you like some tea?

Catherina: No, thanks. What time is it? I must
go to see Petro Minelli.

The Director: Ah, yes, Petro. He is an excellent
engineer. You will like him a lot.

Catherina: We have made an appointment at four
o'clock, and I must go now.

The Director: Very well. If I can help you with
anything, you only have to let me know.

Catherina: I will do that. Thanks a lot.

(Someone knocks on the door.)

Petro: Come in.

Catherina: Good afternoon.

Petro: Oh, good afternoon.

Catherina: Are you free at this moment?

Petro: Yes, certainly. Excuse me for the events
of this morning. I had to leave a little rapidly.

Catherina: Don't worry. It's not at all important.

Petro: Very well. Then what can I do for you?
Excuse me, I have forgotten your name.

Catherina: Catherina De Sanctis.

Petro: Catherina De Sanctis. Oh, yes. Excuse
me. My memory for names is rather bad.

Catherina: Mine is too. I have a good memory for
pictures and faces, but never for names.

Petro: Fine. My name is Petro.

Catherina: Yes, I know. My memory for names is
not completely bad.

Petro: What can I do to help you, Catherina?

Catherina: Good, I would like ...

(The worker who was taking away the things in Petro's
office returns.)

Worker: Can I continue now?

Petro: No, not at all. Not right now. Don't you
see that I am busy? I am in a meeting.

Worker: Excuse me, but you said four o'clock, and
it is now later than four o'clock.

Petro: Listen, let me have ten minutes.

Worker: I'm sorry, but it is now later than four
o'clock, and I leave work at four thirty.

Catherina: What does he want?

Worker: I have to move all this out before four
thirty, and it is now more than four o'clock. And
besides, I am completely alone.

Petro: Can you give me only five minutes?

Worker: No. Listen. Excuse me, but I must start
immediately.

Catherina: Can we use another office?

Worker: I'm very sorry, but I know nothing about
that.

Petro: Fine. Let's try to find another office.


EXERCISE 5: Excusing and introducing oneself.

Guide: In this conversation people have excused
themselves. Let's explore further the various ways
of doing this in Interlingua.

A man: Would you like a cup of tea?

A woman: Thanks.

A man: Oh, I'm sorry, but I spilled the coffee.

A woman: Don't worry. It's my fault. There is
some coffee on your papers.

A man: Oh, don't worry. It's nothing serious.
There is also some coffee on your clothing.

A woman: Oh, that's not important.

A man: Excuse me. Can you repeat your name? My
memory for names is not very good.

A woman: That's not at all important. I myself
don't have a very good memory for names.

A man: Oh, there is coffee spilled everywhere,
on a lot of things.

A woman: I'm so very sorry.

A man: It's nothing.

A woman: And I'm very sorry for being late.

A man: Don't worry. You're not really late.

A woman: I said at four o'clock, and it is a little
later than four at this moment.

A man: That's not at all important. Good, can
you give me your name? I have forgotten it.

A woman: Maria. And your name, I believe it is
Lorenzo.

A man: Yes, you're right. Excuse me. As I've
already told you, my memory for names is very bad.


EXERCISE 6: Describing a company. The days of
the week.

Guide: In the next exercise, we are going to run
into some commercial and technical words. First,
I would like to hear them separately.

A man: Tell me about this company.

A woman: It is part of a group. The central offices
are in the United States, in New York.

A man: The central offices are American.

A woman: The central offices of this group are
American. There are three branch offices.

A man: The group has central offices and three
branch offices.

A woman: One in Switzerland, one in Canada, and
one in the United Kingdom. There are three branch
offices in the group besides the central offices.

A man: We are in the United Kingdom.

A woman: We are the British branch. The central
offices are in the United States. The American
company is the owner of our branch. We form part
of the group.

A man: We don't own the group.

A woman: No. It is the central company in New
York that owns the group. We are only a branch.

A man: The entire group includes the central company,
and the branches. Do you understand now?

Guide: Let's talk now about a trip to Geneva.

A man: Are you leaving Saturday?

A woman: Next week?

A man: No, not next week. At the end of this week.

A woman: Today is Monday.

A man: Tuesday, Wednesday.

A woman: Thursday, Friday.

A man: Saturday, Sunday. We are going to fly to
Geneva next Saturday.

Guide: Fine. So Petro and Catherina are looking
for an available office, a place where they can
talk. Let's find out if they have been successful.


SCENE 6: Strasbourg, in the offices of Marex Mundial:
Catherina and Petro try to continue their
conversation. Finally they find a vacant office,
and Catherina explains to Petro something about
the nature of the Geneva Project. A secretary
interrupts them, saying that she has to lock up
the offices before going away.

Despite this interruption, Catherina is able to
say to Petro that he has been selected for the Geneva
project and that his work there will start the
following week. Petro expresses his surprise because
he has no recollection of accepting this new
assignment.

Petro: There must be another office in this area.
Is it vacant? Oh, excuse me. No, there is someone
in that office that I didn't see.

Catherina: And here?

Petro: Is it empty?

Catherina: Take a look.

Petro: Nobody seems to be using it right now.

Catherina: Yes. Everything's fine. We can use
these chairs.

Petro: Then you're gonna work at the central offices?

Catherina: I used to work there. But you ought
to know I'm gonna work in Geneva.

Petro: In the Trans-Infra office in Geneva?

Catherina: No ...

Petro: In our Marex Mundial agency in Geneva?

Catherina: No, not at all.

Petro: Then in the holding company in Geneva?

Catherina: No, not exactly. But wait. Let's go
back and start out once again.

Petro: Good idea! You've come from Paris?

Catherina: Yes, exactly.

Petro: Up to now you have worked for Trans-Infra,
in the central office.

Catherina: Exactly!

Petro: And you are now gonna work in Geneva.

Catherina: Bravo! You have understood everything.

Petro: But there is a certain thing that I don't
understand very well even now. What are you doing
here, in this branch?

Catherina: That's exactly what I was gonna explain
to you.

A secretary: Oh, excuse me.

Catherina: We were looking for an empty office.

The secretary: Ah, but this one's not really free.

Petro: Oh, nuts!

The secretary: I'm gonna lock these doors. Do
you have a key?

Petro: No.

The secretary: Listen, I'm very sorry about this,
but I'm gonna leave and I've gotta lock up these
offices before going away.

Petro: But this isn't possible!

Catherina: She's right. We shouldn't be here.
Do you know where we can go?

The secretary: Everyone's locking up now, but perhaps
you can find a quiet place in some other part of
this building.

Petro: Fine. We'll find some quiet place some
way or other.

Catherina: I was talking about ...

Petro: Oh, all this is not at all important. I
was only casually interested in it.

Catherina: But it should be of interest to you.
It also concerns you.

Petro: It concerns me? How?

Catherina: Because you're also going to Geneva.

Petro: What am I gonna do in Geneva?

Catherina: You have signed on. Didn't you agree
to it?

Petro: Agree to what?

Catherina: To participate in the Geneva project.

Petro: I don't remember anything about that.

Catherina: You don't remember having asked to work
in Geneva?

Petro: Okay. I remember having thought about it.
It interested me a little. I remember that I had
spoken about it to Paul Barone many months ago.
But nothing had been decided.

Catherina: Well fine. It has been decided.
Everything has been completely arranged.

Petro: And I've now gotta go to Geneva?

Catherina: Exactly.

Petro: Really? But when?

Catherina: You're gonna fly there next Sunday.

Petro: Next Sunday?

Catherina: Yeah. At the end of the week.

Petro: But ...

The secretary: Can you leave this office? It's
absolutely necessary for me to lock it up right
now.

Catherina: I think she wants us to go away.

The secretary: Exactly!

Petro: I must leave for Geneva at the end of this
week.

(Petro and Catherina leave the building.)

Porter: Here are the keys to your car, Mr. Minelli.

Petro: Ah, yes. Thanks. I wish someone had told
me sooner so that I could get ready more easily.

Guide: Petro seems a little surprised. I'd like
to know what's been going on here. And I'd also
like to know exactly what's gonna happen to him.
There is only one way to find out: listening to
the next part.

The main Blender documentation and tutorial authors are now working on the [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Official Blender MediaWiki]. If you're considering helping write Blender tutorials or documentation, please consider helping us at the official wiki instead.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

This should be merged into the Blender 3D book. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 23:29, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
: Agree. Quality tutorial BTW. Congratulations! :)--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:20, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
:: Thanks for the compliment! I'm not sure where it would fit in the Blender 3D book, because it's rather a quick case-study tutorial. It doesn't belong in the Noob to Pro section anyway, because regular Blenderheads have no use for this (apart from the hdri section, a subject on which I haven't found decent tutorials - the biorust.com tutorial isn't worth much IMO)... --[[User:1983|1983]] 22:00, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

== *Crash* ==
Hello i am probably jumping the gun, but am trying to setup up a simple yayfray render, with the hdr image as instructed in this tut, i get to applying the hdr image, setting all the yayfray stuff cache ect, and i hit the old f12 and bam &quot;windows is sorry&quot; shut blender down ect wtf help stephen@eggandmilk.co.za
:I had the same problem, but you just have to install [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YafRay Yafray]. I was assuming that Blender installed it, but seemingly that's not true.

==Thanks!==
Thanks so much for this tutorial.  I had never used Blender before and was able to pick it right up.  The instructions were very clear and worked perfectly for the medical device rendering that I urgently needed for work



==  blue pic ==


Hey,

I have followed yourre instructions, but my pic came out blue, with almost no shade or textures, i can't figure out what Ive done wrong? does anyone know what to change??

rudivanerp@gmail.com


== Nice One ==

== Russian? ==

What is this?

Рендер с добовленными матерьялами
Для визуализации, вы можете непосредственно нажать F12, или сначала зайти в установки визуализации(F10). Because of the render settings we use (GI and an HDRI environment), my render took about 3 minutes on a AMD64 3200 [...]

== Black render ==

I followed everything to the letter yet got a black render. No model, no ground plane, nothing :-( Have I missed something here? I'm using Blender 2.48a and Yafaray r299.

*UPDATE* I double checked Yafaray was installed, the script is there but Blender's console reports this:

''Couldn't FIND registry key for yafray, is it installed?
Error loading yafray plugin: The specified module could not be found.''

It also can't find Python but it is also installed!! I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling them all to no avail.

*Update 2*
I finally downloaded Yafray (NOT Yafaray) and it all worked with Python 2.5.4 I think I might give up though since the render output is just fog. Thanks for the tutorial anyway, I guess it helped some people.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I just found the abandoned site about the [[Anatomy/Nervous System|Nervous system]] and tried to set up a logical and helpful way to explain the anatomical systematics of this challenging topic. I'd appreciate if anyone feels up to comment on that.

I think the distinction between the functional and localizational aspect has to be made in order to get things right, especially the nomenclature that is always mixed up by people since they don't understand the difference between terms that describe function and terms that name positions.

I have started to insert both the English terms for anatomical structures but also added the Latin anatomical description in Italic according to the recent (Parisian) Nomina anatomica [http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/Nomina_Anatomica] and Terminologia anatomica from 1998. I would like to please every author who wants to contribute to attach to this system for two reasons. First, the english manner of anglifying medical terms generates a certain degree of misunderstanding as the plethora of medical phrases and descriptions contain some ambiguity. The nomina anatomica is the conventional language that anatomists use and that all medical personnel around the world should attach to. I know this is far from reality as english-speakers dominate the medical literature and they do not study, publicize and converse in proper Latin terms. Nevertheless, if WikiBooks aims to generate reliable textbooks at least the minimal standard for such project would be the use of the correct language. The second reason for using both forms lies in the fact that a minority - but a large one - from some European countries will be able to fluently read into the matter as they are trained to use the Latinized nomenclature. 

I have started to set up a preliminary division of chapters. I would suggest to everyone who would like to contribute to concentrate on four main sections for each structure as can be already seen in the [[Anatomy/Nervous System/Anatomical compartmentalization#Spinal_cord_(Medulla_spinalis)|spinal cord]] chapter: 

(1) Gross anatomy

(2) Microscopic anatomy

(3) Internal organization

(4) Function

Any suggestions?

Okay, that's it for the beginning. See you later.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adding a compressor to a ramjet powered by a turbine in the exhaust allows increased combustor inlet temperature, and a consequent increase in possible thermal efficiency. The turbine however is limited in the temperature it can handle, so maximum power is also limited. 


In the [[T-S diagram]] below the presence of the compressor allows us to raise the combustor inlet temperature (3). The raising of the combustor segment increases the cycle area and the thermal efficiency.

[[Image:turbojet-cycle-kk-20050810.png]]


Addition of an afterburner (5-6) allows thrust augmentation as can be seen from the increased area of the diagram shown below. The [[wikipedia:afterburner|afterburner]] operates in the higher entropy range and has lower efficiency than the base turbojet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

Reiter's Syndrome is an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy, characterized by the classic triad of nongonococcal urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. Term Reiter's arthritis has been replaced by Reactive Arthritis because of Dr Reiter's experiments in Nazi concentration camps.

==Etiology==

RS generally occurs about 1 to 3 weeks after a systemic infection. Chlamydia trachomatis is the bacteria most often associated with Reiter's syndrome, but several different bacteria acquired through the digestive tract, including Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter, are associated with Reiter's syndrome as well.


RS is usually self-limited, and generally lasts less than 6 months. The disease tends to remit, but recurs intermittently in 35% of cases, and 25% of patients will have chronic low grade symptoms. These recurrences may manifest as only one of the constellation of symptoms seen in the acute attack.


Although the reason why only some people are affected after infection is unclear, the HLA-B27 haplotype has been found to increase a person's chance of developing Reiter's syndrome. Approximately 80% of people with RS are HLA-B27 positive. 

==Clinical Findings==

Mild constitutional symptoms generally appear within 1-3 weeks. Urethritis may be postdysenteric or post venereal. Muscuoskeletal symptoms are mainly myalgias, asymmetric joint stiffness in lower extremity or low back pain.

A scoring system for diagnosis of Reiter's like spondyloarthropathy exists. Two or more of the following establishes the diagnosis ( one from musculoskeletal system) .

#Asymmetric oligiarthritis predominantly of the lower extremity
#Sausage shaped finger (dactylitis), toe, heel pain, or other enthesitis
#Cervicitis or acute diarrhea within one month of arthritis
#Conjunctivitis or iritis
#Genital ulceration or urethritis

==Radiologic Findings==

Skeletal abnormalities develop in up to 80 % of patients. Initial attacks of pain subside, only to recur later, leaving progressive changes at joints and entheses (sites of musculo tendinous insertions). The classic radiographic findings are: 

#Normal mineralization (osteoporosis in acute phase)
#Periostitis
#Ill define erosions
#Bilateral asymmetric distribution
#Joint space narrowing
#Fusiform soft tissue swelling

The imaging appearance is similar to [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Joint_Disorders/Psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis]]. However the distinction is made based on the distribution. Reiter's prdominantly involves the lower extremity primarily feet, ankle, knee and SI joints. 

===Feet===

Reiter's arthritis has a prediliction for MTP joints and first IP joint over the DIP and PIP joints. The arthritis is initially seen involving one joint only. There may be swelling of the entire digit giving the appearance of a sausage. Early on a periostitis of the phalanges may be noted. Later on uniform joint space narrowing, and marginal erosions with adjacent bone proliferation occur.

Calcaneus is involved in more than 50% of patients, hence the name &quot;lover's heel&quot;. Painful erosions and reactive spurs are very common at the attachment sites of Achilles tendon and plantar aponeurosis in calcaneus. 

===Ankle===

Usually there is fluffy periostitis of tibia and fibula with soft tissue swelling. Uniform joint space loss may occur and erosions are less frequent.

===SI Joint===
Bilateral asymmetric involvement is characteristic. Erosive changes are first seen on the iliac side of the true synovial joint. Because of the asymmetry, radiographically it may appear as unilateral involvement and indistinguishable from [[Wikipedia:Septic arthritis|septic arthritis]]. However bone scan may show uptake in both SI joints. Ankylosis is less frequent.

===Spine===
Involvement is typically around thoraco lumbar junction (lower three thoracic or upper three lumbar). Early involvement occurs as paravertebral ossification. As the disease progresses large bulky bony bridges form between adjacent vertebral bodies.

===Differential Diagnosis===

Involvement is typically around thoraco lumbar junction (lower three thoracic or upper three lumbar). Early involvement occurs as paravertebral ossification. As the disease progresses large bulky bony bridges form between adjacent vertebral bodies.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/b&gt; Sclerosis and ill-definition of both SI joints is noted in this patient with Reiter's syndrome.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 2&lt;/b&gt; Bony proliferation (arrows) is noted along the anterior margin of the lumbar spine in this patient with Reiter's syndrome.


[[Image:reiter3.JPG|Erosion of the 3rd and 5th metatarsal heads is noted]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; Erosion of the 3rd and 5th metatarsal heads is noted.


[[Image:reiter4.JPG|Prominent erosion of the posterior calcaneus is noted adjacent to the retrocalcaneal bursa]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 4&lt;/b&gt; Prominent erosion of the posterior calcaneus is noted adjacent to the retrocalcaneal bursa.

==Treatment==

Three therapies are used in Reiter’s syndrome: NSAIDS for acute inflammation, antibiotics for infection, and sulfasalazine or methotrexate for chronic disease

==Prognosis==

The prognosis for patients with Reiter's is generally good. Most people will have complete recovery of the initial illness 2 - 6 months after symptom onset. Approximately 20% of Reiter's patients will have mild, chronic symptoms that usually present as back pain and arthritis. There are a small percentage of people who will develop persistent, severe deforming arthritis. For these unfortunate few, treatments are generally not effective.

White has multiple choices here which can lead to very different games.
:*[[/3. Bb5/]] is the most played. White puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn.  
:*[[/3. Bc4/]] is quieter. Instead of attacking the knight, White chooses to target the weak f7 pawn.
:*[[/3. d4/]] is aggressive. Subsequent play may result in a very open game.
:*[[/3. Nc3/]] is the quietest common continuation.
:*[[/3. c3/]] the Ponziani opening, opens the white diagonal for the queen, allows for an eventual d4 pawn push, and controls d4 and b4 (possible plants by the black knight) at the expense of hemming in the knight.

Some more uncommon moves:

:*[[/3. Nxe5/]] the Irish Gambit, sacrificing a knight for a pawn.
:*[[/3. g3/]] the rarely seen Konstantinopolsky Opening
:*[[/3. Be2/]] a passive reply called the Inverted Hungarian Opening or Tayler Opening.

== Overview ==

'''''Lord Voldemort''''' (pseudonym) is perhaps the most notorious Dark wizard ever known and the most powerful and dangerous of all time. It is said that the only wizard he ever feared is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. Voldemort apparently believes nothing is worse than death; perhaps his greatest weakness is his inability to love.

Voldemort's wand is made from yew wood and contains a phoenix feather core. It is considered a &quot;brother&quot; to Harry Potter's holly wand because the feather in each was donated by the same phoenix, Fawkes, who is Albus Dumbledore's beloved pet.

Voldemort's chosen name originates from the French ''&quot;vol de mort&quot;'', or &quot;flight from death&quot; in English. This is an excellent example of the series' possibly excessive matching of name to character; Voldemort's main desire in the series is to escape death.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Voldemort killed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] as he attempted to murder their one-year-old son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. Harry survived, but Voldemort apparently died when his curse rebounded upon him, though some doubted he was truly gone. The attack left Harry with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], introducing Harry, now eleven, to the Wizarding world, mentions Voldemort, and explains how Harry made him vanish. Hagrid personally believes there was too little that was still human in Voldemort to die.

While at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander's]] wand shop, Harry tries one particular wand which Ollivander had evidently been holding in reserve. It suits Harry perfectly. Mr. Ollivander tells him, &quot;It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when ... its brother gave you that scar... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter ... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things – terrible, yes, but great.&quot; 

Voldemort is first seen during the climactic battle in Hogwarts' dungeon. Voldemort's surviving spirit possesses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]'s body, controlling Quirrell as he attempts to steal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] and kill Harry. It is revealed that it was Voldemort who was driving many events in the story: 

*Voldemort, aided by Quirrell, had attempted to steal the Stone from Gringotts Bank, not knowing that Hagrid had removed it earlier that same day. 

*Harry's scar first pains him at the Welcome Feast, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] is looking at him. Voldemort by now is riding the back of Quirrell's head, concealed by a turban, and may be the reason Harry's scar pains him. Harry notes that Quirrell was not wearing a turban at the Leaky Cauldron. 

*At Voldemort's apparent bidding, Quirrell hexed Harry's broom during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch match]] against Slytherin. Harry was saved by Professor Snape.

*It was Quirrell, again at Voldemort's instructions, who was killing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorns]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] so Voldemort could drink their blood to sustain his tenuous life. Harry's scar seared when he encountered the robed figure that killed the unicorns.

*In the end, Voldemort propels Quirrell through an elaborate security maze protecting the Stone at Hogwarts. He wants Harry, who also bypassed the security, to fetch the Stone, then orders Quirrell to kill him. During the battle with Quirrell and Voldemort, Harry is nearly incapacitated by pain searing inside his scar. With Quirrell's defeat and (probable) death, Voldemort is forced to flee his body and find a new host. 

Harry realizes, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] confirms, that his scar causes him pain whenever Voldemort is nearby. Dumbledore theorizes that when Voldemort's killing curse rebounded off Harry, it left a lasting connection between Harry and Voldemort. He withholds any additional details, however.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Voldemort never acts directly in this book; instead, the story is driven by a remnant of his younger self, contained in a magical diary, when he still used his birth name, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]. Details are under that character entry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Lord Voldemort is not seen directly, as he hides and regains strength. At the end, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] (Wormtail) returns to serve him after escaping Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Voldemort is heard, though remains unseen, when he occupies the old [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Riddle Manor|Riddle manor]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], the elderly Muggle caretaker, investigates when he sees lights in the supposedly deserted house. Inside, he eavesdrops on Voldemort and Pettigrew. Voldemort mentions his one ''faithful'' servant, apparently not Pettigrew, and the two plot to murder someone named Harry Potter. When Bryce is discovered, Voldemort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kills]] him. 

His scar searing, Harry awakens from a nightmare&amp;mdash;Voldemort has just murdered someone. Pain in his scar can indicate that Voldemort is nearby, and Harry worries about being attacked on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. Much later, Harry has another dream that Pettigrew is being punished. 

During the Triwizard Tournament, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] simultaneously grab the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|trophy]], only to discover it is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] that transports them to a cemetery. There, Voldemort orders Pettigrew to kill Cedric and bind Harry.

Voldemort's body is like a hideous baby, with snake-like, scaled skin, slitted eyes, and a grown man's malevolence. To restore Voldemort's body, Harry's blood, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Voldemort's father's]] bone, and Pettigrew's own flesh (his right hand) are added to a potion, making him human. Exulting in his newly restored self, Voldemort briefly taunts Harry, then, ignoring the whimpering Pettigrew, summons his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]].

Voldemort greets his servants, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. One is promptly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|tortured]] for doubting the Dark Lord would return. Voldemort says he never forgives, nor forgets, and he requires repayment for his Death Eaters having denied him. He rewards Pettigrew's service, conjuring him a magical silver hand to replace the severed one.

After his failed attack on baby Harry, Voldemort's disembodied soul had wandered for years, occupying small animals, then attached itself to a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|weak wizard]]. After failing to capture the Philosopher's Stone and losing his host, he was a detached spirit again until Pettigrew found him. One true ally was left who could capture Harry Potter, but until then, Pettigrew crafted him a rudimentary body and sustained him with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]]'s venom. With Harry's blood inside him, he can now overcome the protection Lily's death had given Harry.

Harry's wand is returned, and he is forced to duel Voldemort. Harry casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|the Disarmament spell]] as Voldemort hurls the Killing Curse. A golden stream unites their wands, and a gold light dome forms around them. Harry's wand heats up, and he forces the light beads that have formed on the stream into Voldemort's wand. Cedric's shade ejects from Voldemort's wand, then Frank Bryce, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], and James and Lily Potter emerge. His parents explain they can briefly protect Harry when he breaks the stream. When the connection is broken, the shades rush at Voldemort as Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summons]] the Triwizard Cup, transporting himself and Cedric's body to Hogwarts.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], who is actually Voldemort's servant, guides Harry to his office,then admits he rigged the Tournament. As he is about to fatally curse Harry, Dumbledore bursts in and stuns Moody, who is revealed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], disguised by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]. Under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], Barty confesses that he and Pettigrew kidnapped Moody so Barty, Jr. could assume his identity, specifically to lure Harry into Voldemort's trap.

After Dementors have sucked out Barty's soul before he could confess, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] discounts Harry's story, claiming Dumbledore fabricated it. After Fudge's angry departure, Dumbledore assigns missions for Hagrid and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madam Maxime]]; for Professor Snape; and also Sirius Black.

At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore informs the entire school that Voldemort has returned and murdered Cedric Diggory. Dumbledore believes students should know the truth despite the Wizarding world's denial.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

The Wizarding world doubts claims that Voldemort has returned, leaving Harry edgy all summer. He listens to the Muggle news for any unexplained deaths or possible magical disturbances, and scans [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] for any signs. Ron's and Hermione's deliberately vague letters only increase the tension, fueling Harry's anger. 

After a Dementor attack near his home, Harry is taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], Sirius Black's home and now headquarters for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. The Order believes Voldemort remains hidden while rebuilding his organization, though Harry's announcing his return has impeded Voldemort's efforts. Harry learns Voldemort may be seeking a powerful weapon. When Hermione notices Harry's scar hurting him, Harry discounts it, claiming it happens frequently now.

At Hogwarts, some Gryffindors doubt Harry and Dumbledore's claims regarding Voldemort. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] supports Harry, echoing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother's]] belief that Dumbledore is far more trustworthy than the ''Daily Prophet''. 

Soon, Harry runs afoul of the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, and Ministry spy, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], for claiming Voldemort has returned. She assigns him two weeks detention that is tantamount to torture. When Umbridge happens to touch Harry's hand, his scar sears, causing Harry to suspect she could be linked to Voldemort. He stubbornly refuses to tell Dumbledore, feeling stung by the headmaster's continually avoiding him. Sirius assures Harry that the Order believes there is no connection between Umbridge and Voldemort. 

Fed up with Umbridge's useless lessons, Hermione and Ron urge Harry to teach students real defensive magic. He reluctantly agrees, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] is formed. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]] complains that the Disarming jinx Harry demonstrates is too easy until Harry explains how he effectively used it against Voldemort.

Harry repeatedly dreams about a long corridor with a doorway at the end that he longs to enter. His scar hurting seems related to Voldemort, and Harry can feel the Dark Lord's emotions.

Meanwhile, Hagrid returns from his secret mission to recruit the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]] against Voldemort. Hagrid failed because Death Eaters had already offered bigger rewards.

Shortly before Christmas, a terrible pain awakens Harry after he saw [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] being attacked at the Ministry. Dumbledore alerts the Order, then sends the Weasley children and Harry to Grimmauld Place. When Dumbledore briefly glances into Harry's eyes, Harry feels the snake he saw in his dream wanting to attack Dumbledore.

Harry and the Weasley children happen to overhear Mad Eye Moody say that Harry and Voldemort may share a mental connection. Harry, fearing Voldemort can see into Headquarters through him, wants to leave until Dumbledore delivers a stern message: &quot;Stay where you are.&quot; Harry relents, but fears Voldemort could be possessing him until Ginny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|having been possessed by him]], assures Harry he is not.

During his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] lessons with Snape, Harry recognizes the long hallway as one at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Harry, Ron, and Hermione later conclude that the weapon Voldemort seeks is in the Ministry. Harry can feel Voldemort's joy when ten Death Eaters escape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison, leading Hermione to suspect the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] have defected to Voldemort. Meanwhile, Harry wonders if Snape's lesson are actually opening his mind to Voldemort rather than blocking it.

Harry dreams that Voldemort is torturing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|someone]] after being told his plan will fail. When a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|patient]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]] dies, Harry and Hermione conclude he had been under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] to steal the weapon. Voldemort likely had him killed because he was recovering from the protective spells that temporarily drove him insane.

In his next Occlumency lesson, Snape suddenly breaks Harry's vision just as he reaches the doorway and finds it open. Shortly after Dumbledore's ouster from Hogwarts, Harry dreams about the corridor and the door again, this time entering a room with rows of shelves containing dusty phials. What he wants is almost within his grasp, but he is awakened.

Harry &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort torturing Sirius and rushes to the Ministry, unaware it is a trap. He and fellow Dumbledore's Army members are ambushed by Death Eaters seeking a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] concerning Harry and Voldemort. Sirius and Order of the Phoenix members arrive in time and neutralize the Death Eaters, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] kills Sirius. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore's sudden arrival erupts into a fierce duel. Finally, Voldemort possesses Harry, but Harry's overwhelming emotions of love and friendship drive him out. Voldemort escapes with Bellatrix.

Back in his office, Dumbledore tries to calm a distraught Harry by claiming responsibility for Sirius' death; had he been more open with Harry, he would have recognized Voldemort's trap. The curse leaving Harry's scar had forged a link between Harry and Voldemort, enabling Harry to sense Voldemort's emotions and, occasionally, see his thoughts. Voldemort only recently discovered the link. Dumbledore had been avoiding Harry to prevent Voldemort from gaining information, and it is why Snape was teaching Harry Occlumency, though their mutual animosity made that impossible. Voldemort implanted false images into Harry's mind to lure him into an ambush. 

Dumbledore also explains why Harry was placed with the Dursleys: Lily's sacrificing herself to save Harry cast a powerful magical charm that has protected him from Voldemort ever since. Only his remaining in a home with his mother's blood kin – his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] - sustains the charm's effect. Despite the Dursleys' cruelty, Harry's physical safety was more important than his emotional well-being. 

A prophecy made shortly before Harry's birth is why Voldemort wanted to kill him. Voldemort only heard its first half, and he needed Harry to recover the copy stored at the Ministry. The prophecy, about someone with &quot;the power to vanquish the Dark Lord,&quot; could have referred to either Harry or Neville Longbottom. Because Voldemort chose to kill Harry, a &quot;half-blood&quot; like himself, he marked Harry as his equal. The power that Harry has and Voldemort lacks is love. Its power protected Harry from Voldemort, and that strength will enable him to defeat the Dark Lord. Dumbledore also confirms that, according to the prophecy, one must kill the other.

With the Ministry finally admitting that Voldemort has returned, Dumbledore is re-instated as Headmaster of Hogwarts, and in his other offices.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] introduces new Minister for Magic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]] to the British Prime Minister. Fudge reports that the recent crises plaguing the Muggle world is due to Lord Voldemort having returned. As a result, Fudge has resigned.

Meanwhile, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]] pleads for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape's]] help. Voldemort has assigned her son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]], a nearly impossible and probably fatal task. She believes Voldemort is risking Draco's life to punish her husband, Lucius, for his failure at the Ministry. Bellatrix Lestrange, however, questions Snape's loyalty, though Snape refutes this, saying he has earned Voldemort's trust. Snape refuses to attempt to change the Dark Lord's intent, but agrees to swear an '[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]]' to protect Draco and complete this mission should Draco fail.

After publicly acknowledging Voldemort's return, the Ministry has flooded the Wizarding realm with propaganda planted in the ''Daily Prophet'', and published pamphlets containing supposedly useful information.

Dumbledore speculates that Voldemort found Harry's mind too painful to inhabit and will not attempt to possess him again. Voldemort is likely also worried that Harry will peer into his own mind, and is probably blocking contact using Occlumency.

Harry and Dumbledore study Lord Voldemort's early years by viewing donated memories in Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. Voldemort's mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], is Salazar Slytherin's direct descendant, and his father is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]]. During this time period, Voldemort is known by his birth name, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle#Half-Blood Prince|''Tom Marvolo Riddle'']]. In a later session with the Pensieve, Dumbledore notes Tom's changed appearance and comments about his using the name Voldemort. As this study was done using Riddle's birth name, additional details are under that character topic.

Voldemort has informed Draco about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], and has ordered him to murder Dumbledore. This is likely the same mission Narcissa Malfoy was distressed about, suspecting Draco would fail and then be killed by Voldemort. Snape fulfills the Unbreakable Vow by killing Dumbledore in Draco's place. As Snape and Draco flee Hogwarts, Snape prevents the other Death Eaters from killing Harry, saying Voldemort wants Harry for himself.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], the Dark Lord's new headquarters, Voldemort holds court with his Death Eaters. Believing Harry's wand is more powerful against his own, its twin, Voldemort demands Lucius Malfoy's wand. Malfoy's position at the table's far end reflects how much he has fallen from Voldemort's favor, while Snape now sits beside the Dark Lord. Voldemort also taunts Bellatrix Lestrange, even though she serves him faithfully. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charity Burbage|Charity Burbage]], the Hogwarts' Muggle Studies professor, is suspended and tightly bound above the table. For having advocated inter-marriage with Muggles, Voldemort casts a lethal curse at her.

The Order of the Phoenix, meanwhile, is transferring Harry to a safe house shortly before his late mother's magical protection ends. Six protectors paired with a Harry Potter decoy will fly to separate safe houses, while the real Harry goes with Hagrid. As the group takes off, Death Eaters, tipped off by Snape, immediately attack. When Harry is identified by his signature [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Disarming]] spell, Voldemort suddenly appears. In the screaming confusion, Harry's wand independently casts a golden spell, shattering Voldemort's borrowed wand. Harry and Hagrid barely reach the safe house alive. Everyone arrives safely except [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|&quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody]], who apparently has been killed.

Harry, fearing he is endangering everyone, wants to leave The Burrow, but is overruled. Shortly after, he &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort torturing Ollivander, demanding to know how Harry destroyed his borrowed wand, though Ollivander does not fully understand the reason. Harry, eager to start his quest, sarcastically remarks to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] that Voldemort will not just kill himself. She correctly guesses that Harry's mission is to kill Voldemort, though Harry pretends he was only joking to allay her fears. Harry &quot;dreams&quot; that Voldemort is searching for someone named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], and recalls Mr. Ollivander once mentioning that Gregorovitch crafted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum's]] wand. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] sends a warning that the Ministry of Magic has fallen to Voldemort, and Prime Minister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]] is dead. As Death Eaters attack The Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape to Grimmauld Place. Harry again watches through Voldemort's eyes as a terrified Draco Malfoy is forced to torture [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|a Death Eater]] for letting Harry escape.

Sirius' brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Arcturus Black]] is identified as the mysterious R.A.B. who left the note inside the fake Locket Horcrux. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] tells Harry that Mundungus Fletcher stole the real Locket Horcrux from Grimmauld Place, and explains its connection to Regulus: when Voldemort needed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elf's]] assistance to hide a locket in a sea cave, Regulus sent Kreacher. Voldemort abandoned Kreacher to die there, but he returned to his master. Regulus retrieved the real Locket Horcrux, replacing it with a fake, though he died in the attempt. Harry, still upset by Kreacher having betrayed Sirius, is bothered more by Voldemort abusing the house-elf.

Voldemort now controls the Ministry: Muggle-born wizards and witches are being rounded up and their wands confiscated. All magical children in England must only attend Hogwarts, now headed by Severus Snape.  

After the Trio recover the real Locket Horcrux, Ron requests they avoid speaking Voldemort's name aloud&amp;mdash;it feels jinxed. (Note: for the remaining story, Harry, Hermione, and Ron generally only use Voldemort's common euphemisms such as, &quot;You-Know-Who&quot;, and &quot;He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&quot;, though, for brevity, this summary will continue to call him Voldemort.)

Shortly after, Harry &quot;sees&quot; Voldemort demanding something that Gregorovitch claims was stolen long ago. In Gregorovitch's memory, a young, blond thief [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] Gregorovitch and escaped with a wand. Voldemort then kills Gregorovitch.

Ron leaves the mission, and Harry and Hermione go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] to see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]. After Harry is led upstairs, Nagini, Voldemort's snake, pours from Bathilda's dead body as it crumples to the floor. As Harry is attacked, Hermione rescues him just as Voldemort appears. While recovering, Harry sees into the Dark Lord's memories, watching as, sixteen years before, Voldemort kills his parents and attempts to murder Harry.

Hermione shows Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book, ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' and a photo of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], the blond thief who stole the Elder Wand from Gregorovitch. Voldemort also has Grindelwald's photo, taken from Bathilda's house. 

Ron returns bearing a spare wand to replace Harry's destroyed one, and he updates them about the Wizarding world&amp;mdash;speaking Voldemort's name summons Death Eaters or Snatchers (Voldemort's bounty hunters). The Trio seeks out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]] for information about a mysterious symbol. He tells them about the Peverells and the Tale of the Three Brothers and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. Harry believes the Hallows could make him invincible against Voldemort. A ring handed down from the Peverells could contain the Resurrection Stone, and it may be hidden inside the Snitch that Dumbledore bequeathed to Harry. Harry's own Invisibility Cloak may also be a Hallow, while Voldemort seeks only the Elder Wand, the third Hallow.

Harry inadvertently speaks Voldemort's name, and Snatchers immediately appear. As the Trio and other captives are taken to Malfoy Manor, Harry sees Voldemort inside a tall tower where an old man (Grindelwald) says he knows what Voldemort wants, but claims he never had it. With Dobby's help, the Trio, along with the other prisoners, escape Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage. While there, the goblin [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] agrees to help Harry break into Bellatrix Lestrange's Gringotts vault, that Harry now suspects contains another Horcrux. Mr. Ollivander confirms that Voldemort seeks the Elder Wand, believing it is more powerful against Harry's. Despite its bloody history, only capture, not murder, is necessary to win the wand's allegiance. Harry watches as Voldemort removes the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb.

After Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape Gringotts with the Cup Horcrux, Harry sees Voldemort's fury. Though he believes his other Horcruxes are safe, he will check on them, including one hidden at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione then race to Hogwarts. Harry knows Nagini may also be a Horcrux and that Voldemort is aware his Horcruxes are under attack. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]] helps the Trio sneak into Hogwarts through the Room of Requirement where Dumbledore's Army members are hiding. Harry feels Voldemort's rage as he discovers the Locket Horcrux is missing. Meanwhile, the Order and other allies begin secretly pouring into Hogwarts to prepare for battle. Harry frantically searches for Ravenclaw's lost diadem, another Horcrux, as Voldemort and his army march to Hogwarts. Snape, ousted from the school, rejoins Voldemort, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and the other faculty secure the castle. Outside Hogwarts, Voldemort's voice offers a reward for Harry Potter. 

As the battle begins, Harry, Ron, and Hermione find the Diadem Horcrux inside the transformed Room of Requirement. Draco Malfoy, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] attempt to stop them but fail, and the Diadem is destroyed. Draco may have been trying to regain Voldemort's favor. 

Harry locates Voldemort in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]]. Hiding inside, Harry, Ron, and Hermione overhear Voldemort tell Snape that he suspects Snape actually commands the Elder Wand by having murdered Dumbledore. To gain its allegiance, Voldemort orders Nagini to kill Snape, then leaves. Dying, Snape hands Harry his memories.

Voldemort's voice announces that Harry Potter has one hour to surrender, otherwise, everyone at Hogwarts will die. Harry, meanwhile, watches Snape's memories in a penseive. Snape had deeply loved Harry's mother, Lily, but Snape's affiliation with future Death Eaters at Hogwarts acrimoniously ended their friendship. Snape carried the prophecy to Voldemort, but when Voldemort said Lily must die, Snape defected to Dumbledore, who swore Snape to spy on Voldemort in exchange for Lily's protection. But Peter Pettigrew's betrayal allowed Voldemort to kill James and Lily. Dumbledore held Snape to his promise, saying that all he could do now was to protect Harry, Lily's child. 

In a different memory, Snape has temporarily contained a deadly curse in Dumbledore's hand that was infected when he put on the Ring Horcrux. Dumbledore has about one year to live. They discuss Voldemort's plot to use Draco to murder Dumbledore. Voldemort expects Draco to fail so he can then kill Draco to punish Lucius Malfoy. Voldemort likely anticipates Snape will finish Draco's task, but once Dumbledore is dead, the Dark Lord will no longer need a spy at Hogwarts. Dumbledore charges Snape with protecting the school once he is gone.

In yet another memory, Dumbledore tells Snape that Voldemort's soul shard had fastened itself to Harry, creating the link between Voldemort and Harry. However, to defeat Voldemort, Harry, and the soul fragment, must be killed by Voldemort. Snape is dismayed that Dumbledore protected Harry only to sacrifice him to Voldemort.

Sometime later, Dumbledore's portrait tells Snape that to retain Voldemort's trust, he must reveal Harry's true departure date from Privet Drive to the Dark Lord. If Snape can plant the idea to have multiple Potter decoys into Mundungus Fletcher's mind, Harry may escape unscathed.

Harry goes to the Forbidden Forest and surrenders himself to Voldemort, who casts a Killing Curse. Harry, believing himself dead, appears to be in a deserted King's Cross Station. On the floor, a small, flayed creature wails in pain. Albus Dumbledore appears and explains that when Voldemort used Harry's blood to re-animate himself, he unintentioally extended Lily Potter's protection; Harry's life was then tethered to Voldemort's.

Dumbledore speculates the two wands, already connected by their identical magical cores, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|had merged closer]] during Harry and Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|duel]]. The wands' masters were also tied by their souls and blood, though Harry was the stronger wizard; Voldemort feared death, while Harry embraced the possibility, enabling his wand to imbibe some powers from Voldemort's, making it more powerful than any wand Voldemort wielded, even the Elder Wand. Now Harry can choose to &quot;continue on&quot; or return to the living world. Harry chooses to return.

Returning to himself, Harry pretends to be dead while Voldemort displays his body to the allies. Several things then happen simultaneously: the students' families begin arriving as reinforcements; many magical denizens, including the Centaurs, join the allies; and Neville beheads Nagini with the Sword of Gryffindor, destroying the final Horcrux. 

Death Eaters storm the castle. Inside, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix after a fierce duel. Enraged, Voldemort attempts to fatally curse Molly, but Harry's shield charm blocks him. Harry tells Voldemort that Dumbledore outsmarted him, planning his own death so that Snape was never the Elder Wand's rightful owner. But Draco Malfoy unknowingly won the wand's allegiance when he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|disarmed Dumbledore]] atop the Astronomy Tower, only to lose its allegience when Harry captured Malfoy's wand. Because Harry willingly sacrificed himself to Voldemort, the same magic that once protected Harry, now protects his allies. 
 
Voldemort casts Avada Kedavra as Harry simultaneously conjures Expelliarmus. But Voldemort's killing curse rebounds, reflected by Harry's blood protection and the Elder Wand's allegiance to him. With all his Horcruxes destroyed, Voldemort dies instantly.

== Strengths ==

Lord Voldemort is an exceptionally brilliant and potent wizard. He was one of the most powerful wizards to ever exist. When Dumbledore first met him at the orphanage he was already aware of his magical abilities and used it to control and punish. This control of his powers mark him as a prodigy even as a young child. He becomes so proficient in Dark magic that Albus Dumbledore recognizes that he has entered into magical realms unknown to the average wizard. He apparently can fly without a broom, and his spells and curses are powerful and often deadly.

As a youth, Tom Riddle used his charm and guile to conceal his Dark and deceptive nature from all his Hogwarts teachers except Albus Dumbledore. Despite his cruelty and violence, Voldemort's charisma allowed him to recruit a devoted following while offering little in return. He becomes so powerful, that his Death Eaters remain loyal mainly out of fear, knowing they will be tortured or killed for any slight misstep. Once entering the Dark Lord's service, there is no leaving it.

Voldemort is also an accomplished [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimens]], able see into almost anyone's mind. There is some question as to whether he can penetrate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s mind, or whether Snape's skill at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] has protected him from that. Dumbledore is also likely able to block Voldemort.

== Weaknesses ==

An insatiable lust for power compels Voldemort to utilize any means to achieve total domination over the wizarding world. He is loyal to no one, and he never hesitates to kill anyone, including his own followers, either when he is enraged, or when it serves his purpose.  This was significantly undermining his power base, as his servants' loyalty to him was weakening.

There is only one wizard Voldemort fears: Albus Dumbledore, recognized as among the greatest and most powerful wizards ever. Once Dumbledore is dead, Voldemort seeks his wand, the Elder Wand, believing it will make him invincible, though he never bothers to understand why it is powerful.

Voldemort considers death the worst possible fate and has gone to extreme lengths seeking immortality. Dumbledore comments that when Harry and Voldemort dueled in the graveyard, Harry was the stronger wizard because he was prepared to die, if necessary, while Voldemort feared death despite his recent resurrection.

Voldemort is overconfident and continually ignores minor details, which often lead to his failures. In particular, he discounts any magic he is unable to understand, particularly that of non-human races like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elves]]. While he recognizes that love can have a magical effect, he never understands it and underestimates its power, considering most emotions a weakness, and it remains a purely academic concept. He himself is unable to love anyone or anything, though he is somewhat sentimentally attached to Hogwarts castle, considering it the only home he has ever known. While possessing Harry's body in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Harry's deep yearning to be rejoined with his beloved slain godfather drives Voldemort out. Harry's emotions are so overpowering and disturbing to Voldemort that he never attempts to possess Harry again, and he will consistently discount love's power.

Although Dumbledore mostly discounted it, because Voldemort so strongly believed in the prophecy stating that a &quot;chosen one&quot; would vanquish him, his actions became largely responsible for it eventually coming true. In effect, he created what he feared. By deliberately &quot;marking&quot; Harry as his enemy and killing his parents, he set the boy on a predetermined path leading to their eventual confrontation. Voldemort also failed to understand that love significantly empowered Harry, and always attributes Harry's repeated successes to luck and help from others, such as from Dumbledore.  He also particularly fixates on Harry's wand, believing it is the only thing standing between himself and Harry's ultimate defeat. Although the twin cores in Harry's wand and Voldemort's are unable to attack each other, Voldemort attributes some super-magical power to this. This mistaken belief is fueled by Snape, as Voldemort's closest confidant, who has claimed that Harry is only a moderately competent wizard, not a particularly strong one. Whether or not Snape actually believes this or was deliberately misleading the Dark Lord, Voldemort accepts Snape's words as fact.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Voldemort calls Death Eaters his true family, though he has compassion for none, using them only as servants rather than comrades, eliminating them almost capriciously if they fail him in some way, are unfortunate enough to be in close proximity when he is enraged, or if it serves his evil plan. Indeed, Voldemort murders Severus Snape, who he probably considered among his most trusted and valuable Death Eaters after Snape killed Dumbledore, solely in an attempt to gain more magical power although he did express regret at doing so. Voldemort also shows no respect or allegiance to Bellatrix Lestrange, his most fanatical follower; he does rescue her during the Battle at the Ministry, though likely because she was still useful to him, rather than feeling any loyalty to her.

Voldemort became obsessed with Harry Potter after he failed to kill the one-year-old boy – livid that a helpless infant caused his downfall. He later seeks revenge on Harry to prove that he, Voldemort, is the most feared and powerful wizard of all time. Voldemort considers Harry weak in comparison to himself and he always discounted how love's power has aided Harry. But after possessing Harry's mind, Harry's overwhelming emotions for his friends and family are so overpowering and disturbing to Voldemort that they drive him out. He never attempts to possess Harry again.

Even from an early age, Voldemort considered himself superior to all other wizards except one – Albus Dumbledore, said to be the only one he ever feared. When he first met the eleven-year-old Tom Riddle, Dumbledore sensed this wizard was different, though he never suspected the young boy would become the most malevolent Dark wizard ever known. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore resolved to keep an eye on Riddle while concealing his suspicions, hoping Tom had abandoned his thieving and cruelty. Tom, meanwhile, cultivated a false facade, charming many, while quietly sowing his evil empire, recruiting fellow Slytherins to become his first Death Eaters. Dumbledore suspected Tom was engaging in some Dark activities at Hogwarts, particularly after a Muggle-born girl was killed. From then on, he watched Riddle even more closely, but could never prove he was involved in anything while he was still a student at Hogwarts.

== Analysis ==

Lord Voldemort, née Tom Marvolo Riddle, is the primary antagonist in the Harry Potter series, and the only living descendant of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] (by way of his mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], and her father [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]]). His only allegiance is to himself, and he is obsessed with achieving immortality and obtaining total power. Voldemort advocates pure-blood elitism, despite having a Muggle father and witch mother, making him a half-blood, and considers other &quot;Mudbloods&quot; as filth.

Much of Voldemort's character was shaped by his difficult and lonely childhood in a Muggle orphanage. While there, he remained friendless, partially because the Muggle orphans feared and shunned the strange boy, but also because he felt superior and apart from them. Knowing that he possessed unusual powers others lacked, Tom engaged in cruel acts against his fellow orphans, often stealing their possessions as trophies. Voldemort had a multifaceted personality, but upon entering Hogwarts, and knowing that Dumbledore at least partially understood his true nature, he crafted a new persona for himself. He became a seemingly quiet, model student, using charm and guile to win his instructors' favor and gather peers. This charisma helped fuel his later rise to power, gaining him many loyal followers who adopted his pure-blood ideology. Voldemort rarely appreciated or rewarded this loyalty, however, and ruled through fear, cruelty, and intimidation, even with his most devoted servants, solely to attain his goals.

It is unknown if Tom's Muggle father, Tom Riddle Sr., ever knew his son existed, apparently having been duped into a bogus marriage by Merope Gaunt, who probably used a love potion to entrap him. Riddle left her before Tom was born. Regardless, Tom grew up deeply loathing his father for abandoning him and his mother, who died heartbroken shortly after Tom's birth. Tom so despised his Muggle blood, that he murdered his Riddle relatives in an attempt to erase his &quot;tainted&quot; heritage. 

Whether or not Tom would have developed any differently if either or both his parents had raised him can only be speculated about. The Riddle family would have been unable to understand or control Tom's unique powers, probably fearing and rejecting him, while he could have considered them weak, inferior, and possibly disposable. His Gaunt relatives, meanwhile, were firmly entrenched in their haughty, pure-blood beliefs, considering themselves superior to all wizards, even other pure-bloods, due solely to their ancestry and despite previous generations having squandered the Gaunt fortune that had long ago sunk the family into poverty and a low-class status. They epitomized the Slytherin belief that they were owed whatever they wanted. This environment likely would have warped Tom's development, though Merope apparently eschewed at least some Gaunt beliefs and had defied her family by marrying a Muggle, seeking a better life.   

Like his Gaunt family, Voldemort is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|parselmouth]], the ability to speak with snakes. This trait is descended from his ancestor, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. As Slytherin's heir, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], Tom Riddle's memory that is stored in a diary is the only one able to control the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|basilisk]]. Aware that Harry is also a Parselmouth, Riddle warns him that the basilisk will not answer him; Harry heeds his advice. When Voldemort attempted to murder baby Harry, he had unknowingly transferred some powers, including Parseltongue, to the boy. Just why this occurred is explained more fully in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

More than anything, Voldemort feared death. The name, Voldemort, can be interpreted as &quot;flight from death&quot; in French. To achieve immortality, Voldemort splintered his soul into multiple pieces, embedding them into objects known as Horcruxes.  As long as any Horcrux survived, Voldemort could not be killed. By shredding his soul this way, it was irreparably damaged, and as Harry systematically destroyed the Horcruxes, what remained likely became even more diminished, further dehumanizing Voldemort. Harry is tied to Voldemort by one of these soul shards, but also by his blood, used in Voldemort's resurrection, and by their wands. Voldemort's yew wand contains a phoenix feather core; one of only two feathers donated to the wand maker Mr. Ollivander by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], Dumbledore's loyal companion and animal familiar. Fawkes' other feather lies within Harry's wand.

Voldemort's reputation became so Dark and evil, that merely speaking his name aloud instilled dread into most who hear it. But as powerful and terrifying as the Dark Lord was, it was said that Albus Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort truly feared. Voldemort admitted that he himself had never, &quot;sought a duel,&quot; with Dumbledore, but later declares that Dumbledore is, &quot;getting weak in old age,&quot; and he is, &quot;not the wizard he once was&quot;. He considers Dumbledore's views regarding love and loyalty as a joke, believing only in power and the ability to use it. Voldemort's over-confidence and own self-indulgence eventually causes his downfall.

It is also interesting to note that Harry's scar never pains him in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], even when he is directly battling Tom Riddle's memory that was contained in the diary Horcrux. When Riddle attacks Harry in the Chamber, it is some forty years after the diary was created, and so the Voldemort that had inflicted the scar, and the Riddle that Harry was fighting, are quite different people. That is likely why Harry's scar fails to react to the young Riddle.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is worth remembering that '''Voldemort''', or '''Tom Marvolo Riddle''', as he was then known, was born in 1926 on the 31st of December. His world views were mostly formed in a London orphanage, and later at Hogwarts, at about the time that the National Socialist (Nazi) party was coming to power in Germany. This may have influenced his pureblooded wizarding views, and fostered the need to eradicate the Muggles that so closely mirror Aryan purity beliefs and the Final Solution proposed in Germany at that time. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58 The author has mentioned this similarity as well,] though she notes that she was rather taken by surprise on discovering the similarities in detail. This is not to say, or imply, that Voldemort was a Nazi, or had any sympathy for the Nazi party's aims; he no doubt viewed them as, if anything, an amusing but totally insignificant side show in the useless Muggle world. However, the &quot;racial purity&quot; idea, involving (in this case) eliminating anyone unable to prove that they were descended only from wizarding families, certainly may have provided the basis for Voldemort's many actions.

As mentioned, Harry's scar hurts him because Voldemort's soul fragment within him, recognized and reacted to Voldemort's soul (or what was left of it) whenever the two were in close proximity, or when Voldemort was experiencing strong emotions. The soul fragment that Harry was battling in the Chamber of Secrets had been splintered off Voldemort some forty years earlier, and so likely there was little recognition there; certainly not enough for the soul fragment in Harry to recognize it. In support of this, we should also note that Harry never reported any pain in his scar during the final confrontation with Voldemort, late in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], after the soul fragment that he carried had been killed.

In an interview following the final book's publication, the author stated that Harry's parselmouth ability, along with his connection to Voldemort's thoughts, vanished when Voldemort's soul shard within Harry was destroyed. The author has further stated that Harry has never missed this ability.

And so we reach the Italian Game.  White takes aim at Black's weak f7 Pawn. Now there are a number of options for Black. This opening is more reserved than the Ruy Lopez.

White's main plan is to take control of the center with a d4 push. He must choose if he does it right now--[[/4. d4/]] to get a lead in development (despite the loss of the pawn)--or if he prepares it with moves like [[/4. c3/]] or [[/4. b4/]].

White may also forget about the d4-push, and play a quieter line, by supporting the center with [[/4. d3/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;Osteosarcoma&lt;/b&gt; is the most common malignant primary bone tumor. Osteosarcoma tends to occur in children and young adults typically 10-25 or 30 years of age. Osteosarcomas also tend to occur in patients in the sixth decade, likely related to malignant degeneration of [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Paget disease|Paget's disease]]. It is said that they tend to occur most often towards the end of long bones in the metaphyseal region but they can also arise in the diaphysis and there is enough variation that this parameter is not terribly helpful in differentiation. A typical osteosarcoma is destructive with associated sclerosis from either malignant bone formation or reactive sclerosis. There are multiple types of osteosarcoma. The most common of which is the Conventional Osteosarcoma which accounts for 75% of cases. Conventional osteosarcoma is typically located around the knee and is a very aggressive lesion associated with a soft tissue mass, cortical destruction, a permeative pattern of bone change. Most demonstrate some degree of osteoid matrix. Conventional osteosarcomas commonly arise in the metadiaphysis but regularly (75%) cross the physis to involve the epiphysis. The distal femur and proximal tibia are the bones most commonly involved, followed by the humerus and iliac wing. They have a rapid doubling rate, are often large when discovered and are aggressive in appearance. Lesions are typically permeative with a wide zone of transition. Cortical breakthrough can be seen typically with a large soft tissue mass. Periosteal reaction typically presents with a Codman’s triangle or sunburst pattern. At least 90% of conventional osteosarcomas produce osteoid matrix in variable quantities which alters their radiographic appearance. Lesions that are dense appear low in signal on T1 and T2 sequences and if they are less dense, typically will be low signal on T1 and higher signal on T2 imaging.

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/b&gt; X-ray and CT demonstrate expansile mass centered in the femur with extensive osteoid matrix and cortical destruction.

Differential is quite short with a typical conventional osteosarcoma and includes [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Ewing sarcoma|Ewing's sarcoma]]. Metastases are said to occur in up to 10-20% of patient’s at clinical presentation and hematogenous spread to lungs or bones and lymphatic local spread are typical.

==Types==
===Parosteal Sarcoma===

[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Parosteal_Osteosarcoma|Parosteal osteosarcoma]] is the 2nd most common type of osteosarcoma. 80% occur between the ages of 20 and 50. They are commonly found at the distal femoral metaphysis, posteriorly, less commonly in the proximal tibia and humerus. [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Parosteal_Osteosarcoma|Parosteal osteosarcoma]] arises from the surface of the bone and is seen as a soft tissue mass often growing around the bone of origin. The osteoid matrix is typically more mature and densely sclerotic, especially centrally. MRI appearance is variable depending on the amount of osteoid formation, cellularity and presence of cartilage, usually appearing quite heterogeneous. If there is little cellularity and cartilage the lesion will be lower signal intensity. They are low grade tumors and grow slowly, but with recurrence can become more aggressive. Metastases are less common than with conventional osteosarcoma but can metastasize to the lung. Differential includes myositis ossificans, cortical desmoid tumor and [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteochondroma|osteochondroma]]. Myositis ossificans is typically more dense peripherally rather than centrally, helping in differentiation. [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteochondroma|Osteochondroma]] has more normal appearing marrow and cortical bone.

===Telangiectatic Osteosarcoma===

[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Telangiectatic_Osteosarcoma|Telangiectatic osteosarcoma]] is a rare variant that present as an entirely lytic bone lesion with a much less aggressive appearance. Typical age is 10-25 years of age and lesions commonly occur in the metadiaphysis of long bones, similar to conventional osteosarcoma. Lesions are more geographic but portions of the mass can have a wide zone of transition and cortical breakthrough with a soft tissue mass. Lesions are highly vascular, partly necrotic and often have large pools of blood within them with soft tissue peripherally and along septa. Leading to an MRI appearance with internal septa, fluid fluid levels, peripheral heterogeneity. [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Telangiectatic_Osteosarcoma|Telangiectatic osteosarcoma]] commonly enhances. Differential includes [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Aneurysmal_Bone_Cyst|aneurysmal bone cyst]] and [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Giant cell tumor|giant cell tumor]].

===Periosteal Osteosarcoma===

[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Periosteal _Osteosarcoma|Periosteal osteosarcoma]] are more rare than conventional or parosteal osteosarcoma and arises from the surface of the bone, most commonly in diaphyses of femur and tibia. Age of presentation is typically 10-20 years of age. Scalloping of the adjacent cortex is common and there are often spicules of bone emanating from the lesion in a sunburst pattern. Also seen commonly is periosteal reaction. Intramedullary invasion and extension is uncommon. MRI signal is typically not helpful (low T1 and high T2.) Spicules of bone emanating in sunburst pattern tend to be low T2 in signal. Differential includes juxtacortical chondroma and high-grade surface osteosarcoma.

===High Grade Surface Osteosarcoma===

Rare subset of osteosarcoma similar to periosteal subtype commonly occurs in the diaphyses and is more often associated with intramedullary invasion. Low Grade Intraosseous Osteosarcoma Rare entirely intraosseous tumor that is quite variable in appearance and can occur in the diaphyses or metadiaphyses. Age- &lt;30 Soft Tissue Osteosarcoma Another rare form of osteosarcoma found most commonly in the thigh, upper extremity or retroperitoneum. Masses have variable amounts of mineralized osteoid. 

===Osteosarcoma in older patients (&gt;60)===

Osteosarcomas in older patients can be primary lesions but around 50% are thought to arise in pre-existing lesions like [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Ewing sarcoma|Ewing's sarcoma]], dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma or previously irradiated tissues. Most lesions are entirely lytic and can occur in the facial bones, axial skeleton and in the soft tissues. Appearance varies greatly with origin. 

==Imaging Workup== 

Typical imaging of any suspected osteosarcoma should include a PA and lateral view of the chest to help rule out metastatic lesions. Specific imaging of the lesion should include X-ray - Plain films of the lesion in question or affected anatomy. 

*CT Scan - Better evaluates the bone lesion and soft tissue involvement. CT of the chest may be performed to improve sensitivity for detection of pulmonary metastasis. 

*MRI - MRI of primary lesion best evaluates the intramedullary extension and the extent of soft tissue involvement. Additionally, MRI is the most sensitive modality for detection of skip lesions or local metastases. MRI is much more accurate for determination of surgical margins than CT. 

*Bone Scan - Helpful to detect metastatic lesions. 

==Treatment==

Treatment is usually performed with both chemotherapy and primary resection. Prior to chemotherapy administration, up to 80% of patients treated with surgical excision of primary tumor developed pulmonary metastases. Postoperative, adjuvant chemotherapy is now standard of care. Surgical excision of primary lesion remains the primary treatment modality.

MRI is important for defining the surgical margins especially in the bone marrow. Surgical margins of ~6cm from the edge of abnormal MRI signal are considered adequate. The margins are much less extreme in the soft tissues. Surgical excision of pulmonary metastases is typically via wedge resection. Follow up imaging - Imaging protocols vary but are often done at 3 months for the first year then at 6 months for the next year or two. After the first two or three years it is common to continue with annual MRI. Additional imaging would of course be dictated by changing symptoms.

== Basic principles ==
Aerodynamic analysis attempts to progressively analyze the flows in the aerodynamic stages. Practical design includes substantial theoretical, computational and experimental analysis.

The stagnation or total temperatures and pressures are needed to measure the energy additions in high speed gas flows that occur in gas turbines. Using the Mach number allows us to factor in the compressibility of the gas.


=== Compressible fluid flow equations ===
See [[http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/reports/1953/naca-report-1135/naca-report-1135.pdf  NACA 1135: Equations, Tables, and Charts for Compressible Flow]].

==== Continuity ==== 
In a steady flow, for any two sections of the flow on a stream tube

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_1 c_1 A_1 = \rho_2 c_2 A_2 &lt;/math&gt;

or in differential form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} (\rho c A) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\rho}{\rho} + \frac{dc}{c} + \frac{dA}{A} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the fluid

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; and

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional Area for the tube or channel

==== Momentum ==== 
The net force on the control volume matches the momentum change in the fluid 

:&lt;i&gt;Adp=-&amp;rho;A c dc&lt;/i&gt;
:&lt;i&gt;dp=-&amp;rho;c dc&lt;/i&gt;

==== Energy ====
The change in enthalpy is balanced by the change in kinetic energy

:&lt;i&gt;dh + c dc=0&lt;/i&gt;

Where &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; is enthalpy per unit mass

and &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; is velocity of flow.

==== Enthalpy ====
The enthalpy of a gas h at temperature T is 

:&lt;math&gt;h = c_p T&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the constant pressure specific heat of the gas. For air &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt;  is about 1.005 kJ/kg K.

==== Stagnation temperature ====
Stagnation temperature is the temperature of the gas if it is brought to rest adiabatically.
Adding the kinetic energy to the internal energy of the gas we get the relation

:&lt;math&gt;h_t = c_p T_t = c_p T + \frac{c^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_t =  T + \frac{c^2}{2 c_p} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the total(stagnation) temperature of the flow. 

The total enthalpy relation encapsulates the energy changes in isentropic compressors and turbines.  To add energy to the flow the gas is put through a relative deceleration process against the compressor and diffuser surfaces and gains energy. To extract energy the gas is accelerated against nozzles and turbine buckets.

The Mach number of the flow is 

:&lt;math&gt; M = \frac{c}{a}=\frac {c}{\sqrt{\gamma R T}}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting

:&lt;math&gt;T_t =  T + \frac {\gamma R T M^2 }{ 2 c_p} &lt;/math&gt;


since &lt;i&gt; R= c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; &amp;gamma; = c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/i&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_t =  T\left(1 + \frac {\gamma M^2 }{2} (c_p-c_v)/c_p\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_t}{T}=\left(1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (greek letter gamma) is the adiabatic expansion coefficient between pressure and volume &lt;math&gt;p_1V_1^\gamma = p_2V_2^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

This is the temperature if the gas is brought to rest adiabatically.

==== Isentropic stagnation pressure ====
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_t}{p}=\left(\frac{T_t}{T}\right)^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_t}{p}=\left(1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Isentropic stagnation density ====
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\rho_t}{\rho}=\left(\frac{T_t}{T}\right)^{1/(\gamma-1)} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\rho_t}{\rho}=\left(1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)^{1/(\gamma-1)} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Duct flow ===
A steady inviscid adiabatic quasi-one dimensional flow obeys the following equations:

Differential continuity equation

:&lt;i&gt;d (&amp;rho; c A) =0 &lt;/i&gt;

Differential momentum equation

:&lt;i&gt;dp=-&amp;rho; c dc&lt;/i&gt;

Differential energy equation

:&lt;i&gt;dh + c dc=0&lt;/i&gt;

Rearranging continuity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\rho}{\rho}+\frac{d c}{c}+\frac{d A}{A}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Rewrite momentum equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d p}{\rho}=\frac{dp}{ d \rho }\frac{d \rho}{\rho} = -c dc&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ d \rho } \equiv \frac{\part p}{\part \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of sound is:

:&lt;i&gt;a =(dp / d&amp;rho;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Rearranging and substituting:

:&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=(dp / d&amp;rho;)&lt;/i&gt;

:&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; d&amp;rho; / &amp;rho; = -c dc&lt;/i&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \rho}{\rho}= -\frac{c dc}{ a^2 }= -\frac{c^2}{ a^2 } \frac{dc}{c}  = -M^2 \frac{dc}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into continuity equation

:&lt;math&gt;M^2 \frac{dc}{c}-\frac{d c}{c}-\frac{d A}{A}=0&lt;/math&gt;

We get the area velocity equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d A}{A} =(M^2-1) \frac{dc}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for acceleration (positive &lt;i&gt;dc/c&lt;/i&gt;) the area must decrease for Mach numbers below 1 and increase for Mach numbers above 1.

The relationship between Mach number and duct area related to the throat area A&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{A^*}= \frac {1}{M} \left[ \frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right) \right]^{\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The temperature relation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{T_t}= \left[ \frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right) \right]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

the pressure relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{p_t}= \left[ \frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right) \right]^{-\frac{\gamma}{2(\gamma-1)}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the density relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}= \left[ \frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right) \right]^{-\frac{1}{2(\gamma-1)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The figure below shows these relationships for air with &amp;gamma; of 1.4.

[[Image:nozzle-flow-kk-20060824.png|||800px|Isentropic flow through a duct]]

A fully expanded gas would approach a Mach number of infinity as it's temperature drops to absolute zero.

==== Mass flow ====
The figure above shows this exchange for a fluid with &amp;gamma;=1.4 undergoing an adiabatic expansion. Sonic velocity (Mach 1) is achieved when the pressure drops to 0.528 and the area for a particular mass flow is minimum at this Mach number. The flow at this condition is said to be choked and any further reductions in duct area will not produce acceleration of the stream. The mass flow per unit area is

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{m} = A \rho v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{m} = A \rho_0 \left[ \frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right) \right]^{-\frac{1}{\gamma-1}} V &lt;/math&gt;

=== Nozzles ===
A nozzle converts internal energy of the gas into directed kinetic energy by expanding along a pressure gradient. 

As the gas expands, initially the volume increment is smaller than the velocity increment and the stream tube converges. At M=1, the effects balance and for M&gt;1 the differential volume increase is greater than the velocity increase and a divergent stream is needed. The narrowest section of the nozzle is called the &quot;throat&quot;.

Decreasing the pressure at the exit of a nozzle of fixed geometry increases the exit velocity until the the velocity in the smallest section of the nozzle becomes sonic. The nozzle is then said to be &quot;choked&quot; and further reduction of the exit pressure has no effect on the flow upstream of the throat.

The maximum exit velocity depends on the energy content of the source gas.

&lt;/div&gt;{{-}}
---&gt;

==== Choked flow ====
Choked flow is the maximum flow that can pass through a passage for a given initial total conditions. Boundary layer effects further limit the flow through real nozzles.

=== Diffusers ===
A diffuser converts relative kinetic energy into pressure.

An ideal diffuser would recover the stagnation pressure, but practical diffusers cannot bring the fluid velocity to zero and have losses. The pressure recovered by such a diffuser is:  

:&lt;math&gt; \pi_d = p_{t2} / p_{t0} &lt;/math&gt;

A subsonic diffuser is a divergent passage. Diffusers operate in an adverse pressure gradient regime and the boundary layer development must be carefully managed to avoid flow separation. Boundary layers can be energized by extraction or aspiration but this has energy and complexity costs. 

Achieving stable supersonic diffusion without shockwaves is almost impossible, since instabilities become rapidly magnified as the flow can rapidly snap to become subsonic via a normal shockwave and accelerate in the convergent passage. Usually multiple inclined shockwaves are employed to minimize entropy rise.

=== Shocks ===
The shock is a thin boundary across which heat transfer and viscous heating make the flow subsonic. The isentropic relations above are not applicable across a shock wave. The total temperature across a shock (normal to the shock surface) remains constant but the total pressure is lost. The loss depends on the incident Mach number.

==== Normal shock ====
The Mach number M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; after the shock is:

:&lt;math&gt;M_2^2=\frac{1+[(\gamma-1)/2]M_1^2}{\gamma M_1^2-(\gamma-1)/2}&lt;/math&gt;

A higher incident Mach number will transition to a smaller downstream subsonic Mach number.

The density &amp;amp; velocity relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}=\frac{u_1}{u_2}=\frac{(\gamma+1)M_1^2}{2+(\gamma-1)M_1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

the pressure relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_2}{p_1}=1+\frac{2 \gamma }{\gamma+1}(M_1^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

and the temperature relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\frac{h_2}{h_1}=\left[1+\frac{2 \gamma }{\gamma+1}(M_1^2-1)\right] \frac{2+(\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\gamma+1)M_1^2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Inclined shock====

== Velocity triangles ==
Basic analysis of the effect of the blade rows on the airflow can be done through velocity triangles. The figure below shows a basic set of velocity triangles for compressor and turbine rows.

[[Image: velocity-triangles-kk-20050824.png|||640px]]

In the compressor the airflow is decelerated (diffused) in the velocity frame of the blade cascades. If the velocity of the inflow is u in the static frame then the rotor blades see the vector sum of u and &amp;omega;r which is the velocity of the blades whirling at angular speed ω at that particular radius r. The rotor blades turn the flow incoming in the rotor frame of reference at velocity v&lt;sub&gt;ri&lt;/sub&gt; and diffuse it down to velocity v&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;. The stator sees the incoming flow at u&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and diffuses it down to u&lt;sub&gt;se&lt;/sub&gt; and turns it back to the axial direction. The typical axial Mach number is around 0.6 and the rotor angular Mach number (&amp;omega;r/a) is kept as high as possible to maximize the compression per stage. Since the fundamental gas dynamic process in the compressor is subsonic and supersonic diffusion, the limitations are imposed by the boundary layers and adverse pressure gradients which amplify them. The ultimate limit of compression is when the boundary layer diverges on the suction side of the blades and the blade row stalls. 

The velocity triangles for compactness can be combined as shown on the right side since the angular velocity of the blade row is equal at inlet and exit.

In the turbine the airflow is accelerated (nozzled) in the velocity frame of the blade cascades. The incoming flow is accelerated and turned by the stators (nozzle vanes) to velocity u&lt;sub&gt;ri&lt;/sub&gt; and directed towards the turbine rotor. In the rotor frame of reference the flow comes in axially (or nearly so) at velocity v&lt;sub&gt;ri&lt;/sub&gt; and is accelerated and turned to velocity v&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;. The exit velocity u&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; then is nearly axial once the angular velocity &amp;omega;r of the turbine blades is subtracted. 

The turbine’s degree of reaction is the kinetic energy that occurs in the turbine rotor compared to the total kinetic change. The triangles above describe an approximately 50% reaction turbine. Impulse turbines have the rotor frame velocities v&lt;sub&gt;ri&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; changing only in direction indicating that inlet and exit incidence angles of the blades are equal in magnitude if the axial velocity does not change.

== Axial Compressors ==
Axial compressors are typically designed numerically since the flows in them are highly complex and three dimensional. The compression produced by the stage is determined by the tangential Mach number. The flow through the compressor depends on the axial Mach number and the area of the annulus. Improvements in design of the blades have allowed relative Mach numbers of 1.5 being achieved at the tip of the fan. The hub may be half the tip radius of the blades and the tangential velocity can vary by a factor of 2. Blades which operate supersonically for part of their span are called transonic.

Solidity is the ratio of the chord of the blades to the tangential distance subtended by the blade. Aspect ratio relates the blade chord to the blade length. The modern trend is towards lower aspect ratios. Higher aspect ratio blades tend to be lighter and blade loss is slightly less catastrophic an event. They often have part span shrouds to prevent flutter. Wide chord blades have recently been engineered to provide better performance, since they allow higher pressure ratios to be achieved. The width of the blade allows for a better shock structure in the supersonic regions of the blade, and a lower pressure gradient that delays separation. They can also avoid part span shrouds since their torsional rigidity is higher.

The blades act like staggered airfoils and they can tolerate a few degrees of incidence before the loss factor diverges. The loss factor is defined as the loss in total pressure divided by the dynamic pressure of the incident flow (p&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;-p). The minimum loss factor ranges from about 0.02 increasing with the inlet Mach number.

The compressor blade rows perform diffusion in reducing the velocity difference while increasing pressure.

=== Blade profiles ===
The earliest compressors employed circular arc blades. Double circular arcs have also been used, while modern compressors use more sophisticated 3D CFD designed blades.

=== Subsonic blades ===
For subsonic blades the passage widens as the air goes through it and simultaneously turns. The blades have higher inclination on the leading edge relative to the axial direction which reduces at the trailing edge resulting in a widening channel through which air must flow. The convex (surface) surface presents a large adverse pressure gradient which tends to enlarge the boundary layer. If the adverse gradient exceeds a critical level then flow separation and blade stalling occurs. 

Aspirated compressor blades evacuate the suction side boundary layer and allow for larger diffusion.

=== Transonic blades ===
Fan blades are typically transonic. The incident flow approached the blade at supersonic velocity. The initial diffusion happens through a converging wedge shaped passage that creates multiple inclined shocks terminated by a stronger normal shock in the passage that makes the flow subsonic. The subsonic flow is then further diffused by a diverging passage as in subsonic blades.  

Supersonic blading is easy to see in the outer periphery of the fans of commercial airliners. The leading edges are sharp and appear to be curved slightly in the opposite direction to create the supersonic wedge. The incident flow while highly 3 dimensional  is qualitatively comparable to the flow into a 2D intake of a supersonic aircraft such as the F-15.

For compressor stages it is advantageous to bring the flow subsonic by the use of variable stators. Most large modern engines have variable stators that allow subsonic blading to be used while providing good performance throughout the operational envelope. The variable stator adds swirl to the flow so that the Mach number variation between root and tip is reduced preventing stall at the root of the blades. 

=== Multistage compressors ===
For multiple compressor stages on a shaft the inlet Mach number progressively drops as the air is compressed and heats up.by

=== Mass flow ===
The mass flow in a duct is maximum if the Mach number is close to unity. The axial Mach number through the engine is kept close to one to reduce the blade heights. The blockage introduced by the hub and casing boundary layers, as well as the cross sectional area of the blades reduces the mass flow below the theoretical value. Actual axial Mach numbers range up to 0.6.

=== Loss mechanisms ===
Real compressors suffer from various loss mechanisms.

Tip leakage

Hub and casing boundary layers

Seal leakages

TBD

=== Stage performance ===
The corrected speed of the engine is defined as 

Corrected speed &lt;math&gt;= \frac{N}{(T_{t2}/T_t)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Off design behavior ===
A multistage compressor operating at speeds lower than designed or with lower pressure ratio than designed, will load the front stages more than the rear stages. This can result in stalling of the front stages. Variable stators and multiple shafts can be used to solve this. Most modern turbofans have multiple shafts as well as variable stators in the front compressor stages. The variable stators balance the compression between the front and rear stages at off design conditions.

=== Matching ===
The compressor and turbine flows are “matched” to provide sufficient flow through the turbine, as well as sufficient power at the right rpm for the compressor. The temperature increase in the combustor allows us to calculate the relative areas required  

=== Transients ===
Surge

To accelerate and engine the fuel added in the combustor is increased. This increases the temperature and the pressure in the combustor which now has to be generated by the compressor. If the compressor is too close to stall a surge may happen where the compressor stalls. In extreme cases the flow is reversed through the compressor and the hot combustor gases exit the front of the compressor. The cycle then continues at the Helmholtz frequency of the system till the disturbance is damped out. The engine controller is tasked with ensuring that the compressor doesn’t reach the surge line during acceleration.

In deceleration the fuel quantity is decreased and if the flame becomes too lean a flameout may occur.

Rotating stall

Unsteady flows in the compressor may cause some sections to stall (stall cells). These rotate with the blades and propagate from blade to blade, possibly exciting vibrations that can cause damage. The rotating stall precedes a full scale surge in which the compressor stalls in the entire circumference.

&lt;b&gt;Periosteal osteosarcoma&lt;/b&gt; are more rare than conventional or parosteal osteosarcoma and arises from the surface of the bone, most commonly in diaphyses of femur and tibia. Age of presentation is typically 10-20 years of age. Scalloping of the adjacent cortex is common and there are often spicules of bone emanating from the lesion in a sunburst pattern. Also seen commonly is periosteal reaction. Intramedullary invasion and extension is uncommon. MRI signal is typically not helpful (low T1 and high T2.) Spicules of bone emanating in sunburst pattern tend to be low T2 in signal. Differential includes juxtacortical chondroma and high-grade surface [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteosarcoma|osteosarcoma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

&lt;b&gt;Osteochondromas&lt;/b&gt; are cartilage-covered, histologically normal bony projections (exostoses) on the external surface of a bone in the vicinity of growth plates. They are the most common benign bone lesions and present during late childhood and adolescence. Although any bone with enchondral ossification may be involved, the femur, the proximal tibia, and the proximal humerus account for approximately 65-85% of cases.

There is a hereditary skeletal dysplasia known as [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Hereditary_Multiple_Exostoses|osteochondromatosis (multiple heritable exostoses)]] where multiple exostoses are distributed symmetrically on the skeleton. This is a autosomal-dominant disease and is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias. The condition is familial, with more severe manifestations in men.

==Pathophysiology==

Osteochondromas result from the growth of aberrant growth plate with cartilage on the bony surface. As the cartilage grows, it forms a cap over a bony mass that develops by progressive enchondral ossification. The bony portion contains mature, normal cortical and medullary bone with a marrow space contiguous with the parent bone. Deep lobules of cartilage may be present, often heavily ossified. Osteochondromas have their own growth plate and stop growing with skeletal maturity.

==Epidemiology==

*Age: Present before the age of 20 in 80% of cases ( range of age 10-35 years)

*Sex: There is a 2:1 male to female predominance for the development of solitary osteochondromas. In osteochondromatosis, men are more prone to the severe manifestations.

==Clinical Findings==

In general, osteochondromas are slow growing and painless. However, they can be associated with complications, such as:

*Pressure on adjacent nerves and blood vessels 
*Pressure on adjacent bone leading to deformation, fractures 
*Overlying bursitis 
*Malignant transformation (in &lt; 1%). Malignant transformation should be suspected if : 
**Pain in the absence of fracture, bursitis, or nerve compression
**Growth of lesion after skeletal maturation

In the osteochonromatosis, the clinical complications also include severe growth abnormalities. In particular, deformities of the tubular bones are present and cause disproportionately short limbs. However, the degree of shortness appears to be unrelated to the number of exostoses. Malignant transformation is rare, but higher (1-10%) than in solitary osteochondromas. Malignant transformation is usually into chondrosarcoma.

==Radiologic Findings==

There are two characteristic types of osteochondromas, pedunculated and sessile. The pedunculated type has a slender pedicle directed away from the growth plate. The sessile are broad based. Below are other characteristic findings of osteochondromas:

*Located at the metaphyses 
*Calcification in the chondrous portion of the cap can give the pedunculated lesions a cauliflower-like appearance 
*The lesions grow away from the joint 
*MR or CT imaging can demonstrate cortical and medullary continuity between the osteochondroma and the parent bone as a distinctive feature. 
*MR is the best imaging modality for visualizing the effect of the lesion on surrounding structures and for evaluating the hyaline cartilage cap. Mineralized areas in the cartilage cap remain low signal intensity with all MR pulse sequences, although as enchondral ossification proceeds, yellow marrow signal is ultimately apparent. 

The lesions of [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Hereditary_Multiple_Exostoses|osteochondromatosis]] are radiologically indistinguishable from solitary exostoses. They are typically sessile and metaphyseal in location. The skeleton is involved symmetrically, and the limbs are affected more than the spine. The number of exostoses varies. The knee, ankle, and shoulder are usually involved.

In both solitary osteochondromas and [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Hereditary_Multiple_Exostoses|osteochondromatosis]], the radiologic distinction between a benign exostosis and an exostotic chondrosarcoma is difficult unless growth and change in appearance can be demonstrated on serial films.

==Treatment==

No treatment is required if the diagnosis is not in doubt and if the patient is relatively asymptomatic. However, surgical resection is indicated for persistent irritation from bursitis or for neurovascular compromise. Surgical resection is also indicated for continued osteochondroma growth after skeletal maturity.

Definitive treatment includes marginal excision of an active exostosis including the cartilaginous cap and overlying perichondrium. The cartilaginous cap should not be traumatized during its removal. Less than 5% of osteochondromas return after removal.

==Early years==
[[Image:Milutin Tesla.jpg|thumb|right|Tesla's father Milutin]]
Tesla was born &quot;at the stroke of midnight&quot; in [[wikipedia:1856|1856]]  with lightning striking during a summer storm (the first moment of July 10). The midwife commented, &quot;He'll be a child of the storm,&quot; to which his mother replied, &quot;No, of light.&quot; He was born in [[wikipedia:Smiljan|Smiljan]] near [[wikipedia:Gospic|Gospi&amp;#263;]] in [[wikipedia:Coatia|Croatia]], [[wikipedia:Lika|Lika]], (the [[wikipedia:Military Frontier|Military Frontier]] of the [[wikipedia:Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]], now in [[wikipedia:Croatia|Croatia]]). (His baptismal name was &amp;#1053;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1082;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1081; (''Nikola'').  His Baptism Certificate reports that he was born on June 28 ([[wikipedia:Julian calendar|Julian calendar]]; July 10 in the [[wikipedia:Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendar]]) [[wikipedia:1856|1856]], and christened by the Serbian orthodox [[wikipedia:priest|priest]], Toma Oklobd&amp;#382;ija. Tesla was [[wikipedia:baptism|baptised]] in the Old Slavonic Church rite.

His father was [[wikipedia:Reverend|Rev.]] [[wikipedia:Milutin Tesla|Milutin Tesla]], a [[wikipedia:Serbs|Serbian]] priest in the [[wikipedia:Serb Orthodox Church|Orthodox Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] which gathered the Serbs of the &quot;Greek-rite&quot; as they were legally referred to in [[wikipedia:Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Monarchy]] at the time (Vlach Orthodox; Metropolitanate of Karlovci). His father's church in [[wikipedia:Gospic|Gospi&amp;#263;]] was destroyed in the [[wikipedia:1990s|1990s]][http://www.eparhija-gornjokarlovacka.hr/Images/Eparhija/Gospic/Gospic4.jpg]. His mother was [[wikipedia:Duka Mandic|&amp;#272;uka Mandi&amp;#263;]], a housewife talented in making home craft tools. Nikola was one of five children, having one brother and three sisters. His [[wikipedia:godparent|godfather]], [[wikipedia:Jovan Drenovac|Jovan Drenovac]], was a Captain in the Krajina army. His family moved to Gospi&amp;#263; in [[wikipedia:1862|1862]].

Tesla went to school in [[wikipedia:Karlovac|Karlovac]] (then Austria-Hungary), then studied electrical engineering at the [[wikipedia:Austria Politechnic|Austria Politechnic]] in [[wikipedia:Graz|Graz]], [[wikipedia:Austria|Austria]] ([[wikipedia:1875|1875]]). While there, he studied the uses of alternating current.
Today , there is a school dedicated to Nikola Tesla in Zagreb.

==Early employment==

In [[wikipedia:1881|1881]] he moved to [[wikipedia:Budapest|Budapest]] to work for the [[wikipedia:telegraph|telegraph]] company, [[wikipedia:American Telephone Company|American Telephone Company]]. On the opening of the [[wikipedia:telephone|telephone]] exchange in Budapest, 1881, Tesla became the chief electrician to the company, later engineer to the [[wikipedia:Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government and the country's first telephone system.  He also developed a [[wikipedia:telephone|telephone]] [[wikipedia:repeater|repeater]] (sometimes called an  [[wikipedia:amplifier|amplifier]]) [ed., this was one of the first wireless telephones]. The device could act as an [[wikipedia:audio|audio]] [[wikipedia:Loudspeaker|speaker]] (not an audio [[wikipedia:transducer|transducer]]).

The device had its [[wikipedia:resonance|resonance]] tuned to a  particular [[wikipedia:frequency|frequency]] of other repeaters to communicate between each. In [[wikipedia:1916|1916]], Tesla described the prior developed audio transducers. According  to Tesla, it was the &quot;...'' simplest ways ''[to detect the [[wikipedia:radiant energy|radiant energy]] ...]'' the low frequency gave audible notes. ''[... in a field, there was]'' placed a [[wikipedia:conductor (material)|conductor]], a wire or a coil, and then Tesla would get a note ''[...]'' characteristics of the audible note''&quot;. The audible sounds were of the quality of the telephones diaphragms of that period of time. The invention was never patented nor released publicly (till years later by Tesla himself). The device also  contained the characteristics of modern wireless telephones. 

For a while he stayed in [[wikipedia:Maribor|Maribor]]. He was employed at his first job as an assistant engineer. Tesla suffered a nervous breakdown during this time. In [[wikipedia:1882|1882]] he moved to [[wikipedia:paris|Paris]] to work as an engineer for the [[wikipedia:Continental Edison Company|Continental Edison Company]]. He worked designing improvements to electric equipment.  In the same year, Tesla conceived of the induction motor and began developing various devices that use rotating [[wikipedia:magnetic field|magnetic field]]s (for which he received patents in [[wikipedia:1888|1888]]).  Tesla visualized the rotating fields and thereby designed the induction motor. 

Tesla was fascinated by the [[wikipedia:Crookes radiometer|Crookes radiometer]], believing that it was a most wonderful invention.

Tesla hastened from Paris to his mother's side as she lay dying, arriving hours before her death in [[wikipedia:1882|1882]]. Her last words to him were, &quot;You've arrived, Nidzo, my pride.&quot;  After her death, Tesla fell ill. He spent two to three weeks recuperating in Gospi&amp;#263; and the village of [[wikipedia:tomingaj|Tomingaj]] near Gra&amp;#269;, the birthplace of his mother. All his life, Tesla kept a home-spun embroidered travel bag from his mother.

'''[[wikipedia:Nikola Tesla|Nikola Tesla]]''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла) was of unusual intellectual brilliance. The Serbian-American inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer and electrical engineer had a general mental capability that could reason, plan, and solve problems in his head. He could think abstractly and comprehend ideas without putting pen to paper. His patents (over 225 in the United States) and theoretical work still form the basis for modern alternating current electric power systems (including the polyphase system power distribution system). Tesla helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution.  Tesla is regarded as one of the most important inventors in history. He is also well known for his contributions to the science of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  His legacy can be seen across [[wikipedia:Modern world|modern civilization]].
&lt;p&gt;
In his early years, he enjoyed widespread fame; he was widely recognized in high society and in culture, and a significant amount of professional material of the publishing industries focuses on Tesla's announcements. He was highly regarded in the [[wikipedia:history of science and technology|annals of history]]. In the United States, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist of his era. After his demonstration of wireless communication in 1893 and after Westinghouse being the victor in the &quot;War of Currents&quot; using Tesla's patents, he was widely respected as America's greatest electrical engineer. Tesla's name became a byword for innovation and practical achievement.His name was one of the most recognizable in the world, a ''magician'' who conjured up technical feats. Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. He later became credited as being the inventor of the radio. Tesla's vision was to find a means to provide humanity the means for [[wikipedia:Free energy (disambiguation)|unlimited energy]]. He gave his life to make real these plans, while others made fortunes with his [[wikipedia:invention|invention]]s.  
&lt;p&gt;
In his later years, Tesla was regarded as a ''[[wikipedia:mad scientist|mad scientist]]''. He became noted for making &quot;bizarre&quot; and misunderstood claims about possible scientific developments. At the end of his life, Tesla was mocked by his contemporaries and lived his remaining years destitute and [[wikipedia:Historical revisionism (political)|forgotten]].  Never putting a large focus on his finances, Tesla died impoverished at the age of 86. Tesla was ahead of his time; many of Tesla's ideas and concepts are just only recently coming to fruition. 
&lt;p&gt;
Tesla's legacy can be seen across modern civilization wherever electricity is used. Aside from his work on electromagnetism and engineering, Tesla is said to have contributed in varying degrees to the fields of robotics, ballistics, computer science, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. Many of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and New Age occultism. Many contemporary admirers of Tesla have deemed him the man who invented the twentieth century.

==Relations, friendships, and personal views==

In his middle life, Nikola Tesla became very close friends with [[wikipedia:Samuel Clemens|Mark Twain]]. They spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere. He remained bitter in the aftermath of his incident with Edison. The day after Edison died the New York Times contained extensive coverage of Edison's life, with the only negative opinion coming from Edison who was quoted as saying, &quot;He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene&quot; and that, &quot;His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.&quot; In his old age, Edison expressed that his biggest mistake was never respecting Tesla or his work. This did little for their almost non-existent relationship.

Tesla was opposed to [[wikipedia:war|wars]] but believed it could not be avoided until the cause for its recurrence was removed.  He inherited a hatred of war from his parents and homeland, and devised protective measures intended to systematically end warfare. He found exceptions and some justifiable situations where conflict was indeed necessary. He envisioned wars of machines, not of humans, and a future of catastrophic weapons. He sought to reduce distance, such as in communication for better understanding, transportation, and transmission of energy, as a means to ensure friendly international relations.  A system for &quot;Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media&quot; known as ''[[teleforce]]'' was reportedly developed later in his life. Teleforce was intended to be a type of defensive particle-beam weapon.

Like many of his era he developed a fondness for eugenics. The earliest clear instances of this were after his obsessive-compulsive disorder had been pronounced. In a curious 1926 interview he indicated humanity's future would be run by a &quot;Queen Bee&quot; referring to women who'd mate selectively.[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/women.htm]. By February of 1935 he had a pro-eugenics article in ''Liberty'' which was edited by a friend named G. S. Viereck. In a 1937 interview near the end of his life he indicated that &quot;A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html] Tesla was considered an [[wikipedia:eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], therefore some of his ideas have been overlooked in the traditional eugenicist school of thought.

==Later years==

Prior to the [[wikipedia:World War I|First World War]], Tesla looked overseas for investors to fund his research.  When the war started, Tesla lost funding he was receiving from his [[wikipedia:europe|European]] patents.  Wardenclyffe Tower was also demolished towards the end of WWI.  Tesla had predicted the relevant issues of the post-[[wikipedia:World War I|World War I]] environment (a war which theoretically ended) in a printed article ([[wikipedia:December 20|December 20]], [[wikipedia:1914|1914]]).  Tesla believed that the [[wikipedia:League of Nations|League of Nations]] was not a remedy for the times and issues.  In [[wikipedia:1915|1915]], Tesla filed a lawsuit against Marconi attempting, unsuccessfully, to obtain a court injunction against the claims of Marconi. Around [[wikipedia:1916|1916]], Tesla filed for [[wikipedia:bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] because he owed so much in back taxes.  He was living in poverty. 

Tesla started to exhibit pronounced symptoms of [[wikipedia:obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]] in the years following.  He became obsessed with the number three.  He often felt compelled to walk around a block three times before entering a building, demanded a stack of three folded cloth napkins beside his plate at every meal, etc.  The nature of OCD was little understood at the time and no treatments were available, so his symptoms were considered by some to be evidence of partial [[wikipedia:insanity|insanity]] and this probably hurt what was left of his reputation.  This obsessive-compulsive behavior may have originated from the observations over repeated [[wikipedia:polyphase system|polyphase system]]s in nature that Tesla researched.

At this time, he was staying at the [[wikipedia:Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], renting in an arrangement for deferred payments.  Eventually, the Wardenclyffe deed was turned over to [[wikipedia:George Boldt|George Boldt]], proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria to pay a $20,000 debt. In [[wikipedia:1917|1917]], around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, Tesla received [[wikipedia:AIEE|AIEE]]'s highest honor, the [[wikipedia:Edison Medal|Edison Medal]]. The irony of this honor was probably not lost on Tesla.

==Radar development==

Tesla, in [[wikipedia:August|August]] [[wikipedia:1917|1917]], first established principles regarding frequency and power level for the first primitive [[wikipedia:radar|radar]] units in [[wikipedia:1934|1934]]. [[wikipedia:Emile Girardeau|Emile Girardeau]], working with the first [[wikipedia:France|French]] radar systems, stated he was building radar systems &quot;''conceived according to the principles stated by Tesla''&quot;. By the [[wikipedia:1920|twenties]], Tesla was reportedly negotiating with the [[wikipedia:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] government under Prime Minister [[wikipedia:Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] about a ray system. Tesla had also stated that efforts had been made to steal the &quot;death ray&quot; (though they had failed).  The Chamberlain government was removed, though, before any final negotiations occurred. The incoming [[wikipedia:Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]] government found no use for Tesla's suggestions and ended negotiations.

==1930s==

On Tesla's seventy-fifth [[wikipedia:birthday|birthday]] in [[wikipedia:1931|1931]], [[wikipedia:Time magazine|Time magazine]] put him on its cover. [http://www.teslasociety.com/time.jpg] The cover caption noted his contribution to electrical power generation.  In [[wikipedia:1935|1935]], many of Marconi's patents relating to the radio were declared invalid by the [[wikipedia:United States Court of Claims|United States Court of Claims]].  The Court of Claims decided that the prior work of Tesla (specifically US645576 and US649621) had anticipated Marconi's later works.  Tesla got his last patent in [[wikipedia:1928|1928]] on [[wikipedia:Januuary 3|January 3]], an apparatus for aerial transportation which was the first instance of [[wikipedia:Vertical take-off and landing|VTOL]] [[wikipedia:aicraft|aircraft]]. In [[wikipedia:1934|1934]], Tesla wrote to consul Jankovi&amp;#263; of his homeland. The letter contained the message of gratitude to [[wikipedia:Mihajlo Pupin|Mihajlo Pupin]] who initiated a donation scheme by which American companies could support Tesla. Tesla refused the assistance, and chose to live by a modest pension received from [[wikipedia:Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and to continue researching.

==Field theories==

When he was eighty-one, Tesla stated he had completed a [[wikipedia:dynamic theory of gravity|Dynamic Theory of Gravity]]. He stated that it was &quot;''worked out in all details''&quot; and hoped to give to the world the theory soon. &lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[http://www.tesla.hu/tesla/articles/19370710.doc]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The theory was never [[wikipedia:Publishing|publish]]ed. At the time of his announcement, it was considered by the scientific establishment to exceed the bounds of reason. Some believe that Tesla never fully developed the Unified Field Theory, nor that any physicist in the years since it was first postulated. 

While Tesla had &quot;worked out a dynamic theory of gravity&quot; that he soon hoped to give to the world, he died before he publicized any details. Few details were revealed by Tesla about his theory in the announcement. Tesla's critique in the announcement was the opening clash between him and modern experimental physics. Tesla may have viewed his principles in such a manner as to not be in conflict with other modern theories (besides Einstein's). Tesla's theory is ignored by some [[wikipedia:research|research]]ers (and mainly disregarded by [[wikipedia:physicist|physicist]]s).

The bulk of the theory was developed between [[wikipedia:1892|1892]] and [[wikipedia:1894|1894]], during the period that he was conducting experiments for with [[wikipedia:high frequency|high frequency]] and high [[wikipedia:potential|potential]] electromagnetism and patenting devices for their utilization. It was completed, according to Tesla, by the end of the 1930s. Tesla's theory explained gravity using [[wikipedia:electrodynamics|electrodynamics]] consisting of [[wikipedia:traverse wave|transverse wave]]s (to a lesser extent) and [[wikipedia:longitudinal wave|longitudinal wave]]s (for the majority). Reminiscent of [[wikipedia:Mach's principle|Mach's principle]], Tesla stated in 1925 that,  

: ''There is no thing endowed with life - from man, who is enslaving the elements, to the nimblest creature - in all this world that does not sway in its turn. Whenever action is born from force, though it be infinitesimal, the cosmic balance is upset and the universal motion results.''

Tesla, concerning [[wikipedia:Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein]]'s [[wikipedia:Theory of relativity|relativity theory]], stated that '...the relativity theory, by the way, is much older than its present proponents.  It was advanced over 200 years ago by my illustrious countryman [[wikipedia:Ruder_Boskovic|Boskovic]], the great philosopher, who, not withstanding other and multifold obligations, wrote a thousand volumes of excellent literature on a vast variety of subjects.  [[wikipedia:Ruder_Boskovic|Boskovic]] dealt with relativity, including the so-called time-space continuum...', (1936 unpublished interview, quoted in Anderson, L, ed. Nikola Tesla: Lecture Before the New York Academy of Sciences: The Streams of Lenard and Roentgen and Novel Apparatus for Their Production, [[wikipedia:6 April|6 April]] [[wikipedia:1897|1897]], reconstructed 1994).

Tesla was critical of Einstein's relativity work, '...[a] magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king...., its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists...', (New York Times, [[wikipedia:11 July|11 July]] [[wikipedia:1935|1935]], p23, c.8). 

Tesla also stated that 'I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing.  I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.', (New York Herald Tribune, [[wikipedia:11 September|11 September]] [[wikipedia:1932|1932]])

==Death and afterwards==

Tesla died alone in the hotel [[wikipedia:New Yorker hotel|New Yorker]] of [[wikipedia:heart failure|heart failure]], some time between the evening of [[wikipedia:January 5|January 5]] and the morning of [[wikipedia:January 8|January 8]], [[wikipedia:1943|1943]].  Despite selling his AC electricity patents, he was essentially destitute and died with significant debts. 

At the time of his death, Tesla had been working on some form of ''[[wikipedia:teleforce|teleforce]]'' weapon, or ''[[wikipedia:death ray|death ray]]'', the secrets of which he had offered to the [[wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|United States War Department]] on the morning of [[wikipedia:5 January|5 January]]. It appears that his proposed death ray was related to his research into [[wikipedia:ball lightning|ball lightning]] and [[wikipedia:plasma|plasma]]. He was found dead three days later and, after the FBI was contacted by the War Department, his papers were declared to be top secret. 

Immediately after Tesla's death became known, the [[wikipedia:Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] instructed the [[wikipedia:Office of Alien Property|Office of Alien Property]] to take possession of his papers and property, despite his US citizenship.  All of his personal effects were seized on the advice of presidential advisors. [[wikipedia:J. Edgar Hoover|J. Edgar Hoover]] declared the case &quot;most secret&quot;, because of the nature of Tesla's inventions and patents.  Tesla's Serbian-Orthodox family and the Yugoslav embassy struggled with American authorities to gain these items after his death due to the potential significance of some of his research.  Eventually, his nephew, Sava Kosanovich, got possession of some of his personal effects (which are now housed in the [[wikipedia:Nikola Tesla Museum]] in [[wikipedia:Belgrade, Yugoslavia|Belgrade, Yugoslavia]]).  Tesla's [[wikipedia:funeral|funeral]] took place on [[wikipedia:January 12|January 12]], [[wikipedia:1943|1943]] at the [[wikipedia:Cathedral of Saint John the Divine|Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]] in [[wikipedia:Manhattan|Manhattan]], [[wikipedia:New York City]].

In [[wikipedia:1976|1976]], a large [[wikipedia:bronze|bronze]] statue of Tesla was erected at Niagara Falls State Park. A similar statue was also erected in the Tesla's hometown of Gospic in the 1981. The statue in Gospic was dynamited by the Croatian forces in 1991.

Perhaps because of Tesla's personal eccentricity and the dramatic nature of his demonstrations, [[wikipedia:conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about applications of his work persist. The common Hollywood stereotype of the &quot;[[wikipedia:mad scientist|mad scientist]]&quot; mirrors Tesla's real-life persona, or at least a caricature of it&amp;mdash;which may be no accident considering that many of the earliest such movies (including the first movie version of [[wikipedia:Mary Shelley|Mary Shelley's]] [[wikipedia:Frankenstein|Frankenstein]]) were produced by Tesla's old rival, Thomas Edison. There are at least two films describing Tesla's life. In the first, arranged for TV, Tesla was portrayed by [[wikipedia:Rade Serbedzija|Rade &amp;#352;erbed&amp;#382;ija]]. In [[wikipedia:1980|1980]], [[wikipedia:Orson Welles|Orson Welles]] produced a [[wikipedia:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]n film named ''Tajna Nikole Tesle'' (The Secret of Nikola Tesla), in which Welles himself played the part of Tesla's patron, [[wikipedia:George Westinghouse|George Westinghouse]].

==Seized records==

According to [[wikipedia:FBI|FBI]] [http://web.archive.org/20040810031405/foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/tesla.htm documents] acquired via [[wikipedia:FOIA|FOIA]] request, the sum of Tesla's possessions (&quot;consisting of about two truckloads of material... [and] approximately thirty barrels and bundles&quot;) were seized, upon his death in [[wikipedia:1942|1943]], by agents of the (now defunct) [[wikipedia:Office of Alien Property Custodian|Office of Alien Property Custodian]]. One document states that &quot;[he] is reported to have some 80 trunks in different places containing transcripts and plans having to do with his experiments...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Menlo Park==

In [[w:1884|1884]], Tesla moved to the [[w:United States|United States of America]] to accept a job with the [[w:Edison Company|Edison Company]] in [[w:New York City|New York City]].  He arrived in the US with 4 [[w:cent (currency)|cent]]s to his name, a book of [[w:poetry|poetry]], and a letter of recommendation from [[w:Charles Batchelor|Charles Batchelor]] (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison. 

The letter read simply &quot;I know two great men, and you are one of them.  This young man is the other&quot;. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering.  Eventually Tesla earned the respect of Edison and offered to undertake a complete re-design of the Edison company's DC [[w:dynamo|dynamo]]s.  After Tesla described the nature of the benefits from his proposed modifications, Edison offered him [[w:US dollar|US$]]50,000 if they were successfully completed.  

Tesla worked for nearly a year to redesign them and gave the Edison company several enormously profitable new patents in the process.  When Tesla inquired about the $50,000, Edison replied to him, &quot;Tesla, you don't understand our American humor&quot;, and reneged on his agreement, offering a raise in Tesla's salary of $10 per week as a compromise - at which rate it would have taken almost 100 years to earn the money Edison had originally promised.  Tesla resigned on the spot.  In some accounts of the final confrontation, Tesla did not say a single word to Edison but simply turned his back on the inventor and walked off the premises.  Edison would receive US patent 328572 for an improved [[w:commutator_%28electric%29|commutator]] and, later, would gain US patent 373584 for a [[w:dynamo|dynamo-electric machine]] (which includes an ''[[w:coil|extra coil]]'' and utilizes a ''[[w:force field|field of force]]'') among other patents which Tesla may be responsible for.

==Independence==

In [[w:1886|1886]], Tesla formed his own company, ''[[w:Tesla Electric Light &amp; Manufacturing|Tesla Electric Light &amp; Manufacturing]]''.  The initial financial [[w:investor|investor]]s disagreed with Tesla on his plan for an alternating current motor and eventually relieved him of his duties at the company. Tesla worked in New York as a common laborer from [[w:1886|1886]] to [[w:1887|1887]] to feed himself and raise capital for his next project.  

In [[w:1887|1887]], he constructed the initial [[w:brush#Electrics|brush]]less alternate-current [[w:induction motor|induction motor]], which he demonstrated to the ''American Institute of Electrical Engineers'' (now [[w:IEEE|IEEE]]) in [[w:1888|1888]].  Also in 1887, he developed the principles of his [[w:Tesla coil|Tesla coil]] and began working with [[w:George Westinghouse|George Westinghouse]] at Westinghouse's [[w:Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] labs.  Westinghouse listened to his ideas for [[w:polyphase system|polyphase system]]s which would allow transmission of [[w:alternating current|AC]] electricity over large distances

The first efficient and practical electromechanical generator patented by Nikola Tesla in 1891 was U.S. Patent 447921. This is the first small rotating machine, called the alternator. Nikola Tesla's U.S. Patent 447920, &quot;Method of Operating Arc-Lamps&quot; (March 10, 1891), describes an alternator that produces high frequency current, around 10,000 cycles per second (hertz). His intention was to suppress the disagreeable sound of power-frequency harmonics produced by arc lamps operating on frequencies within the range of human hearing. The produced alterations (or pulsations) was in the longwave broadcasting range (very low frequency band).

==World Columbian Exposition==

The International Exposition was held was held in Chicago in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World. It was the first to have a large portion of its grounds  devoted electrical exhibits. It was an historical moment and the beginning of a revolution, as Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse introduced the public to electrical power by providing alternating current to illuminate the Exposition. The general public observed firsthand the qualities and abilities of alternating current power. All the exhibits were from commercial enterprises. Thomas Edison, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse had exhibits. General Electric Company (backed by Edison and J.P. Morgan) proposed to power the electric fair with direct current at the cost of one million dollars.

Westinghouse, armed with Tesla's alternating current system, proposed to illuminate the exposition for half that price. Tesla's high-frequency high-voltage lighting produced more efficient light with quantitatively less heat. A two-phase induction motor was driven by current from the main generators to power the system. Edison tried to prevent the use of his light bulbs in Tesla's works. Westinghouse's proposal was chosen over the inferior direct current system to power the fair. General Electric banned the use of Edison's lamps in Westinghouse's plan, in retailiation for losing the bid. Westinghouse's company quickly designed a double-stopper lightbulb (sidestepping Edison's patents) and was able to light the fair.

The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems. The exhibits included a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor). The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current. Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.

Tesla displayed his phosphorescent lighting, powered without wires by high-frequency fields. Tesla displayed the first practical phosphorescent lamps (a precursor to fluorescent lamps). Tesla's lighting inventions exposed to high-frequency currents would bring the gases to incandescence. Tesla also displayed the first neon lights. His innovations in this type of light emission were not regularly patented.

Also among the exhibits was Tesla's demonstration, most notably the &quot;Egg of Columbus&quot;. This device explains the principles of the rotating magnetic field and his induction motor. The Egg of Columbus consisted of a polyphase field coil underneath a plate with a copper egg positioned over the top. When the sequence of coils were energized, the magnetic field arrangement inductively created a rotation on the egg and made it stand up on end (appearing to resist gravity). On August 25, Elisha Gray introduced Tesla for a delivery of a lecture on mechanical and electrical oscillators. Tesla explained his work for efficiently increasing the work at high frequency of reciprocation. As Electrical Congress members listened, Tesla delineated mechanisms which could produce oscillations of constant periods irrespective of the pressure applied and irrespective of frictional losses and loads. He continued to explain the working mean of the production of constant period electric currents (not resorting to spark gaps or breaks), and how to produce these with mechanisms which are reliable.

The successful demonstration of alternating current lighting at the Exposition dispelled doubts about the usefulness of the polyphase alternating current system developed by Westinghouse and Tesla.

==Colorado Springs==
In [[w:1899|1899]], Tesla decided to move and began research in [[w:|Colorado Springs, Colorado]], where he could have room for his high-voltage high-frequency experiments.  He chose this location primarily because of the frequent thunderstorms, the high altitude (where the air, being at a lower pressure, had a lower dielectric breakdown strength, making it easier to ionize), and the dryness of the air (minimizing leakage of electric charge through insulators).  Also, the property was free and electric power available from the [[w:|El Paso Power Company]]. Today, magnetic intensity charts also show that the ground around his lab possesses a denser magnetic field than the surrounding area.  Tesla reached Colorado Springs on [[w:|May 17]], 1899. Upon his arrival he told reporters that he was conducting experiments transmitting signals from [[w:|Pikes Peak]] to [[w:|Paris]].

Tesla kept a [[w:diary|diary]] of his experiments in the Colorado Springs lab where he spent nearly nine months. It consists of 500 pages of handwritten notes and nearly 200 drawings, recorded chronologically between [[w:June 1|June 1]], 1899 and [[w:January 7|January 7]], [[w:|1900]], as the work occurred, containing explanations of his experiments.  He was developing a system for [[w:wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraphy]], telephony and the transmission of power, experimented with high-voltage electricity and the possibility of wireless transmitting and distributing large amounts of electrical energy over long distances.  He also conceived a system for geophysical exploration--[[w:seismology|seismology]]--which he called ''[[w:telegeodynamics|telegeodynamics]]'', based on his reciprocating mechanical oscillator patented in [[w:1894|1894]], and explained that a long sequence of small explosions could be used to find [[w:ore|ore]] and create [[w:earthquake|earthquake]]s large enough to destroy the [[w:Earth|Earth]].  He did not experiment with this as he felt there would not be &quot;a desirable outcome&quot;.

==Laboratory construction==
Tesla, a local contractor, and several assistants commenced the construction of the laboratory shortly after arriving in Colorado Springs. The lab was established on [[w:Knob Hill|Knob Hill]], east of the [[w:Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind|Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind]] and one mile (1.6 km) east of downtown. Its primary purposes were experiments with high frequency electricity and other phenomena, and secondary--research into wireless transmission of electrical power. Tesla's design of the lab was a building fifty feet by sixty feet (15 by 18 m) with eighty-foot (24 m) ceilings.  A one-hundred-forty-two foot (43 m) conducting aerial with a thirty-inch (76 cm) [[w:copper|copper]]-[[w:Foil (chemistry)|foil]] covered [[w:wood|wood]]en [[w:|ball]] was erected on the [[w:roof|roof]].  The roof was rolled back to prevent fire from sparks and other dangerous effects of the experiments.  The laboratory had sensitive instruments and equipment.

==Tuned circuits==

Tesla also constructed many smaller resonance transformers and discovered the concept of [[w:tuned electrical circuit|tuned electrical circuit]]s.  He also developed a number of [[w:coherer|coherer]]s for separating and perceiving electromagnetic waves and designed rotating [[w:coherer|coherer]]s which he used to detect the unique types of electromagnetic phenomenon he observed.  They had a mechanism of geared wheels driven by a coiled spring-drive mechanism which rotated small glass cylinders.  These experiments were the final stage of years of work on synchronized tuned electrical circuits.

These [[w:transceiver|transceiver]]s were constructed to demonstrate how [[w:signal|signal]]s could be &quot;tuned in&quot;.  Tesla logged in his diary on [[w:July 3|July 3]], [[w:1899|1899]] that a separate resonance transformer tuned to the same high frequency as a larger high-voltage resonance transformer would transceive energy from the larger coil, acting as a ''transmitter'' of wireless energy, which was used to confirm Tesla's patent for radio during later disputes in the courts.  These air core high-frequency resonate coils were the predecessors of systems from radio to [[w:radar|radar]] and [[w:medical|medical]] [[w:magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imaging]] devices.

==Propagation and resonance==

On [[w:July 3|July 3]], 1899, Tesla discovered [[w:Earth|terrestrial]] [[w:Standing wave|stationary wave]]s within the earth. He demonstrated that the Earth behaves as a smooth polished conductor and possesses electrical vibrations.  He experimented with waves characterized by a lack of vibration at points, between which areas of maximum vibration occur periodically.  These standing waves were produced by confining waves within constructed conductive boundaries.  Tesla demonstrated that the Earth could respond at predescribed frequencies of electrical vibrations.  At this time, Tesla realized that it was possible to transceive power around the globe.  A few years later, [[w:George Westinghouse|George Westinghouse]] stopped funding Tesla's research when Tesla showed him that he could offer free electricity to the whole world by simply &quot;ramming a stick in the earth in your backyard&quot;.  Westinghouse said he would go bankrupt if that happened.

Tesla conducted experiments contributing to the understanding of electromagnetic propagation and the Earth's resonance.  It is well documented (from various photos from the time) that he lit hundreds of lamps wirelessly at a distance of up to twenty-five miles (40 km).  He transmitted signals several kilometres and lit neon tubes conducting through the ground. He researched ways to transmit energy wirelessly over long distances (utilizing the [[w:ionosphere|ionosphere]] and the [[w:ground|ground]]'s [[w:telluric current|telluric current]]s via [[w:|transverse wave]]s, to a lesser extent, and, more readily, [[w:longitudinal wave|longitudinal wave]]s). He transmitted extremely low frequencies through the ground as well as between the Earth's surface and the [[w:Kennelly-Heaviside layer|Kennelly-Heaviside layer]]. He received patents on wireless that developed [[w:standing wave|standing wave]]s by this method. In his experiments, he made mathematical calculations and computations based on his experiments and discovered that the resonant frequency of the Earth was approximately 8 Hz ([[w:Hertz|Hertz]]).  In the [[w:1950s|1950s]], researchers confirmed  [[w:resonant frequency|resonant frequency]] was in this range (interesting to note, [[w:Theta|Theta]] [[w:brain waves|brain waves]] also cycle in this range).

==Cosmic waves==

In the Colorado Springs lab, Tesla recorded what he concluded were [[w:extraterrestrial|extraterrestrial]] radio signals and announced his findings in some of the scientific journals of the time. [http://www.teslasociety.com/mars2.htm] His announcements and data were rejected by the scientific community who did not believe him.  He notes measurements of repetitive signals from his receiver which are substantially different from the signals he had noted from storms and earth noise.  Specifically, he later recalled that the signals appeared in groups of clicks 1, 2, 3, and 4 clicks together.  He stated in the article &quot;A Giant Eye to See Round the World&quot;, of [[w:February|25 February]] [[w:1923|1923]], that: 

:&quot;''Twenty-two years ago, while experimenting in Colorado with a wireless power plant, I obtained extraordinary experimental evidence of the existence of life on Mars.  I had perfected a wireless receiver of extraordinary sensitiveness, far beyond anything known, and I caught signals which I interpreted as meaning 1--2--3--4.  I believe the Martians used numbers for communication because numbers are universal''.&quot; ''Albany Telegram &amp;#8212; [[w:25 February|25 February]] [[w:1923|1923]]'' [http://www.tesla.hu/tesla/articles/19230225.doc]

Clearly, Tesla felt the signal groups originated on the planet [[w:Mars (planet)|Mars]].  In 1996 Corum and Corum published an analysis of [[w:Jovian plasma|Jovian plasma]] [[w:torus|torus]] signals which indicate that there was a correspondence between the setting of Mars at Colorado Springs, and the cessation of signals from Jupiter in the summer of 1899 when Tesla was there. [http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf] Further, analysis by the Corums indicate that Tesla's transceiver was sensitive in the 18 kHz gap in the [[w:ionosphere|Kennelly-Heaviside layer]] which would have allowed that reception from Jupiter.  Therefore, there is evidence the signals Tesla noticed came from [[w:Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]], among other possible sources.  Tesla spent the latter part of his life trying to signal Mars.

It is important to recognize that when he says he &quot;recorded&quot; these signals, it is meant that he wrote down the data and his impressions of what he had heard. He did release reports at the time.  Tesla&amp;#8217;s initial announcement of the existence of extraterrestrial radio signals was in 1899. [http://www.teslasociety.com/cosmos.htm] In March of 1907, Tesla wrote about signaling to Mars in Harvard Magazine and how it was a problem of electrical engineering. [http://www.teslasociety.com/signaltomars.htm] Additional descriptions come from remembrances twenty years later.  All this was met with resistance and disbelief by his contemporaries.

==Colorado departure==

Tesla left Colorado Springs on [[w:January 7|January 7]], [[w:1900|1900]]. The lab was torn down, broken up, and its contents sold to pay debts. The Colorado experiments prepared Tesla for his next project, the establishment of a wireless power transmission facility that would be known as Wardenclyffe.

On [[w:March 21|March 21]], [[w:1900|1900]], Tesla was granted US685012 [[w:patent|patent]] for the means for increasing the intensity of electrical oscillations. The United States Patent Office classification system currently denotes that this patent pretains to superconductivity technology (Class 505/825). Within this patent it describes the increase intensity and duration of electric oscillations of a [[w:Cryogenics|low temperature]] [[w:resonator|resonating]] circuit. [[w:Carl von LindeCarl von Linde]] and [[w:William Hampson|William Hampson]], both commercial researchers, nearly at the same time filed for patents on the Joule-Thomson effect. Linde's patent was the climax of 20 years of systematic investigation of establish facts, using a [[w:regeneration|regenerative]] counterflow method. Hampson's designs was also of a regenerative method. It is believed that Tesla had intended that Linde's machine would be used to attain the cooling agents.

==Wardenclyffe Tower==

Tesla began planning the [[w:Wardenclyffe Tower|Wardenclyffe Tower]] facility ca. 1898, and in 1901, construction began on the land near Long Island Sound. Architect Stanford White designed the Wardenclyffe facility main building. The tower was designed by W.D. Crow, an associate of White. Funding for Tesla's project was provided by influential industrialists and other venture capitalists. The project was initially backed by the wealthy J. P. Morgan (he had a substantial investment in the facility, initially investing $150,000).

In June 1902, Tesla moved his laboratory operations from his Houston Street laboratory to Wardenclyffe. However, in 1903, when the tower structure was near completion, it was still not yet functional due to last-minute design changes that introduced in an unintentional defect. When Morgan wanted to know &quot;Where can I put the meter?&quot;, Tesla had no answer. Tesla's vision of free power did not agree with Morgan's worldview. Construction costs eventually exceeded the money provided by Morgan, and additional financiers were reluctant to come forth. By July 1904, Morgan (and the other investors) finally decided they would not provide any additional financing. Morgan also encouraged other investors to avoid the project. In May 1905, Tesla's patents on alternating current motors and other methods of power transmission expired, halting royalty payments and causing a severe reduction of funding to the Wardenclyffe Tower. In an attempt to find alternative funding, Tesla advertised the services of the Wardenclyffe facility, but he met with little success. By this time, Tesla had also designed the Tesla turbine at Wardenclyffe and produced Tesla coils for sale to various businesses.

By 1905, since Tesla could not find any more backers, most of the site's activity had to be shut down. The main hall continued to be used for blackface minstrel shows until October of that year. Employees were laid off in 1906, but parts of the building remained in use until 1907. In 1908, the property was foreclosed for the first time. Tesla procured a new mortgage from the proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, George C. Boldt. The facility was partially abandoned around 1911, the tower structure eventually becoming deteriorated. Between 1912 and 1915, Tesla's finances unraveled, and when the funders wanted to know how they were going to recapture their investments, Tesla was unable to give satisfactory answers. Newspaper headlines of the time labeled it &quot;Tesla's million-dollar folly.&quot; The facility's main building was breached and vandalized around this time. Collapse of the Wardenclyffe project may have contributed to the mental breakdown Tesla experienced during this period. Coupled to the personal tragedy of Wardenclyffe was the earlier 1895 unexplained fire in Tesla's Houston Street laboratory. In this fire, he lost much of his equipment, notes and documents. This produced a state of severe depression for Tesla.

In 1915, legal ownership of the Wardenclyffe property was transferred to George Boldt for a $20,000 debt. Demolition and salvaging of the tower occurred in 1917. However, the main building remains standing to this day. Tesla was not in New York during the tower's destruction. George Boldt wished to make the property available for sale. New York papers reported that the tower had been destroyed by order of the government to prevent its use by foreign agents. In 1917, the United States government may have aided the destruction of the Wardenclyffe Tower, ostensibly because it was believed it could provide a navigational landmark for German submarines. The facts neither support nor discount either claim. On April 20, 1922 Tesla lost an appeal of judgment versus his backers in the second foreclosure. This effectively locked Tesla out of any future development of the facility.

==Fight for radio==

In [[w:1904|1904]], the US Patent Office reversed its decision and awarded [[w:Guglielmo Marconi|Guglielmo Marconi]] the patent for [[w:radio|radio]]. Tesla began his fight to re-acquire his radio patent. Later in [[w:1909|1909]], Marconi was awarded the [[w:Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize]] for radio. Tesla was deeply resentful. So in [[w:|1915]], Tesla filed a [[w:lawsuit|lawsuit]] against Marconi.

Tesla always disputed the claim that [[w:Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] invented radio and he gave a simple reason for this position.  It was that radio is not an invention: &quot;It was evident to me in [[w:1888|1888]] that wireless transmission of energy, if it could ever be accomplished, is not an invention; it is an art.  Bell's telephone, Edison's phonograph, or my [[w:induction motor|induction motor]] were inventions, but the wireless transmission of energy is an art that requires a great many inventions in combination.&quot;, (Nikola Tesla, 1916, in Ed. Anderson, Leland, 'Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents And Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Energy, Published 1992).  Seen in this context, some believe that it is Tesla's lecture and patent record from 1888 onwards that contains the fundamental information on the '....great many inventions...' that form the basis for modern radio and wireless technology.  

An ongoing lawsuit regarding the patent battle was finally resolved in Tesla's favor in [[w:1944|1944]], one year after his death.  This decision was based on the facts of the prior work existing before the establishment of Marconi's patent.  At the time, the [[w:United States Army|United States Army]] was involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with Marconi regarding radio, leading some to posit that the government granted Tesla and others the formal recognition in order to nullify any claims Marconi would have to compensation (as the earlier award to Marconi nullified any claims Tesla would have for compensation).

==Nobel rumors==

Due to the fact that the [[w:|Nobel Prize]] was awarded to Marconi for radio in [[w:1909|1909]], it was believed that Tesla and Edison were to share the [[w:Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize of 1912]] (and, later alone, in [[w:Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize of 1915]]). Tesla's rumored nominations for the Nobel Prize in Physics was primarily for his experiments with tuned circuits using high-voltage high-frequency resonant transformers. It was possible that Tesla was told of the plans of the physics award committee and let it be known that he would not share the award with Edison.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Most common of osteochondrodysplasias characterized by formation of multiple [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteochondroma|osteochondromas]].

==Pathophysiology==

&lt;b&gt;[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteochondroma|Osteochondroma]]&lt;/b&gt; is continuous with underlying medullary and cortical bone. 

A hyaline cartilage cap involutes after reaching skeletal maturity.

The solitary form is the only benign neoplasm associated with radiation.

==Prevalence==
1:50,000-1:100,000; 1:1,000 on Guam/Mariana Islands 

==Genetics==
*Autosomal dominant (incomplete penetrance in females); 3 distinct loci on chromosomes 8,11, 19 

*2/3 of affected individuals have a positive family history 

==Age==
Forms shortly after birth; virtually all patients discovered by 12 years of age; M:F = 1.5:1.0

==Physical Appearance==

Short stature (40%) due to development of exostoses at the expense of longitudinal bone growth 

==Location==
Any portion of the skeleton preformed in cartilage may be involved.

Multiple and usually bilateral; knee (70-98%), humerus (50-98%), scapula and rib (40%), elbow (35-40%), hip (30-90%), wrist (30-60%), ankle (25-54%), hand (20-30%), foot (10-25%), pelvis (5-15%), vertebra (7%) 

==Site==
Metaphyses of long bones near epiphyseal plate (distance to epiphyseal line increases with growth)_ 

Disproportionate shortening of an extremity (50%) 

*Upper Extermity
**Pseudo-Madelung deformity
**Ulnar shortening and longer bowed radius 
**Ulnar tilt of distal radial articular surface 
**Ulnar deviation of hand 
**Dislocation of radial head 
**Radioulnar synostosis 
**Shortening of 4th and 5th metacarpals 
**Supranumerary fingers/toes 

*Lower Extremity
**Coax valga (25%) 
**Genu valgus (20-40%) 
**Valgus deformity of ankle = tibiotalar tilt (45-54%) 
**Undertubulation with widened metadiaphyseal junction: 
**Erlenmeyer flask deformity of distal femur 

==CT==
Wavy pelvis sign = small sessile lesion create undulating cortical contour 


[[Image:mhes1.jpg|Lateral and AP views of forearm demonstrate exostoses arising from the distal radius and proximal ulna. The radial head and the radiocapitellar joint are dysplastic. Pseudo-Madelung deformity is present with ulnar tilt of distal radius articular surface and ulnar subluxation of hand]]

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; Views of the femur demonstrate multiple sessile osteochondromas. The proximal femur involvement gives the femoral neck a widened appearance.

==Clinical Significance==
If not discovered incidentally by radiograph, multiple exostoses may create symptoms depending on its size and location. Impingement of nerves and tendons or inflammation of overlying bursae may contribute to pain. The most concerning potential cause of pain, however, is malignant sarcomatous transformation, which occurs in 10-20%!

==Treatment and Followup==
*There is no universally accepted standard for follow-up of multiple exostoses. Most consider annual routine clinical exam in children as the standard, with radiographs if symptomatic. Difficult regions to assess clinically, such as the pelvis, may warrant radiographic studies routinely. 

*The cartilage cap is a useful part of the neoplasm to focus on in a radiographic study:

*Benign &lt; 1.5 cm or 2.0 cm.

*Malignant &gt; 1.5 cm or 2.0 cm.

*However, it is common for patients with osteochondromas to develop a bursa over the exostosis. It can be extremely difficult to distinguish this bursa from a cartilage cap and vice versa.

*Keep in mind that in a skeletally immature patient, growth due to young age will thicken the cartilage cap and simulate malignancy.

*Follow-up is typically done routinely by radiographs: increasing destruction or change in appearnce of the cartilage mantle is worrisome for malignancy.

*Ultrasound is useful to evaluating cap thickness and overlying bursae.

*MRI T2-weighted images are the most useful for evaluating the cartilaginous cap.

*Bone scan is generally nonspecific, but may identify sites that are more active and merit closer attention.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Human Performance Technology?==

Human Performance Technology as described as:
* an analysis of present and desired levels of job performance, that identifies the causes for the performance gap
* a multidisciplined approach to the development of interventions that improve performance
* guides the change management process and evaluates the results (source: www.ispi.org)

'''Human performance technology''' takes a systematic approach to improving job performance in the workplace, such as conducting a needs assessment, cause analysis, design of recommendations or solutions, implementation of resolution and evaluation and results of the new interventions implemented to improve performance. To achieve effective multifacted interventions, needs assessments are critical to improving performance in the workplace. Most organizations do not find that the time spent to implement a needs assessment is worthwhile, because it can be quite time consuming depending on the type of changes required to improve performance within the organization and among its employees.

=='''Needs Assessment'''==
[According to Robert Rouda and Mitchell Kusy, Jr (1995), states that a needs assessment identifies the current state and conditions of performance and in what specific manner the performance should be performed. &quot;There are four steps to completing a needs assessment: perform a gap analysis, identifying priorities and importance, identify causes of performance problems and/or opportunities, and identifying possible solutions and growth.&quot;]
=='''Gap Analysis'''==
[A '''&quot;gap analysis&quot;''' examines and compares the current work situation and conditions to the desired work situation and conditions. Questions to consider:]
* Problems or deficits. Are there problems in the organization which might be solved by training or other HRD activities? 
* Impending change. Are there problems which do not currently exist but are foreseen due to changes, such as new processes and equipment, outside competition, and/or changes in staffing? 
* Opportunities. Could we gain a competitive edge by taking advantage of new technologies, training programs, consultants or suppliers? 
* Strengths. How can we take advantage of our organizational strengths, as opposed to reacting to our weaknesses? Are there opportunities to apply HRD to these areas? 
* New directions. Could we take a proactive approach, applying HRD to move our organizations to new levels of performance? For example, could team building and related activities help improve our productivity? 
*Mandated training. Are there internal or external forces dictating that training and/or organization development will take place? Are there policies or management decisions which might dictate the implementation of some program? Are there governmental mandates to which we must comply? (Robert Rouda and Mitchell Kusy, Jr, (1995)) 
The answers to these questions will help us to find the current performance gaps, if any, and aid in creating a process to move toward the desired performance, while providing support or rationale for a business case to implement change within the workplace, whether its on an individual level (job change) or organizational level (corporate policies and procedures). To address results found in our needs assessments, we should consider the various interventions that can be used to address the causes for the gap in performances, such as training, organizational changes and its goal, possible changes staff changes. 
=='''Identifying priorities and importance'''==
Robert Rouda and Mitchell Kusy, Jr. (1995)states that we must &quot;determine if the identified needs are real, if they are worth addressing, and specify their importance and urgency in view of our organizational needs and requirements. Some questions to consider:
* Cost-effectiveness: How does the cost of the problem compare to the cost of implementing a solution? In other words, we perform a cost-benefit analysis. 
* Legal mandates: Are there laws requiring a solution? (For example, safety or regulatory compliance.) 
* Executive pressure: Does top management expect a solution? 
* Population: Are many people or key people involved? 
* Customers: What influence is generated by customer specifications and expectations? 
If some of our needs are of relatively low importance, we would do better to devote our energies to addressing other human performance problems with greater impact and greater value.&quot; 
=='''Identify causes of performance problems and/or opportunities'''==
Rouda and Kusy (1995) states that &quot;we must know what our performance requirements are, if appropriate solutions are to be applied. Consider the following two questions for every identified need: 
* Are our people doing their jobs effectively? 
* Do they know how to do their jobs? 
This will require detailed investigation and analysis of employees, their jobs, and our organizations -- both for the current situation and in preparation for the future. 

=='''Identify possible solutions and growth opportunities'''==
Training and/or other interventions might be called for if sufficient importance is attached to moving our people and their performance into new directions.  
But if our people ARE NOT doing their jobs effectively: 
* Training may be the solution, IF there is a knowledge problem. 
* Organization development activities may provide solutions when the problem is not based on a lack of knowledge and is primarily associated with systematic change. These interventions might include strategic planning, organization restructuring, performance management and/or effective team building. (Rouda and Kusy (1995))

We must understand that performance improvement “is not an isolated activity, but has three interrelated goals:]] 
*(1) learning and;
*(2) applying the learning on the job (training transfer)
*(3) the organization meets its objectives”.  (Schouborg, 2001, pp.203-218) 
For these three goals to be achieved, Caravagalia (1993) states that to ensure the transfer of training (performance improvement), it must include:
*(a) use realistic examples of how the skill might be used; 
*(b) give learners meaningful contexts for the application of concepts rather than presenting theory without application; 
*(c) include the opportunity to practice the skills in the design of the learning event; 
*(d) present new concepts in several different ways; transfer of training is more likely to occur when concepts appear in several different training contexts; 
*(e) use clear and effective visual aids; 
*(f) consider the use of pre-training assignments; 
*(g) keep concepts and skills as close as possible to the work generally done by participants in their everyday jobs; 
*(h) building in post-training follow-up with participants; 
*(i) encourage the organization(s) to develop supportive environments for the continued learning in the workplace after training has taken place. (Caravaglia, 1993, Ensure Transfer of Training, pp.63-68)
Hence, understanding how adults learn is critical to guaranteeing that the desired skills are transferred and performance will improve. Skills transfer, or the transfer of training, is truly a systematic process that requires the involvement of not only the training area, the employee but the entire organization. It is critical that the selected intervention used to improve performance directly links to the organization’s goals or initiatives, because the success of any given organization heavily relies on the performance of its employees. As IT professionals, when presented with a HPT project we must stress the importance of a needs assessment, because the answer may not be as straightforward as training.

An &lt;b&gt;aneurysmal bone cyst&lt;/b&gt; is an expansile osteolytic bony lesion composed of blood-filled spaces separated by connective tissue septa of bony trabeculae or osteoid tissue and osteoclast giant cells

==Epidemiology/Prevalence==
*Almost always present in patients &lt; 30 years old. 80% in 5-20 year olds. 
*Very slight male to female predominance before 14 year old; after, slight female to male predominance (i.e. 1.16:1.00). 
*~1% of all bone tumors. 
*1.4 cases per 100,000 worldwide.

==Types==
#Primary (~70%) - no known cause or association with other bony lesion. 
#Secondary (~30%) - occurs in conjunction with another lesion or trauma. Some suggest using ‘principal lesion concomitant with hemorrhagic or cystic changes’ instead. Typical primary lesions include eosinophilic granuloma, simple bone cyst, chondroblastoma, [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Giant cell tumor|giant cell tumor]], or [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteosarcoma|osteosarcoma]].

==Clinical Presentation==
Pain

==Radiologic Findings==
*expansile 
*lucent lesion in the proximal tibial metaphysis and epiphysis
*abutting the joint space
*no periosteal reaction
*no matrix evident
*patient is skeletally immature (physeal plates not completely fused)

===Location===
*~60% in long bones (mostly metaphyseal and eccentric) 
*tibia, femur, and spine (posterior elements) top three locations 
*If in flat bones, majority in pelvis.

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Osteoblastoma and [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteoid ostemoa|osteoid osteoma]] (especially when location is posterior spinal elements) 
*Lytic metastasis (should have more aggressive features) 
*Unicameral bone cyst (usually central) 
*[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Giant cell tumor|Giant cell tumor]] (skeletally mature, epiphyseal and abut articular surface when in non-flat bones) 
*[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Osteosarcoma|Osteosarcoma]] (but typically has osteoid matrix, aggressive features) 

==Treatment==
Biopsy is recommended to differentiate from more aggressive lesions. When primary, wide resection is recommended. If curettage alone is used, 25% recur. So when location makes wide resection unfeasible, aggressive curettage (i.e. liquid nitrogen, embolization, etc.) is needed. When secondary, treat the primary lesion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
&lt;b&gt;Multiple Myeloma&lt;/b&gt; is a neoplasm of differentiated plasma cells resulting from malignant clonal expansion and overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Common complications include recurrent bacterial infections, anemia, osteolytic lesions and renal insufficiency.

==Etiology==

The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown, but risk is increased with radiation exposure and patient's with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Long term follow-up (30years) has shown that multiple myeloma develops in up to 16% of patients with MGUS. 

==Clinical Presentation==
Multiple myeloma occurs in older adults, with a median age of onset of 65 years. It is more common in men and in African American population. Patients can be asymptomatic. Presenting symptoms include bone pain, fatigue, and pathologic fractures. They have strong diagnostic value if accompanied by more than 10% atypical plasma cells in the bone marrow and either a monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum or light chains in the urine.


Bone lesions, hypercalcemia and anemia correlate directly with tumor burden.


MRI can detect involvement of the vertebral marrow in 50% of patients with indolent myeloma (asymptomatic MM with fewer than 4 osteolytic lesions and normal renal function).


Myeloma cells can induce increased cytokine release, especially interleukin 6 which activate osteoclasts provoking bone resorption.

==Treatment==
High dose or low dose melphalan, cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids with or without bone marrow/stem cell transplant. Bisphosphonates (pamidronate) have been used to treat hypercalcemia and appears to reduce the incidence of skeletal complications (pathologic fractures, need for irradiation, spinal cord compression) and bone pain.

==Radiologic Images==
Conventional radiography, bone scans, CT, MR, and PET can be utilized to study patients for myeloma. Typically, skeletal radiography and MR surveys of the axial skeleton are both used in documenting extent of disease and response to treatment. In addition, consequences of multiple myeloma, such as compression fractures can be determined.

===Conventional Radiographs===
On skeletal surveys, images are obtained as follows:
#Lateral skull
#AP and lateral total spine (including cervicothoracic and lumbosacral lateral views)
#AP pelvis
#AP humeri and femori

Well-defined lucent lesions within the bone are suspicious for myeloma. Approximately 50% of bone destruction is required for conventional radiographs to detect these lesions.


There are four distinct types of myeloma involvement:
#Solitary lesion (plasmocytoma) - typically involves the spine, pelvis, skull, ribs, sternum, and proximal appendages.
#Diffuse skeletal involvement - myelomatosis
#Diffuse skeletal osteopenia - no well defined lytic lesions; compression fractures are common.
#Sclerosing myeloma - associated with POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes).


The number of lytic bone lesions, along with other clinical factors (M protein, serum hemoglobin, serum calcium, renal function), are used to stage the patient and estimate tumor burden. The Durie-Salmon staging system for multiple myeloma separates patients into 3 stages. Radiographically, if a patient has 2 or more lytic lesions, they are stage III. If they have no bone destruction or a solitary plasmacytoma, they are stage I or II, depending on the other clinical factors.

===MRI===
Malignant plasma cells tend to distribute themselves in areas of normal active hematopoesis. In adults, this is in the axial skeleton; therefore, MR surveys tend to image the axial skeleton.


On T1-weighted sequences, focal plasmacytoma will appear hypointense relative to the hyperintense marrow. Diffuse involvement will demonstrate diffuse hypointensity of the marrow relative to musculature and disk spaces.


On T2-weighted or STIR sequences, focal plasmacytoma is hyperintense relative to the background marrow. Diffuse involvement will demonstrate diffuse marrow hyperintensity relative to musculature.

===Case 1===
This image demonstrates a typical &quot;punched-out&quot; lesion in the skull on plain film.

[[Image:mm1.jpg|This image demonstrates a typical &quot;punched-out&quot; lesion in the skull on plain film]]

===Case 2===
This case demonstrates progression of myeloma with increasing lucency within the iliac wing lesion.

'''run game''' 
Possibly the biggest advantage game maker has over program based games, is that from almost any stage of completion, the game can be run to see what its like.
I suppose you are wondering what debug mode is. Well, it is unnecessary until you can program in GML (game maker language) so don't worry about it.

''' add a sprite''' 
Well a sprite (who picked the name sprite) is a picture. The majority of things in any 2d game have a sprite. A sprite is basically an image, or a collection of images making a short animation. Collectively your list of sprites in-game are just all the images your game puts on top of each other to create a game.

''' add a sound'''
As the name says, this adds a sound. Although, sounds are not really worth adding unless you are slightly more advanced. Also in the unregistered version I don't think you can get a sound from a file. Meaning that it has to be stored in the .exe file (in the game).

If you don't know the mechanics of an exe file, think of an exe file as a machine. Normally in games the exe file knows where to find all the resources (i.e. pictures, sounds, menu's etc.) and combines them all into a game, which it then spits out onto your screen (look in you program files, for most programs there is an exe file and a dozen or so folders containing files that the program reads, uses, etc..). Storing everything inside the .exe file slows down the running speed of the .exe itself, also longer load times etc., so eventually (when you get better with game maker) it is better to have the files external (not inside the .exe file).

''' add a background'''
This is very similar to sprites. Backgrounds are used like the background of your computer's desktop. Everything goes on top of the background.

'''add an object'''
Now if you remember before, I told you that a sprite is just a large set of images. An object is what you see in-game, or may not see as the case may be. It defines the rules which the sprites follow. Say a sprite were to go left when the left arrow was pressed. The object tells the sprite to go left, if the left key is pressed. You can do a lot of functions, under a lot of events (when something happens, i.e. keypress). 
events include-

on left mouse click
when keyboard button is press
on collision with another object
every step (every 0.06 seconds)

and the functions include things like
move left
change the sprite
play a sound
create another object

Each event can govern many functions. Also, rather helpfully they are well worded-
on collision with bullet
create instance of object_explosion
&amp; play the sound explosion.midi

* What do you want to do? ==
* Encourage to cough and visualize oropharynx to see if you can remove FB. ==
* You are unable to visualize any FB and the child begins to have severe difficulty breathing, moving less air, but still maintaining airway.  What do you want to do prior to transport? ==

* Heimlich maneuver until obstruction relieved or unconscious ==
* And if this was an infant? ==
* 5 back blows/ 5 chest thrusts w/ head down until obstruction relieved or unconscious ==
*= to avoid injury to abdominal organs ===

* The child becomes unconscious.  What do you want to do? ==
* Attempt ventilation ==
* if no airway management equipment - back blows/chest thrusts vs abd. thrusts ==
*  between each cycle - visualize and remove visible FB &lt;b&gt;*no blind sweeps&lt;/b&gt; - ventilate ==
* If you have airway management equipment - direct laryngoscopy, visualization, suction, removal of FB with McGill forceps, intubation if needed ==

= Foreign Body Aspiration =

* Radiation Background 
* “Dirty Bomb” 
* Radioactive Waste / Nuclear Reactors 
** Yucca Mountain 

==Radiation ==

===Basics of Radiation- Irradiation===
 
* Irradiation is exposure to penetrating radiation 
** External irradiation does not make a person radioactive. 
** External irradiation can damage tissue through direct or indirect means (generation of free radicals and H2O2 from ionization of water) 
===Basics of Radiation- Contamination ===
* Contamination occurs when material that contains radioactive atoms is deposited on skin, clothing, body cavities, wounds. May also damage tissue, but much more slowly than direct irradiation. 
* Person contaminated with radioactive materials will be irradiated until the source of radiation (the radioactive material) is removed 
===Basics of Radiation ===
* Ionizing radiation is produced by unstable atoms (isotopes) which have an excess of energy or mass. 
* Atoms give off, or emit, the excess energy or mass as radiation which collide with adjacent molecules and ionize (knock off electrons) 
** electromagnetic ( gamma or x-rays)  
** particulate (i.e., mass given off with the energy of motion - beta and alpha radiation).  
===4 types of ionizing radiation ===
* Alpha- little penetration, easily stopped by skin and clothes, dangerous if ingested or inhaled. 20x more damaging than equivalent dose of beta or gamma. 
* Beta- light penetration, may cause red “burn” on skin. 
* Gamma- deep penetration, like x-rays. 
* Neutrons- particles that also penetrate deeply and cause extensive damage. Seen only in nuclear bombs. 
* All types of radiation cause damage to DNA of cells. Most vulnerable tissues are heme, GI and reproductive systems. 
===Biological Effects of Radiation ===
* Stochastic- effects that are also seen in unexposed individuals, but are increased in frequency with radiation exposure (trigger effect). Not all individuals exposed will get effect. Severity is independent of dose. 
** Examples include cancer, mental retardation in exposed fetus, genetic damage. 
===Biological Effects of Radiation ===
* Non-stochastic effects- threshold dose, predictable causal relationship with dose related severity in all individuals exposed. 
** Sterility, skin burns, cataracts, hemopoietic damage, GI and CNS damage. 
===Radiation Physics for Dummies ===
* Absorbed dose = energy/mass=joule/kg 
* 1 Roentgen=1 rad 
* 100 rad= 1Grey(Gy). 
* Dose equivalent=energy/mass x (strength of type of radiation). Alpha is 20x. 
* 1 rad of gamma is 1 rem 
* 			BUT 
* 1 rad of alpha is 20 rem 
* 100 rem = 1 Sievert (Sv) 
===Radiation Physics for Dummies ===
* Natural radioactivity - 40 mrem/year. 
* Air travel NYC-London- 4 mrem 
* CXR- 10 mrem 
* National Council of Radiation Protection 
** 5 rem/yr (50 mSv) =annual exposure limit of radiation workers 
** 0.5 rem (500 mrem or 5 mSv) = max annual exposure to layperson = 50 CXR. 
===Radiation Physics for Dummies ===
* 50 rem is max single dose recommended for a first responder acting in a life saving situation 
** No risk of Acute Radiation Sickness 
** 1-4% estimated increase in Ca risk. 
* In this case, rem = rad, since workers in this situation will be wearing PPE, so gamma is only radiation that will penetrate. 
===Biological Effects of Radiation ===
* Sterility- 30 rads in men, 300 rads in women. More exposure leads to longer effect. Usually temporary 
* 100 rads  = N/V 
* 200 rads = Cataracts, Hemopoietic syndrome 
* 300 rads of Beta = skin erythema 
* 400 rads = usually fatal ARS due to heme depression. 
* 1,000 rads = GI syndrome → FATAL. 
* 2,000 rads = CNS syndrome → FATAL 
==“Dirty Bomb” FAQ ==
===What is a “Dirty Bomb”? ===
* A conventional explosive packaged with radioactive material that scatters when the bomb goes off. 
* Could be a small device, or as big as a truck bomb 
===How does a Dirty Bomb do harm?=== 
* Initial blast of the conventional explosive 
* Airborne radiation and contamination 
===Only nuclear experts can make one, right? ===
* Nope, requires not much more expertise than it takes to make a conventional bomb 
===So why aren’t we all dead? ===
* The hard part is acquiring the radioactive material, not building the bomb. 
* There are reports that suggest organizations, such as Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda, probably have radioactive contaminants such as strontium 90 and cesium 137, which could be used to make a dirty bomb, and have succeeded in manufacturing a small dirty bomb 
===Why else aren’t we all dead?=== 
* A dirty bomb is not a nuclear weapon 
* 	(nuclear weapons involve a complex nuclear-fission reaction and are thousands of times more devastating) 
===So do we have to worry? ===
* Yes, dirty bombs are WMD’s but… 
* More for their capacity to cause terror and disruption than inflicting heavy casualties. 
** Panic over radioactivity 
** Evacuation measures 
** Area struck would be off-limits for at least several months—possibly years—for cleanup efforts 
===Acme Radioactive Materials, on sale for 3 payments of $9.99?=== 
* Radioactive materials for military, industrial, or medical applications:  e.g. weapons-grade plutonium or uranium, freshly spent nuclear fuel 
** the most deadly 
** the most difficult to obtain  
** Medical supplies such as radium or certain cesium isotopes used in cancer treatments could be used 
*less dangerous
*A measuring cup’s worth of radioactive material would be needed, but such small amounts would be unlikely to cause severe harm, especially if over a wide area.
===Dirty Bomb- Summary ===
* Explosion and trauma, moderate dispersal of radioactive debris, imbedded fragments, very little irradiation 
==Yucca Mountain ==
* http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov 
===Location ===
* Nye County, Nevada, ~100 miles NW of Las Vegas 
* Remote desert on federally protected land 
* Within secure boundaries of the Nevada Test Site. 
===What is Yucca Mountain? ===
* A site slated by the federal gov’t to store all nuclear waste from power plants, weapons program, etc. 
===Currently ===
===Why Yucca Mtn? ===
* Remote 
* Dry climate 
* Stable geology 
* Deep water table 
* Closed water basin 
===How do we get the stuff to Yucca? ===
* Nat’l experience to date 
** 2,700 shipments 
** 1.6 million miles 
** 30 years; 
** → No harmful release of radiation 
* Similar to Europe’s safety record- travel shorter distances, but more densely populated 
==Transportation of Nuclear Waste ==
* Highly regulated 
* DOT and NRC regulations 
** Containers 
** Advance route approvals 
*Each state’s governor can specify
*Local trained emergency response teams (34 states)
** Escorts 
** 24-hr satellite surveillance 
===Scenario  ===
* A shipment to Yucca Mountain goes flying off an elevate section of the FDR 
* FDNY calls to confirm this and informs you that you will be getting 5 victims. 
* Soon after this 6 ambulatory patients with minor injuries show up. EMS soon brings 2 critically injured patients and 5 patients with compound fractures. 
* What is the most important next step in addition to mobilizing the mass casualties’ disaster plan? 
* In any explosion consider a “dirty bomb”. 
** So, radiation detection device required 
* Screen background radiation.  If &gt; 2x → contaminated. 
* For gross screening, may be able to use the radiation detection monitor used to monitor radioactive waste from the hospital. 
===LUDLUM M-3===
SURVEY METER 
* PPE with an N95 respirator, coveralls/gloves, and eye shields should be worn by personnel treating patients  
* PAPR’s and full Decon suits are overkill, unless suspect simultaneous chemical contamination! 
* If life saving treatment is done without PPE (personal protective equipment), providers will need to be screened, change clothes and shower as well. 
* Personal electronic dosimeters should be worn as soon as available 
* The detection device confirms that all these patients are contaminated. DOE sends out word that Cesium 137 has been confirmed as the radioactive agent. No other toxic substances are identified. 
* What are the next steps? 
* Tendency is to run away from these victims out of fear of suffering harm to oneself. Wrong and unethical. 
* Treatment of the LIFE-THREATENING traumatic injuries should take place ASAP, even before decon is done. 
* Should don quick respiratory, eye and contact protection as in routine trauma. 
* IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A LIVING PATIENT TO BE SO CONTAMINATED AS TO POSE AN IMMEDIATE HEALTH THREAT TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS.  
* This is in direct contrast to chemical contamination situations, where there is indeed an immediate hazard to health care providers. 
* That being said, non-life-threatening injuries will allow time for screening for radioactivity to take place. Remember, radioactive particles are PARTICLES, and can be washed and stopped by PPE (thin Tyvek suits with hoods, gloves, and respiratory face protection and eye shields).  
* If mixed chemical/radiologic incident is suspected, then treat as a chemical incident with greater PPE consideration. 
* All victims must be screened for radiation. Those that test positive will need to be decontaminated. 
* In the meantime, you will need to treat the most severely injured.  
===Decontamination ===
* All victims need nasal swabs to assess degree of exposure &lt;i&gt;prior to showering&lt;/i&gt;. Best if done &lt;1 hour after exposure. 
* Treat the immediate victims first, then shower them (on gurneys).  
* All others can be showered, screened, and then treated. 
===Decontamination ===
* Due to inhalation or ingestion, some victims may not be totally decontaminated. Admitted to special isolation rooms as determined by hospital administration and Radiation Safety Officer. 
* Radiation may not be detected externally even if ingestion has occurred (hence the nasal swabs, and save body secretions is important) 
===Treatment ===
*All victims should have nasal swabs done to assess degree of exposure.
*Urine, feces, vomitus should be collected as well, with names and times labeled.
*Assess samples for radioactivity.
*Internal decontamination may be necessary
===Treatment- internal decontamination ===
* Potassium iodide- to protect thyroid if I 131 is suspected 
* gastric lavage within 1-2 hrs. until fluid is , 2x background radiation. 
* Antacids (AlOH, MgCO3) reduce GI uptake 
* Dulcolex or fleet’s phosphosoda cathartic enemas. 
===Treatment ===
* Vomiting- use 5-HT3 blockers (Zofran, Anzemet) 
* Draw blood for CBC, ALC, HLA, and Chromosome analysis in consultation with hematology. 
* CBC with an absolute lymphocyte count should be done. A drop of 50% in 24-48 hours has prognostic significance. 
* Consider anti viral and antibacterial prophylaxis in consultation with ID. 
* Isolation if pancytopenia is a risk. 
===Treatment ===
* Prostaglandin (misoprostol) analogues in consultation with GI may prevent GI bleed. 
* Colony stimulating factor may help those at risk for pancytopenia. 
* DTPA-chelates plutonium and other transuranic elements 
* Prussian blue- chelates thallium and cesium 
* Consult Nuclear Medicine as well for general management. 
===Treatment ===
* Amifostine- free radical scavenger, protective of cell membranes and DNA. 
* Clinically used to offset mucositis of RT. 
* Side effects- n/v, hypotension. 
* Protective pre exposure, may be valuable for first responders (and us!). 
* Post exposure not shown to help

==Questions? ==
===Acute radiation sickness ===
* ARS results from direct exposure to radiation from either particles or beams. 
* Initially N/V 
* More severe exposure → diarrhea, shock, and AMS 
* Advanced symptomatic state from radiation exposure alone → unlikely to survive.  But, can be difficult to distinguish from trauma related symptoms if an explosion has occurred. 
==In absence of injury ==
* Acute Radiation Sickness – 4 phases: 
** Prodromal phase-nausea /vomiting or no symptoms. 
** Latent phase –recovery  
** Manifest Illness phase- heme (anemia, infection), GI sloughing, bleeding and fluid loss. 
** Recovery or death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
&lt;b&gt;Renal osteodystrophy&lt;/b&gt; is a very broad term used to describe all of the pathologic features of bone related to renal failure. Renal failure and modern therapies (including peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and renal transplant) result in derangments in calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and bone metabolism.

==Pathophysiology==
Chronic renal disease leads to hyperphosphatemia (which binds serum calcium) and decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (important in gut uptake of calcium) by the proximal convoluted tubule. Low serum calcium results, which stimulates the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands. PTH acts to increase bone osteoclast activity, to decrease osteoid formation by the osteoblasts, to increase the kidney's production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, to increase active calcium resorption, and to decrease phosphate reabsorption. 

In the setting of untreated renal disease, PTH is elevated and resultant high-turnover bone disease occurs. Specifically, [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Primary hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]] leads to bone resorption, commonly from subperiosteal regions and tufts of the phalanges, proximal humerus, tibia and femur, distal clavicle, and calvarium. 


The prevalence of hemodialysis and renal transplantation, which helps to normalize PTH, has helped changed the presentation of this disease to a lower-turnover bone disorder. Phosphate binding compounds, including aluminum, inhibit osteoblast activity and contribute to the spectrum of disease.

==Clinical Presentation==

Renal osteodystrophy can have varied presentation, from vague complaints of bone pain and tenderness to striking skeletal deformity. In adults, the spectrum of disease is dominated by osteomalacia (and resultant bone weakness), and findings of [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Primary hyperparathyroidism|hyperparathyroidism]]. In children, whose active development is at risk, skeletal deformities ([[Wikipedia:rickets|rickets]]) are more prominent. These include skull flattening in neonates, bowing deformities of the appendicular skeleton in children, and in early adolescence, scoliosis and SCFE. Both adults and children are at increased risk of fracture. Children are additionally at risk of growth retardation.

==Radiologic Images==

Imaging findings are many and quite varied. Some of the more prevalent are:

*osteopenia - often seen early. 
*thinning of cortices and trabeculae. 
*&quot;salt and pepper&quot; skull. 
*[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Subperiosteal resorption|subperiosteal resorption]] 
*&quot;rugger jersey&quot; spine -- sclerosis of the vertebral body end plates.

==Differential Diagnosis==
*[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Primary hyperparathyroidism|primary]] or [[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Metabolic_Basic/Secondary_hyperparathyroidism|secondary hyperparathyroidism]] 
*[[Diagnostic_Radiology/Musculoskeletal_Imaging/Tumors_Basic/Multiple_Myeloma|multiple myeloma]] 
*[[Wikipedia:Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease|calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD)]]

= Logic =
* For a drop factor of 10, a drip rate of 21 → 125 cc/hr ==

Shouldn't it be that what immediately follows &lt;code&gt;|title=&lt;/code&gt; be &lt;code&gt;MONOPOLY&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;big&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ? This, because the sort key for the category list is then messed up. This is assuming you care to pay any attention to that. Besides, does it really need to be any bigger than what it is? On the other hand, why bother using the template for one (or two &amp;mdash; of the other I can't remember the title) occasions in which you want to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, even though you don't even need it? After all, it is bigger than all the other text anyways. --[[User:D. F. Schmidt|D. F. Schmidt]] 09:18, August 10, 2005 (UTC)
:Hm, you're right! I've removed it now... it was mainly there because the title page was looking rather small and lonely. :)
:The template adds far more than just font scaling though, it also applies the Monopoly-like font and color as well as placing the menu bar above it. This also means that any change made on a whim to the header formatting affects all pages in the wikibook instead of having to be manually changed in each. Not only that, it adds each page to the category without intervention.
:You can see the template I modelled it off in use throughout the [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] wikibook. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
::I do understand why you have a template. (I've studied [[w:Cascading style sheets]], which is a lot like templates here.) I was commenting that it seems silly to add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;big&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a template-modified thing, where the template already adds a font-size increase. I'm sorry if that's poorly worded. It's the best I can think of right now. That's all I was saying really. -- [[User:D. F. Schmidt|D. F. Schmidt]] 03:58, August 12, 2005 (UTC)
:::Ah I see now. :) I did it to have the text huge in one place and smaller in the other, otherwise yes it would have been in the template. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

==The Mega Edition==
So why was &quot;The Mega Edition&quot; deleted? It is officially licensed and of interest to the Monopoly community. It may be the most important addition to Monopoly since the Stock Exchange.</text>

situation amusante) a dinar con ille, ma illa non
accepta le invitation proque illa ha multo a facer.

Petro: Nos arriva tosto. Ecce mi appartamento.
Vamos. Entra.

Catherina: Gratias.

Alicia: Es io, Alicia. Ubi esseva vos heri durante
le postmeridie? Io telephonava tres vices.

Catherina: Qui es illa?

Petro: Alicia, mi secretaria.

Alicia: Finalmente, vos ha retornate a vostre
appartamento. Io ha unes novas pro vos. Vos va

Petro: Multe gratias!

Alicia: Vos va haber besonio de un secretaria in
Geneva. Non vos preoccupa. Io non va abandonar

Catherina: Bon. Illa ha explicate toto lo que

Catherina: Toto nunc se ha explicate.

Petro: Completemente. Omne es sur mi registrator

Petro: Si. Vos ha ration. Ascolta. Ubi va vos

Petro: Ben. Tunc nos nos videra le septimana proxime

Catherina: Si. Assi es le cosas. Usque le septimana
proxime!

Petro: Io vos accompania ex le edificio.

Catherina: No. Non face illo. Alicia forsan va
telephonar vos. E vos non esseva hic le ultime
vice que illa vos telephonava.


EXERCITIO 1: Ascoltar un message.

Guida: Bon. Petro nunc sape ubi ille va e proque.
Su secretaria, iste Alicia, pare assatis autoritari.
Que nos nunc ascolta un altere message ex un
registrator telephonic.

Un femina: Illo es un registrator telephonic.

Martina: Petro, io es Martina. Martina Barrate.
Ascolta, mi automobile es stropiate. Illo es in

Illa vole que Petro la porta illac.

Guida: Io comprende. Finalmente, io suppone que
omne illo va devenir plus facile, con le tempore.


SCENA 2: Strasbourg, in le officios de Marex Mundial:
In iste scena Petro parla a su chef de servicio.
Ille le dice que tosto ille va a Geneva. Il pare
que Bernardo, le Chef, jam sapeva isto, e ille deveni
irritate a causa del attitude apparentemente casual
de Petro sur su partita e le problemas que illo
va causar a omnes in le departimento.

Ille deveni specialmente irritate quando Petro demanda
su adjuta in su cerca pro su caffetiera preciose.
Ille expressa su irritation assatis fortemente, e
Petro rapidemente vade via, exprimente que ille
comprende proque le chef es assatis irritate.

Petro: Bernardo?

Bernardo: Si?

Petro: Esque io pote vider vos un momento?

Bernardo: Si.

Petro: Io va comenciar travaliar tosto sur un nove
projecto. Io sape que io non ha potite dar a vos
mi notification antea, ma ...

Bernardo: Io sape. Vos vade a Geneva.

Petro: Ah, vos jam lo sapeva?

Bernardo: Si. Vos parti multo tosto, nonne?

Petro: Si, multo tosto.

Bernardo: Al fin del septimana?

Petro: Exactemente. Io vola ibi deman.

Bernardo: Isto me pare un pauco troppo precipitate.

Petro: Si, si, io sape, e anque pro me.

Bernardo: Henrique va esser sol.

Petro: Si.

Bernardo: Ille va deber facer omne le travalio
completemente sol.

Petro: Oh, io es confidente que ille potera facer
lo assatis facilemente.

Bernardo: Vos vermente crede isto?

Petro: Si. Felicemente, il non ha multe travalio
in iste momento. Toto es multo calme.

Bernardo: Felicemente pro nos!

Petro: Si. Io sape que isto es vermente difficile
pro vos.

Bernardo: Si, ma ...

Petro: Bernardo, io volerea vos demandar un favor.

Bernardo: Si?

Petro: Heri on ha portate via omne le cosas in
mi officio, e io ha perdite alique. Illo es alique
que es mie personalmente.

Bernardo: Ah, si? Que?

Petro: Un caffetiera. Alicuno sin dubita credeva
que illo esseva le proprietate del compania, ma
illo es mie. Le problema es que io non pote trovar
lo, e ...

Bernardo: Un caffetiera?

Petro: Si. Un caffetiera marron. Electric. Io
lo ha comprate solmente ante un mense.

Bernardo: Ascolta, Petro. Io regretta isto, ma
io trova que vos exaggera le importantia de omne
isto un pauco. Vos me dice que vos va a Geneva
in quatro dies. Vostre partita causa multe
inconvenientias pro Henrique e le servicio. Isto
anque me causa grande problemas. E nostre clientes?
Que va illes pensar de omne isto? Vermente, Petro,
io non crede que isto es multo importante. E io
lo regretta, ma io non ha ulle tempore a perder
pro un caffetiera, mesmo si illo es nove.

Petro: Certemente. Io comprende. A revider.
(A se) Le Chef non es multo sympathic hodie.


EXERCITIO 2: Le datas e le tempore.

Guida: Si io comprende ben, le chef de Petro es
assatis irritate a causa de su viage a Geneva.
Il ha parlate de un demora troppo curte, il me pare.

Un femina: Quando va illo comenciar?

Secunde homine: Illo comencia lunedi. Demanda
a ille que lunedi.

Un femina: Que lunedi?

Prime homine: Le proxime lunedi. Demanda a ille
quanto dies illo face.

Un femina: Quanto dies face illo?

Secunde homine: Illo face sex dies solmente. Hodie
es martedi.

Un femina: Illo es un demora assatis curte.

Guida: Ah!

Un homine: Io sape. Illo es un demora multo curte.

Un femina: Io ha besonio de plus tempore.

Un homine: Illo comencia lunedi. Nos ha solmente
un septimana.

Un femina: Que die es hodie? Que esseva le die
de heri? Heri il esseva lunedi. Tunc hodie es
...

Un homine: Martedi.

Un femina: Illo vole dicer que deman le die essera

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: Strasbourg: Catherina and Petro are in
Petro's apartment. They are discussing his plans
for his trip to Geneva. In Catherina's presence,
Petro listens to the messages on his telephone
answering machine.

We hear a message recorded by Alicia, his secretary,
who reveals to him that she authorized that everything
be taken from his office because of his obligation
to go to Geneva for his work. She informs Petro
that she will go directly to Geneva to work with
him at the end of her vacation.

Petro does not seem very enthusiastic about his
transfer to Geneva. He invites Catherina (who finds
the situation a bit funny) to have dinner with him,
but she does not accept the invitation because she
has a lot to do.

Petro: We'll be arriving soon. There is my apartment,
over there. Let's go. Come on in.

Catherina: Thanks.

Petro: Follow me, please.

Catherina: This is a very nice room.

Petro: Yes. It isn't bad. Would you like something
to drink?

Catherina: No. I'm fine, thanks. I will be having
to leave before long. I've got a lot to do.

Petro: And you're going to Geneva tomorrow.

Catherina: Yes.

Petro: And me, I'm going Sunday, and we will see
each other Sunday afternoon or Monday morning.

Catherina: Yes, exactly. I could telephone you
shortly after you get to your office.

Petro: That would be a little early, but ....
That wouldn't bother you in any way?

Catherina: Not at all. What is this?

Petro: A telephone answering machine.

Catherina: Something like that can be very useful.

Petro: Yes. I'm not in my apartment all that often.

(Peter presses a button on the machine to hear his
messages.)

Alicia: It's me, Alice. Where were you yesterday
afternoon? I called you up three times.

Catherina: Who's that?

Petro: Alicia, my secretary.

Catherina: She isn't here right now?

Petro: No, she is on vacation.

Alicia: Finally, you've returned to your apartment.
I've got some news for you. You're gonna leave
for Geneva very soon. A letter arrived here from
Paris a week ago. They wanted to know if you would
be interested in the position in Geneva. I told
them that you were interested in the job and wrote
them a confirmation letter for you.

Petro: Thanks a lot!

Alicia: You're gonna need a secretary in Geneva.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna abandon you. I will
be going there to work for you very soon, after
my vacation.

Petro: She really thinks of everything!

Alicia: Your boss in Geneva will be a woman, Catherina
De Sanctis. She's young ... and very attractive,
it seems to me.

Catherina: I think your secrtary's very nice!

Petro: Really?

Alicia: There's something else: Marc Reval needs
you office. Tomorrow they're gonna move out all
your things. It will be necessary for you to find
another office until the end of the week. I said
that everything was okay because soon you would
be going to Geneva.

Petro: That woman's trying to plan my life as if
whe were my mother!

Alicia: That's everything. I'm gonna go out to
take in the sun. You're gonna need me, I know,
but we will be seeing each other very shortly.
I'm gonna send you a post card.

Catherina: Good. She's explained to you everything
I wanted to say to you.

Petro: Yes.

Catherina: Everything has now been explained.

Petro: Completely. Everything is on my answering
machine.

Catherina: Fine. I'm now gonna go away. We don't
have anything to discuss right now, it seems to
me.

Petro: Yes. You're right. Listen. Where are
you going to eat? Do you want to go out to eat
with me?

Catherina: No, thanks. I don't believe I want
to do that. I've got many things to do.

Petro: Fine. Then we will see each other next
week.

Catherina: Yes. That's the way things are. See
you next week.

Petro: I'll walk with you out of the building.

Catherina: No. Don't do that. Alicia perhaps
is gonna call you up. And you weren't here the
last time she called you.


EXERCISE 2: Listening to a message.

Guide: Good. Petro now knows where he is going
and why. His secretary, this Alicia, seems rather
authoritarian. Let's listen to another
answering-machine message.

Martina: Petro, this is Martina. Martina Barrate.
Listen, my car has broken down. It is in the garage.
I don't know the cause of the problem, but I won't
be able to get it back today. So could you give
me a lift to the office in your car tomorrow morning?
I can't use Eric's car because he needs it. Could
I go with you? I will be here all evening if you
want to call me up.

A woman: Where does she want to go?

A man: To the office, to work.

A woman: When? At what time?

A man: Tomorrow in the morning.

A woman: Will she use her own car to go to the
office?

A man: No. Her automobile is in the garage. She
wants Peter to give her a lift there.

Guide: I understand. Finally, I suppose that all
this will become easier, with time.


SCENE 2: Strasbourg, in the offices of Marex Mundial:
In this scene Petro is talking to the service chief.
He tells him that soon he will be going to Geneva.
It seems that Bernardo, the chief, already knew
this, and he becomes irritated because of Petro's
apparently casual attitude about his departure and
the problems it will cause everyone in the department.

He becomes especially irritated when Petro asks
his help in his search for his precious coffee maker.
He expresses his irritation rather strongly, and
Petro rapidly goes away, expressing that he understands
why the chief is a bit irritated.

Petro: Bernardo?

Bernardo: Yes?

Petro: Can I see you a moment?

Bernardo: Yes.

Petro: I'm going to start soon on a new project.
I know that I have not been able to give you my
notification before, but ...

Bernardo: I know. You're going to Geneva.

Petro: Ah, you already knew that?

Bernardo: Yes. You are leaving very soon, aren't
you?

Petro: Yes, very soon.

Bernardo: At the end of the week?

Petro: Exactly. I'm flying there tomorrow.

Bernardo: This seems a little sudden to me.

Petro: Yes, yes, I know, and also for me.

Bernardo: Henrique is gonna be alone.

Petro: Yes.

Bernardo: He's gonna have to do all the work
completely alone.

Petro: Oh, I'm confident that he will be able to
do it rather easily.

Bernardo: You really think so?

Petro: Yes. Fortunately, he does not have much
work right now. Everything is very calm.

Bernardo: Happily for us!

Petro: Yes. I know that this is really difficult
for you.

Bernardo: Yes, but ...

Petro: Bernardo, I would like to ask a favor of
you.

Bernardo: Yes?

Petro: Yesterday someone took away all the things
in my office, and I have lost something. It is
something that is mine personally.

Bernardo: Oh yes? What?

Petro: A coffee maker. Someone no doubt thought
it was company property, but it is mine. The problem
is that I can't find it, and ...

Bernardo: A coffee maker?

Petro: Yes. A brown coffee maker. Electric.
I bought it only a month ago.

Bernardo: Look, Petro. I'm sorry about this, but
I find that you are exaggerating the importance
of all this a little bit. You tell me that you
are going to Geneva in four days. Your departure
is causing a lot of inconvenience for Henrique and
the service. This is also causing me big problems.
And our clients? What are they going to think about
all this? Really, Petro, I don't think that this
is very important. And I'm sorry, but I don't have
any time to lose for a coffee maker, even if it
is new.

Petro: Certainly. I understand. See you later.
(To himself) The chief isn't in a very good mood
today.


EXERCISE 2: Dates and the time of day.

Guide: If I understand correctly, Peter's boss is
rather irritated because of his trip to Geneva.
He has talked about too short a delay, it seems
to me.

First man: Ask him when it is gonna start.

A woman: When is it gonna start?

Second man: It starts Monday. Ask him which Monday.

A woman: Which Monday?

First man: Next Monday. Ask him how many days
that is?

A woman: How many days is that?

Second man: That is only six days. Today is Tuesday.

A woman: That is a rather short delay.

Guida: Ah!

A man: I know. That is a very short delay.

A woman: I need more time.

A man: It starts Monday. We have only a week.

A woman: What day is today? What was the day
yesterday? Yesterday it was Monday. So today is
...

A man: Tuesday.

A woman: That means that tomorrow the day will
be ...

A man: Wednesday.

A woman: And the day after tomorrow will be ...

A man: Friday.

A woman: In four days the day will be ...

A man: Sunday.

A woman: That means then that in six days the day
will be ...

A man: Monday once again.

A woman: I need more time.

A man: We don't have the time.

A woman: I need another week.

A man: The congress is gonna start next week.

A woman: And it is going to continue next week.

Guide: Good. Catherina had to go by plane to
Switzerland today. I'm wondering if she has already
arrived in Geneva.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: Geneva, at the airport and in Carla Jackson's
automobile: Catherina is in the Geneva airport.
A woman, Carla Jackson, comes to meet her. Carla
is Swiss, but her husband is American and lives
in Switzeland.

She has come with her car to take Carla to a hotel,
and she talks a little about her life and her husband,
who is looking for work at this moment.

She gives Catherina the name of her hotel and indicates
to her where it is located. When they arrive at
the hotel in downtown Geneva, Carla expresses her
surprise when she discovers that Catherina is not
carrying much baggage with her.

Carla Jackson: Excusa me, are you Miss De Sanctis?

Catherina: Yes, that's me.

Carla Jackson: Good afternoon. My name is Carla
Jackson.

Catherina: Good afternoon.

Carla Jackson: Welcome to Geneva.

Catherina: Thanks.

Carla Jackson: Have you had a good trip?

Catherina: Oh, excellent, thanks.

Carla Jackson: I have an automobile to take you
away to your hotel.

Catherina: Ah, very good. You are very nice for
coming to pick me up. Where are you from yourself?

Carla Jackson: I'm Swiss.

Catherina: Swiss? Your name seems more English
or American.

Carla Jackson: Oh, yes, Jackson. My husband is
American.

Catherina: Do you live in Switzerland, you and
your husband?

Carla Jackson: Yes. Rather near the airport, a
few kilometers away. Twenty minutes by car.

Catherina: And what does your husband do?

Carla Jackson: Not much. He's not working at this
moment. He's looking for work.

Catherina: What's his profession?

Carla Jackson: He's a teacher. He teaches physical
education.

Catherina: Ah, it seems to me that it is not easy
to be a foreigner in Switzerland, especially when
a person doesn't have work.

Carla Jackson: You're right. Really, it's very
hard. But I, at least, have a job. It is not easy
for my husband, because he is a teacher, and he is
not a Swiss national. He's an American citizen.

Catherina: But you, you are a Swiss national?

Carla Jackson: Yes. I was born in Switzerland.
But my husband, he is American. And on top of that
he doesn't speak French very well.

Catherina: Then he can't work in a Swiss school.

Carla Jackson: That's right. He can work only
in an international school or a private school if
there is an available position. It's rather hard
for him at this moment. Things will get better
once he knows French well. And you, do you speak
English or another language?

Catherina: Yes. I speak English and German rather
well.

Carla Jackson: It's really useful to speak several
languages. ... Oh, I haven't told you the name
of your hotel. It's the Hotel Leman. It's in the
downtown area of the city, but in an area that is
not very noisy.

Catherina: That's perfect.

Carla Jackson: If you need anything, let me know.

Catherina: Thanks. I will do so. But first I
must find an apartment.

Carla Jackson: Finding an office is not difficult.
But an apartment is more complicated.

Catherina: Mr. Tanner is trying to find me something.
He knows Geneva well as well as the parts surrounding
it.

Carla Jackson: Ah, yes, Mr. Tanner. He doesn't
work in the same place I do, but I know him. We've
arrived at the hotel.

Catherina: Good. Thanks a lot.

Carla Jackson: It was a pleasure. This is really
all the baggage you have?

Catherina: Yes. I will be getting the rest very
soon later on.

Carla Jackson: You don't have much.

Catherina: It's enough for me right now. Ah, I
really like this hotel.


EXERCISE 3: Jobs and nationalities.

Guide: Very interesting, this conversation. I
would like to hear once again the expressions for
describing nationalities and positions of employment.

A man: This man, Dr. Chrales Lautner, he comes
from Switzerland?

A woman: He is Swiss. Here is Mr. Maurice Gobin.
He comes from France.

A man: He's French. Good. Mrs. Renate Schwartz.
She comes from Germany.

A woman: She's German. And Mrs. Conini? She comes
from Italy.

A man: She's Italian. And Mr. Gonzalo Alvarez?
He comes from Spain.

A woman: He's Spanish. And Mr. Joao Soares? He
comes from Portugal.

A man: He's Portuguese. And Mr. Akiro Mishima?
He comes from Japan.

A woman: He's Japanese. What does he do?

A man: He's a businessman. He is the president
of a small company that will probably will become
very important later on.

A woman: And Carla Jackson's husband?

A man: He doesn't have any work. He is unemployed.
He is a teacher. He is American. His wife is Swiss
and works in an office.

Guide: Hmm, I would like to hear part of this again,
but a little more slowly.

A man: What does he do?

A woman: He's looking for work.

A man: What kind of work?

A woman: As a teacher.

A man: Where does he come from?

A woman: From the United States. He's American.

A man: And his wife?

A woman: From Switzerland. She's Swiss.

A man: Is she also looking for work?

A woman: No. She has a job. She works in an office.
She is employed in an office.

Guide: Catherina is now going to her office. Let's
see now what's happening.


SCENE 4: Geneva, the offices of the holding company:
In this scene we get to know Alan Tanner, who works
in the building owned by the holding company. It
is obvious that he and Catherina know each other
very well socially. She asks him how a person can
find an office in Geneva.

Alan Tanner explains that there is no space in the
holding company's building but that he has arranged
for Catherina to immediately consult with an agent
who will be able to help her. But before Catherina
leaves to see the agent, Alan invites her to have
dinner with him. Catherina observes that he hasn't
changed in any way at all.

Catherina: Can I come in, Mr. Tanner?

Tanner: Catherina! Ah! I'm happy to see you.
How are you?

Catherina: Very well, thanks, Alan. And you?

Tanner: Very well. What do you think of Geneva?

Catherina: It seems to be very nice.

Tanner: Have you had a good trip?

Catherina: Very good, thanks.

Tanner: And the hotel, do you find it convenient?

Catherina: Yes. It is very good.

Tanner: And things in Paris, are they going well?

Catherina: Yes, everyting is going very well in
Paris.

Tanner: Ah. We had some really nice times in Paris,
you and I.

Catherina: Yes, really.

Tanner: You came a little early to get organized?

Catherina: Yes. At least I want to organize what
I can before starting work. Tell me, how can a
person find an office in this city?

Tanner: Ah. Unfortunately, there is no space in
this building.

Catherina: Yes, I know. I know.

Tanner: All this is stupid. You are only four
people, and everything is so big here. You'd think
we could find something for four new people, but
this isn't really possible.

Catherina: Yes, yes. I understand. At any rate,
it is not the same organization. It would probably
be better for us not to be in the same office.

Tanner: I don't see why not. But in any event,
I have called an agent who specializes in finding
offices, and I have arranged a meeting between you
and him. I believe that it would be better if you
talked directly with him.

Catherina: Ah, very good. When will the meeting
take place?

Tanner: Now.

Catherina: Now?

Tanner: Yes. The meeting was for nine thirty.

Catherina: But it is now nine thirty.

Tanner: I know.

Catherina: Then we'd better go there.

Tanner: Wait. Let's finish our coffee first.
We don't have any need to hurry up. And I have
some things to say to you.

Catherina: Oh yeah? About what?

Tanner: About the possibility of the two of us
going out to dinner this evening.

Catherina: Alan, you haven't changed at all.


EXERCISE 4: How to talk about the time of day.

Guide: I want to be confident about knowing how
to tell the time of day in Interlingua.

A woman: What time is it?

A man: It is about five thirty.

A woman: Five thirty.

A man: What time does the train come?

A woman: For train schedules, people use a
twenty-four-hour clock.

A man: Let's see. Seventeen hundred hours. What
does that mean?

A woman: Seventeen hundred hours is five o'clock.

A man: Let's try sixteen hundred forty hours.

A woman: Five forty. And eighteen hundred hours
fifty. What is that?

A man: Six forty.

A woman: And another way of saying ten to seven?

A man: Six fifty.

A woman: And ninteen hundred hours ten? What can
be said instead of nineteen hundred hours ten?

A man: Seven ten.

A woman: Yes, seven ten.

A woman: And seven fifteen? What can be said insted
of seven fifteen?

A man: A quarter past seven.

A woman: And seven forty five?

A man: A quarter to eight.

Guide: Ah, thanks. I now understand a bit better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: Strasbourg: Petro is in a travel agent's
office. He is making reservations for a flight
to Geneva. There is no direct flight to that
destination, and he must fly to Paris and transfer
to another plane. The agent suggests that Petro
go to Lyon and from Lyon by a high-speed train (TGV)
to Geneva, but Petro prefers to travel completely
by plane. The agent then sells him a ticket to
Geneva via Paris, and Petro gives him a check for
the trip.

Petro: Can you help me?

The agent: Just a moment. Yes. What can I do
for you?

Petro: I want to go to Geneva this Sunday.

The agent: How do you want to go there?

Petro: By plane.

The agent: What company?

Petro: The company? That doesn't matter. Any
company is okay.

The agent: First class? Tourist class?

Petro: Tourist class.

The agent: Morning or afternoon?

Petro: I prefer the afternoon. Let's say about
three or four o'clock.

The agent: Then ... well, it seems that there isn't
a direct flight between Strasbourg and Geneva.
You'll have to transfer to another plane in Paris.
There is an Air Inter flight between Strasbourg
and Paris. You will then go by Air France to Geneva.
You will leave in the morning.

Petro: And ... the trip takes how long?

The agent: Let's see. ... It depends on the time
that you have to wait in Paris. When do you want
to leave? What day?

Petro: Sunday. Next Sunday. At ten o'clock.

The agent: Sunday. ... You then will have an Air
Inter flight for Paris at eleven thirty, which arrives
in Paris at twelve forty-five.

Petro: Yes. ... And afterwards, how do I get to
Geneva?

The agent: You then have an Air France flight for
Geneva, which leaves at seventeen hundred fifteen
hours from Paris and arrives in Geneva at seventeen
hours twenty.

Petro: There's no direct flight?

The agent: No, none. If you don't want to take
two planes, you can go by plane to Lyon, and then
you can take the TGV to Geneva at seventeen hundred
hours twenty.

Petro: Yes, but I would have to go from the Lyon
airport to the railroad station. No. I prefer
to take the plane.

The agent: Very well. Can you give me your name?

Petro: Minelli, em, I, en, ee, double ell, I.

The agent: Your initials?

Petro: Pea, as in Petro.

The agent: Just a minute. Do you want to reserve
your trip from Geneva at this time?

Petro: No, I don't want a round-trip ticket. A
one-way ticket to Geneva is good enough.

The agent: Fine. One minute, please. Here's your
ticket. Your reservation is for Sunday the tenth
of this month. You leave Sunday from Strasbourg
at eleven thirty and you arrive at Geneva at seventeen
hundred hours twenty. You then will have to wait
in Paris three and a half hours.

Petro: Very well, thank you.

The agent: How do you want to pay? Credit card?
Check? Cash?

Petro: By check.

The agent: Fine. The total price is sixteen hundred
euros, please.

Petro: Okay. How do you want me to make out my
check?

The agent: To the Kaufman Agency.

Petro: Kay, ...

The agent: Kay, ay, you, eff, em, ay, double en.

Petro: Thanks. Here's the check.


EXERCISE 5: Buying a ticket.

Guide: Good. Petro has reserved his plane seat.
Let's try practicing the vocabulary used to do this.
What do you say to the travel agent?

A man: I want to go to Frankfurt on Friday, the
fourth of June. I want to travel by plane. I want
to reserve a plane seat for Frankfurt.

A woman: When do you want to leave?

A man: Friday.

A woman: There is a flight at ten o'clock.

A man: Is there a flight in the afternoon?

A woman: Yes. There is another Lufthansa flight
at four o'clock.

A man: What time does it get to Paris?

A woman: The flight lasts an hour.

A man: Then I will arrive there at five o'clock?

A woman: Yes, exactly.

A man: Fine. Can you reserve for me a seat on
the four o'clock flight to Frankfurt?

A woman: Yes. I can prepare for you a ticket for
the four o'clock flight to Frankfurt. And when
do you want to return?

A man: Can I leave the return flight open? I don't
know right now when I will be able to return, and
I would like to decide this later.

A woman: Yes, I understand. I am leaving the return
ticket open. How do you want to pay? You can pay
with a check.

A man: Can I pay with a credit card?

A woman: Yes, naturally. Or you can also pay in
cash. How do you want to pay?

A man: With a credit card. How much does the ticket
cost?

A woman: Six hundred fifty-five euros.

A man: Very well. Here's my credit card.

Guide: Let's return to Petro. He is in the airport,
and he is now making a new friend.


SCENE 6: Peter is at the point of getting on the
plane for Geneva at the Strasbourg airport, where
he meets a certain Mr. Melville, who says he is
a business consultant. Petro gives him a rather
detailed description of his work.

Mr. Melville gives him his card, saying that, because
of his many contacts with various governments, he
probably will be able to send some new projects to
Petro. He suggests finally that Petro send him a
detailed plan for an engineering project. Petro
is very happy and says he will send something to Mr.
Melville very soon.

The flight attendant: Passengers who have a green
embarcation card will have the first priority for
embarking. Please give passangers with a green
embarcation card the first priority for embarking
on the plane.

Melville: My card is green.

Petro: So is mine. It seems we have only thirty
minutes to wait.

Melville: Yes. Do you live in Geneva, or are you
going there only as a tourist?

Petro: I'm gonna work there.

Melville: Oh, yes. What do you do?

Petro: I work in urban transport.

Melville: Really?

Petro: Yes. Trains, buses, etc.

Melville: Allow me to introduce myself. My name
is John Melville.

Petro: Petro Minelli. Very nice to meet you.

Melville: So you're an engineer?

Petro: Yes, exactly. I have a technical and
commercial background, both of them.

Melville: Tell me a little about these systems
of transport and about your new company. That
interests me.

Petro: Okay. Imagine that you have a city of about
a million people. You need a means of public
transportation, underground possibly, like the metro.
Or perhaps you want a suspended monorail. Or possibly
a surface vehicle, a tramway.

Melville: Interesting. Continue.

Petro: You come to see us. We explain to you the
existing possibilities. We talk to you. We submit
to you different solutions. We then can construct
the transport project for you that you find most
suitable.

Melville: How? You provide the material, the
machines, the locomotives, the trains?

Petro: Everything. We build everything through
the companies in our group.

Melville: At a price.

Petro: At a very competitive price. I think you
will really find what we offer you to be the most
cost effective of all possibilities.

Melville: That's very interesting. Very interesting.
Listen, do you have a card?

Petro: I don't have my new card.

Melville: Let me give you mine. I can't find my
professional card at this moment, but here's my
personal card. It is possible that I can send a
project or two your way.

Petro: Oh yeah? What type of work do you do?

Melville: I am a consultant for different enterprises,
but I have especially good contacts with different
government agencies, and I think that I could have
need for services similar to yours.

Petro: Really? That sounds very good.

Melville: There is something that you can do for
me. Let's say we have a city of a million inhabitants,
for example. Let's say that we have such a city
in the Middle East. Can you send me a letter
explaining to me how you would begin, how you would
establish your schedules and prices, how much time
would be necessary for the project, etc. Can you
do that?

Petro: Certainly. I will give you an idea of our
ways of planning our projects and what we can offer
our clients.

Melville: Perfect.

The flight attendant: In a few minutes we will
be arriving in Geneva. Please put out your cigarettes
and attach your seat belts.

Melville: Very interesting. Very interesting indeed.

Guide: Very well. Petro has arrived in Geneva.
It seems his new work will be starting very soon.
Let's see what happens in the next part.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: In this scene, the agent that Alan Tanner
introduced to Catherina shows her a vacant office.
From what he says, the office is in one of the most
elegant districts of Geneva. Catherina examines
everything in detail and makes plans to change some
things. She wants a smaller reception area with
more space for the offices.

The agent confirms that such changes should not
present any problems. Afterward she verifies some
details about the lease, including the rental rate
and the term of the lease (three years with an option
to renew). Catherina and the agent return to his
office to conclude the formalities.

The agent: I am a real-estate agent, and I know
Geneva. I can tell you that this is a good office.
It is well situated. Do you know Geneva at all?

Catherina: No.

The agent: Well, you are in one of its most beautiful
neighborhoods.

Catherina: Oh yeah?

The agent: Yeah, an excellent neighborhood--and
also centralized and practical. And the building
is modern. It is on the third floor. Do you want
to use the elevator or the stairs?

Catherina: The stairs.

The agent: Here's the office.

Catherina: How much space does it have?

The agent: About sixty square meters.

Catherina: That should be enough.

The agent: The reception area is very big.

Catherina: What was the last organization that
occupied this office?

The agent: The last tenants worked in television
or something similar. I don't know exactly.

Catherina: I understand. I was only curious.

The agent: Here's an office over here.

Catherina: My, but it's very small.

The agent: Yes, you're right. It isn't very big.
Here are the toilets. Over there is another small
room.

Catherina: Yes. A drink machine can be installed
there.

The agent: Yes, that could be done very easily.
There you have a conference room. It's a very
beautiful room.

Catherina: What is its size? Thirty square meters?

The agent: Yeah. Its dimensions are six by five
meters, making thirty. Right. Almost thirty square
meters. Maybe a little more.

Catherina: Yeah. It would make a very beautiful
office.

The agent: It's a beautiful room, clear, with big
windows.

Catherina: Where does the sun come from?

The agent: The sun? Wait. Where is the south?
It should be there. Let's see. The sun turns like
this. You have it here in the morning. There are
connections for phones and electricity.

Catherina: Very good.

The agent: I think there is also another small
room over there.

Catherina: Yeah.

The agent: Here it is.

Catherina: For this reception room, we could put
a wall here and remove the wall there to make this
part here bigger.

The agent: Yeah, reducing a little the area of
the reception room.

Catherina: Would that cause problems?

The agent: No, no, no problems. You can put up
a wall here. Yeah, this could be done very easily.

Catherina: Are there some formalities that we must
finish?

The agent: That depends on what you want to do.
But in principle there aren't any problems. Many
of our clients make small structural changes that
are similar.

Catherina: And the rent?

The agent: Yeah. Three months in advance.

Catherina: And a lease for three years.

The agent: Three years, yes. That's correct.

Catherina: And if we want a lease for more than
three years?

The agent: We can discuss that later. I think
that there would not be any problem in extending
it.

Catherina: Fine. It seems perfect to me.

The agent: Very well. All right, let's go to my
office to take care of the formalities, if you want.

Catherina: Fine.

EXERCITIO 1: Description del officio.

Guide: We have been presented with many technical
words in this conversation, words about rent, etc.
But first, let's hear something about the ways of
describing an office.

A man: An office is made up of four parts. What
is the part where a person enters?

A woman: That's the reception area. Its dimensions
are generally three meters by four. The total space
of this is ...

A man: Twelve square meters. And then there is
a big room for meetings. What is its name?

A woman: A conference room. It is six by five
meters. What is the total space for this?

A man: Thirty square meters. Then there are two
rooms for working. They are called ...

A woman: ... the offices. They generally are some
about three meters by three meters. This is how
much in square meters?

A man: Nine square meters each one, or a total
of eighteen square meters.

A woman: And what is the total surface area? Twelve,
plus thirty, plus eighteen meters all together would
be ...

A man: That would be a total of some sixty square
meters. The office is near the train station, near
the banks, near stores. It is in the downtown area
of the city. There is space for parking cars and
bus stops. In other words, ...

A woman: ... it is well situated. And what is
the building itself like?

A man: It is a modern building.

A woman: The office is at street level?

A man: No, it is on the third floor. A store is
at street level.

A woman: How much is the rent each month?

A man: Forty-eight thousand euros per year. Payments
are made every three months.

A woman: Then I must pay how much in a three-month
period?

A man: Twelve thousand euros every three months.

A woman: I want the offices for three years. Is
this possible?

A man: Yes. We can get a lease for three years.

Guide: Ah, I'm starting to understand. In any
case, let's now see if Petro and Catherina have
run into each other.


SCENE 2: The Geneva office: Peter finally finds
Catherina after losing himself a few minutes on
the third floor. Catherine shows him their new
offices, and Petro finds them rather impressive.
He verifies that the phones are working, and they
talk about the need to hire a new
receptionist/secretary. Petro says he will call
up Alan Tanner to ask his help in finding a suitable
candidate. At the end of the scene we find out
that Petro will have to go on another trip.

Catherina: But where is Petro? We were gonna get
together at ten o'clock.

Petro: Catherina? Where are you?

Catherina: I'm here.

Petro: Ah, there you are. I have been looking
for you everywhee on the third floor.

Catherina: I was here.

Petro: You told me that I should go to the right
after getting off the elevator on the third floor.

Catherina: Yeah, that's true.

Petro: But I made a mistake. I went to the left.
It's because of this that I got here late.

Catherina: Don't worry. That's nothing important.
What do you think of our new offices?

Petro: They're nice. Everything is well illuminated.
The atmosphere is nice. There's enough space for
all of us.

Catherina: Yes. Once we are in complete working
order, there will be six or seven of us in these
offices.

Petro: We have enough space. Even in this room
there is enough space for six people.

Catherina: The last tenants used it as a conference
room.

Petro: It's nice. Do the phones work?

Catherina: I've been told that they do.

Petro: Let's see. Hello? Excuse me. I've made
a mistake. I wanted another number. Yes, they
work.

Catherina: Here we can put the telex.

Petro: Fine.

Catherina: And here there is enough space for a
xerox machine.

Petro: Excellent!

Catherina: Here's your office.

Petro: Very good. A desk, a lamp, an office chair,
a more comfortable chair, a telephone--perfect!

Catherina: I think we should tear down that wall
to make this room bigger.

Petro: Yes, obviously. That's an excellent idea.
Two or three days will be necessary for that work,
which will be rather easy.

Catherina: They want to do it this weekend.

Petro: I'm glad we can do it so rapidly!

Catherina; Here we will have a secretary/receptionist.

Petro: Yes, another excellent idea.

Catherina: Fine. What do you want to do now?

Petro: You're the boss.

Catherina: You can find a secretary. We will need
someone who can type.

Petro: Naturally.

Catherina: Mr. Tanner of Marex Mundial can help
us.

Petro: The American?

Catherina: Yes, him.

Petro: I know him.

Catherina: He has helped to solve our problems
in finding these offices.

Petro: Perfect. I'll call him up.

Catherina: I'm sure you will be able to make a
good selection. Very well, I want to install the
necessary machines, especially the computer.

Petro: And me, I've gotta make another trip to
Paris on Wednesday. Is there something else I can
do for you?

Catherina: Not right now. You already know what
we need.

Petro: Yes, an office that works.

Catherina: Exactly.

Petro: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

Catherina: Fine. See you then.

EXERCISE 2: Office equipment.

Guide: I'd like to verify the names of the things
they have in their offices:

A man: I'm wondering what people call the things
where they put letters, papers, and documents.
You put all the letters in ...

A woman: ... file folders. There's a file folder
for each file. Where are the file folders?

A man: The file folders are in a file cabinet.
There are photocopies of all the letters in the
file folders.

A woman: Maintaining photocopies of all documents
is an excellent idea. And that, I know, is a
typewriter.

A man: What is that?

A woman: A telex.

A man: Really?

A woman: And that machine is a photocopier.

A man: And what is this machine that people use
to add up columns of numbers, an adding machine?

A woman: Yes, an adding machine or a calculator.

Guide: Ah yes. Good. Petro has gone to another
office and is asking for help. Let's see what's
happening.

nos vide le proxime cosa que le confronta:


SCENA 4: Geneva, le officios del holding: Petro
parla con le senior Chambon, qui ha le responsabilitate
pro cercar appartamentos pro le personal de su
compania. Le secretario de Petro, Alicia, il pare,
telephonava ex Strasbourg e reservava duo appartamentos
pro ille e illa, le un juxta le altere. Petro dice
que ille non vole viver apud su secretaria e que
ille vole un parve appartamento in un altere edificio
a un certe distantia de illa.

duo centos septanta francos suisse. Illos es duo
appartamentos juxta se, e nos non ha besonio de illos
immediatemente.

Un homine: Il ha un error.

Un femina: Pardono?

Un homine: Il ha un error.

Un femina: Ma in vostre littera vos diceva duo
mille euros.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: Peter is going to Alan Tanner's office.
He says he has to find a receptionist/secretary,
and he would like to know if Alan could help him
with the problem. As for looking for a new apartment,
it seems that a certain mysterious person has already
solved this problem for Petro.

Petro: Mr. Tanner? Alan?

Tanner: Oh, hello, Petro. Come on in.

Petro: Thanks. Listen, I need your help.

Tanner: Fine. What can I do for you?

Petro: There are two things, to tell the truth.

Tanner: Yes?

Petro: First, we need a secretary/receptionist.

Tanner: Ah, a person who can answer the telephone
and write some letters, etc.

Petro: Yes, exactly.

Tanner: A bilingual secretary? A trilingual one?

Petro: Okay, English is the most important. After
that comes French. Naturally at times German could
be useful.

Tanner: Yes. Do you want a man? A woman?

Petro: That's not at all important, but probably
it will be a woman. What we want is a good secretary
with good qualifications.

Tanner: Very well. First I'm gonna consult with
our personnel service. There's also an agency.
And naturaly you could also publish a small classified
ad in the papers. But do you want somebody right
now?

Petro: Yes, as soon as possible.

Tanner: Very well. What was the second thing?

Petro: The other thing is an apartment for me.

Tanner: But I thought you already had an apartment.

Petro: No. I'm living now in a hotel. I want
to find an apartment, and Catherina told me that
you could help me with this problem.

Tanner: Yes. We have a housing office, but I believe
I saw something indicating that you already have
an apartment. Let me call up Chambon. Just a minute.
(On the phone) Mr. Chambon, please. Yes? He's
not there? Fine. I'm Mr. Tanner. I'm with
Mr. Minelli. He needs an apartment and ... yes?
Ah, yes, I also thought so. Thanks. Chambon is
not in his office, but the woman I talked with said
that she's sure that there's an apartment for you.
Two apartments, on the same floor. Someone in
Strasbourg has arranged for them.

Petro: Someone in Strasbourg?

Tanner: Yeah.

Petro: Two apartments?

Tanner: Yeah. Your associate ...

Petro: Oh, God!

Tanner: Pardon?

Petro: Excuse me. Can I see Mr. Chambon?

Tanner: Yeah. He's gonna return to his office
in ten minutes. He's in office four hundred eleven.

Petro: I'm gonna go there to see him.

Tanner: Fine. Soon I'm gonna find a secretary
for you.

Petro: Thank you so very much.

Tanner: It's a pleasure.


EXERCISE 3: Polite Questions.

Guide: Let's listen to this friendly conversation.

A man: How's everything?

A woman: Just fine, thanks. And you, how're you
doing?

A man: Oh, just fine, thanks. Everything's going
okay?

A woman: Yes, thank you. Everything's going fine.
How's business?

A man: Oh, not bad. Everything's going the way
it usually does. Too much work, never enough money,
as always. But how's business for you?

A woman: Oh, okay, I guess. We've got a lot to
do at this time of the year. How's your family?

A man: Things are going fine with them. And how's
your boss?

A woman: Oh, he's doing okay. He's very worried
right now.

Guide: This seems rather easy to me. Petro wanted
to clear up the story about his apartment. Let's
take a look at the next thing he runs into.

SCENE 4: Geneva, the offices of the holding company:
Petro is talking to Mr. Chambon, who has the
responsibility for looking for apartments for the
personnel of his company. Petro's secretary, Alicia,
it seems, made a phone call from Strasbourg and
reserved two apartments for him and her, one next
to the other. Petro says he that he doesn't want
to live next to his secretary and that he wants
a small apartment in another building at a certain
distance from her.

Petro: Good mornng, Miss.

The secretary: Good morning, sir.

Petro: Can I speak to Mr. Chambon, please? I'm
Petro Minelli. Mr. Tanner sent me here.

The secretary: I'm sorry, but Mr. Chambon is not
in his office right now. But he probabily will
be back very soon.

Petro: Very well. Can I wait for him?

The secretary: Certainly. You can sit down over
there if you want. ... Ah, Mr. Chambon has come
back. I'm gonna tell him that you are waiting for
him.

Petro: Thanks a lot.

The secretary: It's a plesure.

Chambon: You are Mr. Minelli, no doubt.

Petro: Yes, I am.

Chambon: Come (on) in. Excuse me for not being
here when you arrived.

Petro: Don't worry about that. I didn't have to
wait very long for you.

Chambon: Fine. I suppose that you want to see me
about your apartment.

Petro: Exactly.

Chambon: Fine. I believe that I have two suitable
apartments for you. There're a little expensive,
but you said that that wasn't at all important.

Petro: What?

Chambon: Yes. The rent is eight thousand two hundred
seventy Swiss francs. They are two apartments next
to each other, and we don't have any immediate need
for them.

Petro: How much is that in Euros?

Chambon: Okay ... let's see ... It's eight thousand
five hundred euros.

Petro: Eight thousand five hundred euros ... Listen,
I think there's a mistake.

Chambon: Oh really?

Petro: You received an order from Strasbourg?

Chambon: Exactly.

Petro: Did you receive a letter from ...

Chambon: No. We received a telex. It was signed
by ... wait. I should have it here in this folder.
Yes, A. Martini. Alicia Martini.

Petro: Alicia Martini. Yes, I believe that there
is a mistake.

Chambon: Oh, really?

Petro: Yes. It seems that my secretary did not
understand exactly what I wanted. I need only a
rather small place that is not too expensive.

Chambon: Small?

Petro: Yes, very small and very cheap. A rather
small studio would be enough for me.

Chambon: Ah, that's gonna be much more difficult
to find. Apartments for unmarried people are harder
to find here in Geneva, especially cheap apartments.

Petro: But can you try to find me one?

Chambon: I'll do everything that I can do.

Petro: Thanks a lot.

Chambon: You're sure you don't want these two larger
apartments?

Petro: Yes, completely.

Chambon: Very well. I'm gonna try to help you
out.

Petro: Thank you so much.

Chambon: Don't worry. It's a pleasure.


EXERCISE 4: Corrections.

Guide: It seems that Petro's secretary is causing
some irritating problems for him. I have the
impression that she would like to be more than a
secretary. But what interests me is the method Peter
used to correct this mistake. What do people say
after making mistakes when they speak?

A man: There's a mistake.

A woman: Excuse me?

A man: There's a mistake.

A woman: A mistake?

A man: Yes. That's not the right price. It's
three thousand euros.

A woman: Three thousand euros? But you told me
two thousand.

A man: Yes, but there's a mistake. I believe I
made a mistake.

A woman: It isn't two thousand euros?

A man: Unfortunately no. I'm sorry about this.

A woman: But in your letter you said two thousand
euros.

A man: Yes, I know. The letter said two thousand
euros. But there was a lack of communication.
I'm very sorry about it.

Guide: I think I now understand.

features=Offensive term for a Muggle-born wizard/witch|
appearance=''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''
}}

== Overview ==

An offensive and insulting term for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] witches or wizards. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This term, which is bad enough that it rather shocks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] when he first hears that it has been used, is a dreadful insult. Wizards who pride themselves on being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|&quot;pure-blooded&quot;]] use the term to suggest that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] parents or grandparents somehow pollute the person's blood.

== Analysis ==

While the term is first used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], and is there seen as being a horrible insult, it is instructive to note that as the series continues, it is used more frequently; and with the increase in usage it loses its power.

Draco Malfoy uses &quot;mudblood&quot; to describe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], who is born of Muggle parents. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] see this as clear evidence that Draco is ruled by prejudice, and believe that this makes him likely to join [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s organization. The reader perforce accepts Harry's point of view in this.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] tells Hermione that the term is used to refer to one with &quot;dirty blood, common blood.&quot; While the term is not used in the book to refer to wizards with one Muggle parent, it seems that a wizard obsessed with &quot;Blood purity&quot; could consider such a person to have &quot;polluted their blood&quot;, and so could use this term against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Half-blood|Half-blood]] witches and wizards as well. It is interesting to look at the roster of characters in the series and see who could be equally tarred by this epithet. Of course, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Harry's mother]] springs from Muggle roots, but interestingly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] had a Muggle father, and for that matter so did Voldemort himself.

== Overview ==

A ''Muggle-born'' is a witch or wizard of non-magical ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]]) parentage. Muggle-born witches and wizards are looked down upon by some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|Pure-Blood wizards]], who think that purebloods are superior and Muggle-borns are unworthy of magic.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Famous examples of Muggle-born witches are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger.]] We are told that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] is Muggle-born as well.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter_7|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] we are introduced to another name for those witches and wizards born of Muggle parentage - [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mudblood|&quot;Mudbloods&quot;]]. This is an insult used only by purebloods who feel that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Half-blood|Half-blood]] and Muggle-born witches and wizards are somehow inferior to purebloods.

== Analysis ==

Apparently it is not necessary to have magical ancestry to be able to do magic oneself; it seems that magical ability can spontaneously appear without known magical ancestry, and sometimes in only one child of a given union. Lily Evans' sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia]] showed no sign of magical talent, though her son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] may have shown a hint of ability.

Through a process possibly akin to hybrid vigor, it seems that many of the most powerful wizards have some Muggle in their recent background. Interestingly, it seems that powerful wizards and witches can spring directly from Muggle roots as well: Lily Evans and Hermione Granger are noted to be highly gifted Muggle-born witches.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

A '''''parselmouth''''' is a wizard or witch with the ability to understand and talk to snakes (using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]). 

== Extended Description ==

Perhaps the best known Parselmouth was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. His heir, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle]], possesses this ability as well, and presumably passed it on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] via his attempt to kill him with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|the Killing Curse]]. Parselmouths are often assumed to be evil, partially because of their association with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], three more Parselmouths are introduced: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]].

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is initially uncertain whether Voldemort is aware that Harry is a parselmouth, though likely rumours have reached him. The incarnation of Voldemort that is aware of Harry's ability was destroyed at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] suggested in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' that Voldemort was likely unaware of its destruction at the time. He may have since learned of its fate from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], but will not have learned any fine detail from that source, since we discover in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that Voldemort is unable to sense the destruction of the diary, or anything else about it. It is also unknown whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] would have mentioned Harry's being a Parselmouth to Voldemort, given his complex loyalties. So having an opponent who can unexpectedly understand and countermand his orders to a part of his army might prove a problem for Voldemort.

As it turns out, however, the final battle does not involve any significant number of snakes, apart from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]]; so while the fact that Harry is a Parselmouth is important to the story in the seventh book, it is not a factor in the final battle. By [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|Christmas of Harry's seventh year]], however, it is certain that Voldemort does know that Harry is a parselmouth; the trap that Voldemort sets for Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] will not work on anyone who does not speak Parseltongue.

== Overview ==

The opposite of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] witch or wizard, a '''''Squib''''' is the child of wizarding parents with no magic powers of his or her own. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Squibs live a most uncomfortable life. Raised in Wizarding families, they are perforce aware of magic, and see it used all around them all the time, and yet they cannot take part in it. While the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] shields Muggles from this awareness of the magical world, nothing can be done for Squibs without depriving them of their parents; they would have to forget the entire time they were growing up, when magic would have been pervasive in the family home. It is quite likely that this deprivation of magic leaves most squibs embittered.

On the Hogwarts Express in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 6|first year,]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] mentions that he has a relative who has no magical abilities; he believes she is an accountant, but says that they don't talk about her much.

During [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|second year]] he discovers that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] is a Squib. We also learn that there are mail-in courses that are supposed to teach magic to squibs; the effectiveness of these courses is unknown, but the author has stated, in a later interview, that the home-study course does not work on Filch.

Before the start of Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|fifth year]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Arabella Figg]] reveals to Harry that she is also a Squib.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] is initially so unsure of his magical abilities that he is afraid that he is &quot;almost a Squib&quot;. 

There are rumours that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s late sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] was hidden away from Wizarding society because she was a Squib and an embarrassment, rumours that are fanned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] in her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Life and Lies|&quot;tell-all&quot; book about Dumbledore]], which was published shortly after his death. It is worth noting that squibs not only had a hard life, as mentioned above, but were embarrassments to their parents.

== Analysis ==

Early on, we learn that not all wizards are equally powerful. Quite apart from the obvious specializations – [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] Healing, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] with flying and refereeing, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]], to give a few examples – we gather that there are wizards who overall have stronger or weaker magical abilities. This is explicitly mentioned several times in the case of Neville Longbottom, who repeatedly bemoans his magical weakness. We also learn that it is possible for wizards to spring from Muggle families, and we are presented with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], who has done exactly that. Combining these two, it is clearly possible that a Wizarding family may, on occasion, contain an individual with limited or no magical powers. While Ron touches on the concept briefly, and Neville more strongly, we don't hear the name for the condition until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|Harry's second year]].

Despite their lack of magical ability, Squibs are now regarded as part of the Wizarding world. This is a very uncomfortable place for them, as they are perforce aware of the world of magic but cannot join it. All the same, it is better than the past century, when they were apparently often hidden away as being unfit for either Wizarding or Muggle company.

It is perhaps worth mention that while &quot;Squib&quot; is a term for non-magical people born of magical parents, there is no analogous term for magical children born of Muggle parents (like Hermione, whose parents are both Muggle dentists). The closest term available is &quot;Muggle-born&quot;, which seems to be used only as a term of derision, a milder form of &quot;Mudblood&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shouldn't a binary search be introduced before a merge sort, since a merge sort is basically a binary search used for sorting.

I also think that heap and quick sorts need to be mentioned a variants of the merge sort.

:Heap short is covered in [[Computer Science:Data Structures]], since that's where heaps are covered. Pedagogically, I see nothing wrong with covering merge sort first: that's a much better demonstration of the divide and conquer technique than binary search is (that's because DnC has the conquer step, e.g. the merge operation, but there is no real conquer step in binary search, so it's a weaker example; though, it is important to show such cases-- but only after the main point is already understood).

:Quick sort is covered in the next chapter (which is on randomization). Quick sort is certainly a divide and conquer technique and it's mentioned as such, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it a variant of merge sort. (Nor would I consider a heap sort a merge sort variant-- not variant in the sense of, say, the Shell sort is a variant of the bubble sort.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:39, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

== Is the iterative code for MergeSort correct? ==

Im not seeing this section happen in my head 

     for i := 1 to n by unit*2
       let a1[1..unit] := result[i..i+unit]
       let a2[1..unit] := result[i+unit..i+unit*2]
       result[i..i+unit*2] := merge(a1,a2)
     repeat

Shouldnt the indexes of result array be [2*i...2*i+unit] and [2*i+unit..2*i+unit*2] respectively? Or are the array overlaps intentional?

== Removed personal (but probably relevant) comment ==
I removed [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Algorithms%2FDivide_and_Conquer&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1705394&amp;oldid=1374405 a personal remark on the middle of the text], it was contributed by an anonymous editor 10:35, 1 May 2006 59.184.1.252 it could probably refer to this http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs251/ClosestPair/ClosestPairDQ.html page, so if anyone is interested in examining the info and reword it into the text it may be helpful.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:10, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

== Use a more modern language ==
Please, could we update the cod to use a more modern language, or at least something that has some use today? (And this includes C) 
Seriously, representing the first element of an array as '1'?
If we're going to be programming, let's at least use relevant code.</text>

== Introduction ==
== Biology ==

Biology is the study of life. It encompasses many fields ranging from Botany (the study of plants) to Zoology (the study of animals). The biological aspect concentrates on the chemical and physical mechanisms that are associated with life.

== Psychology ==

Psychology is the study of the mind and is a fast-evolving and ever changing field. It is considered the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. It is influenced by the positivist movements, and is also highly quantitative. This means that  the logical truth of something must be based in the material world (positivism), and it uses mathematical equations to give support, or prove theories (quantitative). 

A mistake is often made to dismiss something as non-quantitative because current technology or thought cannot quantify it. This has been a struggle with psychology, and only recently in the history of science has psychology been recognized as science. Some fields within psychology, most notable, psychoanalysis still do not appear to adhere to positivistic or quantitative principles. Psychoanalysis is not considered to be scientific because of its concentration on the unconscious mind. One thing that history shows is that a field considered non-quantitative may in the future have a basis in the physical world. In fact, if the underlying mechanisms of consciousness and unconsciousness can be understood and manipulated by biopsychologists, psychoanalysis may indeed have a positivistic basis.

The ever changing nature of psychology is fascinating and important to study. The emergence of a physical mechanism via the brain and electrochemical processes has further thrust psychology into the realm of science and blurs the line between psychology and biology.

== How they work together ==

Biology and psychology tightly integrate together. This is because the brain is the location of thought or mind, and it is governed by electrochemical properties. These are the same basic principles that underlie all other functions that create life. This means that the actions of the mind are governed by the physical world and since the mind is paramount to the study of psychology, psychology is really just a subfield of biology.

= Brief History of Psychology\Biology =
== Ancient Greeks ==

The '''Ancient Greeks''' were pioneers of biology and medicine.  They were experienced enough with anatomy to hypothesize that behavior and cognition derived from biology rather than spirituality.  In particular, Hippocrates proposed that a person's personality is determined by the balance of four bodily fluids, or humors: black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm.  Although this idea is not supported by modern evidence, the terms &quot;choleric&quot;, &quot;melancholic&quot;, &quot;sanguine&quot;, and &quot;phlegmatic&quot;, which derive from these four fluids, are still in popular use.

== The Microscope ==
== Foundations in Physics ==

It is unsettling to believe that one's behavior and one's thoughts are dictated by the laws of physics, but the mechanics behind many psychological phenomena have been demonstrated.

== The First Psychology Laboratory ==
== Phrenology ==
Phrenology is the idea that different parts of the brain perform different functions.  It was formally proposed by Franz Gall, though others, such as Paul Broca, followed a similar ideology.  Gall made the further claim that the size of the different brain regions corresponded to an individual's relative strengths and weaknesses, and that the size of brain regions could be detected by analyzing the shape of one's skull.  This latter point would be taken by some of Gall's students and turned into a form of divination that led to phrenology's reputation as a parlor trick.  However, the idea that the brain is segregated into functional regions remains prominent today.

== Behaviorism ==
Behaviorism is the idea that all (or most) psychological phenomena, including a person's behavior and thoughts, are learned through classical and operant conditioning.  This is in contrast to the idea that traits are innate, such as by genetics.  James Watson and BF Skinner were two of the most prominent behaviorists.  James Watson is perhaps most famous for his &quot;Little Albert&quot; demonstration, in which he conditioned an infant to fear a white rabbit by playing loud noises every time the infant approached it.  Not only did the infant develop an aversion for white rabbits, but the fear generalized to other white fluffy objects (e.g. cotton balls, Santa's beard).  BF Skinner conducted experiments at the University of Minnesota in which he used operant conditioning to train pigeons to perform such tasks as playing a miniature piano.
The debate of &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; remains strong today, but it is now clear that most of psychology derives from the interaction between these forces.

&quot;The role of a writer is not to say what we all can say, but what we are unable to say.&quot;|caption=--Anaïs Nin}}

This chapter begins with some prewriting strategies to help you generate ideas and pick a topic. In addition to learning ways to overcome writing anxiety (writers' block), you will also learn how to craft an outline to keep your ideas on course, organize your draft, and tailor it to your audience. 

Before you actually begin writing, ask yourself the following questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? Which?

For instance, you might ask yourself:
&lt;br&gt;
#Why am I writing?
#What is my subject?
#Which subject has the most potential to attract readers?
#Who is my audience?
#Where does my background information come from?
#How can I persuade my readers?

Keeping these questions in mind before, and during, the writing process will help you identify and develop ideas. If you experience difficulties, seek your instructor's advice to steer you back on course.

= How do I pick a topic? =
Have you ever been stressed out because you can't think of a good topic for an important writing assignment? You're not alone. As a student, you'd probably prefer it if professors would just assign topics rather than leave you to find one on your own. However, professors aren't vague because they want to punish you; they usually just don't want to constrain your creativity or discourage you from writing about topics that truly interest you. Professors also want to be surprised by their students' ingenuity, and very few teachers want to read a big stack of essays all on the same stale topic. Unfortunately, just being told to &quot;be creative&quot; is unlikely to calm you down when you've got a major paper due next week and still haven't found a topic to write about!

Imagine that you are in an introductory literature course. The professor has assigned a 3-5 page essay on a Shakespearean play that requires multiple sources. You try asking the professor to be more specific, or offer some suggestions. The professor responds, &quot;No, it's up to you. Surprise me.&quot; What do you do?

One smart option is to go to the library and look for scholarly journals that cover Shakespearean studies. You might also try scholarly books about Shakespeare and his plays. Browsing these sources should give you some ideas about the aspects of Shakespeare and his plays, that scholars have found worth writing about. You might find that an idea that you thought was &quot;totally original&quot; has already been done. However, you shouldn't let this worry you. If every essay or book had to be 100% original, we'd have precious few to read! 

If you keep reading and skimming articles and books, you will find many different discussions and possibilities for writing topics. One way to do this is to write a list of binaries, a list of opposing ideas that may represent larger discussions about the topic at hand. Choosing from these opposing ideas in the text will lead you to ideas for a more specific argument. Scholars frequently engage in complex and long-lasting arguments that span across different journal articles and books. Professor X's article on climate change will be mentioned, discussed, or challenged by Professor Y in a book and Professor Z in another article. None of them are worried about saying things that have never been said before; the key is just to say them differently and perhaps better.

You will always have one advantage over any other scholar you read--their articles and books cannot take advantage of all the relevant scholarship that appeared after their publication date. Don't be afraid to freshen up an old article with new supporting evidence--or challenge one whose conclusions are called into question by subsequent research.

You should also look for an issue that you can reasonably cover given the time and space (page count) you have available. After that it's a simple matter of supporting your argument by bringing in relevant quotations from those who agree with you. You should also identify the counter-arguments and provide pertinent background information.  

This technique also works well for writing theses and dissertations. Instead of writing about &quot;things never written about before,&quot; try to make a new contribution to one of the many ongoing conversations in the field. This approach is especially handy if you hope to publish your work, since some publishers tend to favor works that fit with their existing line of publications. Readers also expect you to be familiar with, and probably refer to, works of other scholars who have written on your topic. Think of your work as either extending existing work or taking it in a new direction.

If you intend to publish fiction, it's a good idea to first familiarize yourself with the work of successful fiction writers and consider what it is about their work that appeals to publishers. There is no shame in following the same roads that led to their success. This isn't the same as &quot;copying&quot; or &quot;ripping off&quot; an author; there is a difference between duplicating techniques and duplicating content.

In essence, the easiest way to find a topic to write about is to see what other writers are writing about and join their &quot;conversation.&quot; The conversation metaphor is a very useful way to understand what scholarship is all about. Rather than thinking of essays or books as isolated units of scholarship, try envisioning them as the fruits of a massive network of scholars who converse with each other via scholarly documents, conference presentations, e-mail, phone calls, and other forms of communication.  Research ''what'' is available and ''where'' you can make the most valuable contribution.

= What are Some Other Ways to Get Ideas? =
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;The best time for planning a book is while you're doing the dishes.&quot;|caption=--Agatha Christie
}}

Still stuck even after pouring over all those books and journals? Don't worry. There are plenty of other ways to stimulate your brain. 

In general, though, remember that good ideas may arise anytime and anywhere. You might be struck by a brilliant insight as you're running on the treadmill or even while dreaming. Always be prepared to record new ideas. Carry a small notepad with you or use your mobile phone to record a voice memo. You might even try writing the idea on a napkin and taking a picture of it. The important thing is to get it down quickly, because you're all too likely to forget all about it by the time you're ready to write.

Another good way to generate ideas is to read and listen actively.  Your texts and professors will discuss relevant issues in the field, and they might make comparisons to related ideas and other thinkers. A professor might say, &quot;There is still work to be done in this area,&quot; or &quot;there is great controversy over this issue.&quot; Be alert to these sources for good ideas. The biggest mistake a novice writer can make is to rely solely on &quot;inspiration.&quot; As a scholar, you are never alone--don't be afraid to listen and respond to the work of others instead of always trying to be original or profound.

Even chatting with your classmates might help you think of a good topic. You can also check with your college or university's writing center. Many of them have tutors who can help you find and hone a great topic for your paper.

Let's look now at three other techniques for getting those brain juices flowing: brainstorming, clustering, and freewriting.

==What is a Brainstorm?==
Brainstorming allows you to quickly generate a large number of ideas.  You can brainstorm with others or you can brainstorm by yourself, which sometimes turns into freewriting. To effectively brainstorm, write down whatever ideas come to mind.  Sometimes it works better to write down each idea on a separate piece of paper.  It also helps to ask yourself some questions:

# What do I care about or what am I interested in?
# What do I know that I could teach others?
# What irritates me? 

In order to capture more of your thoughts, you may want to brainstorm a few times until you have enough ideas to start writing.

'''Examples'''

Imagine you are in a class. Your instructor says you will have to write a paper on your favorite free-time activity, and that you must also persuade your reader to try it.

First ask yourself, ''What do I care about?'' or ''What am I interested in?''

It is easiest to write about a topic that you are interested in. This could be anything from gardening to ice skating, or from writing poetry to playing the piano.  Your list, in this example, would then read:&lt;br&gt;
#gardening
#ice skating
#writing poetry
#playing the piano
At this stage, every idea is good since you are trying to come up with as many ideas as possible.  

Second, ask yourself, ''What do I know that I could teach others?'' 

You may be able to teach someone else something that you really enjoy.  Good for you!  If you cannot, don't worry; you are still just brainstorming. Perhaps you teach swimming lessons or t-ball, or maybe you bake really well and are able to offer some of your insights. Your list, in this example, would then read:
#swimming lessons
#t-ball
#baking
Anything is fine.  You are still brainstorming.

Let's think of another example. How about the common situation in which the instructor wants you to write about &quot;something you care about&quot; or an &quot;issue you have&quot;?

Again start by asking yourself a question. Ask yourself, ''What irritates me?''

Everyone has things that irritate them, some small and others larger. An example of something small that's irritating could be people in your dorm who leave trails of toothpaste by the sink and never clean up after themselves. A personal example can be useful as a bridge to a larger issue that will be your topic -- in this case it could be community living and personal responsibility.

In academic writing with a less personal slant, the source of irritation is often another writer/theorist with whom you disagree. Your &quot;irritation&quot; then would lead to an effective piece about why you have a better conception of what's really going on. A less direct version of this would be a writer/theorist who makes some good points but lacks something in his/her argument that you can add to the &quot;conversation.&quot;

A majority of academic writing begins with brainstorming. Go ahead! Try one or many of the ideas for brainstorming either by yourself or in a group. Working together to come up with ideas means that there are more ideas coming from many different minds.

==What is Clustering?==
Clustering is a process in which you take your main subject idea and draw a circle around it. You then draw lines out from the circle that connect topics that relate to the main subject in the circle. Clustering helps ensure that all aspects of the main topic are covered.

'''Example'''

After using the brainstorm example, let's say you decided on gardening as your topic. Your main idea of gardening would be in the center of your page circled. Anything else that you want to say about gardening you would connect to the circle with lines. You can also add more lines to extend the ideas that relate to thoughts around the circle. When finished, your clustering might look like the following: {{-}}
[[Image:Cluster_Example.png]]

==What is Freewriting?==
Freewriting helps generate ideas and set them in motion. To begin, start writing without worrying about spelling or grammatical errors. You should write your ideas naturally and spontaneously so that you can record many ideas quickly.  Do not look back at what you wrote until you are satisfied that you have written enough. An easy way to freewrite is to set a time limit and then begin writing. You can write anything at all, and in the end, you will often find some quality ideas scattered throughout your writing.

'''Example'''

# I set my kitchen timer for a specific amount of time.  Let's say 5 minutes.
# I just begin writing without worrying about what I am putting onto the page.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
Things I like to do.  Watching TV is a great way to unwind after a long day.  Playing video games is too.  I like talking to my friend Steph on the phone, but I get annoyed when she doesn't call me back.  I like shopping.  My favorite store is JC Penney.  They have everything that you need there.  I can buy clothing, luggage, things I need for my kitchen, wall coverings.  I love that store.  I like going to the theater.  Last  year, I saw ''The West Side Story''.  It was amazing.  For some reason, I always look forward to fall and spring yard work.  I don't know if it is the sense of accomplishment I feel when the yard is ready for the season or what, but I really do enjoy it.  There are so many things that need to be done each year too.  In the spring, you need to be sure to fertilize before&lt;br&gt;
|caption=A sample freewrite.}}

3.  The timer went off, so I stop writing.&lt;br&gt;
4.  At this point, I review what I have written and decide which point(s) &lt;br&gt;to elaborate on.

With these simple writing tips, you should be able to find a topic and begin the process of writing the assigned paper.  Established authors use brainstorming, clustering, and freewriting, so you're in good company when you use these techniques to help you overcome writer's block or writing anxiety. After all, your indecision is only a question, and to quote the popular college  text ''[https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog594/files/geog594/WritingAnalyticallyChap6.pdf Writing Analytically]'' &quot;learning to write is largely a matter of learning how to frame questions.&quot; If none of these work for you, try to come up with your own strategy.  What works for someone else may not work for you.  After all, these prewriting strategies are just ways to put your ideas on the paper so you can develop them at a later time.  Try to enjoy the process of writing instead of seeing writing only as the chore of finishing an assignment your instructor has given you.  Done this way, writing might become a pleasure that can also improve your critical thinking ability.

= Starting with a Thesis Statement =

= How Do I make an Outline?=
Developing an outline, such as the examples below, can be helpful because you can keep an overview of what you want to say, check whether you have covered everything, and find what is out of scope and should be excluded. The outline can grow during the writing process as new points come to mind.

'''Outline example I'''
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
I.   Introduction and Thesis
: Brief description of issues that arise when reading &quot;Hamlet&quot;
II.  Issues of feminism uncovered through reading &quot;Hamlet&quot;
: a. What other scholars have discovered about feminism in &quot;Hamlet&quot;
: b. Which of these discoveries was most evident to me and how  
: c. Ideas of feminism that I uncovered on my own
III. How uncovering ideas of feminism in &quot;Hamlet&quot; has led me to better understand what Shakespeare thought of the role women played in society
IV.  Conclusion
|caption=A sample outline.}}

'''Outline example II'''
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
I.   Mixed marriages
: States this issue briefly, why I am interested in exploring this, and whether this issue exists in my culture
II.  Issues of mixed marriage within your culture
: a. Is it acceptable to get married to a person who is a different religion?
: b. Is it acceptable to get married to a person who is a different race?
: c. What are the advantages or disadvantages of mixed marriages?
III. Personal experiences 
: a. An example from my own life or my family.
: b. An example from the news.
 IV.  Conclusion

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tense translates to &quot;would...&quot; The easiest verb for English speakers to remember in this tense is &quot;I would win&quot;, which is &quot;Ganaría&quot;. If you pronounce it out loud, you will see why it is so easy to remember.&lt;br&gt;

The conditional tense is formed exactly the same as the [[Spanish/Future|future]] tense with the exception of the endings. The endings of the conditional tense are:&lt;br&gt;
-ía&lt;br&gt;
-ías&lt;br&gt;
-ía&lt;br&gt;
-íamos&lt;br&gt;
-ían&lt;br&gt;

This tense is frequently used in conjunction with the imperfect subjunctive, as demonstrated in the following contexts. Pay special attention to the position of the verbs in the conditional. &lt;br&gt;

''Si yo tuviera dineiro,'' '''compraría''' ''un coche.'' &lt;br&gt;
If I had money, '''I would buy''' a car.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Yo iría''' ''a la fiesta si tú me llevaras.''&lt;br&gt;
'''I would go''' to the party if you took me. &lt;br&gt;


The irregular verbs in the conditional tense are exactly the same as those in the future tense. See the page on the [[Spanish/Future|future tense]] for more information.

Un homine: E ecce Hubert La Salle. Ille es un
de mi collegas. Nos travalia in le mesme departimento
de Rodea, Fratres.

Un femina: Incantate, Hubert.

Guida: Ben. Io comprende melio. Ma io etiam nunc
ha difficultate con le pronunciation exacte del
nomines in le linguas europee que io non cognosce.
Que nos retorna nunc pro vider como va le cosas
con Catherina e su nove equipa.


SCENA 6: Le officios a Geneva: Quando le scena
comencia, Petro parla con Olivero Rossi, le contabile
del compania. Ille vole le adjuta de Rossi pro arrivar
al precios e expensas pro le plan de un projecto
que ille ha comenciate disveloppar. Rossi insiste
que le precios que ille producera essera applicabile
solmente pro le projecto que Petro ha in le mano
e que illos non potera applicar se a ulle altere
projecto pro ulle altere citate. Ma Petro jam sape
illo. Ille non ha besonio de omne le detalios.

Tunc Petro dicta duo litteras, un al senior Melville,
dicente que ille tosto va inviar le le information
que ille voleva. Le altere littera es a Alicia.
In iste littera Petro pretende esser le functionario
administrative. In illo ille dice a Alicia que
infelicemente il esseva impossibile trovar duo
appartamentos conjuncte e que solmente ille poteva
trovar pro le senior Minelli un multe parve
appartamento de un camera.

Facite isto, Petro vade a Catherina pro describer
su conversation con le senior Melville e le littera
que ille ha inviate. Obviemente ille spera que
Catherina approbara, ma su reaction non es exactemente
lo que ille attendeva.

Petro: Olivero, vos es le contabile, nonne?

Olivero: Si?

Petro: Vos controla nostre expensas.

Olivero: Si.

Petro: Io volerea producer un lista de precio e
de expensas. Vos poterea adjuvar me?

Olivero: Si. Io es hic pro facer cosas simile.

Petro: Vos ha habite relationes commercial con
le Arabia Saudite in Paris?

Olivero: Si.

Petro: Io ha studiate le numeros e facite un parve
description de un projecto hypothetic. Ecce lo.

Olivero: Ah, si. Illo es un projecto que include
omne le servicios pro un citate de un million de
habitantes.

Petro: Si. Assi es.

Olivero: Ma vos non pote usar exactemente iste
mesme projecto pro un altere citate.

Petro: Si. Io comprende illo. Io non ha besonio
de omne le detalios. Io ha besonio de un documento
pro marketing solmente.

Olivero: Multo ben, io pote dar a vos un serie
de numeros. Ma vos debe comprender que illos esserea
multo approximative.

Petro: Si, certemente. Io nunc debe dictar duo
litteras. Car senior Melville, em, e, el, ve, i,
duple el, e. Vos me ha demandate unes detalios
concernente nostre activitates, virgula, nostre
precios, virgula, e nostre servicios, puncto. Io
vos invia con iste littera unes informationes sur
lo que nos pote offerer a nostre clientes. Io es
confidente que vos e vostre collegas los trovara
interessante, puncto. Excusa me, per favor, pro
inviar iste littera a vos un pauco retardate, puncto.
Io ha debite dedicar multe effortio e tempore al
inauguration de nostre officios nove in Geneva, puncto.
Attendente vostre responsa, io vos invia mi optime
salutes. Isto es le fin del prime littera.

Ecce le secunde littera, adressate al senioretta
Alicia Martini, em, a, er, te, i, duple en, i, Marex

in le directorio. Car senioretta Martini. Nos

nos ha potite trovar solmente un parve appartamento
studio pro le senior Minelli. No. Scribe &quot;un multo
parve appartamento de un camera&quot;, puncto. Nos spera
que nos potera adjuvar vos in le futuro, puncto.
Sia assecurate de nostre optime salutes.

Iste littera debe portar le nomine del director
administrative in Geneva. Fin del secunde littera.
Multo ben, isto debe haber le effecto que io vole.
Catherina?

Catherina: Bon die, Petro. Entra.

Petro: Ascolta, io volerea parlar a vos sur alicuno
qui forsan pote nos adjuvar.

Catherina: Ah, bon.

Petro: Si. Io le cognosceva durante mi viage a
Geneva, e io crede que ille forsan pote dar travalio
a nos.

Catherina: Ah, si?

Petro: Si. Io le ha scribite un littera in la
qual io da diverse specificationes, includente precios,
pro monstrar le lo que nos pote facer. Ma io vole
consultar con vos sur illo, naturalmente, ante inviar
lo via.

Catherina: Si. Io ha vidite vostre littera, Petro.
Illo es dirigite a un senior Melville, io crede.

Petro: Si, exactemente. On non nunquam sape.
Ille pote offerer nos possibilitates interessante.
Il esserea un bon idea comenciar con un projecto
assatis importante. Io non le cognosce, ma ...

Catherina: Exactemente ubi faceva vos su cognoscentia?

Petro: In le avion. Ille pareva multo sympathic,
ma io repete que io non le cognosce. Ille diceva
que ille ha multe bon contactos al nivello
governamental, e ille parlava multo seriosemente
de illos.

Catherina: Il non me ha surprendite que vos le
trovava seriose. Il anque non me surprende que
ille dava a vos su adresse personal in vice de su
adresse professional.

Petro: Como? Vos le cognosce?

Catherina: Ille es le director de venditas de nostre
plus grande competitor.

Petro: Que?

Catherina: Si, exactemente. Ille es le director
de venditas a CCG. Io es convincite que nos es
melior, ma il non esserea un bon idea dar a ille
ideas troppo detaliate de nostre activitates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: The Geneva office of Marex Mundial: Catherina
has gotten together all the members of her team
to introduce them to one another. While they are
waiting for the last two people to arrive, Catherina
gives a letter to Petro. It's from Alice, who is
spending some vacation days at the Costa Brava.

She wants to tell Petro what she has done for their
transfer to Geneva. Petro becomes even more irritated
when he reads this. Catherina interrupts his grumbling
to introduce him to two new colleagues of his, who
have just arrived.

Catherina: Good morning, Petro.

Petro: Good morning.

Catherina: Listen, all the members of the team
have arrived. Olivero e Martijn have arrived, ...

Petro: Fine.

Catherina: ... and I want to introduce all of you
to one another.

Petro: An excellent idea.

Catherina: Oh, Peter, there is a letter for you.

Petro: A letter? Really?

Catherina: Yes, it's from Alicia.

Petro: Thanks. (reading Alice's letter) &quot;Just
a few lines from the Costa Brava, where I have spent
some very nice vacation days. The weather is really
great, and everybody's very nice.&quot; Excellent!
Perfect! Why don't you stay there?

Catherina: What did you say?

Petro: Nothing. I was only reading Alice's letter.
&quot;I hope that you have not had any big problems in
my absence and that there will not be too much work
for me when I return. In the meantime, I have
organized our transfer to Geneva, and I have sent
them a telex with instructions to reserve two
apartments for us.&quot; That woman is intolerable.
She wants to run my life as if she were my mother!

Cathreina: Good news?

Petro: What?

Catherina: Your letter, does it have any good new
for you?

Petro: No, but it's really not at all important.

Catherina: It's long, that letter of yours.

Petro: Yes, a bit long.

Catherina: Well?

Petro: Well what?

Catherina: Finish the letter.

Petro: Okay. (reading Alice's letter) &quot;We'll
be seeing each other very soon. Don't worry.
Everything will be just fine after I arrive in
Switzerland. Alicia.&quot; I don't know how, but I've
gotta find some quick way of getting rid of that
woman. She's gonna ruin me!

Catherina: Petro, Petro.

Petro: Yes?

Catherina: I want to present to you the others
on the team. Everyone's here right now. This is
Petro Minelli. He is our engineering specialist.
He can tell us if a project is feasible or not.

Petro: At least I hope so!

Catherina: And here's Olivero Rossi, our accountant.
He comes from the executive offices of Trans Infra.
And here's Martijn Ockrent. He is responsible for
our marketing affairs, though he comes from the
legal department of Trans Infra. For our marketing
strategy, it is important to have someone who knows
something about international law, and Martijn has
strong knowledge in both areas. And here's Liliana,
my assistant. She is in charge of all administrative
details. That's everything. I hope that all of
us will work harmoniously together and that our
project will be a great success. I don't only hope
this, but I am confident that everything will work
out quite well.


EXERCISE 5: Introductions.

Guide: Good. Io would like some practice with
the various ways of introducing oneself and of
introducing a person to another person.

A man: Good morning. My name is Bryson, Paul Bryson.
And over there, it seems there is someone from the
Amerex Society of Mexico. Let's go over ther to
talk with him. I believe that his name is Garcia,
Mario Garcia. He works in their marketing department.
Good morning. My name is Bryson, Paul Bryson.

A woman: How do you do. Are you Mario Garcia?

A man: Ah, yes. That's me. My pleasure. I am
from the company Rodea Brothers of Milan. I work
in their sales department.

A woman: I am Gertrude Johnson from the American
company Xerox, and I work in their offices in Berlin.

A man: I am very pleased to meet you. Allow me
to introduce to you my friend Robert Garnier from
Paris.

A woman: Hello, Roberto.

A man: And this is Hubert La Salle. He is one
of my colleagues. We work in the same department
of Rodea Brothers.

A woman: My pleasure, Hubert.

Guide: Good. I'm understanding a bit better.
But even now I have some trouble with the exact
pronunciation of the names in the European language
that I don't know. Let's return now to see how
things are going with Catherina and her new team.


SCENE 6: The Geneva offices: As the scene begins,
Petro is talking with Olviero Rossi, the accountant
of the company. He want's Rossi's help in arriving
at prices and expenses for the plan of a project
that he has started to develop. Rossi insists that
the prices that he will produce will be applicable
only for the project that Petro has on hand and
that they can't be applied to any other project
for any other city. But Petro already knows that.
He doesn't need all the details.

Then Petro dictates two letters, one to Mr. Melville,
saying that he soon will be sending him the information
he wanted. The other letter is to Alicia. In this
letter Petro pretends to be the administrative
officer. In it he tells Alicia that unfortunately
it was impossible to find two neighboring apartments
and that he was only able to find for Mr. Minelli
a very small one-room apartment.

After doing this Petro goes to Catherina to describe
his conversation with Mr. Melville and the letter
that he has sent him. Obviously he hopes that
Catherina will approve, but her reaction is not
exactly what he expected.

Petro: Olivero, you are the accountant, aren't
you?

Olivero: Yes.

Petro: You control our costs.

Olivero: Yes.

Petro: I would like to work up a list of prices
and costs. Can you help me?

Olivero: Yes. I'm here to do things like that.

Petro: Have you had commercial relations with Saudi
Arabia in Paris?

Olivero: Yes.

Petro: I've studied the numbers and come up with
a small description of a hypothetical project.
Here it is.

Olivero: Ah, yes. It's a project that includes
all services for a city of a million inhabitants.

Petro: Yes, that's right.

Olivero: But you can't use exactly this same project
for another city.

Petro: Yes, I know that. I don't need all the
details. I need a marketing document only.

Olivero: Very well, I can give you a series of
figures. But you must understand that they are
very rough.

Petro: Yes, of course. I now must dictate two
letters. Dear Mr. Melville, em, ee, el, vee, I,
double el, ee. You've asked me for some details
concerning our activities, comma, our prices, comma,
and our services, period. I am enclosing with this
letter some information about what we can offer
our customers. I am confident that you and your
colleagues will find it interesting, period. Please
excuse me for sending you this letter somewhat late,
period. I have had to dedicate a lot of time and
effort to the inauguration of our new offices in
Geneva, period. I look forward to your response
and would like to convey to you my best wishes.
This is the end of the first letter.

Here's the second one, addressed to Miss. Alicia
Martini, em, ay, ar, tea, I, en I, Marex Mundial,
Strasbourg. You can find the address in the
directory. Dear Ms. Martini. We have received
your telex dated May the thirteenth asking for two
apartments for Mr. Petro Minelli. period. We regret
to inform you that we have been able to find only
one small studio apartment for Mr. Minelli. No.
Write &quot;a very small one-room apartment,&quot; period.
We hope that we will be able to help you in the
future, period. Please be assured of our best wishes.

This letter should be under the name of the
administrative director in Geneva. End of the second
letter. Very well, this should have the effect
that I want. Catherina?

Catherina: Good morning, Petro. Come on in.

Petro: Listen, I would like to talk to you about
someone who can possibly help us.

Catherina: Oh, good.

Petro: Yes. I met him during my trip to Geneva,
and I believe that he can perhaps refer some work
to us.

Catherina: Oh yeah?

Petro: Yeah. I have written him a letter in which
I furnish various specifications, including prices,
to show him what we can do. But I want to consult
with you about it, naturally, before sending it
out.

Catherina: Yes. I have seen your letter, Petro.
It is directed to a Mr. Melville, I believe.

Petro: Yes, exactly. You never know. He could
offer us some interesting possibilities. It would
be a good idea to start with a rather important
project. I don't know him, but ...

Catherina: Exactly where did you meet him?

Petro: In the plane. He seemed very nice, but
I want to say once again that I don't know him.
He told me that he has many good contacts at the
government level, and he spoke very seriously about
them.

Catherina: It doesn't surprise me that you found
him to be serious. It also doesn't surprise me
that that he gave you his personal instead of his
professional address.

Petro: What do you mean? Do you know him?

Catherina: He is the sales manager of our biggest
competitor.

Petro: What?

Catherina: Yes, exactly. He is the sales manager
of CCG. I'm convinced that we are better, but it
would not be a good idea to give him any detailed
ideas of our activities.

SCENA 2: Le officios de Geneva: Petro interviewa
Francesca pro le position de secretaria. Ille comencia
per offerer un caffe a illa, e postea ille comencia
su questiones. Primo ille vole saper lo que illa
face in iste momento, como illa usa su linguas,
qual es su velocitate como stenographo, qual es
su velocitate in claviar, e si le claviation place
a illa. Finalmente, ille la demanda si a illa place
travaliar independentemente e proque illa vole un
position nove. Petro tunc dice gratias a illa e
la informa que illes la notificara al fin del
septimana.

Francesca: Vos permitte que io entra?

Petro. Si. Entra.

Francesca: Eh, io es Francesca Cardano.

Petro: Ah si. Entra.

Francesca: Io ha un appunctamento pro un interview
con le senior Petro Minelli a dece un horas trenta.
Illo es pro le position de secretaria.

Petro: Si, io comprende. Io es Petro Minelli.

Francesca: Ah, si. Io veniva un pauco ante le
tempore.

Petro: Un pauco, si. Ma illo non es importante.
Vos pote seder vos hic, si vos vole.

Francesca: Gratias.

Petro: Io ha vostre littera hic. Si, ecce lo.
Esque vos vole un tassa de caffe ante que nos comencia?

Francesca: Si, multe gratias.

Petro: Illo es vermente excellente, iste machina.
Io prefere facer mi proprie caffe io mesme. Io habeva
un caffetiera electric multo bon, ma io lo ha perdite.
Esque vos vole un pauco de lacte? De sucro?

Francesca: No, gratias. Io lo prende nigre.

Petro: Ecce lo.

Francesca: Gratias.

Petro: Tunc nos pote comenciar. Qual es vostre
situation in iste momento?

Francesca: Io es le secretaria de un director de
servicio de marketing.

Francesca: Si, exactemente.

Petro: Como usa vos omne iste linguas?

Francesca: Eh ben, le compania pro le qual io travalia

differente, e omne iste linguas es utile pro me.

Petro: Obviemente. Io comprende. Qual es vostre
nivello como stenographo e vostre velocitate in
claviar?

Francesca: In le claviation io pote facer octanta
parolas per minuta. Como stenographo, io face octanta,
ma io non lo usa multo. In le officio ubi io travalia
nunc on usa machinas a dictar.

Petro. A vos place facer le claviation?

Francesca: Io non lo face multo sovente proque
in le officio ubi io travalia nunc il ha un equipa
de claviatores.

Petro: E esque vos pote travaliar sol le plus parte
del tempore?

Francesca: Si. Io mesmo prefere travaliar assi
si io pote. In iste momento, io face le major parte
de mi travalio completemente sin supervision.

Petro: Io non vole dicer solmente travaliar de
un maniera independente. Io parla de esser le sol
persona presente in le officio.

Francesca: Io non sape. Io nunquam ha essayate
iste typo de travalio. Io sempre ha travaliate
in officios grande.

Petro: Ma pensa vos que vos poterea travaliar in
un officio parve como iste sin difficultate?

Francesca: Io non crede que un tal ambiente me
molesterea. Ma illo certemente esserea differente
pro me.

Petro: Que sape vos sur le transporto urban?

Francesca: Pardono?

Petro: Que sape vos del sector industrial? Le
sector de transporto.

Francesca: Pro dicer le veritate, io non sape multo
sur illo.

Petro: E que vos attraheva verso iste typo de

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: Catherina and Petro are talking about
their work. Petro says that he hasn't seen her
for a long time, Catherina answers that the cause
of this is that she has been very busy. Peter then
indicates that he is unhappy because he doesn't
have much to do.

Catherina asks him what is on his schedule for next
week. Peter says that Wednesday he is going to
take a three-day trip to Paris and that today he
is going to interview a possible
secretary/receptionist. Besides this, he doesn't
have anything to do. Peter finds this a bit
depressing.

Catherina tries to comfort him, saying that the
company really hasn't started its operations and
that before too long everyone in the Geneva office
will be very busy. In the meantime, she invites
Petro to go with her to see the computer center,
but Petro can't do this because Catherina is going
there during the hour of his interview. At the
end of the scene, Peter is bored, not knowing what
he can do to keep busy.

Catherina: Petro. Petro.

Petro: Good Morning, Catherina. How are you?

Catherina; Very well, thanks.

Petro: I haven't seen you for a long time.

Catherina: I've been very busy.

Petro: More than me?

Catherina: What are you doing?

Petro: As you can see, I'm reading the paper.
I'm drinking coffee.

Catherina: Oh, good. I came her to talk to you
about your program this week.

Petro: My program?

Catherina: What do you have on your schedule?

Petro: This week?

Catherina: Yes, this week.

Petro: Okay. I'm going to Paris on Wednesday for
three days.

Catherina: Oh yeah? For the liaison commission?

Petro: Yeah.

Catherina: And afterwards?

Petro: Nothing. Today I'm gonna interview a candidate
for the secretary position.

Catherina: And for the rest of the week?

Petro: I don't have anything planned. Nothing
on my schedule. It's a little depressing.

Catherina: How so?

Petro: I don't have anything to do here, no work.
Staying here waiting for the telephone to ring bores
me a lot.

Catherina: Listen. Our work in this office is
only beginning. A certain amount of time is needed
to launch this kind of project.

Petro: Yes. But I don't like staying here with
nothing to do.

Catherina: Before long you will have a lot to do.

Petro: I hope so.

Catherina: Say, if you want, you can come with
me to the computer center.

Petro: To do what?

Catherina: It's interesting.

Petro: When are you gonna go there?

Catherina: I've got to see them at noon, and I'm
gonna leave the office around eleven thirty.

Petro: No. I can't go with you. The candidate
for the interview will be here shortly after you've
gone.

Catherina: Okay, it isn't important. I'll see
you later.

Petro: Okay, see you later.

Catherina: See you.

Petro: And I've just finished reading the paper.
What am I gonna do next?


EXERCISE 1: Programs:

Guide: Catherina and Petro were talking about their
programs. I would like to hear once again some
other possible ways of describing their activities.

A woman: What is your progrm for this morning?

A man: My program?

A woman: Yes, what are you going to do this morning?

A man: I have three things to do. I must see the
boss at ten o'clock.

A woman: Oh yeah?

A man: And then I have to study the sales reports
between eleven o'clock and noon.

A woman: Okay. And then?

A man: Then I'm gonna eat something.

A woman: I see. I'd like you to give me this
information once again. What are you doing at ten
o'clock?

A man: I'm gonna see the boss.

A woman: He is very busy. Have you made an
appointment?

A man: Yes. I have an appointment for ten o'clock.

A woman: That'll take up how much time?

A man: An hour.

A woman: Then it will last an hour. And at eleven
o'clock? Where will you be at eleven o'clock?

A man: I will have returned to the office, if
everything goes well.

A woman: And then what are you gonna do?

A man: I'm gonna study the sales reports.

A woman: That will take up how much time?

A man: An hour, more or less.

A woman: And then are you gonna eat lunch?

A man: Yeah. Afterward that I'm gonna eat lunch.

Guide: It seems that there certainly are different
ways of expressing the future in Interlingua.

A man: I will be seeing Anna Tuesday; I'm seeing
Roselie Wednesday; I'm gonna see Valerie Thursday.
Mmmm.

Guide: It seems that all these constructions mean
the same thing.

A woman: Are you gonna go away?

A man: No, I'm gonna eat here.

A woman: I'm also gonna eat here.

A man: I'm gonna eat here today and tomorrow.

Guide: All these constructions are used.

A woman: Fine. In that case I'll see you here
later, around one.

A man: Fine. See you then.

Guide: I now understand better now. It seems that
Petro had to have an interview with a candidate
for the secretary's job. Let's se how it will go.


SCENE 2: The Geneva offices: Petro is interviewing
Francesca for the job of secretary. He starts by
offering her a coffee, and afterwards he starts
his questions. First he wants to know what she
is doing at this moment, how she uses her languages,
what her shorthand and typing speeds are, if she
likes to type. Finally, he asks her if she likes
to work independently and why she wants a new
position. Petro then says thanks to her and informs
her that they will notify her at the end of the
week.

Francesca: May I come in?

Petro: Yes, come in.

Francesca: Uh, I'm Francesca Cardano.

Petro: Ah, yes. Come in.

Francesca: I have an appointment for an interview
with Mr. Petro Minelli at eleven thirty. It is
for the secretary position.

Petro: Yes, I understand. I am Petro Minelli.

Francesca: Ah, yes. I came a little early.

Petro: A little, yes. But that isn't important.
You can sit down here, if you want.

Francesca: Thanks.

Petro: I have your letter here. Yes, here it is.
Would you like a cup of coffe before we start?

Francesca: Yes, thanks a lot.

Petro: It is really excellent, this machine. I
prefer to make my own coffee myself. I had a very
good electric coffee maker, but I have lost it.
Would you like a little milk? Some sugar?

Francesca: No, thanks. I like it black.

Petro: Here it is.

Francesca: Thanks.

Petro: Now we can start out. What is your situation
at this moment?

Francesca: I am the secretary of a marketing services
director.

Petro: In your letter you say that you speak English
well and German a little and also Spanish.

Francesca: Yes, exactly.

Petro: How do you use all these languages?

Francesca: All right. The company I work for at
this moment has clients of different nationalities,
and all these languages are useful for me.

Petro: Obviously. I understand. What is your
level as a stenogrpher and your typing speed?

Francesca: As a typist I can do eighty words a
minute. As a stenographer, I do eighty, but I don't
use it a lot. In the office where I work we now
use dictating machines.

Petro: Do you like to type?

Francesca: I don't do it very often because in
the office where I work now there is a typing pool.

Petro: And can you work alone most of the time?

Francesca: Yes. I myself prefer to work like that
if I can. At this moment I am doing most of my
work completely without supervision.

Petro: I don't mean only working independently.
I'm speaking of being the only person present in
the office.

Francesca: I don't know. I never have tried this
type of work. I always have worked in large offices.

Petro: But do you think that you could work in
a small office like this one without any trouble?

Francesca: I don't believe that such an environment
would bother me. But it would certainly be different
for me.

Petro: What do you know about urban transport?

Francesca: I beg your pardon?

Petro: What do you know about the industrial sector?
The transport sector?

Francesca: To tell the truth, I don't know a lot
about it.

Petro: And what attracted you to this type of
company? I would like to know the reason why you
want to leave the position that you now have for
this one.

Francesca: Well, my boss is leaving. And the next
person who's gonna take his position already has
his own secretary. They can move me to another
position, but at a lower level. It is because of
this that I have decided to look for another position.

Petro: I understand. Very well. Thanks a lot,
Miss.

Francesca: Thanks.

Petro: We want to arrive at a final decision rapidly,
and I believe that we will be able to give you an
answer toward the end of the week.

Francesca: Fine.

Petro: Okay. We will contact you when we have
made our decision.

Francesca: Thanks a lot. See you later.

Petro: See you later.

EXERCISE 2: Interviews:

Guide: It seems to me that this young lady was
good, don't you agree? Before continuing with our
story, I would like to hear once again the kind
of questions that are made during an interview.

First man: Ask him his name.

A woman: What is your name.

Second man: Eric Jensen

First man: And his age.

A woman: What is your age?

Second man: I am thirty years old.

First man: And his nationality.

A woman: Where are you from? What is your
nationality?

Second man: I am Danish, from Copenhagen.

First man: Ask him what his qualifications are.

A woman: What are your qualifications. What diplomas
or certificates do you have?

Second man: I have a certificate of commercial
studies.

First man: Ask him how much time he has studied.

A woman: How long have you studied?

Second man: Two years.

First man: Ask him where he has studied.

A woman: And where have you done your studies?

Second man: In a technological institute.

A woman: Your qualifications then are a certificate
of commercial studies, two years in a technological
institute.

First man: Ask him what his experience is.

A woman: What do you have as experience? For how
long have you worked?

Second man: I have three years of business experience.

First man: Ask him what is the work he is now doing.

A woman: What kind of work are you doing now?

Second man: At this moment, I don't have any work.
I'm unemployed.

First man: Ask him what his previous position was.

A woman: Fine. What kind of work did you do in
your last position?

Second man: I worked for an insurance company.
I was an office worker.

First man: Ask him how long he did this work.

A woman: How long did you do this work?

Second man: Three years.

First man: Ask him if he speaks other languages.

A woman: Do you speak other languages?

Second man: The English I learned in school and
German.

A woman: Fine, thank you. Soon I will let you
know of our decision.

Guide: It is now lunch time. Catherina and Petro
are now eating in a cafe in the area near their
office.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: In this scene Petro and Catherina are
eating in a cafe near their office. Petro thinks
that Catherine seems very young to have a position
in the company with so many responsibilities, and
he asks her some rather indiscreet questions: what
her age is and whether she ever wanted to get married.

Catherina answers very candidly and afterwards speaks
to Petro about his interview with the Francesca
Cardano, the candidate for the secretary's job.
Petro thinks that she would be an ideal secretary.
Catherina only wants to be assured that she can
start her work before too long because they need
someone immediately as they prepare to open their
offices in Geneva.

Petro: I find this place very nice for having lunch.

Catherina: Yeah. I do too. And the prices aren't
all that high.

Petro: Catherina?

Catherina: Yes?

Petro: You seem to rather young to be responsible
for a project like this one.

Catherina: You think so?

Petro: Yes. I hope that this doesn't irritate
you.

Catherina: No, not at all.

Petro: There are not many women in your profession.

Catherina: Yes, you're right. There are very few.

Petro: And it surprises me to find a woman of your
qualifications at your age.

Catherina: You find it exceptional?

Petro: Yes. It is completely exceptional, very
rare.

Catherina: Perhaps I have had a lot of luck.

Petro: And, as I said, you seem quite young for
it. Can I ask you your age?

Catherina: Petro, you know that you should never
ask women their age.

Petro: But you are not a woman. You are a colleague.

Catherina: Ah, thanks a lot.

Petro: I did not want to give you that kind of
bad impression.

Catherina: I know. In any event, it's not a secret.
I'm thirty-three years old.

Petro: Thirty-three years old. And you never wanted
to get married?

Catherina: To tell the truth, I was married once,
for three years.

Petro: In Belgium?

Catherina: Yes.

Petro: And what happened?

Catherina: There were many differences between
us that I gradually discovered during the first
year of our marriage.

Petro: Your husband also worked in transportation?

Catherina: No, he was a professor of biology.

Petro: I understand. And how were the discussions
at the computer center this morning?

Catherina: Everything went well. I believe that
we will have what we want. And the interview that
you had this morning, how was it?

Petro: Oh, I believe that she is a good candidate.

Catherina: Oh, good. What is her name?

Petro: Francesca. I have forgotten her last name,
but I have this in the notes about my interview
with her in the office.

Catherina: So you think she could do the work?

Petro: Yes, I think so. She is nice and has a
good knowledge of languages: English, German,
Spanish. Her experience is rather good. But she
has worked only in big companies, and this position
would be a little different for her. At times she
will have to manage things in the office all by
herself. But she is better than all the others.
Do you want to talk with her before we make a final
decision?

Catherina: No, no. I have confidence in you.

Petro: Fine. As far as I am concerned, I think
she is the person we should hire.

Catherina: Fine. And when will she be able to
start?

Petro: I told her that we would contact her this
week.

Catherina: Fine. I think we should contact her
soon. We want to activate the office as soon as
possible.

Petro: I know, I know.

EXERCISE 3: Listening and understanding.

Guide: Let's stay in the cafe were Petro and Catherina
are eating and listen to the conversation to others
who are eating there. What are they talking about?

First woman: Probably you've already tried it out.

Second woman: I don't think so. I can't remember
it at all.

First woman: Come on. Try it out.

Second woman: What is it?

First woman: Vodka and orange juice with sugar.
Different ingredients.

Second woman: Is it very strong?

First woman: No, no. But naturally, if you drink
six or seven, ...

Second woman: Oh, I would never do that.

First woman: I want to have a coctail party, but
a real cocktail party, with all sorts of different
cocktails.

Second woman: Yes. That would be an excellent
idea--based on the nineteen twenties. You could
have some music from that time, especially jazz.
And everyone would wear clothing from those years.

First woman: Fine: Do you want to have a vodka
with orange juice just to try it out?

Second woman: I don't know.

First woman: Come on. Try it out. It won't kill
you.

Second woman: Okay, why not? I'm not working this
afternoon.

First woman: I'm gonna try to call the waiter.

Guide: Okay. I now understand. So Catherina and
Petro have now returned to their offices. Let's
see what is happening between them.


SCENA 4: Petro e Catherina talk about their new
secretary. Petro then shows Catherina an ad for
an engineering job in Mexico. He wants to apply
for the position because he doesn't have enough
to do in Geneva, and he's getting bored. He asks
Catherina if she would give him a reference if he
contacted the company offering this position, and
she says that she would be happy to do so.

Petro: As soon as possible. Monday? That would
be perfect. Yes, yes. I understand. Very good.
So we'll see you next Monday. Very good. See you
then.

Catherina: Peter, I'd like to ...

Petro We have a secretary.

Catherina: Oh, very good.

Petro: I was just now talking to her on the phone,
you know, to Francesca Cardano.

Catherina: Fine. When can she start out?

Petro: Next Monday.

Catherina: Very good.

Petro: Yes. I think that she will work out very
well. One other thing: I myself won't be here
in the office Monday. Will you be able to orient
her?

Catherina: Yes, I can do that. I'll introduce
her to all the others, and I'll explain to her a
little about the kind of work we do here.

Petro: Very good. Thanks.

Catherina: Fine. In the meantime, look at this.
I just got it.

Petro: What is it?

Catherina: Thursday, Paris, Hotel d'Albion.

Petro: Ah, yes. Infomat.

Catherina: Yes. It is their new system of integrated
control.

Petro: It could be interesting.

Catherina: It's a bit technical. It's more in
your area of expertise than in mine.

Petro: A completely integrated system of control.
It has some very interesting possibilities.

Catherina: It is a presentation. A presentation
and a conference.

Petro: Four hours, Thursday, in the afternoon.
It's too late for lunch but not too late for dinner.
They simply want to give us some tea and biscuits.
That is not enough. But Informat makes very good
products. And if this is a new project, ...

Catherina: Will you be in Paris then?

Petro: Yes. I will be there starting Wednesday.

Catherina: Fine. Do you want me to notify them
that you are gonna go there?

Petro: Yes, please.

Catherina: Gerardo will also be there, Gerardo
Florette. He always goes to all those conferences.
I'm gonna ask him to show you everything that's
important at that Informat conference.

Petro: Thanks. (On the phone) Hello? I would
like to reserve a seat on a flight to Paris Wednesday
afternoon. Yes, exactly. Yes, that's fine. I
want to return Thursday afternoon. My name is Minelli:
em, I, en, ee, double el, I. Em as in Mama. Fine.
And I would also like to reserve a hotel room for
the time I will be there. Can I do this through
your agent?


EXERCISE 4 Spelling:

Guide: When the course started out, I learned with
you to say the letters in Interlingua, and I would
like to practice them a little at this point. Let's
listen to the spelling of some names:

A man: Francesco:

A woman: Ef, are, ay, en, see, ee, es, see, oh.

A man: Melville:

A woman: Em, ee, el, vee, I, double el, ee.

A man: Switzerland:

A woman: Es, double you, I, tea, zee, ee, are,
el, ay, en, dee.

A man: Paris:

A woman: Pea, ay, are, I, es.

A man: London:

A woman: El, oh, en, dee, oh, en.

A man: Geneva:

A woman: Jee, ee, en, ee, vee, ay.

Guide: Fine. It now is Wednesday afternoon. Petro
is in Paris. He is arriving at his hotel.

SCENA 6: Paris, un centro de conferentias: Petro
es nunc in le sala de conferentias e face le prime
cognoscentia de Gerardo Florette. Gerardo demanda
a Petro si su viage a Paris in avion esseva
confortabile e si a ille place su hotel. Petro
dice que su avion arrivava tarde e que ille habeva
unes difficultates con le empleato del hotel ante
que ille recipeva le clave a su camera.

Gerardo anque demanda a Petro como sta Catherina
e postea dice a Petro que le conferentia non ha
ulle nove productos o systemas a offerer a su
participantes. Petro tunc vide le senior Melville,
le empleato de un compania competitor con le sue,
e il pare que il va haber un lucta verbal inter
illes.

Un femina: Bon die.

Petro: Bon die.

Le femina: Vos es ...

Petro: Petro Minelli, de Marex Mundial.

Le femina: Ah, si, senior Minelli. Ecce vostre
carta de identification. Ah, il ha un senior qui

Petro: Ah, bon.

Le femina: Ille es illac, apud le fenestra.

Petro: Gratias. Excusa me.

Gerardo: Petro Minelli?

Petro: Si, es io. E vos debe esser Gerardo Florette.

Gerardo: Exactemente. Esque vos ha habite un viage
bon a Paris desde Geneva?

Petro: Le avion in le qual io volava arrivava
retardate.

Gerardo: A causa del tempore mal?

Petro: Si. E io anque habeva unes difficultates
con le empleato del hotel a causa de haber arrivate
retardate.

Gerardo: Vermente?

Petro: Ma il non esseva multo grave. Io poteva
arreglar omne sin difficultate.

Gerardo: Io detesta le hotels. Como es le cosas
a Geneva? E como es Catherina?

Petro: Catherina sta ben. Il non ha ullo extraordinari
in Geneva. Nos solmente comencia nostre operationes,
e nos non ha multe travalio.

Gerardo: Ah, non vos plange.

Petro: Et hic? Como es le presentation?

Gerardo: Assatis ben. Nullo special. Sempre le
vetule cosas.

Petro: Que? Ma illes sempre parla de systemas
de controlo completemente integrate.

Gerardo: Si, ma illo es sempre le mesme cosa.

Petro: Io credeva que iste vice illes habeva alique
nove a monstrar nos.

Gerardo: Deo mie, no.

Petro: Tunc pro que es vos hic?

Gerardo: Il es melior que esser sempre in le officio.

Petro: Ma qual perdita de tempore!

Gerardo: Possibilemente. Ma il es plus agradabile
que prender the in un hotel de luxo.

Petro: Eh, qui es ille, illac?

Gerardo: De qui parla vos?

Petro: Le homine in ille habito brun?

Gerardo: Il me pare que io le cognosce.

Petro: Io mesme, io le cognosceva durante un viage

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: Paris, at Peter's hotel: In this scene
Peter has some problems with the hotel desk clerk,
who is less than cooperative in verifying his
reservation and in making him feel welcome. Finally,
after filling out a form, Peter has to pay cash
in advance for his room.

Petro: Good evening.

The clerk: Yes, sir?

Petro: I'd like a room.

The clerk: Yes, sir?

Petro: I have reserved a room at this hotel ...

The clerk: Oh, yes?

Petro: ... in the name of Minell, Petro Minelli.

The clerk: Hmm.

Petro: My plane came in late because of the bad
weather.

The clerk: A single or a double?

Petro: A single.

The clerk: With a bath?

Petro: Shower.

The clerk: Fill out this form, please, name
nationality, all that. Is this for a single night
only?

Petro: No, three nights.

The clerk: Three nights?

Petro: I've made a reservation. From Geneva.
I was in Geneva and I reserved a room with one bed
for three nights from this evening. But my plane
arrived late because of the bad weather. My name
is Minelli, em, I, en, ee, double el, i. My company
is Marex Mundial. You should have all this information
written in your office. We sent a telex to confirm.

The clerk: That will be three hundred euros, please.

Petro: Three hundred euros?

The clerk: In advance.

Petro: Listen, I have reserved this room. You
have a confirmation. A telex. Can you look for
it in your office?

The clerk: The office is closed.

Petro: Is there someone responsible for customer
service working this evening?

The clerk: After midnight, you have to pay in advance.

Petro: But this is completely incomprehensible!

The clerk: Three hundred euros, please.

Petro: Okay, fine.

The clerk: Room forty-nine.


EXERCISE 5: Reserving a hotel room.

Guide: Fine. At least Petro has a room to sleep
in. I would like to study the words used to reserve
a hotel room.

A man: I would like to reserve a room, please.

A woman: The the customer is going to say for how
long he will be using the room.

A man: I would like a room for three nights, please.

A woman: He also is going to say if he needs a
room with one or two beds ...

A man: A room with one bed, please.

A woman: ... and if he wants a room with a bath
or a shower.

A man: A room with a bed and a bath, please.

A woman: He's now going to say all that in one
sequence.

A man: I would like a room with a bed and bath
for three nights, please.

A woman: He also wants to know the price.

A man: What is the price?

A woman: Let's say that it is one hundred ninety
euros per night. He now wants to know what he will
buy with this one hundred ninety euros.

A man: Does that include the room and breakfast
or only the room?

A woman: The room and breakfast both.

A man: And what is the breakfast price?

A woman: Twenty euros, but it is included in the
room price.

A man: Fine. I'll take the room.

A woman: Here's the key. The number of the room
is seventy-two.

A man: Where is room seventy-two?

A woman: On the seventh floor.

A man: Can you wake me up at seven hours tomorrow
morning?

A woman: With great pleasure.

A man: Thank you. Good night.

A woman: Good night.

Guide: Fine. For him, finding a room was less
difficult than for Petro. And I hope he has slept
well.


SCENE 6: Paris, a conference center: Petro is
now in the conference center and is getting to know
Gerardo Florette. Gerardo asks Petro if his plane
trip to Paris was comfortable and if he likes his
hotel. Petro says that his plane arrived late and
that he had some trouble with the desk clerk at
the hotel before he got the key to his room.

Gerardo also asks Petro how Catherina is and afterwards
tells Petro that the conference doesn't have any
new products or systems to offer its participants.
Petro then sees Mr. Melville, the employee of a
competitor company, and it seems there is going
to be a verbal fight beween them.

A woman: Good morning.

Petro: Good morning.

The woman: You are ...

Petro: Petro Minelli, of Marex Mundial.

The woman: Ah, yes, Mr. Minelli. Here's you
identification card. Ah, there's a man waiting
for you.

Petro: Ah, good.

The woman: He's over there, next to the window.

Petro: Thank you. Excuse me.

Gerardo: Petro Minelli?

Petro: Yes, that's me. You must be Gerardo Florette.

Gerardo: Exactly. Has your trip from Geneva to
Paris been a good one?

Petro: The plane I took arrived late.

Gerardo: Because of the bad weather?

Petro: Yes. And I also had some difficulties with
the desk clerk at the hotel because I arrived late.

Gerardo: Really?

Petro: But it wasn't too bad. I was able to take
care of everything without any trouble.

Gerardo: I hate hotels. How are things at Geneva?
And how is Catherina?

Petro: Catherina is fine. There is nothing out
of the ordinary in Geneva. We are only beginning
our operations, and we don't have much work.

Gerardo: Ah, don't complain.

Petro: And here? How is the presentation?

Gerardo: Oh, okay. Nothing special. Always the
same old things.

Petro: What? But they are always talking about
completely integrated control systems.

Gerardo: Yeah, but it's always the same thing.

Petro: I thought that this time they would have
something new to show us.

Gerardo: Good God, no.

Petro: Then why are you here?

Gerardo: It's better than always being in the office.

Petro: But what a waste of time!

Gerardo: Possibly. But it more agreeable than
drinking tea in a de luxe hotel.

Petro: Uh, who is that there?

Gerardo: Who are you talking about?

Petro: That guy in that brown suit?

Gerardo: I think I know him.

Petro: Me too, I met him in on plane trip recently.

Gerardo: Oh yeah?

Petro: I want to speak to him. So, Mr. Melville,
I have some words to say to you.

Guide: I am curious to know what Petro is going
to say to Mr. Melville. To discover this, let's
listen to the next scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An axial turbine operates in the reverse of an axial compressor. A set of static guide vanes or nozzle vanes accelerates and adds swirl to the fluid and directs it to the next row of turbine blades mounted on a turbine rotor. 

In an Impulse turbine the pressure drop happens entirely in the nozzle vanes. In a reaction turbine the pressure drop is split between the nozzle vanes and the turbine rotor. The proportion of pressure drop in the turbine rotor is called the degree of reaction.

As you probably know, nouns are words which stand for things; they refer to a specific object or concept. In this section we'll explore the different things that languages can do with their nouns.

== Distinctions ==

The first thing that you need to decide about your conlang's nouns is what categories they are marked for. Some of the grammatical categories they can be marked for include:

*Case &amp;mdash; How the thing relates to the rest of the sentence.
*Number &amp;mdash; How many things you're referring to.
*Definiteness &amp;mdash; Whether you're referring to a specific thing or some generic instance of thing.
*Gender &amp;mdash; What arbitrary category the thing fits into (e.g. masculine or feminine).

Not all languages mark all of these categories, and some that mark them may mark them only on articles or adjectives instead of directly on nouns.  For instance, the conlang [http://www.pobox.com/~jimhenry/caligo/toa_tc.htm Thauliralau] marks number, gender and definiteness with articles, leaving the nouns entirely uninflected.  [[Quenya]] marks its nouns for case and number directly on the noun by adding certain endings to them.  [http://www.graywizard.net/Conlinguistics/amman_iar/ai_determiners.htm Amman-Iar] marks its nouns for definiteness, among other categories. [[Wikipedia:Ithkuil language|Ithkuil]] marks its words (which don't easily divide into &quot;nouns&quot; and &quot;verbs&quot;) for many other categories as well.

=== Case ===

''Case'' inflection is perhaps the most important inflection that a noun has, and all conlangs will have to deal with it to some extent.  Cases are used to show the role a noun plays in a sentence.  It is used extensively in languages like Greek, Latin, Finnish, and Hungarian.

Back in the [[Conlang/Beginner/Grammar|Beginners Grammar section]] we learned about the terms '''subject''', '''verb''', and '''object'''. To refresh your memory; the subject shows who or what in the sentence is performing the action and the object shows who or what is being acted upon. In the sentence &quot;the dog bit the man&quot;, ''dog'' is the subject and ''man'' is the object.

In English, we tell what noun is the subject and what noun is the object by looking at the order of the words in the sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). But not all languages do it that way. Many languages use cases to show that distinction. They put the subject of the sentence into what is called the [[Wikipedia:Nominative case|Nominative case]] and the object of the sentence into the [[Wikipedia:Accusative case|Accusative case]]. This means an affix (usually a suffix) is put onto a word, for example in Latin, ''can'''is''''' (dog) in the nominative form, and ''can'''em''''' is its accusative form with its ''–em'' suffix, and the same for ''vir'', with its accusative form being ''vir'''um'''''.  So the sentence &quot;the dog bit the man&quot; in Latin is not &quot;''canis momordit vir''&quot; but &quot;''canis momordit vir'''um'''''&quot;.

Most of the time, English doesn't do anything like this; the words ''man'' and ''dog'' look exactly the same in both &quot;the dog bit the man&quot; and &quot;the man bit the dog&quot;. However English does use cases when it comes to its [[Wikipedia:Pronoun|pronouns]]; the pronouns change their form depending on whether they are nominative or accusative. For example, the pronoun &quot;he&quot; is nominative, but it's accusative form is &quot;him&quot;. Notice the differences between &quot;He bit the dog&quot; and &quot;The dog bit him&quot;.

There's another case that works in a similar way. Up until now, we've been calling words like ''man'' in &quot;the dog bit the man&quot; the '''object''' of the sentence, but actually, it's the '''direct object'''. Some sentences also have a second object called the '''indirect object'''.

An example of the indirect object would be the word ''girl'' in &quot;the boy gave the girl a gift&quot;. An indirect object is an object that is involved in the action of the verb but isn't directly acted upon; the ''boy'' isn't doing anything to the ''girl'', he's doing something to the ''gift'' (i.e. giving it), but the girl is receiving the gift so she must nonetheless be involved in the action.

Like the other two cases, English mostly uses the order of the words to tell which is the direct object and which is the indirect object; the indirect usually comes before the direct. As you may have guessed, other languages might use a case to show the indirect object. When they do, this case is usually called the [[Wikipedia:Dative case|Dative case]].

One case which English ''does'' have is the [[Wikipedia:Genitive case|Genitive case]]. This case is mostly used to show possession &amp;mdash; that somebody owns something. The English genitive case is what we're using when we add Apostrophe-S to the end of a noun; &quot;the king's horses&quot; &quot;Tom's ball&quot;.

Cases can also be used to express some of the same sorts of things that English uses prepositions for. In English, when we want to talk about the location of something we use a preposition such as '''in''', but in Finnish, they use the [[Wikipedia:Inessive case|Inessive case]] ending -ssa; ''talo'' &quot;house&quot; becomes ''talossa'' &quot;in [a] house&quot;.

There are a great variety of cases that work like this so I'll just list some of the more common ones and their nearest English prepositions as a starting point for your own research.

*[[Wikipedia:Locative case|Locative case]] &amp;mdash; in, at
*[[Wikipedia:Instrumental case|Instrumental case]] &amp;mdash; using, with, by
*[[Wikipedia:Ablative case|Ablative case]] &amp;mdash; (Varies greatly from language to language) from
*[[Wikipedia:Lative case|Lative case]] &amp;mdash; to, towards, into

When you're making your conlang, at the very least you'll need to think about how you're going to show which noun is the subject and which is the object; be it case, or word-order, or something else entirely. Once you have that, you can go on to work out whether you want your language to have some or all of these cases that we've just explored. Keep in mind that it's common for a language to have multiple ways to say the same thing. For example, in English we can use the genitive case to show possession, but we can also use the preposition '''of'''; &quot;the king's horses&quot; or &quot;the horses of the king&quot;.

=== Number ===

''Number'' need not be just '''singular''' and '''plural''' like it is in English.  Some natural languages have '''dual''' (two things, or pairs of things), '''trial''' (three things), and '''paucal''' (a few things) number inflection as well.

A few conlangs have other interesting numbers; for instance, an &quot;all&quot; number that refers to the whole set of ''noun'' everywhere, or all of them within a given context; or a ''zero'' number inflection that would occur where other languages would use singular or plural noun preceded or followed by a word meaning &quot;none&quot;. Quenya &amp;mdash; in addition to a singular, plural, and dual &amp;mdash; has a '''partitive plural''' which is used to represent fractions of the whole.

Not all the nouns in your language need to follow the same number scheme; you can have a particular group of nouns that inflect for a paucal number while the rest don't, or whatever you want.

An important concept is that of the '''mass noun'''. There are quite a few languages that have mass nouns, but how they work differs slightly for each one. Usually it has to do with a word presenting the object it's referring to as an unbounded mass of stuff, as opposed to discrete units. A regular, non-mass noun is called a '''count noun'''.

There ''is'' a tendency for nouns referring to powders, liquids, and substances to be mass nouns, but whether the word for an object in a particular language is a mass noun is not wholly dependent on the nature of the object itself. For example, in English the word &quot;furniture&quot; is a mass noun, but the extremely similar word &quot;appliance&quot; (as in &quot;household appliance&quot;) is not. There is no reason why it couldn't be one in your conlang.

Also, what is a mass noun in one language can be a count noun in another, for example one cannot say &quot;three informations&quot;, but you can say that in French, &quot;trois informations&quot; means &quot;three pieces of information&quot;.  Bear this in mind when creating your conlang.

=== Definiteness ===
&lt;!-- TODO: find a good non-English example for this section --&gt;

Definiteness is a tricky subject to grasp. There are two major types of definiteness; '''definite''' and '''indefinite'''. Definite nouns are nouns that refer to specific entities such as something that you've already talked about. Indefinite nouns refer to a class of entities in general or are used to introduce a new and previously unknown entity into the conversation.

Definite nouns are shown in English with the function word ''the'' or other determiners such as ''one'' or ''their''. Indefinite nouns are shown either by using one of ''a'', ''an'', or ''some'', or by using no qualifying word at all. For example: &quot;the cat&quot;, &quot;the cats&quot;, and &quot;my cats&quot; are all definite, whereas &quot;a cat&quot;, &quot;cats&quot;, and &quot;some cats&quot; are all indefinite. Words like these that mark definiteness are common enough that they have their own term; '''articles'''.

You don't have to use articles in your conlang the same way English does. In German, the articles don't just show definiteness, they also tell you what case the noun is. In fact, you don't have to have articles at all; many languages show definiteness with various affixes or clitics or don't show it explicitly at all.

We'll explore articles more thoroughly in the section on adjectives.

=== Gender ===

If you've ever had lessons on another European language other than English then you'll probably think that gender is whether something is ''masculine'' or ''feminine'' (and possibly others such as ''neuter'' or ''common''). To some extent, you're correct. Gender in French or Spanish or German or any other Indo-European language ''is'' about sorting nouns into sexually distinguished categories. 

However, many natural languages don't use sex as the basis of their gender system and instead divide their nouns into animate from inanimate, for instance, and some have larger numbers of genders. It is for this reason that gender is often referred to as '''noun class''' in linguistic circles. You can be as creative as you want when it comes to your noun classes. To give you a taste; the Dyirbal language has a noun class that contains words for women, animals, water, fire, and violence, and another noun class that contains only words for edible plants.

If you want your conlang to be naturalistic then it's generally a good idea to have some words that are in noun classes that don't match their meaning (e.g. Greek and Latin had words for &quot;child&quot; in the neuter gender as well as many words for inanimate things in the masculine and feminine genders).

It is often wondered by non-linguists what gender is actually ''for''; its uses aren't immediately obvious. Like case, it can be used to &quot;tie&quot; the parts of the sentence together; a language which has gender can link adjectives and nouns (and sometimes even verbs!) together without necessarily putting them in a strict order. It can also be used to discriminate between two or more &quot;third person&quot; arguments in a sentence or text. Consider the English text:

:''Bill and Jane went to '''her''' house. '''She''' showed '''him''' '''her''' new bike. '''He''' told '''her''' that '''he''' liked '''it'''.''

This sentence is understandable because ''Bill'', ''Jane'', and the ''bike'' all have different gendered pronouns that we can use to distinguish them. Bill has he/him/his, Jane has she/her/her, and the bike has it/it/its.

If, instead, we were to change ''Bill'' into ''Betty'' and change the ''bike'' into a female ''doll'' then we can plausibly refer to all three of the nouns using just the feminine pronouns. The sentence then becomes much harder to understand:

:''Betty and Jane went to her house. She showed her her new doll. She told her that she liked her.''

It isn't clear whose house or doll it is, nor who is doing the showing or liking, nor who (or what) is being shown something or liked.

== Noun Phrases ==

Once you know what distinctions your nouns can make, you'll want to start thinking about '''noun phrases'''. A noun phrase is a bunch of words collected together that act like a basic noun. Usually noun phrases will have at least one head noun.

Let's try an example; examine the sentence &quot;the ball broke the window&quot;. This sentence has two nouns in it; &quot;ball&quot; and &quot;window&quot;. It also has two noun phrases in it; &quot;the ball&quot; and &quot;the window&quot;. Notice how both noun phrases have a noun combined with other words. These other words are modifiers that narrow down the meaning of the noun they're with. In this particular case you've only got one modifier, the word &quot;the&quot; which is telling you that the noun is definite.

A key feature of a noun phrase is that it is interchangeable, syntactically speaking, with other noun phrases. For example we might decide to swap the phrase &quot;the ball&quot; with the phrase &quot;a rock&quot;; &quot;''the ball'' broke the window&quot; becomes &quot;''a rock'' broke the window&quot;. These substitutions don't actually have to make sense; &quot;''a brief feeling of compassion'' broke the window&quot;. What's important here is that the substitution ''feels right''; the sentence is grammatical and doesn't make you feel linguistically ''uncomfortable''. Contrast this with a sentence like &quot;'ate an apple quickly' broke the window&quot;, which is more definitively wrong (&quot;ate an apple quickly&quot; is not a noun phrase).

These are only simple noun phrases, but languages can and do make more complicated ones; &quot;the red ball&quot;, &quot;my left foot&quot;, &quot;you and me&quot;, &quot;the film I saw last night&quot;, and even &quot;three brown rabbits from out of that field with the trees and broken fence around it&quot;.

We'll discuss how your conlang can go about making noun phrases like these later on, but for now, you just need to understand what a noun phrase is.

''TODO: perhaps put some emphasis on identifying the head of the phrase.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">A rotor and stator combination is called a stage. 

The number of stages depends on the velocity of the rotor and the pressure drop required. Gas nozzles can impart high supersonic velocities to the fluid if the pressure is available. The proportion of this energy the rotor can extract depends on its velocity. 

Increasing the number of stages allows us to reduce the rotor velocity for a given power extracted from the fluid flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Darwin lists the similarities between man and lower animals which argue against special creation. He also dismisses the idea expressed by some naturalists of his day that the natural world be divided into human, animal, and plant kingdoms. He criticizes the classification systems that use only one or two points of comparison, even if brains are compared. 

Darwin then briefly explains the classes and orders of vertebrates in general and gives examples of similarities between dinosaurs and birds, reptiles and mammals, and animal embryos across the spectrum.
He reiterates that there are animals still living like the echidna that link classes of animals together. He mentions new information on the lancelet embryo which helped scientists to classify it as a worm and points to that class, ascidians, as the likely group where the vertebrates began. 

Finally Darwin also mentions the rudimentary female sex organs found in males which point to a hemaphroditic ancestor, probably belonging to a class lower than mammals. Again in a footnote Darwin gives credit for this idea to another scientist, a comparative anatomist. He also lists four scientists who have written on hermaphroditism in lower animals. As further evidence Darwin discusses the development of the nipple from marsupials and retained by both sexes in the higher mammals. He further points to male animals that take care of the eggs and young and cases of male lactation.

In the final paragraph, once again Darwin traces the evolution of vertebrates from ancient marine worms to man. He adds that humans should not be ashamed of their humble origins because even the lowest animals are marvelous in their structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ramjet==
{{wikipedia|Ramjet}}

A ramjet uses the open [[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Brayton cycle|Brayton cycle]]. No rotating machinery is used and compression is achieved by the intake and diffuser. As such they require speed to compress air enough that good efficiency can be achieved. Ramjets are inefficient at [[wikipedia:subsonic|subsonic]] speeds and their efficiency improves at supersonic speeds. 

Fuel is injected into the compressed air and burnt using flameholders to stabilize the turbulent flame as in afterburners.

At [[wikipedia:hypersonic|hypersonic]] speeds the compression and dissociation processes make full diffusion unattractive and supersonic combustion is being researched. A [[wikipedia:Scramjet|Scramjet]] slows the air down to low supersonic speeds and then burn high flame velocity fuels such as hydrogen or methane to try to get net thrust.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:ramjet-schematic-kk-20050816.png||||640px]]
&lt;/center&gt;

==Scramjet==

{{wikipedia|scramjet}}

As the velocity increases the total temperature of the gas stream rises above the dissociation temperature of the combustion products. This prevents efficient burning if the gas stream is diffused to subsonic speeds. To solve this, fuels with high propagation velocities such as hydrogen are used while diffusing the intake air to supersonic speeds without having a large rise in temperature of the gas stream. The challenges become on of obtaining stable flames fronts and a net thrust.

==Turbojet==

A turbojet adds a rotating compressor powered by a turbine. This allows increased compression beyond the stagnation pressure of the intake and improves the efficiency over a ramjet at lower speeds. The hot air after it leaves the turbine is accelerated by the nozzle and ejected. An afterburner can be used to augment the thrust.

[[Image:turbojetpartssm.jpg]]

==Turbofan==

A shrouded fan allows a larger mass of air to be moved by a shrouded fan whose flow bypasses the core. The relative size of the fan compared to the core is identified by the [[Jet Propulsion/Bypass ratio|bypass ratio]]. 

The figure below shows the typical layout of a two shaft high bypass turbofan.


[[Image:tfan-schematic-kk-20050816.png]]

The ratio of turbofan bypass mass flow to the engine core mass flow in a turbofan engine.

As the name suggests, this is the ratio of the air which bypasses the engine core and flows round the outside of the engine and exits via the nozzle. In a modern, high bypass ratio engine, bypass ratios can be as high as 85%. Increasing the size of the fan and the bypass ratio causes a weight penalty. Unducted fans or [[wikipedia:Propfan|Propfans]] have reduced weight penalty but the noise has not been acceptable in the west.

===Geared Turbofan===

Since the fan is much larger diameter than the turbine it must operate at much lower rpm. Traditionally this is achieved by multiple turbine stages. However this makes the turbine system unnecessarily complex and so gearboxes have been attempted to reduce the number of turbine stages required.. The power requirements have so far evaded application in larger size turbofans, but companies are still trying.

Example: [[wikipedia:Honeywell_ALF_502|Honeywell_ALF_502]] used in the BAe 146.

==Turboprop==
{{wikipedia|turboprop}}
Turboshaft with a gearbox and a propeller.

===Turboshaft===

Intake, Compressor, Combustor, and Turbine powering a shaft. Used in helicopters, [[/APU/]]s, as well as surface applications like tanks, ships, electricity generation.

==Pulse Jet==
{{wikipedia|Pulse_jet_engine}}

Uses pulse detonation to close off the intake without primary compression. Intake closure may be dynamic or with mechanical valves such as [[Jet Propulsion/Reed valves|reed valves]].

                               TYPES OF PROPULSION SYSTEMS  (BASIC EXPLANATION LISTING)


I am an FAA Licensed Jet Engine, Piston Engine &amp; Airframe Mechanic plus Skilled with Applied Physics and System Design.  Here is how I would classify not so much Jet Engines per se, but Turbine Engines and all other Propulsion Powerplants:


 1.)  Turbine Propulsion: 

 A.)  Turbojets Engines - No Bypass Cold Airflow Duct and large front Fan, just compressor-turbine spool(s) core.
 B.)  Turbofan Engines - Large Fan in ahead of compressor-turbine spool(s) core with By-Pass Cold Airflow Duct around 
      engine body and compressor-turbine spool(s) core.


 
2.)   Turbine Torque:

 A.)  Turboshaft Engines - More Turbine Stages w/ Free Turbine to Gear Reduced
      Transmission.

 B.)  Turrboprop Engines - Same as Turboshaft Engine except Fuel Control Unit 
      is linked to Blade Pitch System to prevent Windmilling of Propeller and 
      RPM on a Turboprop Engine is controlled by Blade Pitch Control.



 3.)  Non-Turbine Propulsion Powerplants:

 A.)  Ramjet - Hollow convergent venturi tube, lit off when enough forward airspeed is 
      present to provide the compression needed to light it off.  Higher in efficiency and 
      thrust than Propulsion Turbine Powerplants and is dependent on the ability of the 
      fuel injection system pressure and fuel volume delivery limits.  Ramjets are limited 
      to speeds below where the Nitrogen and Oxygen in the air do not compress to such  
      enormous pressures as to where the Oxygen and Nitrogen merge as one killing  
      combustion.  (Note:  Air is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen &amp; 1% various Inert  
      Gases).

 B.)  Scramjet - Supersonic Scramjet or &quot;scramjet&quot;.  These propulsion powerplants are 
      ramjets rated for much higher speeds from supersonic to into hypersonic speeds 
      (more than 4000 MHP).  The only limitation is what any ramjet needs to overcome:   
      The merger of Oxygen and Nitrogen in the Air under enormous compression, 
      when not controlled will merge the Oxygen and Nitrogen as one and kill 
      combustion.   

 C.)  Pulsejet - Hollow convergent venturi tube or any type of differential diameter dual 
      channel which doesn't need to be routed across in a linear manner, but in the same 
      way hydraulic and pneumatic systems can route the master and actuator cylinders in 
      series, any which way in terms of orientation.  There are glass jars and dual plumbing  
      pipes with differential diameters which can be made into pulse jets.  The typical 
      aviation-type Pulse Jet is a convergent venturi channel with spring-loaded shutters on 
      the intake.  During the combustion cycle, a vacuum develops in the aft exhaust 
      section of the venturi causing the spring-loaded-opened shutters to pass airflow during 
      combustion, until the vacuum increases more than the spring-loaded-open shutters 
      can handle causing them to close.  This allows a sealing-bias on the intake side as to 
      maximize thrust in the aft rear section.  But only for a limited dwell-time pulse cycle as 
      to where combustion ceases and allows the shutters to open again to repeat the 
      process.  The aviation-type Pulse Jets run at a frequency around 250 to 600 PPS.  
      As the frequency increases, the Pulse Jet comes online as running into the full thrust 
      rating as fuel delivery increases to maximum limits.  Aviation-grade Pulse Jets may 
      utilize Heat-of-Compression on high compression Pulse Jet designs running on 
      kerosene (same as &quot;jet fuel&quot;) which allow the Pulse Jet to stay lit without additional 
      spark plug or glow plug requirements after being lit off, which time the shutters to the 
      fuel injection system.  Or gasoline-models using shutter position to spark can be used 
      if the compression is lower than needed for allowing a Heat-of-Compression 
      combustion cycle to be utilized.  Plumbing pipes of different diameters connected 180 
      degrees to each other on a 180 degree bend and can be turned into Pulse Jets too.   
      This by using a fuel source in the smaller diameter pipe with spark plug and when it 
      lights off, spark isn't needed anymore, because the compression rises high enough to 
      keep the Pulse Jet lit.  The 180 degree bend between the two different diameter pipes 
      allow a high pulse on/off frequency to develop between combustion and fuel flow dwell 
      when the combustion ceases.  Something in the range of 1200 cycles per second.  
      They're noisy for sure, but keep lit on their own.  Also a glass jar with a cover at the 
      top and small hole at the center with a little bit of gasoline in the bottom, carefully 
      heated on a stove will light off at the top where the hole is and will light off around 
      1200 cycles per second as a Pulse Jet.  Just be careful on adjusting the heat when 
      using a glass jar.  

 D.)  Rocket Propulsion - These Propulsion Powerplants utilize a tapering convergent 
      channel within their airframe fuselage section in which a fuel which carries its own 
      oxygen along with combustible compounds ignite.  Escaping through the tapered 
      convergent channel into thrust.  Typical Rocket Fuels are both liquid and solid Oxy-
      Hydro Fuels which are Oxygen and Hydrogen mixed together and ignited.  Other 
      Rocket Fuels include Hydrogen Peroxide mixed with a catalyst in separate reservoirs 
      injected into the taper convergent thrust channel at the correct ratios to support 
      combustion.  This also goes for the Space Shuttle as well, using liquid Oxygen and 
      Hydrogen in separate reservoirs mixed with emulsified aluminum as to increase thrust 
      output.  Rocket Propulsion speeds are rated to over 30,000 MHP and are more 
      practical for defense, high altitude weather/surveillance and space programs than 
      passenger flight, at least for now this is the case.

 E.)  Missile Propulsion - Missile Propulsion is similar to Rocket Propulsion, except far 
      more airframe system guidance is involved in the likes of airplanes flying on GPS or 
      Radar-Guided systems which control Missile Airframe Flight Control Systems.  This for 
      pin-point guidance, steering and targeting/evasive actions to specific target and 
      collision/avoidance from specific threats.  Many missile designs either incorporate 
      Rocket Propulsion in the  same manner as Rockets or use small turbojet engines 
      within their fuselage.  More advanced missile designs are starting to use Ram Jets 
      along with an initial Rocket Propulsion light-off to get them up to speed.  When they 
      reach a specific airspeed usually around 500 MHP, the Ram Jet will kick in using Oxy-
      Hydro fuel to keep them lit and can increase in speeds to around 2,200 MHP while 
      also fly at low altitudes.  Many of these types of missile designs also incorporate 
      Microwave &amp; Doppler Radar Tracking &amp; Cancellation Systems.  So they can't be 
      tracked by most any type of Radar, even more advanced Radar Systems which  
      track flying objects by their airflow pattern converted into a visual profile.  Such 
      missiles have been pioneered by Russia &amp; India, such as the Moskit from Russia 
      and the Bramos from India. 

 F.)  Air Pressure Propulsion - This is none other than a larger diameter accumulator 
      shaped like a cylinder with an enormous amount of air pressure pre-charged connected 
      to a powerful air compression with high volume capacity tank.  On the other end of this 
      cylinder is a small diameter pipe which when opened up passing a high amount of air 
      velocity, by the air pressure being stepped down at the end before the smaller tail pipe 
      begins causing the air velocity to rise.  These types of Propulsion Systems require a 
      constant pressure to remain at a certain limit within the accumulator cylinder to be 
      effective for any practical thrust.  Experimental applications using this type of 
      propulsion would also require a large enough accumulator cylinder to provide for 
      enough constant pressure to stagnate while the air escapes through the small tail pipe 
      into thrust.  [Pressure = Force / Area;   Force = Pressure x Area.  This is the basic 
      principle on how hydraulics, pneumatics, firearms, rockets, jet propulsion, piston 
      engines and aircraft operate by].

A ramjet uses the open [[Jet Propulsion/Thermodynamic Cycles/Brayton cycle|Brayton cycle]]. In the above diagram a [[2D supersonic intake]] is shown downstream of which is a divergent subsonic diffuser.

Ramjets are inefficient at [[wikipedia:subsonic|subsonic]] speeds and their efficiency improves at supersonic speeds. 

At [[wikipedia:hypersonic|hypersonic]] speeds the compression and dissociation processes make full diffusion unattractive and supersonic combustion is being researched. [[wikipedia:Scramjet|Scramjet]] slow the air down to low supersonic speeds and then burn high flame velocity fuels such as hydrogen or methane to try to get net thrust.

'''Nuts''' in cuisine are a much less restrictive category than nuts in botany, the term being applied to many seeds that are not true nuts in the botanical sense. Any large, oily kernel found within a shell and used in food may be regarded as a nut. Because nuts generally have a high oil content, they are a highly prized food and energy source. A large number of seeds are edible by humans and used in cooking, eaten raw, sprouted, or roasted as a snack food, or pressed for oil that is used in cookery and cosmetics. 

Nuts are a significant source of nutrition for wildlife. This is particularly true in temperate climates where animals such as squirrels and jays store acorns and other nuts during the autumn to keep them from starving during the winter and early spring. 

Nuts of temperate climates are dominated by wind-pollinated trees of the Order Fagales:

'''Granulated sugar''' is pure sucrose, chemically the same as [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|superfine]] (also known as caster or castor) sugar. The crystals are not as fine though. Typically one type may be substituted for the other.

Superfine sugar more easily dissolves in cold liquids. This can help to make [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringues]] of a finer texture. In some cases, this property is undesirable. For example, the coating on [[Cookbook:Saucepan Fudge Crackle Cookies|Saucepan Fudge Crackle Cookies]] is specified to use regular granulated sugar; superfine sugar might dissolve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Jet Propulsion/Engine_ratings|Engine ratings]]==

Engines are certified to deliver standard thrusts depending upon atmospheric conditions. Thrust is typically measured in kN or lbs.

===Maximum Takeoff thrust===

This is the maximum thrust that the engine can deliver for 5 minutes at standard sea level atmosphere. Peak thrust is usually achieved when the engine is static.

===Maximum Climb thrust===

This is the maximum thrust that the engine can deliver for 5 minutes at standard sea level atmosphere. 

===Maximum Cruise thrust===

The thrust allowable for unlimited flight duration at the design altitude.

===Maximum Continuous thrust===

Also called the maximum maneuver thrust. Sometimes is same as maximum cruise.

===Specific fuel consumption===

Typically quoted in mg/Ns for engines. Is usually much higher at cruise than at static.

A typical high bypass engine will consume about 8mg/Ns at maximum takeoff and 15mg/Ns at maximum cruise thrust.




===Example ratings===

The figure below shows the typical behaviour of a modern turbofan. The orange curves show maximum cruise thrust at altitude. The TO thrust is significantly higher than the cruise thrust at sea level since it is permitted for short durations only.. 


&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:tfan-thrust-map-kk-20050824.png|||640px]]
&lt;/center&gt;


Typical large engines today have TO thrusts approaching 480kN. Typical cruise SFC is around 15mg/Ns.  A low bypass military engine will have TO sfc of about 18mg/Ns which rises to 50mg/Ns if afterburner is used.

==[[Jet Propulsion/Specific impulse|Specific impulse]]==

Specific impulse is defined as the thrust (N) divided by the fuel weight flow rate (N/s). The resulting measure is usually quoted in seconds and defines the weight fraction  that is necessary to give a particular delta V for a rocket or range for an aircraft with a given lift to drag ratio.

For a jet engine the specific impulse can be determined from the specific fuel consumption. For example an engine that has an SFC of 15mg/N-s will have a specific impulse of 6800s. Current turbofan engines have cruise SFC below 15. 

For a chemical rocket the specific impulse ranges to about 500s.

&lt;center&gt;

[[Image:specific-impulse-kk-20050824.png|||640px]]

&lt;/center&gt;


==[[Jet Propulsion/Thrust|Thrust]]==

The thrust of a jet engine is determined by the difference in momentum of the fluids flowing in and out of the engine. If the mass of fuel added is negligible then  the thrust is:

:&lt;math&gt; T = \dot{m}(u_{exit}-u_{inlet}) &lt;/math&gt;

==[[Jet Propulsion/Performance|Performance]]==

===Range===

The [[wikipedia:Breguet_Range_equation|Breguet Range Equation]] gives the range achieved by a vehicle. For a constant L/D ratio of the aircraft 

&lt;math&gt;Range=u I_{sp}\left(\frac{L}{D}\right) \ln \left(\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

R = distance flown (m)

u = velocity (m/s)

I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = specific impulse (s)

L/D = lift-to-drag ratio (dimensionless)

W&lt;sub&gt;initial&lt;/sub&gt; = gross aircraft weight at the start of cruise (kg)

W&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt; = gross weight at the end of cruise (kg)

===Example===

For an aircraft with 50% fuel, velocity of 600 m/s, an L/d of 10 and engines with a specific impulse of 3000 the range is:

&lt;math&gt;R = (600m/s) (3000s) (10) \ln(2) = 12,477km&lt;/math&gt; 




===Take off===

===Landing===

===Maneuver===

All jet engines and gas turbines are heat engines that convert thermal energy into useful work. The useful work may be in the form of mechanical power, as from a shaft which may be used to drive a propeller, a vehicle, a pump, an electric generator, or any other mechanical device. In Jet engine applications the work is in producing compressed air and combustion products which are then accelerated to provide reaction propulsion.

The [[Jet_propulsion/thermal efficiency|thermal efficiency]] for a shaft application is calculated using the ratio of output mechanical energy divided by input thermal energy. For propulsive applications the definition of efficiency involves the velocity of the jet through the air since a stationary engine anchored to the ground produces no propulsive work. In such a case a [[Jet_propulsion/propulsive efficiency|propulsive efficiency]] is defined which relates the propulsive work delivered to the total mechanical energy produced by the engine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Theory ==
At the core of computer science, specifically the study of computation and computability, is the Church-Turing thesis.  This thesis states that any function regarded as computable can be computed by a theoretical device called a 'Turing Machine'. A natural corollary of this theorem is that any general-purpose programming language is sufficient to express any algorithm.  Basically anything which can be considered computable (in the case of emulation, the computations involving the workings of a machines hardware), can be computed by any general-purpose programming language.  The reason the modern emulators are capable of emulating most computers is that the bulk of modern computers are based on the von Neumann architecture.  This computer architecture was originally documented by the late John von Neumann in the 1950s, and dictates the basic way in which the modern computer operates (by fetching and executing instructions from memory, these functions can in turn write data back to computer memory during the course of their execution).  All other components such as video, sound, keyboard, and mouse are all extensions to this basic architecture. In pseudocode, a basic emulator loop is written:

&lt;pre&gt;
do
  fetch the next instruction from emulated memory
  execute the instruction
  check for interrupts
while WE ARE STILL EXECUTING INSTRUCTIONS
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Implementation ==
Utilizing these principles, emulation software (emulators) essentially convert binary data written for execution on one machine to an equivalent binary form suitable for execution on another machine.  This conversion is usually done by taking the original binary instruction and translating it into one or more equivalent instructions for execution on another machine.  As a 1:1 instruction conversion rate is usually not possible, the emulator's equivalent to the original program is often much larger.

Often an exact equivalent to one device required by the machine being emulated is not possible.  For example, the controller for a NES or PlayStation is usually not present on a PC.  This is where any comparable equivalent is used, most commonly the keyboard or a joystick.  This compensation is part of what makes emulation difficult, as one must have a clear understanding of how the hardware works in order to emulate it. This is especially true for more challenging pieces of hardware like audio and video chips. There are typically two ways to emulate a given piece of software: interpretation and recompilation.

=== Interpretation ===
In interpretation, the binary data is read and as each instruction is decoded it is executed; each instruction is executed every time it is encountered.  Typically this method is the easiest to implement, but it is also typically the slowest in terms of execution time.  Many older console emulators use interpretation.

{{TODO|Add pseudocode examples and explain better for people looking to program an interpreter...}}

Some examples of emulators that use interpretation are:

* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/nestopia Nestopia]
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/emgb emgb]
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/clonegb CloneGB]

=== Recompilation ===
Recompilation, also called binary translation, involves a directly binary conversion from the binary data for the emulated platform into binary data suitable for execution on the targeted platform. This method usually provides a significant performance boost to emulation software, and it used by most emulators for 'next-generation' consoles.  Recompilation typically comes in two varieties:

* Dynamic recompilation
** In dynamic recompilation, or dynamic binary translation, the binary data is translated only on the first pass, and is kept in a cache where the translated binary equivalent is stored, and referenced whenever that section is executed again. The basic idea is to do expensive translation and decoding of instructions once, and then reference the cached translated code often. This method is the most commonly employed as it can deal with all forms of code, including self-modifying. Some examples:
*** [http://sourceforge.net/projects/schibo 1964]
*** [http://sourceforge.net/projects/daedalus-n64/ Daedalus N64]
*** [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx/ PCSX]
*** [http://forums.ngemu.com/pcsx-discussion/131963-overview-pcsxs-file-structure.html An overview of PCSX's file structure]
*** [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsx2/ PCSX2]
* Static recompilation
** In static recompilation, or static binary translation, the binary data is translated once in a single pass over the code. The code to be emulated can be scanned and the translation can be optimized by applying various algorithms. The translated data is then usually saved either in a file or memory, where it is referenced by the program upon execution.  While this can sometimes improve performance even over dynamic recompilation, if the code is self-modifying, this method usually fails to properly translate the executable, forcing a fallback to a dynamic recompiler or an interpreter to handle the modified code.

In fact, glycolysis considered a linear pathway of ten enzyme-mediated steps. The pathway for glycolysis has two phases: the energy investment phase and energy generation phase. The first five steps in the glycolysis are the energy investment &quot;preparatory phase&quot;, which produce glyceraldehyde and three phosphate. Energy generation phase &quot;payoff phase&quot; is the last five steps of glycolysis, which produce the final two pyruvate molecules product. Glycolysis can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen, which called aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis respectively. In the body, the source of glucose for glycolysis come from dietary disaccharides and monosaccharides.    
'''Glycolysis''' is the process by which [[w:glucose|glucose]] is converted to two molecules of pyruvate.  It is the first step in [[w:carbohydrate|carbohydrate]] metabolism, the end result of which is the conversion of glucose to carbon dioxide and water.  In this process, a large amount of energy is converted into [[w:ATP|ATP]].

During glycolysis, two molecules of NADH and a net two molecules of ATP are generated (two molecules of ATP are used to get the pathway started, but four molecules are then synthesized).  Thus, there is a net production of two ATP molecules for each glucose molecule converted to two molecules of pyruvate.

==The Ten Steps of Glycolysis==
This is not correct, enzyme two is phosphohexose isomerase
===Visual Overview of Reactions===
'''Stage I: Energy Investment'''
'''Stage II: Energy Harvesting'''
==Detailed Description of Reactions==
(1) Glucose that enters the cell has only one fate: it is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by a typical [[w:kinase|kinase]] reaction.  A [[w:pyrophosphate|pyrophosphate]] bond is cleaved (-7.5 kcal/mole) and a phosphate ester bond is formed (+3 kcal/mole), resulting in a net -4.0 kcal/mole.  Therefore, this reaction is irreversible.

[[Image:gly01.gif]]

(2) Glucose-6-phosphate is then converted into Fructose-6-phosphate by a reversible [[w:isomerization|isomerization]].

Note: at body pH, phosphate groups are ionized, so PO3H2 would really be PO3(2-).

Glycolysis, an overview

Glycolysis is a central pathway for the catabolism of carbohydrates in which the six-carbon sugars are split to three-carbon compounds with subsequent release of energy used to transform ADP to ATP. Glycolysis can proceed under anaerobic (without oxygen) and aerobic conditions.
Glycolysis, an overall equation

Glycolysis is a 10-step pathway which converts glucose to 2 pyruvate molecules. The overall Glycolysis step can be written as a net equation:
Glucose + 2xADP + 2xNAD+ -&gt; 2xPyruvate + 2xATP + 2xNADH

Glycolysis consists from two main phases. First phase, energy investment. During this step 2xATP are converted to 2xADP molecules. Second phase, energy generation. During this step 4xADP are converted to 2xATP molecules and 2xNAD+ are converted to 2xNADH molecules.

Anaerobic and Aerobic Glycolysis

Glycolysis is an ancient metabolic pathway which was probably developed about 3.5 billion years ago when there is no oxygen was available. That is why main Glycolysis Glycolysis step s are not require oxygen. Products from Glycolysis then can follow anaerobic and aerobic pathways.
Anaerobic Glycolysis pathway

For anaerobic Glycolysis pathway there are two major fermentation processes exists. 

Lactic acid fermentation. This pathway is common for animal cells and lactic acid bacteria. In animals the anaerobic glycolysis take place in many tissues. Red blood cells take most of the energy from anaerobic metabolism. Skeletal muscle take energy from glycolysis and from respiration. The lactate produced utilise through diffusion from the tissues to bloodstream and then to aerobic tissues, such as liver and heart. In these aerobic tissues lactate can be catabolized further or can be converted back through gluconeogenesis.


One step conversion of Pyruvate to Lactate catalysed by Lactate dehydrogenase.
δGo = -25.1 kJ/mol
Alcoholic fermentation. This two-step pathway is common for yeast.

Pyruvate -&gt; Acetaldehyde + CO2 catalysed by Pyruvate decarboxylase. This reaction requires thiamine pyrophosphate, derived from vitamin B1 as a coenzyme.

Conversion of Acetaldehyde to Ethanol by Alcohol dehydrogenase.
Aerobic Glycolysis pathway

With the present of oxygen in cells pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. The NADH molecules are reoxidized through the with electrons transferred to the O2 molecules. The aerobic Glycolysis consists from two major steps:

Glucose + 2xADP + 2xPi + 2xNAD+ =&gt;
2xPyruvate + 2xATP + 2xNADH + 2H+ + 2xH2O

NADH oxidation pathway which generaly take place in the mitochohdrion:
2xNADH + 8xH+ + O2 + 6xADP + 6xPi =&gt;
2xNAD+ + 8H2O + 6xATP

The final net equation for aerobic Glycolysis:

Glucose + 8xADP + 8xPi + 8xH+ + O2 =&gt; 2xPyruvate + 8xATP + 10xH2O
Aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. Overview

The metabolism of glucose trough aerobics or anaerobic pathways is a nonoxidative process. Both types of glycolysis release a small fraction of potential energy stored in the glucose molecules. During the first 10 steps of glycolysis, only a small part of all glucose energy is released and the rest of the potential energy is released during the last steps after glycolysis. For this reason aerobic degradation is much more efficient than anaerobic metabolism. That is why the aerobic mechanism is now much more spread within living organisms, but nevertheless anaerobic pathways still take place even in animals under certain physiological circumstances.

== Overview ==

'''''Horace E. F. Slughorn''''' is the retired head of Slytherin House and a former Hogwarts teacher. Confronted with a shortage of teachers by the incapacitation of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] and the rumours surrounding the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts position]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] convinces him to come out of retirement and return to teaching. Slughorn is a portly older gentleman with an ebullient manner, a large moustache, and a very deep voice.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] collects [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']] after only two weeks of the summer vacation. As they depart on their way to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], Dumbledore comments that he finds himself again one teacher short, and so they will be stopping to visit someone he hopes to coax into the job. In the town of Budleigh Babberton, they find a house that has apparently been the subject of an attack: door standing open, furniture destroyed, apparent blood spattered on the walls. Dumbledore, surveying the wreckage, pokes an overturned armchair with his wand; it turns into a very fat man, who is then introduced as Horace Slughorn. Asked what had given him away, Dumbledore comments that if the attack had been real, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] would have been floating over the house; Slughorn admits to forgetting it, but says he had been rushed, being in the bath when his detector had gone off. The two of them clean up the house, then Dumbledore introduces Harry, and asks Slughorn if he would be interested in getting his old job back. Slughorn demurs, saying he's concerned that coming out of his concealment might make him a target for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Dumbledore then departs, ostensibly to go to the bathroom.

Slughorn now engages Harry in conversation, talking about his mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] as she was then, and how she had been one of his favorite students despite being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle-born]]. He admits to a bias towards the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|Pureblood]] students, and mentions that it is only natural, with his having been head of Slytherin house. He then talks about his connections in the Wizarding world, with sports teams and the Ministry; Harry asks if they have been in touch since Slughorn went into concealment. Slughorn admits, reluctantly, that his standard of living has dropped since he went into hiding a year before. Harry points out that Hogwarts is probably at least as safe as anywhere else; possibly more so, as Dumbledore was the only wizard that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] was believed to fear.

Dumbledore then returns from the bathroom, saying he had become intrigued by one of the magazines there, and takes his leave of Slughorn. As he and Harry head for the door, Slughorn changes his mind and accepts the teaching post Dumbledore was offering.

As they travel to The Burrow, Dumbledore tells Harry that Slughorn had previously maintained a student group at Hogwarts, called the &quot;Slug Club&quot;, whose members were either skilled or well-connected. It is this group which had left him the connections he needed to keep him in the creature comforts he was so fond of. Dumbledore suggests that Slughorn might want to restart that club on his return, and that Harry would be the star of that club if it did re-form.

It appears Dumbledore is correct, as on the Hogwarts Express heading to school, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] find themselves invited to a gathering in Slughorn's compartment, along with several other students who seem to have important relatives. Slughorn seems to be trying to get Harry to tell what had happened in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]], but when Harry remained silent as to details, Slughorn shifted to his own reminiscences and entertained the students almost until they arrived at Hogwarts.

At the Arrival Feast, Harry, along with many others, is amazed to hear that Slughorn has been brought in as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] Master, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] has been given the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] position that he has wanted for so long. Alarming as this may be, it provides one major advantage for Harry: Snape would only accept students at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T. level]] if they receive an Outstanding grade in Potions, and Harry's grade had been merely Exceeds Expectations. Harry had seen his dream of becoming an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] vanish. Slughorn, however, is willing to accept an Exceeds Expectations student for NEWT-level classes, so Harry is free to take Potions and prepare for his chosen career.

At the first Potions class, then, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], both of whom are now able to take Potions, are in need of textbooks. Slughorn digs a couple of used books out of a cupboard for them. Slughorn has prepared several cauldrons of potion, and asks the class to identify them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] identifies all four of them, earning thirty House points for Gryffindor, and Slughorn's admiration. Slughorn then sets them the task of brewing a particular potion, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Draught of Living Death|Draught of Living Death]]. Harry, looking at his borrowed Potions book, notes that the previous owner had annotated it; following the annotations, he finds that his results are much better even then Hermione's. Slughorn commends him for his skill at Potions, saying he was obviously his mother's son; she was easily the best potion-maker in her class year. As Harry has made the best example of the potion, he wins the prize: a phial of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]], enough Liquid Luck for twelve hours.

Harry's continuing use of the annotated textbook will lead Slughorn to believe that he is extremely talented in Potions. Harry does not want to lose the benefit of the annotations in the book, so when his new copy arrives from Flourish and Blotts, he returns that book to Slughorn, keeping the annotated book for himself.

Returning from a visit with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] after the Quidditch tryouts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are met in the great hall by Slughorn, who invites Harry and Hermione to a little party, &quot;just a few rising stars&quot;, while ignoring Ron who is standing right there. Harry pleads a previous engagement, detention with Snape. Slughorn says he will try to straighten that small matter out, and waddles away, but is ultimately not successful.

On the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] visit of the year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione run into Slughorn in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Honeyduke's Sweetshop|Honeyduke's Sweetshop]]. Slughorn invites Harry and Hermione to another little party, again ignoring Ron. Harry again has to refuse, as he has a lesson scheduled with Professor Dumbledore for that evening. Harry continues to avoid Slughorn's parties by scheduling Quidditch practice on those days when the parties are happening. Hermione later mentions that Slughorn's parties aren't as bad as all that, and that Harry should at least plan on coming to the Christmas party. She mentions that he would be allowed to bring a guest, which sparks a small row between her and Ron.

Harry manages to avoid the girls attempting to wangle an invitation to Slughorn's party with him, eventually inviting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. Hermione chooses to invite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen]], largely to spite Ron who is very deeply involved with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]]. 

Once Harry and Luna arrive at the party, they run into Hermione, who is now actively trying to avoid Cormac. They fall into discussion with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], and Harry and Hermione are very entertained by Luna's theories about conspiracies in the Ministry. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] arrives with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], who he had found wandering the halls; Professor Slughorn decides that he had been attempting to gatecrash, and magnanimously invites him to join the party. Shortly, Draco and Snape leave for a private word, and Harry departs to eavesdrop on them. If he returns to the party afterwards, we don't hear about it.

Immediately after Christmas, in one of his private lessons with Dumbledore, Harry experiences a memory of Slughorn's from the days when the Slug Club had included [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]. The memory, which shows Tom asking about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], is very obviously edited such that none of Slughorn's responses are present. Professor Dumbledore says that Harry is uniquely equipped to retrieve the unedited memory from Slughorn, and charges him with that retrieval, saying it is quite possibly the most important thing Harry will have to do all year.

Some time later, Professor Slughorn sets them the task of determining and brewing an antidote for a mixture of magical poisons. Harry finds a scrawled note in his textbook that says &quot;Simply shove a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bezoar|Bezoar]] down their throat.&quot; As the end of the class approaches, Harry finds a bezoar in the ingredients cupboard. As time is called, nobody has a complete solution, not even Hermione. Harry exhibits his bezoar, to Hermione's dismay and Slughorn's deep amusement. Slughorn absently tucks the bezoar into his bag. At the end of class, Harry asks Slughorn about Horcruxes, but Slughorn irritably insists that there was nothing more to that episode than what Dumbledore has seen, and leaves hastily.

So long as Harry stays away from the subject of Horcruxes, Slughorn remains amiable, but Harry, who is now waiting for one of his invitations to his little soirées, is frustrated that none are forthcoming. And so matters remain for some months, as Slughorn steadfastly avoids any situation where he might be alone with Harry.

Harry had been given a box of Chocolate Cauldrons by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]] who, at the time, had been angling for an invitation to Slughorn's Christmas party. Warned by Hermione to suspect love potion, Harry had set them aside in his trunk. Hunting through his trunk, he had pulled them roughly out, and Ron, whose birthday it was, had mistaken them for a gift for himself and had eaten two. Harry, finding Ron infatuated with Romilda, had taken him to Slughorn's office for an antidote. Slughorn expressed some surprise that as talented a potion-maker as Harry had not simply whipped up the antidote himself, but quickly puts together a potion, and gives it to Ron who is abruptly cured, and badly shaken. Slughorn then pours out some &quot;oak-aged mead&quot; which he says he had gotten as a Christmas gift for Dumbledore, but had forgotten to give him. Harry, watching Ron as he downs the entire glass in one, sees the poison in the mead affecting him. Slughorn, shocked, can only stutter and stammer as Ron falls; Harry, remembering the Bezoar that Slughorn had tucked into his bag, rummages through Slughorn's bag to find it and forces it into Ron's mouth, just in time.

In the Hospital Wing afterwards, where Harry is visiting with Ron, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]], the Weasley family speculate on why Slughorn would have had poisoned mead in the first place, and wonder exactly who he would be trying to poison. The suggestion is aired that Slughorn may be a Death Eater, or sympathetic to them, and be trying to poison Harry; but Harry points out that Slughorn had said the mead was intended for Dumbledore.

On the day of the testing for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] in Hogsmeade, Slughorn finds that only three students remain in his Potions class: Harry, Draco Malfoy, and Ernie Macmillan. He decides to set them an open lesson, having each of them create a potion of his own choice. Harry, thinking to perhaps lighten Slughorn's mood and loosen his tongue, chooses to make up a Euphoria Elixir. Slughorn, when it is complete, looks at Harry's potion and scents it, but departs almost at the run before Harry can convince him to try tasting it.

That morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had been discussing how to get the memory from Slughorn, and had hit upon the idea of using some of the Felix Felicis potion that Harry had won on the first day of class. While they were discussing this, Harry had received a note from Hagrid that said that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] had died, and asking Harry to come to the funeral. Having failed to convince Slughorn to grant him the memory that afternoon, Harry takes the Felix Felicis potion, and promptly decides to attend Aragog's funeral, much to Ron's and Hermione's horror. On the way there, he decides to detour past the greenhouses, where he luckily runs into Slughorn. He chooses to tell Slughorn the truth about why he is out there; Slughorn, thinking avariciously of the value of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantula]] venom, not only fails to punish Harry for being out of the school, but chooses to join Harry at Hagrid's, bearing a number of bottles of mead. After Aragog is buried, Slughorn, pouring generously, manages to get himself and Hagrid drunk; Harry, luckily, moderates his drinking, magically refills the bottles without either of the other two noticing, and finally convinces Slughorn, who is so drunk that he will remember nothing in the morning, to retrieve the memory that Dumbledore has been seeking.

Viewing the memory with Dumbledore shortly afterwards, Harry learns that in that particular episode, Tom Riddle had managed to receive some information about Horcruxes from Slughorn, and had asked about the possibility of making multiple Horcruxes. In particular, Tom had suggested that seven was a particularly magical number, and wondered whether seven pieces of soul might not provide even better immortality than two. Slughorn had been horrified at the thought.

Harry loses access to the textbook that had belonged to the Half-Blood Prince, leaving it in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] to keep it from being confiscated by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], and as a result his skill in Potions falls off rather sharply. However, as he has at the same time rather publicly started going out with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], Slughorn attributes his decreased ability to distraction, quite understandable in one Harry's age.

At the end of the book, following Snape's departure, a meeting of the four Heads of House must be called. As Snape is no longer available, Slughorn is called in as acting head of Slytherin house. Slughorn is in shock at Snape's actions, saying that he had thought he had known Snape. He suggests that with Dumbledore gone, people might not want to send their children to Hogwarts, but that he was in favour of keeping the school open.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Apparently, Professor Slughorn's temporary appointment as head of Slytherin house was continued, as we see him responding (albeit sluggishly) to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s summons to the heads of Houses. As Snape is departing, Professor McGonagall tells Professor Slughorn in no uncertain terms that he must decide whether he stands with the school or with the Death Eaters. Slughorn chooses to stand with the school, and is seen with McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt, dueling Voldemort, just before Harry's final confrontation.

== Strengths ==

He has an uncanny ability to pick students who have a promising future, giving him many good contacts. He is also highly skilled at potion-making and is, according to Dumbledore, an extremely accomplished wizard.  He is good natured and occasionally generous to the people he likes.

== Weaknesses ==

His health is bad, as he has a weak chest. He also shows a favoritism to talented people. In addition, he is slightly greedy.  He is self-indulgent, enjoying an excess of expensive liquor, good food and fine clothing.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Horace Slughorn is portrayed as the classic social climber. In the first meeting of the Slug Club, we see him dismissing a student because he is estranged from his famous relative. We see his perpetual wrangling, masked in amiability, to bring Harry into his orbit. We hear that he has continuing contacts with the more famous people in the Wizarding world, and we see some of them at various Slug Club meetings. We also see that all of these relationships are based on what they can bring to Slughorn; it seems that what he can bring to a relationship is less well defined.Slughorn seems to be intent only on raising his own status by associating with high-status individuals, and the fact that this allows some of his guests to make connections with others is possibly incidental, although we do see him playing up that aspect of his meetings to a small extent.

It is hard to determine whether Slughorn's relationship with Dumbledore is based on Dumbledore's social position, or on respect for Dumbledore's abilities. Dumbledore does seem to like Slughorn, but sees fit to warn Harry indirectly about Slughorn and the Slug Club.

We note in passing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] was a member of an earlier edition of the Slug Club. This would suggest that Slughorn was not, perhaps, the keenest judge of character. In mitigation, though, we have already heard from Dumbledore that Tom was very personable, and both from Dumbledore, and from Tom himself, that Dumbledore was the only one of the teachers who did not accept him at face value.

== Analysis ==

In the articles on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan Lestrange]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]], we note that in Slughorn's memory of the episode where Riddle asks about Horcruxes, Slughorn addresses someone named Avery and someone named Lestrange. Obviously, these are fellow students of Riddle's, and so must be about sixty-five years old as of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', if they are still alive. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] mentions at one point that Avery is a friend of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]], which we assume means he is a student at the time, making him about thirty, Snape's age. Determining Rabastan and Rodolphus' age is slightly more complicated, but Rodolphus married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], who apparently is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy's]] sister. Narcissa is, of course, married to Lucius Malfoy, who was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]] when Snape was Sorted on his first arrival at Hogwarts. From this we can determine that Rabastan and Rodolphus are at least of the same generation as Snape, making them also about thirty, give or take possibly ten years. From this we infer that the Avery mentioned by Slughorn is likely the father of the Avery who plays an active role in this story, and that the Lestrange mentioned may be the father of Rabastan and Rodolphus.

Clay Shirky (google) has written a lot about peer to peer. Things like The Case Against Micropayments are relevant. But I'm specifically thinking about the argument that leechers are simply irrelevant. Because despite neo-con arguments that peer to peer is unfeasible and tragedy of the commons and all that crap, the fact is that bandwidth is not an exhaustible resource. It's a perpetually renewing resource. Or more accurately, it's not something you can save up or waste. Yes, a person may leech from me or I may leech from someone else, but it actually doesn't matter since the bandwidth &quot;wasted&quot; is gone anyways and if someone hasn't used it by now then nobody can. There's also the argument that it's better to be leeched off from directly than for the leecher to leech from the central server that I'm getting my own stuff from. My upload bandwidth is gone either way, but by being leeched off from then I get a faster download rate.

Anyways, this should be written up better and put into the leech section.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Draco Malfoy''''', a boy with blond hair and a pale, pointed sneering face, is the only child of the wealthy Lucius Malfoy and his wife, Narcissa Black Malfoy. Draco attends Hogwarts School of Witchraft and Wizardry, and is in the same year as Harry Potter. Draco is a member of Slytherin House, and he is usually accompanied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Gregory Goyle]], and occasionally [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]], also Slytherins. Draco constantly boasts about being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|pureblood]] wizard and his family's wealth and societal status.

According to the author's web site, Draco was born on 5 June; this would make him almost two months older than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]. According to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|Black family tree]], he was born in 1980.

Draco's wand is hawthorn wood with a unicorn hair core.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Draco Malfoy is introduced to the story in Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] where he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] are being fitted for their school robes. Draco, who does not introduce himself, expresses hope that he will be sorted into Slytherin House. He asks Harry's name, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] appearing at the window distracts them before Harry can answer. Harry is somewhat dismayed by Draco's assumption that pure-blood Wizarding families are superior, and asks Hagrid about this; Hagrid dismisses his concerns, saying Draco would feel less superior if he knew who Harry was.

Draco appears again, with his two cohorts, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], in tow, aboard the Hogwarts Express. Draco expresses some surprise that this truly is Harry Potter, then makes an insulting remark about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who is sharing Harry's compartment, and suggests that Harry would do well to ally himself with Draco rather than Ron. Harry responds that he has a pretty good idea about what people he wants to associate himself with, dismissing Draco. Draco wants the treats Harry bought, but when Goyle attempts to grab a cauldron cake, Ron's rat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], attacks him. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle retreat in confusion.

Draco is Sorted into Slytherin House, as he expected, along with his two sidekicks, Crabbe and Goyle. Harry and Ron find they have double [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] with Slytherin. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle snigger when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], upon seeing Harry's name, remarks, &quot;Our new... ''celebrity''.&quot; Snape obviously favors Draco, while frequently criticizing everyone else in the class.

Except for Potions class, Harry has avoided Draco, but is dismayed that flying lessons are being shared with Slytherins. Harry is eager to learn how to fly, but he fears embarrassing himself while Draco is present. Ron speculates that Draco likely knows little more about flying than Harry, despite his bragging; Draco does have many flying stories to tell, though all seem to end with narrow escapes from Muggle helicopters.

At breakfast, before the first flying class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] receives a package containing a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Remembrall|Remembrall]]. Draco, strutting by the table, grabs it, prompting Harry and Ron leap to their feet, hoping for an excuse to fight. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall's]] timely arrival interrupts them, and Draco returns the Remembrall to Neville.

At the flying lesson, Harry and Ron are delighted when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] corrects how Draco grips his broomstick, saying he has been doing it wrong for years. When Draco jeers at Neville after his accident, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] warns him to shut up, prompting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] to snidely remark that Parvati is sweet on Neville. Disregarding Madam Hooch's order for all students to remain on the ground during her absence, Draco picks up Neville's Remembrall and takes off on his broom, intending to place the Remembrall high in a tree. Harry follows on his broom, discovering he is a natural flyer, and that Draco is far less brave without Crabbe and Goyle being nearby. Draco, cowed, throws the Remembrall high in the air. Harry dives and catches it before it smashes into the ground. He is caught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and has to endure Draco's triumphant smirk as Harry is led away, believing he will be expelled.

Later, Draco challenges Harry to a Wizard's Duel at midnight. Ron immediately volunteers to be Harry's second, and Draco selects Crabbe as his. When Harry reaches the trophy room at the appointed time, however, it becomes apparent that Draco never intended to meet Harry. Instead, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] arrives, hunting students. After evading Filch, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] surmises Draco tipped off Filch that Harry and the others would be there after hours.

Draco is dismayed that Harry escaped being expelled again. He is even more dismayed when, a week later, a long, thin package is delivered to Harry at breakfast. Draco determines that it must be a broom, and denounces him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]. Flitwick agrees it is a broom, but says a first-year student, like Harry, can own one under special circumstances.

Draco, enraged by Gryffindor's win over Slytherin at Quidditch after Harry nearly swallows the Snitch, jokes that Gryffindor's next seeker will be a wide-mouth tree frog. When this fails to have any effect on Harry, Draco reverts to ridiculing Harry's home life and his plans to stay at the school over Christmas. Harry hardly minds - he actually expects this to be his best Christmas ever, particularly as the Weasley children are also staying at Hogwarts. When Draco makes disparaging remarks about Ron's poverty, Ron, enraged, dives at Draco and is penalized five House points by Snape, who has just arrived on the scene.

Shortly after Christmas, Neville Longbottom topples through the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Locomotor Mortis|legs charmed to stick together]]. Draco jinxed him just outside the library, claiming he was looking for someone to practice on. Hermione undoes the jinx, and Harry encourages Neville to stand up against bullies like Draco.

Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle sit directly behind Ron and Neville at the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. Within the first few minutes, Draco has goaded Ron to where he jumps Draco. Neville hesitates, then joins in. Ron, though getting a bloody nose, has given Draco a black eye.

Draco may be within earshot when Harry reads Hagrid's note saying that the dragon egg is hatching. Harry, Hermione, and Ron head to Hagrid's hut to watch. Inside, Hagrid sees someone peering in the window, and Harry recognizes the vanishing figure as Draco. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert]], the baby dragon, later bites Ron's hand, sending Ron to the Hospital Wing, where Draco soon arrives, claiming he needs to borrow a book. Instead, he torments Ron by threatening to tell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] what actually bit him. Charlie Weasley's letter specifying when Norbert is to be picked up is in the book that Draco borrows.

Later, Harry and Hermione, under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], head for the tallest tower to deliver Norbert for the appointed pick up. Along the way, they spot Professor McGonagall penalizing Draco house points and giving him detention for being out after hours and fabricating nonsense about a dragon. That evening's events also land Harry, Hermione, and Neville in detention with Draco; a week before exams, Filch escorts the four to Hagrid, who explains they are going into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Refusing to participate, Draco protests that it is servant stuff, though he sulkily acquiesces after Hagrid issues an ultimatum: either go or be expelled. Something has been slaying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], and the students' job is to help Hagrid track a wounded one and find what hunted it. Despite his initial trepidation, Draco, paired with Neville, becomes bored and scares Neville, who releases a distress signal. Hagrid, responding, re-shuffles the groups so that Draco is now paired with Harry, who presumably is less easily scared. When Harry and Draco find the dead unicorn, a dark shape is hovering over it, apparently lapping its blood; Draco, terrified, runs away.

Draco is seen again at the end-of-year feast, where Harry is sickened by watching Draco banging his goblet in a joyous celebration over Slytherin winning the House trophy. But Harry is suddenly cheered by Draco's stunned and horrified expression when, after a last-minute awarding of house points, Gryffindor is declared the winner.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Malfoy has joined the Slytherin Quidditch team as Seeker, though this is mostly due to his father, Lucius Malfoy, having donated expensive racing brooms to the Slytherin team. When students start being attacked, Harry suspects that Draco might be Salazar Slytherin's heir, and therefore able to open the Chamber of Secrets to unleash the monster within that will kill Muggle-born students. Using the Polyjuice potion that Hermione secretly brewed, Harry and Ron transform themselves into Crabbe and Goyle in an effort to learn the Heir's true identity, only to discover that it is ''not'' Draco, nor does he know who it might be.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

In the book, Draco actually approaches Buckbeak cautiously and even strokes his beak. However, he makes the mistake of verbally insulting the bird and is attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] during the first Care Of Magical Creatures lesson. Later, Hermione slaps Draco in the face for laughing about Buckbeak's impending execution. Draco also taunts Harry about him wanting revenge against Sirius Black, who, unknown to Harry just yet, is his godfather and is somehow connected to James and Lily Potter's murders. Chances are high that Draco knows that Sirius is innocent because Sirius is the cousin of Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===
Draco first appears at the Quidditch World Cup with his parents, and later sees the Trio taking refuge in the woods during the Death Eater attack. Draco's taunting comments and nonchalant manner indicates he knows who is behind the attack.

During the school year, he is turned into a ferret by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Alastor Moody]] for attempting to attack Harry when his back is turned. Draco is rescued by Professor McGonagall. He also passes spiteful information about Harry and his friends to the disreputable journalist, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], who is also an unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]].

Draco attends the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] as his date. Pansy has apparently had a crush on Draco for some time, though his feelings for her are unknown.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Draco is appointed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], along with Pansy Parkinson, for Slytherin House. Hermione reports that he is beastly towards the First Years, clearly abusing his Prefect's powers.

As they travel from the train station to Hogwarts castle, Draco and his sidekicks ride in a horse-less carriage with Pansy Parkinson.

Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle are laughing about something as they arrive at Care of Magical Creatures class. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]], who is substituting for the absent Hagrid, asks if anyone can identify some creatures, Hermione raises her hand, prompting Draco to mimic her. Pansy shrieks with laughter, then screams as the little bundles of twigs on the table jump up, revealing themselves to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bowtruckle|Bowtruckles]]. As he collects a Bowtruckle, Draco suggests to Harry that Hagrid could have run into something too ''big'' for him and gotten hurt. Although we are yet to realize it, and Harry never seems to draw the connection himself, this indicates that Draco knows something about Hagrid's secret mission for Dumbledore.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] is evaluating the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures class]] taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] during Hagrid's absence, Malfoy claims he was slashed by a Hippogriff. When Hagrid returns to Hogwarts, he tells his class they will be working in the Forbidden Forest. Draco seems scared, needing reassurance that the creatures they will be looking at are properly trained. He is hardly reassured by Hagrid's injured appearance.

Educational Decree Number Twenty Four banning all unauthorized school organizations is published, and Draco boasts that the Slytherin Quidditch team was reformed almost automatically, given his father's influence within the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. He implies that Harry will be sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], where there is a special ward for the incurably insane. Hearing this, Neville tries to attack Draco, but Harry and Ron restrain him.

During Harry's secret [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] session, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] suddenly arrives to warn Harry that Umbridge has found out and is on her way. Harry orders D.A. members to run, then heads for a bathroom where Draco, concealed, catches him with a Trip Jinx. Umbridge, arriving, awards Slytherin house fifty points, and sends Draco to search for the other D.A. members. Harry is dragged to the Headmaster's Office, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], and also Dumbledore, are waiting. Umbridge reports that Draco has caught &quot;the Potter boy.&quot; Fudge responds he will inform Lucius Malfoy.

After Umbridge ousts Dumbledore as Headmaster and assumes command, Draco is appointed to her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Inquisitorial Squad|Inquisitorial Squad]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] and Pansy Parkinson. The Inquisitorial Squad has been given unrestricted power to deduct points from all Houses; Draco is quick to abuse his authority.

Shortly afterwards, Professor Umbridge sends Draco to get Snape's assistance in extracting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]], an Inquisitorial Squad member who has been missing for some time, from a toilet. Draco interrupts Harry and Snape during an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency lesson]]. Draco is intrigued and amused when Snape, to cover what they are actually doing, explains that Harry is taking remedial [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]].

As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL exams]] approach, Draco loudly proclaims that one's OWL marks are due more to ''who'' you know rather than ''what'' you know, and mentions that his father is close friends with Griselda Marchbanks, head of the Wizarding Examination Authority. Neville whispers to Harry and Ron that Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother's]], and she has never mentioned the Malfoy family.

In Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL exam]], his examiner, Professor Tofty, greets him as, &quot;the famous Harry Potter?&quot; Draco, overhearing, glares malevolently at Harry, as the wine glass he is levitating falls and smashes.

Umbridge catches Harry using her office fireplace as he frantically attempts to contact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who may be in peril at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. Two Inquisitorial Squad members, Draco and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Millicent Bullstrode|Millicent Bulstrode]], accompany her. Draco and Umbridge restrain Harry, while Millicent captures Hermione. When Harry refuses to reveal who he was contacting, Umbridge orders Draco to fetch Snape; Hermione suddenly &quot;confesses&quot; that they were trying to contact Professor Dumbledore about the secret weapon he had them build. Umbridge demands Hermione lead her to it. Draco suggests he should go along, to which Hermione readily agrees is a good idea; suspicious, and over Draco's protests, Umbridge declares that only Hermione and Harry will go. The other DA members who were also caught, escape the Inquisitorial Squad, aided by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bat Bogey Hex|Bat Bogey jinx]] cast at Draco.

When Harry returns to Hogwarts after the battle at the Ministry, Draco, with Crabbe and Goyle, threatens retaliation for his father, Lucius, having been sentenced to Azkaban prison. Snape's arrival ends the duel before any spells are cast.

Aboard the homeward-bound Hogwarts Express, Draco tries to jinx Harry, but D.A. members arrive in time and, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle are jinxed until they look like gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin]] leave the three in the luggage rack.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Throughout this book, Draco is almost always in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], with the exception of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn's]] party, which he accidentally crashes, where Harry later overhears Snape and Draco arguing.

Later, Harry finds Draco sobbing in the boys bathroom. Apparently he has been trying to do something but it is not going well, and he deeply fears what will happen to him and his family should he fail. Catching Harry's reflection in the mirror, Draco spins and fires curses at him. Harry, defending himself, uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]], an unknown curse he found in the Half-Blood Prince's textbook, with only the notation, &quot;For enemies&quot;. Draco nearly dies from blood loss, but is saved by Snape's timely arrival.

Draco has been tasked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] to murder Professor Dumbledore. When Draco traps the professor atop the Astronomy Tower, he is unable to carry out Voldemort's orders. As he is about to lower his wand and accept Dumbledore's help, other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], who have invaded Hogwarts with Draco's help, find him and Dumbledore. Snape also arrives, and, as Harry helplessly watches from under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], Snape casts a lethal curse at Dumbledore. Draco is last seen being towed by Snape as he, and the other Death Eaters, escape Hogwarts.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry, Hermione, and Ron escape two Death Eaters at an all-night café on Tottenham Court Road, altering their memories so they are unable to remember who they nearly captured. The Trio then hide out at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. Shortly after their arrival, Voldemort's rage once again drags Harry into his mind, and he watches the Death Eater, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]], being tortured for failing to catch Harry. Harry is dismayed that it is a sick-looking Draco who is forced to do the torturing.

Snatchers, led by the werewolf, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]], apprehend the Trio, but Harry's magically altered face, makes it difficult to recognize him. At Malfoy Manor, Lucius calls on Draco to identify Harry. Possibly misled by Harry's swollen face, Draco balks at making a definitive identification, though he may be protecting him. Narcissa Malfoy, however, recognizes Hermione, and is about to summon Voldemort when Bellatrix halts her. After confining the others to the cellars, Bellatrix tortures Hermione for information about the Sword of Gryffindor. When Hermione says it is a fake, Lucius has Draco fetch the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] to verify its authenticity. As Draco leaves the cellar, Dobby Apparates in.

When Harry and Ron escape the cellar, Ron, armed with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew's]] wand, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Disarms]] Bellatrix, but is forced to surrender his wand when Bellatrix holds a knife to Hermione's throat. Draco collects the fallen wands, but after Dobby drops the chandelier on Bellatrix, Harry physically wrests all three wands (Bellatrix', Pettigrew's, and Draco's) from Draco's hand before he and Dobby escape, though Dobby is killed.

Surprisingly, when Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle corner Harry in the Room of Requirement, it is not Draco, but Crabbe and Goyle who talk the most. Draco demands Harry return his wand, though Harry refuses. When Crabbe starts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Descendo|knocking piles of junk over]], Draco stops him, saying if they destroy the room, they may be unable to find the Diadem. When Crabbe sets the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]], Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape on brooms; Harry circles back to save Draco and Goyle, but Crabbe is lost.

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione are making their way under the Invisibility Cloak to the Shrieking Shack, they pass Draco, who is pleading with a Death Eater not to jinx him, that he is on their side. Harry Stuns the Death Eater, and Ron punches Draco, saying that is twice they have saved his life, and calling him two-faced.

Facing Voldemort in the Great Hall, Harry tells him that, even though Voldemort holds the Elder Wand, he does not command it. The wand owes its allegiance to the one who forcefully removed it from its previous master; and as Snape had not taken it from Dumbledore, Snape was never its master. Instead, it was Draco who had Disarmed Dumbledore; and Draco, in turn, had been Disarmed by Harry weeks earlier. The wand Harry won from Draco was now in his hand. Now the issue is: does the Elder Wand sense that Draco was disarmed? If so, then Harry is now the Elder Wand's master.

In the Epilogue, we see Draco, who acknowledges Harry with a nod, with his wife and son, Scorpius. Draco's hairline is receding slightly, which makes his already-pointed chin appear somewhat sharper.

== Strengths ==

Draco is intelligent, magically proficient, and grows into a strong wizard; his father introduced him early on to some Dark Arts magic that most young wizards his age rarely see or even know about. This has given him some advantages that other wizards lack. Like most in his family, Draco was sorted into Slytherin House where he is favored by Professor Snape, a powerful wizard at Hogwarts and head of Slytherin

Draco's family is particularly wealthy and influential, and while Draco himself never directly influences the Ministry or other wizard institutions, he does benefit from it through his father, and has some indirect affect as well. His family's wealth and influence has probably helped him garner his supporters/thug companions, Crabbe and Goyle.

Draco's greatest strength may be that he has developed rather differently from his family, lacking their Dark, evil nature. This does, at times, cause him great personal anguish and he believes himself a failure when he is unable to fully act as Lord Voldemort's agent. It is, however, Draco's innate morality that rules his behavior. While Draco never consciously betrays his family, his actions late in the series saves others' lives, as well as his own soul, and shows he is capable of remorse and redemption. And though he will always embody traditional Slytherin characteristics, Draco learns much from his family's misdeeds, likely retaining a moral nature and becoming a far better person than his wicked relatives.

== Weaknesses ==

Rather than developing his own unique personality traits and abilities, Draco's character is almost entirely formed and sustained by his family's wealth and reputation, as well as by his followers. When accompanied by his enforcers, Crabbe and Goyle, he struts and acts the bully; but as early as flying lessons in the first book, we see that he is effectively lost without their presence. Confronted on his own by Harry, who is astride a broom for the first time, Draco retreats with dishonour. Having challenged Harry to a duel, rather than keeping the appointment, Draco instead tips off Filch that students will be out after hours. Even with Crabbe and Goyle in attendance, his courage is lacking. When Hermione slaps him, the three simply retreat. This weak resolve remains throughout the series, and in the battle at Hogwarts, late in the final book, we see Draco pleading for his life.

In fact, Draco, at least through the first five books, is entirely without honour. He is the epitome of Slytherin's belief, &quot;using any means to achieve their ends,&quot; as the Sorting Hat says.

By the sixth book, Draco's bullying persona starts eroding after Voldemort appoints him to perform an unspeakable task. A more vulnerable side to his personality is exposed as he agonizes over obeying Voldemort's orders, knowing it involves an act he is incapable of performing, but that he must accomplish to protect his family. In the seventh book, Draco shows there are even more limits to what he can or will do. While we see that he still lacks a forceful enough character to resist being manipulated, his youth, inexperience, subordination to his family's strong authority, and fear of Voldemort are contributing factors to his behavior. In particular, Harry sees Draco's revulsion at being forced to torture the Death Eater, Rowle, and we witness Draco's reluctance to identify Harry after his capture, knowing that if he does, Voldemort will promptly murder him. In both cases, even though Draco resists, he is unable to prevent himself from being exploited, mostly because he fears for his and his family's lives.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Malfoy's greatest nemesis is Harry Potter, who he despises for being a Half-Blood and because he was instrumental in Lord Voldemort's downfall. He was insulted when Harry spurned his offer of friendship after their first meeting, Harry preferring Ron Weasley's company over his. Draco also resents Harry's fame and may be jealous over his greater power as a wizard. Draco equally despises Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Hermione because she is Muggle-born and a superior student, and Ron, who, despite being a pure-blood wizard, is poor, and whose family dares to advocate Half-blood and Muggle-born wizards as equals to pure bloods, and that Muggles also have rights.    

Draco lacks true friends, even among his fellow Slytherins, but his two cronies, Crabbe and Goyle, who Draco treats as minions, continually trail him about, following his orders. He does, however, appear to have emotional connections with the two, as he is upset when Crabbe is killed, and he tries his best to keep Goyle alive. Crabbe, Goyle, and others who gravitate to Draco, mainly seem attracted to his family's wealth and status. Draco generally considers most students outside Slytherin as inferior. This attitude also extends to many Hogwarts teachers and staff, though he apparently admires Professor Snape, while considering Professor Dumbledore foolish and ineffectual.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] overhears Draco boasting about an important mission the Dark Lord has assigned him. When Harry mentions it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], she erroneously believes Draco was merely trying to impress [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]].

Pansy is Draco's date at the Yule Ball, in book 4, and she is often seen in close proximity to him, but it appears that their relationship never develops into anything serious or that Draco has any romantic interest in her during the series. Pansy, however, always seems intent on pursuing Draco, possibly, like others, attracted to his family name and wealth.

Draco is always respectful and obedient to his parents, particularly his father, who Draco loves and admires, but also fears. Draco also deeply loves his mother, though he seems unable to openly express it. Being an only child and a son, both his parents apparently have high expectations that he will continue the Malfoy legacy, upholding its traditions, and remaining loyal to the Dark Lord and his pure-blood ethos.

Bellatrix Black Lestrange, Narcissa Malfoy's sister, is Draco's aunt. Their relationship never seems particularly close, though Bellatrix is surprisingly impressed that Draco has shown an eagerness to take on Voldemort's secret mission; she has also tutored Draco in Occlumency, possibly to block Snape, who she never trusts, from reading Draco's mind and learning more details about the Dark Lord's plans. Bellatrix goads Snape into making an unbreakable vow with Narcissa to aid Draco should he fail to complete the Dark Lord's task, though she seems more motivated to ensure the mission's success rather than protect her nephew.

According to Narcissa Malfoy, Professor Snape is Draco's favourite teacher. It also seems that Draco is Snape's favourite student, though his connection to the wealthy and influential Malfoy family appears to have much to do with that. Later in the series, Snape actually secretly works with Dumbledore to protect Draco, knowing it is Voldemort's intent to kill the boy solely to punish Lucius Malfoy for his failure to retrieve a prophecy. Draco resists Snape's help, however, believing it will only further endanger his family, and perhaps having come to distrust him as much as his Aunt Bellatrix does. When Snape escapes following the battle at Hogwarts, he forces Draco to go with him, perhaps fearing Draco's life will be in danger if he remains behind.    

Also, though they never speak throughout the entire series, Draco is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks']] first cousin through their mothers, Narcissa and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]], who are sisters. Due to Andromeda's marrying the Muggle-born wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], she has been disowned by her family, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|the Blacks]]. Neither Andromeda nor the Black family cares to acknowledge the relationship. Only Sirius Black, Andromeda's cousin who also has been disowned by the Blacks, has any contact with the Tonks family.

== Analysis ==

Rowling uses Draco in the series as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter's]] enemy and also as a contrast to his personality. Pure blood, 'evil', Slytherin, Death Eater: these characteristics show how Draco differs from Harry. It is interesting to note, however, how Draco gradually becomes a better person as the series progresses.

We note in the Loyalty part of the headnote that Draco was loyal to his family. While Draco quite obviously reveled in the feeling of superiority that his ancestry brought him, and so would seem to be aligned with Voldemort who was espousing that belief, we can also see that Draco has little stomach for Voldemort's methods. His adherence to the Death Eater organizational ideals was quite possibly driven by his family.

=== First Five Books ===

Through the first five books, Draco's behaviour is consistent. Apparently the archetypal Slytherin, Draco uses any means, fair or foul, to get ahead. He apparently bribes his way into being the new Slytherin Quidditch Seeker when his father donates expensive brooms to the team. He consistently belittles students in other Houses, particularly Harry, Ron, and Hermione. He seems supremely self-confident, quite clearly believing that his father's wealth and his Pure-blood status will get him anything he wants, rather than acheiving it by his own talents and abilities. And we see also that he has surrounded himself with sycophants (notably Pansy Parkinson) and hired muscle, (Crabbe and Goyle, who are presumably paid in status). Taking a leaf from Slytherin's book, Draco especially belittles Muggle-borns (like Hermione), whose parents have no magical ability, and half-bloods (like Harry), born of wizards or witches who were Muggle offspring, or those who profess to like Muggles (such as the Weasley family). Like most bullies, Draco immediately backs down when faced with a superior force. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], Draco's over-bearing father [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] is equally belittling to his own son, causing Draco, who fears his father, to merely take it, having no other choice. Additionally, Hermione, goaded beyond her limits, slaps Draco, whereupon he and his thugs rapidly depart. We quickly see that Draco has largely been moulded into his father's image. Draco is, of course, chastened when his father is removed from the Board of Governors of Hogwarts, but he recovers. One supposes he has rationalized to himself that this is only a mistake that will be rectified shortly after the Board realizes their error. However, Lucius' arrest in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] severely affects Draco. Initially, he retains his arrogance, blaming Harry for his father being arrested, which is, in Draco's view, an inversion of how things should work: being a Pure-Blood, Lucius should be proof against any efforts by Muggle-borns or Muggle lovers, and here he clearly was not. However, that Lucius remains imprisoned must have some effect on Draco.

=== ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' ===

Draco faces difficult problems he may be unable to solve by himself. We suspect he has become a Death Eater, as he seems protective, almost obsessively, about where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] would have been placed on him, but this is never fully confirmed, as he never reveals the Mark. While he exhibits the same arrogance, we start seeing cracks in his armour. In the Potions class he takes with Harry, he no longer needles Harry. Instead, he has been commiserating with Moaning Myrtle about something he is trying to unsuccessfully do. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|the end of the book]], he quite clearly has been burdened with performing several secret tasks; one, murdering Dumbledore, is something that he is unable to carry out. His prevarication when faced with this seems alien to the person we previously believed Draco to be. His mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], of course, understands her son well, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|early in the book]], she is expressing her fear to Snape that Draco will fail and be punished for that failure.

=== ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' ===

The Dark Lord better understood Draco than we did in the previous book. Voldemort deliberately set up Draco to fail in the tasks he assigned him, solely as a means to punish Draco's family for their earlier failures to carry out Voldemort's commands. Voldemort knows Draco's basic weakness is what we recognize as the remaining core of his humanity. Several views of Draco and his family show us that, despite what was seen in the earlier books, Draco, though despicable, is not inherently evil. He is forced to torture a Death Eater who has failed Voldemort, and Harry sees, through Voldemort's eyes, Draco's revulsion at having to perform this task. When Harry is captured and brought to Malfoy Manor, Draco knows that if he identifies Harry, Harry, along with Ron and Hermione, will be murdered, causing Draco to balk at confirming his identity.

Later, Draco, with Crabbe and Goyle, remains at Hogwarts after the other Slytherins are evacuated before the Battle of Hogwarts, apparently to try and capture Harry for Voldemort. He may believe this could restore Voldemort's favour to him and his family. Draco's bullying nature does seem more pronounced whenever he is within Hogwarts' halls, far from his father's authority, and where he has Crabbe and Goyle's support. However, during the battle, Draco seems more concerned with preserving his own hide rather than attacking either side in the fight.

It appears that Draco never has a realization about which side he is actually on, nor does he experience an epiphany about the Dark side's true nature or that it will eventually lead everything to death and destruction. It seems unlikely he will arrive at that conclusion after the series end. Draco believes in the same sentiments as most Death Eaters, and obediently follows his father, but he balks at employing their methods, thus never fully embracing either side. Almost a prototypical Slytherin, Draco's allegiance seems ruled by whatever potential there is for personal gain. He will likely work alongside whatever side is poised to win. His selecting the main chance in this manner, however, does tend to prevent him from weighing the relative outcomes in any sense larger than his own personal future.

# Will Malfoy have a point of redemption, a point of realization that Voldemort's path only leads to destruction and death?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although he loves his father, Draco fears him and what might happen if he should disobey or displease him in any way. His greatest vulnerability is his love for his parents, and theirs is their love for him. While he strives to emulate Voldemort, the main difference between them is that Draco does know love, that of his mother, and to a lesser extent, his father's. Draco has grown up in a sheltered family with a mother who showered him with care packages during his first year at Hogwarts, and a father who would wreak havoc on anyone who hurt him. But we note from the few interactions that we see between Draco and Lucius that there is a definite bullying aspect to their relationship. It would appear that Draco grew up in an abusive home, constantly surrounded by verbal (if not physical) violence and isolation. This aspect is often overlooked, as people will always stereotype Draco as the &quot;bad guy,&quot; but people never begin to look into why he acts this way.

Draco is also unable to kill. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|the sixth book]], Voldemort has ordered him to murder Professor Dumbledore. However, when the opportunity finally arises, Draco, torn and distraught, hesitates and is talked down by the professor. Additionally, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 23|the seventh book]], he is told to identify Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and again he balks, giving an ambiguous answer, even when his father demands a definitive one. Both cases show that Draco has scruples and possesses an underlying humanity that prevents him performing immoral acts. Dumbledore recognized this humanity within Draco, and knowing that committing murder would destroy Draco's soul, he and Snape devised a plan to protect him. 

It appears that Draco's hatred for Harry subsides later in life, and, in the epilogue, he acknowledges Harry with a polite nod at the train station, seeing their children off to Hogwarts.

== Overview ==

'''''Ginevra &quot;Ginny&quot; Molly Weasley''''' is the only daughter and youngest child of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]. She is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor]] and is the sister of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. She is one year younger than both Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]].

The author has said that Ginny's birthday is 11 August 1981, which actually makes her almost exactly one year younger than Harry (whose birthday is 31 July 1980) and 17 months younger than Ron (whose birthday is 1 March 1980).

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Ginny has two brief cameos in the book, first when Harry boards the Hogwarts Express and secondly when he returns. Her interest in Harry is established.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Ginny's ongoing crush on Harry is evident. When Harry arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]], she promptly runs and hides. As Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] head upstairs, they briefly glimpse Ginny in her room before she shuts the door, causing Ron to remark that she is usually quite outgoing. Later, when Harry enters the kitchen for breakfast, Ginny promptly spills her porridge. When Harry speaks directly to her, she blushes furiously and puts her elbow in the butter dish, which only Harry notices. 

At Flourish &amp; Blotts' bookstore in Diagon Alley, Ginny hangs back as everyone else lines up to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]; Harry, mortally embarrassed after Lockhart ruthlessly exploits him for publicity, puts the books Lockhart gave him into Ginny's cauldron. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] appears, harrassing Harry and claiming he revels in the publicity. When Ginny defends him, Draco mockingly suggests Harry now has a girlfriend. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], Draco's father, appears, and perusing Ginny's second-hand text books, disparages their quality, then returns them to her cauldron.

Ginny makes appearances throughout the book, always appearing ill at ease. This is particularly noticeable on February 14th. Professor Lockhart has employed dwarfs to deliver Valentines around the school; one tackles Harry to deliver a Valentine poem apparently sent by Ginny. In the process, the contents in his book bag spills to the floor, including a book titled, the Very Secret Diary; Draco picks it up, though Harry and Ron reclaim it. Ginny runs off, however, apparently quite upset; we are led to believe it is solely because she was embarrassed by the Valentine poem.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] announces at breakfast that the victims petrified by the Chamber of Secrets monster will soon be revived, Ginny approaches Harry and Ron to tell them something, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] suddenly appears and dismissively interrupts her, upsetting Ginny enough that she runs off. With information provided by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], Harry and Ron learn that the monster is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. From talking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]], a giant spider, they surmise that the Chamber's entrance is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s bathroom. As they are about to report their findings to Professor McGonagall, they overhear that Ginny has been taken into the Chamber of Secrets.

Harry and Ron, with Lockhart's forced assistance, locate and enter the Chamber of Secrets to rescue Ginny; Lockhart's attempt to magically erase their memories with Ron's damaged wand results in the cave's ceiling falling in, stranding Harry. He heads for the Chamber, finding an unconscious and rapidly failing Ginny, and a somewhat ghostly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]. Riddle explains that he used his diary to ensnare Ginny, forcing her to open the Chamber of Secrets and release the monster. Now he is draining her life force to restore himself. Riddle also reveals he is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. Harry kills the monster, then destroys the diary, causing Riddle's simulacrum to vanish and restoring Ginny to consciousness. Together with Ron and Lockhart, they return to the surface. Ginny is reunited with her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|father]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|mother]], while Harry explains to everyone that she was controlled by Voldemort.

With [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby's]] help, Harry realizes it was Lucius Malfoy who dropped Riddle's diary into Ginny's cauldron at Flourish &amp; Blotts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] sternly warns Lucius that if any additional Riddle possessions should appear, Arthur Weasley can trace them.

Finally, on the Hogwarts Express homewards, Ginny reveals the reason Percy prevented her from speaking to Ron and Harry earlier was because Percy knew she had seen him kissing his girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, and thought Ginny was about to tell Harry and Ron.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Ginny's role is largely relegated to the background. She is at the Leaky Cauldron when Harry meets up with the Weasleys and Hermione to prepare for school. Ron shoos her away in the Hogwarts Express so that he, Harry, and Hermione can have a private conversation. When the train is inspected by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], Ginny makes her way back to the Trio's compartment, as does [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]; she is present when Harry faints. She herself is adversely effected by the Dementors' presence, though not as severely as Harry; this is most likely because of the remembered trauma of her being possessed by Voldemort.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Ginny is present at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] when Harry arrives, shortly after Mr. Weasley berates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] for dropping a Ton-Tongue Toffee in front of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley Dursley]], giving him a four-foot-long tongue. Soon after, Ron tells Harry that it was Ginny who named his owl [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]].

Ginny attends the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Percy, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], and Mr. Weasley. Ginny and Hermione complain about having to get up so early, but Mr. Weasley notes that a hundred thousand wizards attending an event creates huge logistical problems; attendees with cheaper tickets have to arrive early and remain the entire time. When the Muggle campsite owner has to constantly have his memory charmed, Ginny remarks that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], head of Magical Games and Sports, ought to know better than to wander around in his Beater's robes.

After the match, Death Eaters riot through the campsite. Mr. Weasley sends the younger Weasleys, plus Harry and Hermione, into the nearby woods for safety, though Ginny and the Twins become separated from the others. When the riots are quelled, the three return to their tents, unharmed

Just before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], we see Ginny comforting a distraught Ron, whose invitation to the ball was rejected by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]. After hearing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] similarly declined Harry's invitation, Ron suggests that he can take Hermione and Harry can go with Ginny. But the girls are already attending with someone else. Ginny goes with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], who repeatedly steps on her feet while they are dancing. Hermione is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum's]] date. While at the Yule Ball, Ginny meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]], and they start dating shortly after.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Ginny plays a much larger role in this book and re-enters our story at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|the Order of the Phoenix headquarters]]. Shortly after Harry arrives and has vented his frustrations on Ron and Hermione, they are joined by Fred, George, and Ginny. They inform Harry that Percy has fallen out with the family. After dinner, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] proposes that Harry be briefed on the Order of the Phoenix's current operations; Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George are allowed to listen in, but Ginny, loudly protesting, is unceremoniously bundled off to bed.

We see Ginny in passing a few times during the next few days. She is roped in to help make Grimmauld Place habitable again, removing and destroying Dark artifacts and materials, and ridding magical pest infestations. She joins the victory celebration after Harry returns, exonerated, from his hearing, and is present at Ron and Hermione's celebration for becoming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]].

When Fred and George charm their school trunks to fly downstairs, the luggage evidently injures Ginny, though she is healed by the time they leave for the train. Once aboard, Fred and George depart to talk with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], and Ron and Hermione report to the Prefects' carriage, leaving Harry and Ginny to share a compartment with Neville Longbottom and a Ravenclaw girl Ginny introduces as, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. Apart from cleaning up the compartment after Neville showers everyone with Stinksap, Ginny plays little further part until the school year is underway.

Ginny is among the 28 students (Harry, Ron, Hermione, and 25 others) who attend the first meeting of what is to become [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|the Hog's Head]]. Afterwards, Hermione remarks that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]] likely came only because Ginny did. She says Ginny gave up on Harry; meeting Michael at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], they started dating soon after. Ron decides he dislikes Michael Corner.

After Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four is posted, Ginny fears that the DA may be unable to meet, but Harry reassures her it will continue as planned. She leaves to tell Michael Corner, and, through him, the Ravenclaw members, about the DA. At the first meeting in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], Hermione suggests naming the group; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] suggests the Defence Association (the DA for short); Ginny counters with Dumbledore's Army, saying it has the same initials and represents the worst fears of the Ministry of Magic, who foisted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] on them as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Her suggestion passes unanimously.

After Umbridge bans Harry, Fred, and George from playing Quidditch, Ginny replaces Harry as Seeker.

When Harry has a vision that Mr. Weasley was attacked by a snake, Dumbledore sends Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Ginny to Grimmauld Place by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]]. There, the Weasley children demand to see their father immediately, but Sirius insists it is too dangerous and orders them to wait until their mother returns. They await anxiously until Molly Weasley sends word that Mr. Weasley will survive.

At the hospital, Harry and Ginny eavesdrop on Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] using the Twins' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]]. After Moody suggests Harry may be possessed by Voldemort, Harry isolates himself, believing he is endangering the others. Hermione drags Harry from seclusion, forcing him to talk with her and the others. Ginny, who actually was possessed by Voldemort, draws upon her own experience, saying if there are no big gaps in Harry's memory, then he has not been possessed, greatly relieving Harry.

While visiting Mr. Weasley on Christmas Day, Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione head to the tea shop. Along the way they are spotted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], who is still a patient. While visiting Gilderoy, they also see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Broderick Bode]], who is still uable to speak. They also run into Neville and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|his grandmother]], who are visiting Neville's parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]]. Neville is horribly embarrassed that they have seen his parents, who were tortured into insanity by Death Eaters.

It is close to Gryffindor's match against Hufflepuff, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]], Gryffindor's Quidditch captain, is extremely unhappy with how her team is shaping up, especially [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andrew Kirke|Kirke]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Jack Sloper|Sloper]], the two beaters who replaced Fred and George. Ginny apparently flies extremely well, and Hermione explains that Ginny had been breaking into the Weasley broom cupboard for years, flying all their brooms. Despite the beaters' poor quality, Gryffindor keeps their losses to only ten points when Ginny catches the Snitch.

Just before Spring Break, Harry views [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape's]] memory that is stored in Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. This memory is so disturbing that it permanently dispels Harry's idealized vision of his father, James; to avoid discussing it with anyone, he attributes his brooding to his recent breakup with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]]. Ginny suggests he talk to Cho, but Harry says he would rather speak to Sirius, which is impossible; the only way is via the one unmonitored fireplace in Umbridge's office. Ginny says the Twins have left her believing that nothing is impossible. Shortly, the Twins tell Harry they are planning a diversion, and suggest he use that time to get into Umbridge's office to chat with Sirius.

Harry experiences a vision that Sirius is being tortured by Voldemort and wants to contact Grimmauld Place to verify if Sirius is safe. Overhearing the Trio discussing this, Ginny, along with Luna Lovegood, volunteers their help, guarding Umbridge's door and creating a diversion while Harry contacts Sirius with the Floo Network. Umbridge is undeceived, however, and Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville are captured by Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad. Hermione fools Umbridge into believing a weapon is hidden in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Ginny and the others are left under guard in Umbridge's office while Umbridge takes Harry and Hermione to investigate. 

After applying a well-executed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bat Bogey Hex|Bat-Bogey hex]] to disable Draco Malfoy, Ginny, along with Ron, Luna, and Neville escape and find Harry and Hermione. Luna suggests flying to the Ministry on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] to save Sirius. Ginny is unsure about riding something invisible to her, but gamely accompanies Harry and the others to London. Ambushed by Death Eaters, she, Luna, and Ron become separated from Harry, Hermione and Neville. The two groups re-unite in the antechamber; Ginny apparently suffers a broken ankle, and has to be carried into the Brain Room when the Death Eaters find them. There, she is hit by an apparent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun spell]] and plays no further part in the battle.

Harry visits Ron, Hermione, and Ginny in the Hospital wing. Ginny apparently is nearly recovered, but Ron and Hermione need more time to heal. Luna and Neville are also visiting; Umbridge is also present, recovering from her sojourn among the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]]. The group can barely stiffle giggles when Ron makes clip-clop sounds similar to horse hooves, causing the traumatized woman to bolt upright up in bed, looking around wildly.

On the Hogwarts Express home, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny share a compartment. When Cho Chang walks past, Hermione tentatively mentions that Cho is now dating Michael Corner. Ron is surprised, but Ginny explains that when she caught the Snitch in the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, Michael comforted Cho rather than celebrating with Ginny, so she dumped him. When Ron suggests, glancing furtively at Harry, that she can now choose someone better, Ginny announces she is dating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]]. Ron seems somewhat distressed by this revelation.

Ginny enters our story shortly after Harry arrives at The Burrow late at night. The next morning, after Ron and Hermione awaken Harry, Ginny slouches in, complaining about ''her''. This mysterious female is quickly identified when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] appears with Harry's breakfast, followed by a vexed Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, feeling Fleur is far too full of herself, has nicknamed her &quot;Phlegm&quot;. Mrs. Weasley hopes Bill will instead become interested in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], but everyone agrees, that particularly with Tonks seeming depression since the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|events at the end of the previous school year]], there is little chance she will succeed.

Ginny and the others purchase school supplies at Diagon Alley. When they visit Fred and George's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|joke shop]], the Twins grill Ginny about her boyfriends, but she characteristically refuses to discuss it. Captivated by a Pygmy Puff (possibly a variant of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Puffskein|Puffskein]]), she purchases one, naming it Arnold.

On the Hogwarts Express, we find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] has revived his &quot;Slug Club&quot;, and invites Harry to lunch. Arriving in Slughorn's compartment, Harry is somewhat surprised to find Ginny there, particularly as the other students Slughorn introduces are all related to or connected with famous witches and wizards. But after seeing Ginny casting a particularly impressive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bat Bogey Hex|Bat-Bogey Hex]], Slughorn invited her. Harry has been invited for obvious reasons, and Neville because of the prominence of his parents in the wizarding community. Slughorn asks Harry about the battle at the Ministry, seemingly unaware that Neville and Ginny were also involved. Harry, Neville, and Ginny are unwilling to talk about that battle, much to Slughorn's disappointment.

In Potions class, Harry is given an old textbook he discovers contains many revisions to standard formulas. Following these instructions, he excels in his first lesson. Harry whiffs a flowery aroma in the love potion, which he later recognizes as Ginny's scent. Later, Ginny, passing by, nervously asks if he is being given instructions by a book. Harry recalls Tom Riddle's Diary from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|four years before]]. Hermione also apparently remembers, and immediately tests the book for any Dark magic, but finds nothing. When putting the book away in his bag however, Harry notices a small notation written inside the cover saying that the book belongs to The Half-Blood Prince.

Harry, as team captain, holds Quidditch tryouts. Ginny is selected as a Chaser, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Demelza Robins|Demelza Robins]].

Just before the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] weekend, Ginny delivers a note to Harry from Dumbledore, setting a time for their next lesson. She mentions that she may see him in Hogsmeade; she is going with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]].

After Katie Bell falls afoul of a jinxed necklace, Harry recruits Dean to replace her on the Quidditch team. At the first practice, Ron, bothered by Ginny and Dean's relationship and suffering from nerves in general, plays horribly; Dean, Ginny, and Demelza play very well, though, and Harry compliments them. As they return to the common room, Harry and Ron discover Ginny and Dean kissing in an alcove; Ron is furious, while Harry feels extremely jealous and briefly thinks about cursing Dean, though he contains it. Ginny scorns Ron, saying he is only upset because he has never snogged anyone, then storms off. It is at this point that Harry begins to fully realize his feelings for Ginny, and agonizes over them.

At the following Quidditch match, the announcer, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]], criticizes Harry for choosing Ginny and Ron as team members, but subsides after Ron blocks every play coming his way, and Ginny scores four of the six goals against Slytherin. At the match's end, which Harry wins by distracting the Slytherin Seeker and catching the Snitch, Ginny &quot;forgets to brake&quot; while swooping in for the victory celebration, and smashes into the announcer's podium, sending Smith crashing to the ground.

While talking to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], she tells Harry that Ginny has been defending her, stopping people from calling her &quot;Loony&quot;.

When Harry and Ron are at The Burrow for Christmas, Fred and George tease Ron after learning from Ginny about his relationship with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] unexpectedly stops by with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]] on the pretense of visiting the family. However, it is only a ruse so Scrimgeour can try to recruit Harry as a Ministry pawn; Ginny, Fred, and George all claim credit for throwing parsnips that hastened Percy's departure.

On their return to Hogwarts, Ginny seems unenthusiastic as she mentions that she promised to meet Dean, somewhat encouraging Harry in his feelings. However, he remembers Ron's reaction to his discovering Ginny's relationship with Dean, and fears if he does act, Ron will become his enemy, possibly forever.

Ginny is, of course, at Ron's bedside as he is recovering from being poisoned on his birthday.

Harry is injured in the next Quidditch match when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen]], demonstrating how to correctly use a Beater's bat, slams the Bludger straight at Harry, hitting him. When Harry leaves the Hospital Wing, Hermione tells him that Dean and Ginny had a fight because Dean thought Harry being hit was funny. Harry tries to hide his elation that Ginny and Dean's relationship may have hit a rough spot, but Hermione, he thinks, may have noticed his interest.

Hermione suggests Harry use his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]] to help him obtain a memory from Slughorn that Dumbledore wants. Harry is initially reluctant; he had been saving the potion for some vaguely defined purpose, something to do with Ginny and Dean breaking up. Eventually, he does take some, and, hidden under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], heads out through the portrait hole, slightly brushing against Ginny as she enters with Dean. Ginny rounds on Dean for helping her when she does not need it.

By the following morning, Ginny and Dean have broken up. While this opens an opportunity for Harry, it also creates a problem: can Dean and Ginny play on the same team if they are at daggers drawn? Luckily, Katie Bell returns from St. Mungo's that same day. With McLaggen gone and Katie back, Quidditch is much more fun. Ginny, in particular, is the life of the team, pulling stunts and cracking jokes. Harry is glad to have the opportunity to interact with her, but still fears Ron's reaction if he starts dating his sister.

When Harry receives detention for injuring Draco, serving Saturdays with Snape, Ginny fills in as Seeker, while Dean takes over as Chaser; Harry apparently feels that their animosity will not be a major factor. Despite the horrible showing in the game where Harry was injured, they still have a chance at the Quidditch Cup: they have to win by more than 300 points, however. Returning from detention on the day of the Quidditch final, Harry walks into a celebration: they have won the Cup. Ginny, seeing him enter, runs into Harry's arms, and he kisses her; afterwards, Harry sees Hermione's approval, and, more importantly, that Ron is accepting. 

Ginny and Harry are happy together, and Harry is delighted that people are now discussing something about him that actually makes him happy, rather than about Dark magic. His Potions work is suffering since he hid his old textbook, but Slughorn attributes that to his blooming romance with Ginny.

During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|battle under the Astronomy tower]], Harry sees Ginny fighting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] and rushes to her aid. After the battle has ended, it is Ginny who leads Harry away from Dumbledore's body and to the Hospital Wing, where he reports to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]]. Ginny, with Ron and Neville, had been watching the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]; when Draco emerged, he threw [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|something]], causing everything to go dark. Because Ginny and Ron had taken some of Harry's Felix Felicis potion, they were unhurt. Luckily, they ran into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who discovered the Death Eaters under the Astronomy Tower and alerted the other Order members.

Harry and Ginny spend all their free time together. They sit together at Dumbledore's funeral, but once it ends, Harry tells Ginny they must separate. Voldemort attacks people through those they love, and Harry refuses to risk putting Ginny in danger. Ginny is heartbroken, but understanding.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Only Ginny and Mrs. Weasley are at The Burrow when Harry arrives following his escape from Privet Drive; the other Weasley family members arrive over the next short while. In the following days, Mrs. Weasley sets Ginny and the Trio to work preparing for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, an apparent attempt to delay the Trio's mission. Harry mentions to Ginny that Mrs. Weasley may be hoping that someone else will kill Voldemort while Harry is there making vol-au-vents; Ginny, frightened, understands Harry unintentional implication about his quest, though Harry tries unsuccessfully to dispel her fears. She shows some jealousy when Fleur's little sister bats her eyes at Harry.

On Harry's birthday, Ginny has nothing for him. Instead, she calls him into her room and kisses him, giving Harry &quot;something to remember her by&quot;; Ron interrupts, and, taking Harry aside, angrily warns him to avoid giving Ginny any false hopes; Harry promises it will not happen again, but over the next few days, he catches himself starting to glance at Ginny, before remembering he should not. He also has difficulty controlling his jealousy over [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] showing interest in her at the wedding reception. 

When the Ministry falls and Harry, Ron, and Hermione make a hasty escape, Harry worries about Ginny until Mr. Weasley's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] informs them that the family is safe. Harry continues thinking about her, however.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]] and his group camp within earshot of Harry, Hermione, and Ron, we hear that when Ginny was involved in an attempt to steal the Sword of Gryffindor from the Headmaster's office. Harry is relieved to hear she only had to serve detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].

Between Christmas and his capture by Snatchers in March, Harry often looks for Ginny's dot on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], imagining what she is doing at Hogwarts.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]], Ginny comes to the DA's aid to stop Voldemort. When Cho Chang, Harry's former girlfriend, offers to show him the Ravenclaw common room to see Ravenclaw's statue, Ginny jealously vetoes this and suggests Luna go instead.

Ginny rebels when she is forbidden to participate in the Final Battle. She finally accepts having to stay in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] until Harry evicts her to search for Ravenclaw's Diadem. He gives her strict instructions to remain nearby so she can return after he is done, but when he leaves, she is nowhere to be seen.

As Harry heads to the Forbidden Forest to meet Voldemort, he passes Ginny on the grounds, ministering to a fallen girl. Though he desperately wants her to know he is there and how much he cares about her, he fears he will be unable to continue if he stops, and instead passes on to his fate. He thinks she senses his presence as he passes. She is the last person he thinks about before he &quot;dies.&quot;

In the final assault on the school, Ginny is one of three students dueling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Bellatrix sweeps all three aside when Mrs. Weasley joins in, but Ginny apparently suffers little harm.

In the combined celebration and mourning after the battle, Harry leaves Ginny to grieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]]'s death with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, knowing that he and Ginny have a long time to be together later.

In the epilogue, set 19 years later, it is indicated that Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley are married and have three children: Lily Luna, James Sirius, and Albus Severus.

== Strengths ==

*Ginny's brothers and family provide her with an inner strength and pride.

*Ginny is very funny and not afraid to speak up.

*She is very good-looking, and this largely contributes to her confidence.

*Her best class is Charms as is shown, in a rather comical light, by her advanced and frequent 'Bat-Bogey Hexes,' which are also noticed by Professor Slughorn in book 6.

*Ginny is able to tell Harry to shut up when needed, cheer him up when needed, and to a large extent control his temper and self-guilt.

== Weaknesses ==

We are yet to see what Ginny is afraid of. However it was noted in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] that she had a fear of being controlled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. It seems that she has, however, learned to deal with that fear by Harry's fifth year. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 23|At Christmas time]] of that year, she speaks to Harry quite dispassionately about her experiences while under the control of Voldemort.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Romantic relationships are covered in more depth in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Ginny Weasley|a separate section.]]

*[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]]: Ginny meets him at the Yule Ball and goes out with him almost all through ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. She breaks up with him after his House team loses against hers in Quidditch. He &quot;got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho]].&quot;
*At the end of Harry's 5th year and throughout most of the 6th, Ginny is dating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]].
*As ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' closes, she forms a romantic relationship with Harry. At the end of the book, Harry breaks up with her, thinking that if he dates her, she will be targeted by Voldemort. The break-up does not actually end the relationship; it re-surfaces in the early chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', and in the Epilogue of that book it is revealed that they have married.
*During the series, she establishes a strong friendship with Hermione. While it has been building quietly since ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', it becomes much more apparent in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It can be seen why one may think that Ginny could be a Horcrux, seeing that in the ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' we find out that the diary was in fact a Horcrux, and in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] Tom Riddle tells us that 'Ginny poured out her soul to me.' Later he continues 'I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her...' 

It seems likely that Ginny was not made a Horcrux, but only ''possessed'' by Voldemort, as Dumbledore explains to Harry: 'Well, it is inadvisable to do so, ... because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a risky business.' It is unlikely Voldemort would have deliberately entrusted even a fragment of his soul to a human.

In ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' Ginny explains to Harry what it felt like when she was possessed by Voldemort. Other than in the Chamber of Secrets, Ginny has never mentioned any instances of feelings of possession. We note that Professor Dumbledore speculates that the snake, Nagini, may be a Horcrux owing to her behaviour. From this, it seems likely that Ginny, if a Horcrux, would still display some strange behaviour.  Furthermore, as Voldemort intended to kill Ginny in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', making her a Horcrux would have been pointless.

== Overview ==

'''''Rubeus Hagrid''''' is Keeper of the Keys and Grounds at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He apparently stands about twelve feet tall, and is immensely strong; when Harry first meets him, he bends a rifle barrel &quot;into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber&quot;. He was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped in half, yet he still performs magic with his umbrella which is rumored to contain the broken parts of his wand.

According to the author, Hagrid's birthday is December 6th; events in the stories lead us to believe he is approximately 60 years old when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] first attends Hogwarts.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] entrusts Hagrid to take the infant [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] from his parents' destroyed house in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] and deliver him to his relatives in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Little Whinging]] in Surrey. He arrives with baby Harry on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] flying motorcycle.

On Harry's eleventh birthday, Hagrid personally delivers his Hogwarts invitation and explains to him that he is a wizard, &quot;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and a thumpin' good one, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit.&quot; He takes Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] to buy his school supplies. While there, he collects a mysterious object for Professor Dumbledore from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]].

Over the course of the school year, Hagrid becomes Harry's anchor; as the one who introduced him to the Wizarding world, Harry often seeks his help. For all his large size and fearsome appearance, Hagrid is a gentle soul who Harry trusts and finds more accessible than most teachers. 

Hagrid carelessly drops several clues about the mysterious package he retrieved from Gringotts&amp;mdash;clues sufficient for Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to deduce that it is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], an object powerful enough to restore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] to human form and make him immortal. Hagrid also inadvertently reveals how to bypass the Stone's first guardian not only to Harry, but also to the one who is trying to steal it.

Hagrid wins a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon's egg]] from someone in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]], and sets about hatching it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] finds out about it, and Harry, Ron and Hermione manage to convince Hagrid to send the dragon off to Romania with Ron's brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]]. Harry and Hermione are caught &quot;wandering the halls&quot; after getting the dragon sent off; and they, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] and Draco, receive detention. To serve this detention, the four of them must accompany Hagrid into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Hagrid is attempting to track down something that is killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorns]]. Hagrid divides the four students into two parties, with himself in one and his boar-hound, Fang, in the other. It is there that Harry has his second encounter with Voldemort – his first, of course, being when he was orphaned.

At year's end, Hagrid presents Harry with a photo album containing many photos of his late parents.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry's initial journey by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]] goes astray, he ends up in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Hagrid finds him there and rescues him, bringing him out into Diagon Alley. Hagrid is still with Harry and the Weasley family when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] get into a scuffle in Flourish and Blotts; it is Hagrid who breaks up that fight.

Shortly after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] are found Petrified, Harry is called into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] office. Hagrid, who Harry had bumped into in the hall moments earlier, bursts into the office, loudly proclaiming Harry's innocence, and is quite abashed when Dumbledore has to raise his voice to inform him that he never suspected Harry.

Harry learns Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts because another student, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], accused him of opening the Chamber of Secrets and releasing a monster that killed a girl. When the Chamber of Secrets is opened a second time, the Minister of Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], arrests Hagrid &quot;for safety's sake,&quot; despite Dumbledore's insistence that Hagrid is innocent. As he is taken away, Hagrid tells Harry (who is hiding in the room under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|invisibility cloak]]) to &quot;follow the spiders.&quot; 

Harry and Ron follow a trail of spiders into the Forbidden Forest. There, Harry meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]], a giant spider that was once Hagrid's pet. Aragog reveals that he was not the monster, though he knew what it was, and that Hagrid is innocent. Aragog mentions that he had never been anywhere near the bathroom where the girl had died. This clue leads Harry to understand that the girl in question was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]], and thus to locate the entrance to the Chamber in her bathroom.

After Harry proves that it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] (as Lord Voldemort was originally known) who actually released the monster (to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|muggle]]-born and half blood wizards), Hagrid is released from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]] and returns to the school.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Hagrid sends Harry ''The Monster Book of Monsters'' as a birthday present, hinting that this is part of a secret that he cannot yet disclose. The secret is that Hagrid is the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher, replacing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] who &quot;retired at the end of last year to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs.&quot;

During his Care of Magical Creatures class, Hagrid introduces students to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|hippogriff]]. Introductions with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] do not go well; when Malfoy insults Buckbeak and is injured, his father files a complaint with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Hagrid is so unnerved by the incident that he spends the remaining term teaching the class about harmless [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flobberworm|flobberworms]].

During a conversation in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|The Three Broomsticks]] pub, Hagrid learns from Cornelius Fudge that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] was convicted for betraying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]] and killing their friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], and twelve muggles. Harry has managed to sneak into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], and overhears this conversation.

At the hearing, the complaint against Hagrid is dismissed, but Buckbeak is considered dangerous and is ordered to be destroyed.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione volunteer to help find legal precedents to present at the appeal which can overturn the sentence and save Buckbeak.

After Christmas, Hagrid has regained some of his confidence and teaches the class about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Salamander|salamanders]]. As Buckbeak's appeal approaches, Hermione helps Hagrid prepare a defence. However, Buckbeak loses the case and is sentenced to be executed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid before the execution, but they are unable to comfort him; as Fudge, Dumbledore, and the executioner approach, Hagrid shoos the trio out the back door. While returning to the castle, they hear the dull thud of the executioner's axe.

Hermione uses a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-Turner]] that she has been using to attend multiple classes to take her and Harry back in time three hours. They return to Hagrid's hut and save Buckbeak from execution; an overjoyed Hagrid, unaware of Hermione's time-turner, is convinced he escaped on his own.

The next day, Hagrid tells Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Buckbeak escaped, and about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]]'s resignation as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Now in his second year as Care of Magical Creatures teacher, Hagrid has regained enough confidence to start the class learning about something he calls [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Skrewts]]. These creatures, which initially look like shell-less, deformed lobsters, are totally new to all the students and to Hagrid; one of the things that Hagrid has the students doing is try to determine what exactly Skrewts eat. One gets the feeling that Hagrid, in his unscientific way, is trying to teach the class how to determine the characteristics of a hitherto unknown species. He will later, with the only somewhat willing assistance of the class, study their activity over a longer period, attempt to determine whether they want nesting boxes in which to hibernate (they don't), and give them exercise by having the students walk them on leashes (which becomes difficult as the Skrewts become as large as the students).

When the delegation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] arrives, Hagrid is given the task of caring for the horses. Shortly after this, the Trio visit Hagrid, and find that he has apparently become besotted with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]], the Headmistress of Beauxbatons; he has tried to comb his hair with little success, and slick it down with something like axle grease. They talk about the Skrewts, and also about the upcoming tasks in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Tournament]]. Hagrid apparently knows something about the tasks, but unusually he does not divulge what is in store for the Champions. As they prepare to return to the castle for dinner, Hagrid rather overdoes the eau de cologne, and goes outside to wash it off in the rain barrel. Seeing Madame Maxime leading her pupils up to the school, he goes to join her, apparently forgetting all about the Trio still in his hut.

After Harry's name comes out of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet]], Hagrid asks if he has any idea who put his name in. Harry is very relieved that Hagrid believes he did not put his own name in, but is unable to venture any guesses.

Just before the First Task, Harry is in Hogsmeade with Hermione. Harry, to avoid the taunts he is receiving, is under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. Seeing Hagrid in the Three Broomsticks, he waves, then realizes that Hagrid can't see him; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]], who is with him, can see him, however, and brings Hagrid over to Hermione's table. Hagrid then asks Harry to bring his cloak to Hagrid's hut at midnight that night. Harry, who has an appointment to speak with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] at 1AM, decides that he can just make it. Hagrid tells him to put on his cloak and follow, then knocks on the door of the Beauxbatons carriage and asks Madame Maxime to accompany him. Harry wonders exactly what it is that Hagrid expects him to see, but is alarmed when Hagrid and Madame Maxime walk around the end of the Forbidden Forest to a corral in which there are four [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragons]]. Hagrid is entranced: they are beautiful. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], one of the wizards there to manage the dragons, asks if it was wise to bring Madame Maxime there, after all she has a student who will be in the competition. Hagrid responds that he just thought she would like to see them. Harry, deeply disturbed by the prospect of having to get past the dragons, quietly and invisibly departs.

It is when the Skrewts have destroyed their nesting boxes, and Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid are finishing rounding them up, that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] appears and asks Hagrid for an interview. Hagrid will later report that, annoyingly, the interview seemed to be all about Harry, and had nothing to do with anything Hagrid was doing.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], Harry and Ron overhear a conversation between Madame Maxime and Hagrid. Hagrid reveals that he is half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]], and asks whether it was Madame Maxime's mother or father. Madame Maxime is highly affronted, says that she has no Giant ancestry and is just big-boned, and storms off. Hagrid, shattered, sits for a while and then shuffles off to his hut.

Shortly afterwards, a story appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], that says that Hagrid is half-Giant. The Trio have no idea how Rita Skeeter, who wrote the story, could have learned about Hagrid's ancestry. Hagrid retreats to his hut and does not come out, either to do his groundskeeping duties or to teach. An alternate teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] takes over teaching Care of Magical Creatures, and apparently does a better job than Hagrid, teaching about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], and immediately winning over the hearts of the female half of the class. Draco Malfoy, meanwhile, taunts Harry that the article will have finished Hagrid's teaching career, as many people will be afraid that Hagrid's Giant ancestry will come out and he would eat their children. Hagrid remains closeted in his hut until Hermione, angered by a meeting with Rita during a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade weekend]], hammers on the hut door and demands entrance. She is taken aback to find that Dumbledore is there, but Dumbledore invites them in for tea, and is quite obviously bracing Hagrid to return to duties. He tells Hagrid about his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], who was charged with performing unnatural charms on a goat, and how he weathered the resulting press exposure. As he leaves, he reminds Hagrid that he has not accepted Hagrid's resignation, and expects to see Hagrid at breakfast on Monday, and expects also that he will start his teaching duties again. Hagrid says that his father would not be proud of how he is acting, and shows the Trio a picture of himself and his father. He then asks how Harry is getting on with the Golden Egg clue for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], and Harry says he pretty well has it defeated. Somehow, Harry feels particularly bad about having to lie to Hagrid.

Returning to his teaching job, Hagrid takes up with Unicorns where Professor Grubbly-Plank had left off. He seems to be trying to show that he can teach as well as she can, and he has captured a pair of foals, much to the delight of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]]. It seems that he does know many useful things about Unicorns, as well.

Harry, looking out the window for relief from listening to Ron and Hermione squabbling, sees Hagrid digging near his hut. Madame Maxime walks over to talk to him, but is apparently rebuffed. The next day, Hagrid introduces them to some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Niffler|Nifflers]]. He says that they are very often used in mines, as they are attracted to bright objects, and are very good at digging. He has everyone select a Niffler, and promises a prize for the holder of the Niffler that retrieves the most gold from the patch of ground Harry had seen him digging up. He warns [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] that it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Leprechaun|Leprechaun]] gold, and will vanish shortly, so there's no point in trying to steal it. In the end, Ron's Niffler has retrieved the most gold, but Ron is pensive. He recalls that he had given Harry a fistful of Leprechaun gold at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch world cup]] to pay for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Omnioculars|Omnioculars]] and is upset that Harry had not even noticed it vanishing.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]] appears at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, Harry, leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] on guard, runs off to fetch Dumbledore. When Harry and Dumbledore return, Krum alone is present. Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|sends for]] Hagrid, who arrives shortly with his crossbow. Dumbledore then sends Hagrid off to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Professor Karkaroff]]. Karkaroff immediately blames Dumbledore for attacking his Champion, which enrages Hagrid to the point that he pushes Karkaroff up against a tree, only letting him down when Dumbledore orders him to. Dumbledore then tells Hagrid to take Harry to Gryffindor tower, and asks Harry to remain there until morning.

In the preparations for the Third Task, it is mentioned that Hagrid had been responsible for planting and growing the hedges that now fill the Quidditch pitch, and that he would be providing some of the creatures that the Champions would have to face. Harry, knowing the sorts of creatures that Hagrid is fond of, finds this rather worrying.

At dinner before the Third Task, Harry notices that Madame Maxime's eyes are red, and that Hagrid keeps glancing at her.

When the third task comes around, Hagrid is apparently one of the marshals, who will be keeping an eye on the maze for distress signals from the Champions. While the other marshals are wearing their red ribbons on their hats, Hagrid has no hat and therefore wears his marshal's ribbon on the back of his waistcoat. As it turns out, Harry encounters a Skrewt in the maze, so at least some of the challenges are, in fact, Hagrid's doing.

As Harry is recovering from his adventures in the maze, he hears argument between Dumbledore and Cornelius Fudge as to whether or not Harry's story can be believed. When Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned, Dumbledore asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] to ask Hagrid and Madame Maxime to meet with him in his office.

After he has recovered, and with no Defence Against the Dark Arts classes to go to, the Trio can visit Hagrid more often. One one such visit, they notice that there are two bucket-sized teacups on the table, and Hagrid confirms that he's been having tea with Madame Maxime. He says that Dumbledore had given him a mission, though he couldn't talk about it yet, and that he has pretty much convinced Madame Maxime to join him. Hagrid startles Harry by saying that he was pretty sure Voldemort would be coming back one day, that it was only a matter of time. He goes on to say that Harry had done as well as his father would have, and there's no higher praise than that. Harry smiles for the first time in days.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At the beginning of the school year, Harry is deeply concerned that Hagrid has not returned to Hogwarts; his classes are being taught by Professor Grubbly-Plank, and no one will say where Hagrid is or when he will return.

When he reappears well into winter, Harry, Hermione, and Ron secretly visit him at his hut. They are shocked by Hagrid's battered appearance, although he does not initially explain what has happened. Harry, however, alludes to the events of his summer, including the attack by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] on Primrose Crescent, saying that if Hagrid tells his story, Harry will reciprocate. Under this impetus, Hagrid does tell them that he and Madame Maxime, the gigantic Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy, were on a secret mission for Dumbledore to recruit the Giants to their side. Though Hagrid is forthright about most of the events of the mission, he is still apparently hiding something, because he will not say what took him so long (Madame Maxime has apparently been back at Beauxbatons for months), or how he got so badly injured. He does mention that he had looked to see if his mother, Fridwulfa, was there, but she had apparently died some time before. His story is cut short by the arrival of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], whose distrust of what she terms &quot;half-breeds&quot;, and the footprints of the Trio heading to Hagrid's hut and not returning, have made her suspicious of Hagrid. The Trio, under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, watch as Umbridge, speaking as if to one who is not completely mentally competent, explains her role at the school and that she will be checking his teaching abilities. After she departs, the Trio ask Hagrid to choose something safe and Ministry-approved to teach them, but Hagrid seems unconcerned. Hermione returns to Hagrid's hut the following day to plead with him, saying that if he doesn't teach the Ministry-approved course, he will be in danger of losing his job, but Hagrid is unmoved.

In his Care of Magical Creatures class, Hagrid introduces Harry's class to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]], winged, horse-like animals that can only be seen by humans who have witnessed death. Having seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] being killed, Harry can now see the strange reptilian creatures, as can some of the other students – Neville Longbottom, who saw his grandfather die, and &quot;a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Theodore Nott|stringy Slytherin&quot;]]. Hagrid's teaching is interrupted by Umbridge's appearance to &quot;inspect&quot; his class; her inspection is so clearly adversarial that Hagrid is quite put off his stride and is unable to teach effectively.

It turns out later that Umbridge has put Hagrid on probation. Hagrid sees this as the first step to sacking him. Later in the book, we will find that Umbridge has started attending all his classes and taking notes on his apparent shortcomings.

On February 14th, arriving at the Three Broomsticks early for a meeting with Hermione, Harry sees Hagrid at the bar. Unusually morose, Hagrid talks about how Harry and he are so much alike, both orphans. He then speaks about how important family is. Harry asks what has gotten Hagrid so upset, but Hagrid doesn't answer, setting down his mug and heading out into the rain.

When Umbridge fires the Divination teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], Dumbledore hires a new one, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]]. Firenze, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|centaur]], was previously living in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]; he gives Harry a message to pass on to Hagrid, saying that Hagrid's attempt is not working. Neither he, nor Hagrid, when Harry talks to him later in class, choose to explain to Harry exactly what this &quot;attempt&quot; is.

Late in the year, Hagrid becomes convinced that Umbridge is about to get him sacked. Hagrid pulls Harry and Hermione away from the final Quidditch match of the year, to enlist their help in something he is doing in the Forbidden Forest if he should get sent away. It turns out that Hagrid had found his half-brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]] living with the Giants, where he was being mistreated because he was so small. Hagrid had brought him back to Hogwarts, although with great difficulty and personal injury. He has hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest where he is trying to teach him manners and English. He extracts a promise from a terrified Harry and Hermione that they will continue his education if Hagrid is sent away.

Eventually, Umbridge's hatred of so-called &quot;half-breeds&quot; leads her to sack Hagrid on the pretexts that he is incompetent, and that he has introduced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Niffler|Nifflers]] into her office. Her attempt is done with great drama, the assistance of at least five [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]], and multiple ineffective [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|stun jinxes]] that Harry witnesses during his midnight Astronomy [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL]] exam. As part of the arrest, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] is hit with multiple Stunners and ends up having to go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. Hagrid escapes, carrying his boarhound Fang, who has been Stunned.

When Umbridge is removed and Dumbledore reinstated as Headmaster, Hagrid returns to the school and regains his teaching position. Harry, finding the concern of his friends in the Hospital Wing too intrusive, visits him to talk about the death of Sirius, his godfather, but very quickly discovers that he cannot get any peace there either, and uses Ron and Hermione as an excuse to leave Hagrid's hut.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Hagrid's role in this episode is much decreased, because his main point of contact with Harry is through the Care Of Magical Creatures classes, and Harry has chosen to not take [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT]]-level studies in that course.

It is mentioned that Harry had inherited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]] at the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Dumbledore says that Hagrid has renamed him [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Witherwings|Witherwings]] and will be delighted to take care of him.

Hagrid acts as guard for the Weasley family and Harry as they visit Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies. Harry is very pleased to see him, particularly as the alternative would be a squad of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]].

After the Arrival Feast, Hagrid meets Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and says that if they arrive early to Care of Magical Creatures, they will be able to say hello to Witherwings. Harry, Ron, and later Hermione, are concerned as to how they are going to break it to Hagrid that they have not chosen to take Care of Magical Creatures this year. Some time later, Harry decides that it is because they are not taking his class that Hagrid seems to be so aloof, and resolves to visit him. The Trio go to his hut after Quidditch tryouts, and the visit is initially awkward, but it turns out that a large part of Hagrid's preoccupation is because of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Hagrid's ancient giant spider, Aragog]], who is very ill. Hagrid comments that the Trio's schedules are very full, but they might have managed to fit Care of Magical Creatures in if they had [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-turners]], but Hermione mentions that they were all destroyed at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]] the previous year.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade weekend]] in October, touches the cursed necklace and is injured, Harry runs for help. The first person he runs into is Hagrid, and Hagrid carries Katie back to Hogwarts at the run.

After Aragog dies, Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] come to console Hagrid and to give the creature a proper burial. Following the burial, Slughorn, Harry, and Hagrid take part in what might be considered an impromptu wake, during which Harry obtains the missing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] memory from Slughorn.

When Ron is poisoned on his birthday, Hagrid comes to visit him in the Hospital Wing. As he, Harry, and Hermione leave to give Ron some time with his family, Hagrid mentions that Dumbledore seems upset with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]. He catches himself, but under questioning from Harry he reveals that he had been at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and had overheard bits of a conversation between Dumbledore and Snape in which Snape seemed to be saying that though he had promised to do something, he might just change his mind. There was also some reference to the investigations in Slytherin, which Hagrid assumed had to do with the necklace.

During [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|the tower battle at Hogwarts]], Hagrid tries to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] from fleeing, but he only manages to delay one of them who sets fire to Hagrid's hut. After Dumbledore's death, Hagrid removes his body to safety, and later attends the meeting of the Heads of House where the future of the school is being determined. Hagrid says that he feels he doesn't really belong at that meeting, but says that Dumbledore would have wanted the school to go on. He also says that he would think that students might want to pay their respects to Dumbledore, and so he would not expect to send the students home on the Express until after the funeral.

At the funeral itself, Hagrid carries Dumbledore's wrapped body to the bier, and then returns to the rear of the gathered crowd, where he breaks down in tears and is roughly comforted by his half-brother, Grawp.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Hagrid, once again riding Sirius' flying motorcycle, is given the task of transporting the real Harry Potter to the home of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. As Hagrid occupies so much of the motorcycle's saddle, a sidecar has been added, into which Harry uncomfortably squeezes himself, his rucksack, his broom, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]'s cage. The motorcycle has further been modified to emit brick walls, nets, and dragon fire out of its tailpipe; these are used against the pursuing Death Eaters with limited effect, and in fact the first use of the dragon fire addition results in the sidecar mountings failing partway. Hagrid's later attempt to repair the mountings results in them shearing completely, and Harry and the sidecar fall off. Hagrid circles around and collects Harry from the falling sidecar, from which Harry is only able to retrieve his rucksack. Once the pursuing Death Eaters determine that this is the real Harry, they break off the attack; at Harry's urging, Hagrid then uses the dragon fire again to speed them towards the Tonks home. Many Death Eaters, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], catch up with them near the end of the journey; Hagrid at one point leaps off the motorcycle to wrestle with a Death Eater who is trying to curse Harry, and falls from there to the ground. When Harry reaches him later, he doesn't seem to be moving, but Harry then loses consciousness.

When he recovers, he asks Ted Tonks where Hagrid is, Ted assures him that Hagrid is fine. Hagrid comes in shortly after that. Ted ushers them over to the Portkey which will take them to The Burrow, and while they are waiting for the Portkey to activate, Hagrid asks where Hedwig is. Harry has to tell him that Hedwig is dead; she had been struck early in the battle by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]] intended for Harry.

Once they reach [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], Hagrid largely moves into the background of the action, trying to recover his nerves with brandy and Firewhiskey.

Hagrid is present for Harry's birthday, wearing his best, hairy, horrible suit, and gives him a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Moke|Mokeskin]] bag. This is used for valuables; things placed in it can only be retrieved by the owner. Harry will use it to keep a number of objects which he feels are valuable throughout the book.

The wedding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] is the following day, so Hagrid stays overnight; however, The Burrow is far too full to allow him any place to stay, so he sets up a tent in a neighboring field. He is mentioned briefly as, just before the wedding, he mistakes where he is meant to sit and crushes an entire row of folding chairs, before being shown the reinforced bench which was intended for him.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] try to steal Gryffindor's sword, they are given detention, which is apparently served with Hagrid.

At the battle at Hogwarts, Hagrid appears, flying in through a window; apparently he has been visiting Grawp in his cave outside Hogsmeade, and when he was called to the battle, he asked Grawp to set him down inside the walls. Grawp, misunderstanding him, had thrown him through the window. Later in the battle, he is carried away by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|giant spiders]], children of Aragog. He is later found in the clearing where Aragog's children lived, which has been commandeered by the Death Eaters. The Death Eaters force Hagrid to carry Harry's apparently-lifeless body back to the lawns in front of Hogwarts. Hagrid is evidently crying too hard to notice the pulse beating strongly in Harry's throat. When hostilities re-open, and Harry hides under his cloak, Hagrid is the first to notice that he has vanished.

== Strengths ==

One of Hagrid's main strengths is that he is a half-Giant. This means that his tough skin protects him against many spells and physical injuries. He is also immensely strong physically. Although a half-Giant might be expected to be fierce, Hagrid is one of the most soft-hearted people Harry knows. However, he can fight when necessary. He is one of Dumbledore's most trusted friends.

Hagrid is also unafraid of most physical threats, standing up to a squad of armed Centaurs, dealing with the vicious Blast-Ended Skrewts, and trying to domesticate a dragon. It could be said that this bravery is a weakness, as it tends to lead him into situations that are untenable for those who are traveling with him, such as the Trio.

Hagrid's half-Giant status allows him to interact and negotiate with Giants at a level that humans cannot, as evidenced in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. 

He also interacts with many dangerous animals in a way that not many wizards would dare. His relative strength makes the threats that they pose seem insignificant to him, and so he can consider treating a dragon as a pet.

== Weaknesses ==

After he was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets, he was expelled and forbidden to do magic. His wand was snapped in two (the pieces were later reassembled and hidden in a pink umbrella, which never seems to be far from Hagrid). This seriously hindered his magical education, and as a result, he is rather poor at casting spells.

Hagrid has an unusual obsession with all &quot;interesting&quot; creatures&amp;mdash;which usually means very dangerous ones. He tends to forget just how dangerous certain animals can be, and so has gotten Harry and his friends into some bad situations. Perhaps ironically, it is his physical strength that proves a weakness here; being half-Giant, he is extremely strong, and thus is able to deal with quite dangerous creatures, but he tends to forget that others are not as strong as he is.

On several occasions, Hagrid has allowed facts to slip out that he was meant to keep secret. We see this a number of times in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', for instance, when he reveals the connection with Nicolas Flamel, and the method of bypassing the three-headed dog. The tendency continues through the entire series; in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', we see Hagrid revealing that he has overheard a conversation between Dumbledore and Snape.

Emotionally, Hagrid seems quite immature, for all that he is apparently about 60 years old. His immediate reaction to almost any setback is to retreat from all contact, and possibly to get drunk. He shares Harry's tendency to try and run away from troubles; unlike Harry, though, he never turns of his own volition to face the problem, only doing so when he is forced, often by Dumbledore or by the Trio. His confidence is easily destroyed when dealing with antagonistic people, notably Draco Malfoy, Draco's father Lucius, and Professor Umbridge.

Hagrid is not the best cook. The Trio usually avoids Hagrid's offerings, particularly his rock cakes that are more rock than cake. Hagrid's attempts at cooking are something of a running joke throughout the series, though apparently the birthday cakes that he has made for Harry over the years have been well received.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

During Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|fourth year]], he developed a romantic relationship with the half-giant headmistress of Beauxbatons, Madame Maxime.

He has generally been friendly with Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the series. His opinion is valued by Dumbledore, who allowed Hagrid to stay as Grounds Keeper after being expelled.

== Analysis ==

Hagrid is interesting in part because of what he isn't. It seems initially that Hagrid is to be a sort of a father figure for Harry, with his size, gentleness, kindness towards Harry, and the fact that it was Hagrid who rescued him from his horrible aunt and uncle. However, while he is a comfort and a confidante for Harry, the father figure role would sit very awkwardly on him.

Hagrid is an odd hybrid of maturity and immaturity, which makes him a sort of a  conduit between the professors and the Trio. So, while Harry genuinely likes Hagrid and respects him, it is not as an adult; rather, Harry sees him as one at largely his own level: an instructor perhaps in the ways of wizards, but not a father figure. In fact, Harry, Hermione, and Ron on several occasions act as sort of a combined parent figure for Hagrid: 

*in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', the trio are instrumental in getting Hagrid back on his feet after Buckbeak injures Draco Malfoy;
*again in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', it is they who brace him up for the defence of Buckbeak, and who provide moral support before the scheduled execution; 
*in ''Goblet of Fire'', it is the Trio who manage to rein him in when he is falling for Madame Maxime;
*when the news of his being half-Giant is revealed in ''Goblet of Fire'', it is partly the Trio who get him out of his hut and back teaching again.

Add to this Hagrid's habit of responding to every setback, and every victory, by getting drunk – in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', he seems to be able to get reeling drunk within half an hour of Buckbeak's escape – and we can see that, even at an apparent age of 60 years, Hagrid is still often reacting like an adolescent.

Hagrid does show a certain amount of maturity, of course; his decision to bring his half-brother Grawp back with him, to attempt to civilize Grawp, and in particular the resolve with which he sticks to that decision, shows that the mission to the Giants, and possibly the influence of Olympe Maxime, have matured him.

=== Can Hagrid do magic? ===

Of course he can, though he's not supposed to, at least not in the first two books. In fact, we see him do so twice in the early chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', once [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|when he gives Dudley a pig's tail]], and once [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|when he sends the boat back to the mainland by tapping it with his umbrella]]. Hermione asks, before Hallowe'en in that same book, whether he has used an Engorgement Charm on the pumpkins in his garden, and he admits to having done so, without directly saying  he did use magic. Presumably, once he has been exonerated of the fifty-year old accusation that he had released the monster from the Chamber of Secrets, which happens at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', the prohibition against Hagrid's using magic will have been lifted. However, we are never explicitly told this. It is true that Hagrid, having been expelled in his third year, will not have as much magic ability as he ought to, and there is no sign of his either getting his original wand repaired or getting a new one. There is no real explanation of this; perhaps it is simply that Hagrid is aware of the lack of training and his resulting lack of magical ability. It is true that Hagrid seems very diffident about many things, and likely his minimal use of magic stems from lack of confidence due to his being surrounded by much more competent witches and wizards.

When Hagrid and Madame Maxime were visiting the Giants in Europe to negotiate with them, his use of magic would be, in any case, perforce minimal. They could not use magic while traveling because they were being watched, by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] and possibly also by Death Eaters, and they could not use magic around the Giants because that was something Wizards did, and using magic would antagonize the people they were trying to negotiate with.

There is thus no evidence whether the prohibition against Hagrid's using magic was actually vacated or not. The reader does take away the impression, however, that Hagrid chose to keep whatever magic he did somewhat furtive, though it remains uncertain whether it was still forbidden him, or whether he was simply embarrassed by his relative lack of ability.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20026225/ In an interview with MSNBC] following the publication of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', the following appeared:

:Hagrid, actually, had been safe in Rowling’s mind from the very beginning. Before her first book, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,'' was even published, Rowling planned for Hagrid to carry Harry out of the forest at the end of ''Deathly Hallows,'' believing that Harry was dead.

:&quot;It was very significant,&quot; Rowling said. &quot;Hagrid brings Harry from the Dursleys. He takes him into the wizarding world&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. He was sort of his guardian and his guide&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. And now I wanted Hagrid to be the one to lead Harry out of the forest.&quot;

In this context, Hagrid can be seen very much as the midwife, carrying or leading Harry from one stage in his life to the next. In ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', he carries the infant Harry from the wreckage of the house in Godric's Hollow, to his new life with the Dursleys. He again leads Harry to the discovery of the Wizarding world, and his own role in it, by means of the trip to Diagon Alley. And he is, of course, the one who pilots the fleet of boats that carry all the first-years, including Harry, into Hogwarts before their Sorting. In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', it is again Hagrid, and interestingly again Sirius' flying motorbike, that Hagrid uses to carry Harry out of his childhood home with the Dursleys and into his adult life. It is only proper that Hagrid is the one who carries him out of the Forest and into the place where he can achieve his final victory over Voldemort. The only major transition for which Hagrid is not present is the Advance Guard, carrying Harry to Grimmauld Place in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and inducting him into the Order.

A large part of the reason that Hagrid is unable to do magic, we are led to believe, is that his wand was broken when he was expelled. There are some inconsistencies in this, however. We have to compare Hagrid's experience with Ron's in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''. Ron's wand was broken in the crash landing of the flying car, and as a result, throughout the year his attempts at doing magic were repeatedly marred by unexpected effects from his wand: clouds of grey smoke, firecracker noises, and on at least two occasions, backfires. We see none of these effects when Hagrid attempts magic. Against this, we must also compare what happens when Harry's wand is broken in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'': &quot;repaired&quot; by Hermione, when called upon to work a spell it simply falls apart. Again, we do not see this happen when Hagrid attempts magic. While this must be purely speculation, we can suggest an explanation for this. We learn, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|in the last chapter of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] can repair Harry's wand. We know that Dumbledore had somehow arranged to get Hagrid the groundskeeper's job at Hogwarts after his expulsion, which would suggest strongly that Dumbledore had not bought Riddle's story that Hagrid had been opening the Chamber of Secrets. Our belief is that Hagrid's expulsion happened in about 1942, and we have learned that Dumbledore defeated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] in 1945, and would have gained control of the Elder Wand at that point. It is possible, though nowhere suggested in the story, that Dumbledore repaired Hagrid's wand sometime after that. Hagrid's weak magic, then, is likely partly due to his only having received three years of formal magical schooling, and largely due to his having to hide his spellcasting to keep from getting Dumbledore into trouble. After his name is cleared, presumably he is allowed to use magic again, but likely does not, partly because he has gotten out of the habit of openly using magic, but largely because of lack of confidence in his own abilities.

=1. Zukertort Opening=
===1.Nf3===
White's options are kept flexible as White could intend to play the [[Chess/Réti Opening|Réti Opening]] or the [[Chess/King's Indian Attack|King's Indian Attack]], although it can easily transpose into something else, including the [[Chess/Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Defence]]. Other reasons for playing 1. Nf3 go something along the lines of:

&lt;blockquote&gt;White hates playing against Variation X, but doesn't mind Variation Y.
White plays 1. Nf3 as a request for information.
If Black attempts to transpose into Variation X, which White hates, White will refuse to allow it and play an independent line instead.
If Black attempts to transpose into Variation Y, White will go along with that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Example: A player who hates facing the Queen's Gambit Declined but doesn't mind the Dutch Defence plays 1. Nf3. If it is answered with 1...f5 he will play 2. d4 transposing into the Dutch, but if 1...d5 appears then he will go for a King's Indian Attack with 2. g3. A player whose preferences were the other way around might answer 1...d5 with 2. d4 (allowing a QGD) but 1...f5 with 2. e4!?, the Lisitsin Gambit (not allowing the Dutch).

One general point though: because 1. Nf3 prevents 1...e5, it has more in common with 1. d4 openings (and some 1. c4 openings) than with those following 1. e4. It is also a popular way for White to set up a King's Indian formation. 

Black can play almost anything comfortably at this point, and the following options are merely some of the more common replies.

===Statistics===
Approximate chances: White win 37%, Draw 36%, Black win 27%&lt;br&gt;
Estimated next move popularity: Nf6 49%, d5 25%, c5 11%, g6 5%, f5 3%, d6 3%, e6 2% other moves less than 2%

= Scandinavian Defence =
===1...d5===
When White opens with 1. e4, the pawn on e4 is immediately a big asset, a bulwark in the centre of the board interfering with Black's plans. Black can either manoeuvre around it, for example by putting a pawn of his own on e5, or he can go after that e4 pawn. There is one move that virtually guarantees the disappearance of White's pawn: 1...d5, the Centre Counter or Scandinavian Defence.

Capturing Black's pawn is the usual course of action. After
:*[[/2. exd5|2. exd5]]
we discover the chief drawback of the Centre Counter: in order to recover the pawn (sometimes he chooses not to) Black must now sally forth with his queen providing White with a target to attack. This was considered enough of a problem to put the opening out of business for much of the mid-20th century. Modern players are a little more comfortable breaking the rules though, one of the main reasons for the Scandinavian's modern popularity.

:*[[/2. d4|2. d4]] transposes to the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit.  If Black prefers to decline the gambit, he can steer the game into the French, Caro-Kann, or Nimzovich Defenses.

White can defend the pawn, but not comfortably:
:*[[/2. Nc3|2. Nc3]] is playable; it generally leads to the knight getting kicked with 2...d4 and retreating to e2 with a position that can develop into a reversed Kings Indian. A lesser option for Black is 2... dxe4.
:*[[/2. d3|2. d3]] and Black will gleefully exchange pawns, then queens, and White loses the right to castle, although after 2... dxe4, White can play the interesting 3. Nc3.
:*[[/2. c3|2. c3]] allows black to regain the pawn after 2...dxe4 3.Qa4+, but wastes time and does not help development.
:*[[/2. g4|2. g4]] is called the Zilbermints Gambit.
:*[[/2. e5|2. e5]] is occasionally seen. Only occasionally, because Black has now has an opportunity to develop his queens bishop to somewhere useful before playing the natural e6, thus negating the main weakness of the French Defence which it resembles.
:*[[/2. h3|2. h3]] aims for a reversed Englund Gambit.
:*[[/2. Bd3|2. Bd3]] blocks White's d-pawn, shuts the d3-bishop in with the e-pawn and needlessly weakens g2, so now White will not have the possibility of capturing the d5 pawn because Qxd5 will threaten the g2-pawn.

:*[[/2. Nf3|2. Nf3]] is a gambit seen in blitz chess.  After 2...dxe4, 3. Ng5 follows.

Ciao, how can I help you? I suppose you have problems with the structure of the book. Btw. if you would like to register it is easier to attribute your work to you and admins will know that who is working is a reliable person. Without login we only see a number and therefore check out every added page. - For all other people reading this page: this book is being initiated on the napulitano-discussion group - so it will take some time to build it up. Ciao! --[[User:SabineCretella|SabineCretella]] 06:20, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

yes i am registered, every now and then i become loged out.

the list i made and you fixed will be the headings for the table of contents.

anything you would like to add, would be helpful.

==Questions==
Hello, I'm glad this project has begun. I think there are some basic things we should work out before we get too far along though.  Orthographically, I tend to prefer the &quot;j&quot; to the &quot;i&quot; (nuje v. nuie, serraje v. serraie), thoughts?  Also, what do we do about all the variable conjugations/spellings/usages endemic to the language?  I don't want arbitrary decisions made with the losers just falling by the wayside, but having too many variants can be confusing to the newcomer.  Perhaps some mix can be accommodated (the way many Italian texts include both devo and debbo)? I personally enjoy the lack of standardization in Neapolitan, but it can be frustrating. Sabine (if you're reading this), is there any &quot;easy&quot; way to copy the Neapolitan material from the Italian wiktionary over to this?  Or is it better to just wait for a nap.wiktionary.org to get going and do it there?  One big problem is that all that material is in Italian.... [[User:E. abu Filumena|E. abu Filumena]] 06:43, 18 August 2005 (UTC)



i agree to use &quot;j&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot; and as for the other spellings, i think we should use spellings     that most often appear in the 18th and 19th century literature, also what is being used in and around napule today, and where there is no consensus, list all forms with notes. we discuss a lot of that in the http://groups.yahoo.com/group/napulitano/
--[[User:Espo111|Espo111]] 16:53, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

As for linking material please hold on for a moment - Ultimate Wiktionary should start soon and from here it will be easy to add translations into EN + link it directly. At this stage, to my opinion, it does not make sense to create a neapolitan wiktionary as it would only double admin work and &quot;copy work&quot;. Thank you! --[[User:SabineCretella|SabineCretella]] 13:32, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

: I did not remove the link from the page, but it is not generally considered proper on wikibooks to use a wikibook as means of advertising, which is one way the link to your page could be understood.

:::Hello Frank, I'm not sure why you are being so aggressive, but I'd have to concur that the front page is not the place for this kind of self-promotion.

:::The issue is not if the site itself has ads, nor if the book was originally started for your site, but that wikibooks/wikipedia/etc are considered collective endeavors and that an attribution to a specific entity doesn't reflect this (even if you are currently the only contributor).

In fact, your site does look like a very helpful resource, and I think it fits into the wikibooks scheme in that sense; as a resource.

I created (well, resurrected) the [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] wikibook with the sole purpose of it being a guide for and by GameFAQs users, but I never labelled it as such.

==Blanking and threat ==

At 02:03 UTC, 23 August 2005 Espo111 replaced this page with this [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Neapolitan&amp;oldid=220167]:

well i thought i could help people, but i should have realized wiki is just ignorant people with egos. I guess i will have to create through other means, away from wiki.
 
and i will do whatever i can to kill this book, including vandalism. i shoud have known this would happen as you were the guy who erased all the other stuff we napulitane contributed to the wikipedia article.
 
and my site is less than a week old, so no its not useful yet, thanks for pointing it out strunz. i had hoped for help here, instead of just being erased.
:I'm sorry you feel that way, I wish you luck in your endeavors.  I believe your comment about your page &quot;not being useful&quot; is in regards to the &quot;under construction as of aug. 2005&quot; on the resource page, I copied that directly from the wikipedia Neapolitan language page where you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neapolitan_language&amp;diff=20717412&amp;oldid=19217596] described it as such.[[User:E. abu Filumena|E. abu Filumena]] 03:23, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

no i did not misunderstand, and no i did not over react, i can tell when i am not wanted by idiots
all i wanted was to keep my link on the page to increase traffic to the wikibook, and your &quot;useless comment&quot; pissed me off. I started this book and it was over run and stolen, i started the wikipedia neapolitan article way back, and that was stolen as well, mostly by the same people. you guys can have the book, but i wont promote it, in fact i will discourage it as yet another reason why wikipedia is pure amateur. I finally took the advice of all my professors, and department at school and stopped using wikipedia. it is not nor will ever be credible and academic. And when i get my own students, i will fail anyone caught using any scrap of information derived from wikipedia. and by me posting this just proves you guys are clueless.

so as the old ladies used to say &quot;a fa napule!&quot;

:nonononono... you have blown this completely out of proportion.
:YOU own the content, but WE own the server so WE make the rules. Since our genus in 2002(?) we've had the rule that you may NOT have ANY project promote one linked-to website above another. Our house, our rules, simple enough.
:I wish you the best of luck with your academic future, but I must warn you that if you fail a student solely because they reference a Wikimedia project you'll end up like that pro-Communist guy in Regina who failed students who chose the anti-Communist perspective for their essays; in other words, you'll end up in deep **** with those nasty uni bigwigs.
:I do hope you reconsider this. It's only a minor thing, I don't see why you have to write us off completely just because we won't let you pimp your website on the book's main page.
:Please reconsider, please. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:53, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
::pimp an academic website..... and thats the problem with wikipedia, thanks for pointing it out and validating my point. And thanks for the “warning” but if I would fail my student for using a verified-non academic source (i.e. wiki-whatever), that is non credible and not academically reviewed, then I am just doing what MY professors have warned me about already for that last year and a half. And you are correct, you own the server, and the right to make the rules, rules that are anti-elitist and stating that content “owned” by the community, thus being purely communist in nature. perspective is acceptable, using a non credible source is another. All I am saying is that I am an academic and have simply been awakened by the lack of wiki-credibility by this “completely blown out of proportion” incident. And this incident was simply the “last straw” on wikimedia, thus verifying the old saying “you get what you pay for”
:::Yes we are very anti-elitist, perhaps too much so, but the solutions have so far escaped our grasp. That is the root of the problem with the lack of credibility. There is currently a drive on WP to reference every detail in every article, but that might take some time to occur because we cannot attract a large enough number of academics to add those references in the first place.
:::I'm glad you've put some serious thought into this, but on most of your points &quot;we'll have to agree to disagree&quot; I'm afraid. :)
:::As for &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;... credibility aside, consider this: our goal has always been to make information freely available to the masses; when I can come here and find a bizarrely delicious recipe for banana curry, or a game guide that lets me play from start to finish and find all of its secrets, or do a search on Wikipedia and ''actually'' find out what this Scott Maslen guy's first acting job was, all without a single ad of any form to make sure I pay for the privelage of reading, have we not already succeeded in our quest...? Well, that is something each visitor must decide for themselves. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:49, 25 August 2005 (UTC)


you see, academics dont look to &quot;find out what Scott Maslen guy's first acting job was&quot; and &quot;the linguistics of the neapolitan language&quot; from the same source, its like going shopping for toilet paper and diamond rings at wal mart, they just dont go together. and academics ARE elitist because they DESERVE to be, all the schooling and taking the time to do things correctly is what gives them the right. dont get me wrong, wikipedia has a place in the world, that is not my argument. It just has no place in critical research. want a solution? become elitist, thats the only way. real academics and &quot;arm-chair scholars&quot; will never co-exist, sorry, thats just how it is.

:You contributed KNOWING that your work would be editable by anybody, logged, and under the GFDL.

you get out, you dont own the site either , if you want that information there rewrite yourself. I have to right to edit what i wrote , I am not sure it is correct so i removed it. swearing is a reportable offence, maybe you are the little child here. So leave it out or i will ask you be moderated and maybe banned.

'''Fine'''
you know what, fine, i will do what you you, (i would repeat but i don't need to use vulgar language unlike a wikpedian), I will leave and this book will add to the millions of error filled, half-finished useless wikipages. I started this, i promoted it, i corrected the errors, i did most of the work to start this book, and then a couple if academic-wannabes (mostly Kellen -good neapolian name btw) came along and ruined it. you can keep my half finished contributions -the real information will be completed by real academics, and be placed elswhere -where idiots (like some found here) cannot ruin it. you can keep your joke of a site and the error-filled information it contains. wiki will never be taken seriously by the academic world as long as people like kellen and Cspurrier are allowed to contribute or

Our study of linear algebra will begin with examining systems of linear equations. Such linear equations appear frequently in [[w:applied mathematics|applied mathematics]] in modelling certain phenomena. For example in [[w:linear programming|linear programming]], profit is usually maximized subject to certain constraints related to labour, time availability etc. These constraints can be put in the form of a linear system of equations.

While we have already studied the contents of this chapter (see [[Algebra/Systems of Equations]]) it is a good idea to quickly re read this page to freshen up the definitions.      

==Linear systems==

[[Image:FuncionLineal02.svg|thumb|Graph sample of linear equations]]
A ''linear equation'' is an [[w:equation|equation]] in which each [[w:Term (mathematics)|term]] is either a constant or the product of a constant times the first power of a variable. Such an equation is equivalent to equating a [[w:Degree of a polynomial|first-degree polynomial]] to zero. Some examples of linear equations are as follows:

*&lt;math&gt;x + 3y = -4\ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;7x_1 = 15 + x_2\ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;z\sqrt{2} + e = \pi\ &lt;/math&gt;

The term linear comes from basic algebra and plane geometry where the standard form of algebraic representation of a line that is on the real plane is &lt;math&gt;ax + by = c&lt;/math&gt; where a, b, c are real constants and  x, y are real variables. Review of the above examples will find each equation fits the general form.

The following are not linear equations:

*&lt;math&gt;xy + 7 = 2\ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x_1} + x_2 = 11&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;x^3 = 6 - 12z\ &lt;/math&gt;

For an equation to be linear, it does not necessarily have to be in ''standard form'' (all terms with variables on the left-hand side). The constants in linear equations need not be [[w:Integer|integral]] (or even rational). 

Linear equations are classified by the number of variables they involve. The classification is straightforward -- an equation with ''n'' variables is called a linear equation in ''n'' variables. If n is 2 the linear equation is geometrically a straight line, and if n is 3 it is a plane. The geometrical shape for a general n is sometimes referred to as an ''[[w:Hyperplane#Affine_hyperplanes|affine hyperplane]]''. We'll however be simply using the word ''n-plane'' for all n.  

For clarity and simplicity, a linear equation in n variables is written in the form 
&lt;math&gt;a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3 + ... + a_nx_n = b\ &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, ... , a_n\ &lt;/math&gt; are constants (called the coefficients), and &lt;math&gt;b\ &lt;/math&gt; is the constant term.

[[File:Secretsharing 3-point.svg|thumb|right|A linear system in three variables determines a collection of [[w:plane (mathematics)|planes]].]]
A  ''linear system'' (or ''system of linear equations'') is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables.  For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp;             2y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp;  z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;  1 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp;             2y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 4z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -2 &amp; \\
-x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \tfrac{1}{2} y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp;  z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;  0 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
is a system of three equations in the three variables &lt;math&gt;x, y, z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

A general system of ''m'' linear equations with ''n'' unknowns (or variables) can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
a_{11} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{12} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{1n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_1      \\
a_{21} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{22} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{2n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_2      \\
\vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;              &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp;&amp; \;\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{m2} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{mn} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_m      \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are the unknowns, &lt;math&gt;a_{11},\ a_{12},...,\ a_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''coefficients'' of the system, and &lt;math&gt;b_1,\ b_2,...,b_m&lt;/math&gt; are the constant terms.

==Solutions of linear systems==

A ''solution of a linear equation'' is any [[w:n-tuple|n-tuple]] of values &lt;math&gt;(s_1,s_2,....,s_n)\ &lt;/math&gt;which satisfies the linear equation. For example, &lt;math&gt;(-1,-1)\ &lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the linear equation &lt;math&gt;x + 3y = -4\ &lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;-1 + (3 \times -1) = -1 + (-3) = -4&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;(1,5)\ &lt;/math&gt; is not.

Similarly, a ''solution to a linear system'' is any n-tuple of values &lt;math&gt;(s_1,s_2,....,s_n)\ &lt;/math&gt;which simultaneously satisfies all the linear equations given in the system. 

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp;             2y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp;  z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;  1 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp;             2y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 4z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -2 &amp; \\
-x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \tfrac{1}{2} y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp;  z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;  0 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

has as its solution &lt;math&gt;(1,-2,-2)\ &lt;/math&gt;. This can also be written as:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
x &amp; = &amp; 1 \\
y &amp; = &amp; -2 \\
z &amp; = &amp; -2
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

We also refer to the collection of all possible solutions as the ''solution set''.

In general, for any linear system of equations there are three possibilities regarding solutions:

'''A unique solution:'''  In this case only one specific solution set exists.  Geometrically this implies the n-planes specified by each equation of the linear system all intersect at a unique point in the [[w:Euclidean space|space]] that is specified by the variables of the system.

'''No solution:'''  The equations are termed inconsistent and specify n-planes in space which do not intersect or overlap.  It is not possible to specify a solution set that satisfies all equations of the system.

'''An infinite range of solutions:''' The equations specify n-planes whose intersection is an m-plane where &lt;math&gt;m\le n&lt;/math&gt;.  This being the case, it is possible to show that an infinite set of solutions within  a specific range exists that satisfy the set of linear equations.

The following pictures illustrate these cases:
:{| border=0 cellpadding=5
|-
|width=&quot;150px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| [[File:Two linear equation add method.PNG|120px]]
|width=&quot;150px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| [[File:Parallel linear equations.PNG|120px]]
|width=&quot;150px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| [[File:Intersecting Planes 2.svg|120px]]
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| A unique solution
|align=&quot;center&quot;| No solution
|align=&quot;center&quot;| An infinite range of solutions
|}

Why are there only these three cases and no others? Although a  justification shall be provided in the next chapter, it is a good exercise for you to figure it out now.

A linear system is said to be ''inconsistent'' if it has no solution. If there exists at least one solution, then the system is said to be ''consistent''.

==Methods of solving linear systems==

We know that linear equations in 2 or 3 variables can be solved using techniques such as [[Algebra/Systems_of_Equations#Solving_Linear_Simultaneous_Equations|the addition and the substitution method]]. However these techniques are not appropriate for dealing with large systems where there are a large number of variables. These techniques are therefore generalized and a systematic procedure called ''[[w:Gaussian elimination|Gaussian elimination]]'' is usually used in actual practice. We will study this in a later chapter. A variant of this technique known as the ''[[w:Gauss Jordan method|Gauss Jordan method]]'' is also used.

Many times we are required to solve many linear systems where the only difference in them are the constant terms. The coefficients of the variables all remain the same. A technique called ''[[w:LU decomposition|LU decomposition]]'' is used in this case. A variant called ''[[w:Cholesky factorization|Cholesky factorization]]'' is also used when possible. We will study these techniques in later chapters.

== Exercises ==

This chapter is meant as a review. There are no exercises.

== Introduction ==
So you've been plodding along with your perl scripts, fiddling with arrays and hashes and suddenly you realize that you would like to pass a function to another function depending on the data you encounter, or perhaps you would like to get back a hash when you look up an array index.  References are the thing for you, allowing you to build and pass around ever more complex data structures.

== Referencing and Dereferencing Syntax ==
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
my $nightmare = &quot;clowns&quot;;
my $ref = \$nightmare;
print &quot;I laugh in the face of &quot; . ${$ref} . &quot;\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Output should be ''I laugh in the face of clowns''.

The curly brackets are optional, but generally recommended.

===The human eye===

The eye is a remarkable optical instrument that is often poorly understood by students of consciousness.  The most popular misconception is that there is a 'focus' within the eye through which all the light rays pass! The purpose of this article is to describe our knowledge of the optics of the eye so that such misconceptions can be avoided. 

[[Image:Constudtheeye.png]]

The eye consists of several surfaces at which refraction occurs: air-cornea, cornea-aqueous humour, aqueous humour-lens, lens-vitreous humour.  The crude image forming capability of the eye can be represented quite accurately by the ''reduced eye'' model which involves a single optical surface (air-cornea).  Optometrists use more accurate models such as the Gullstrand Schematic Eye, the Le Grand Theoretical and the LeGrand Simplified Eye.

The lens system at the front of the eye forms an inverted image on the retina.

The eye is about 23 mm deep from the front of the cornea to the back of the retina.  The refractive index of the components of the lens system varies from about 1.33 to 1.39.

Light from every point of a field of view falls all over the surface of the eye. There is no 'point eye' and there is no ordered image between objects in the view and the retina except on the retina.  The image on the eye has the form of an inverted mapping of 3D objects to a 2D surface. This is also the form of conscious experience so the images on the retinas are the closest physical analogues of phenomenal, visual, conscious experience (see Perspective below).

===Perspective===

Perspective describes how light from three dimensional objects is mapped onto a two dimensional surface as a result of the action of lenses of the type found in the eye.

[[Image:Constudperspective.png]]

Perspective is used by artists to create the impression of viewing a 3D scene.  To do this they create a 2D image that is similar to the image on the retina that would be created by the 3D scene.

[[Image:Constudperspective2.png]]

Naive Realists and many Direct Realists believe that the 2D perspective view is the way things are actually arranged in the world.  Of course, things in the world differ from images because they are arranged in three dimensions.

===Colour===

The colour of an object can be represented by its '''spectral power distribution''' which is a plot of the power available at each wavelength. The unit of light power is the watt but the unit that is used to measure subjective illumination is the  '''candela'''.   One candela is the illumination due to light of a wavelength of 555 nanometres and a radiant intensity of 1/683 watts per steradian in the direction being measured.  A steradian is a solid angle at the centre of sphere of one metre radius that is subtended by one square metre of the surface. The curious number 1/683 occurs because the unit was originally based on light emitted from a square centimetre of molten platinum.  The wavelength of 555 nm is chosen because this is the wavelength of peak sensitivity for light adapted (photopic) vision over a large group of subjects. Light adapted vision is largely due to photosensitive cells in the retina called '''cones'''. The candela is fixed as a standard SI Unit for light at a wavelength of 555 nanometres.

The '''lumen''' is a subjective measure of the flux of light energy passing through a solid angle (a steradian). 683 lumens of light at 555 nm are equivalent to a watt passing through the solid angle. At a wavelength of about 520 nm only 500 lumens of luminous flux occur per watt because the visual system is less sensitive at this wavelength. The curve of sensitivity of the visual system to light is known as the '''V-lambda Curve'''. At a wavelength of about 510 nm the same radiant intensity is seen as being half as bright as at a wavelength of 555 nm.

Dark adapted (scotopic) vision has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of 507 nm and is largely due to photosensitive cells called '''rods''' in the retina. Spectral Luminous Efficacy Curves are also used to express how the sensitivity to light varies with wavelength.

Phenomenal colours are due to mixtures of '''spectral colours''' of varying intensities.  A '''spectral colour''' corresponds to a wavelength of light found on the electromagnetic spectrum of visible light.  Colours have three attributes:  '''brightness''', '''saturation''' and '''hue'''.  The brightness of a colour depends on the illuminance and the reflectivity of the surface. The saturation depends on the amount of white present, for instance white and red make pink.  The hue is similar to spectral colour but can consist of some combinations - for instance magenta is a hue but combines two spectral colours: red and blue. It should be noted that experiences that contain colour are dependent on the properties of the visual system as much as on the wavelengths of light being reflected.

Any set of three colours that can be added together to give white are known as '''primary colours'''.  There are a large number of colours that can be combined to make white, or almost any other colour.  This means that a set of surfaces that all appear white could reflect a wide range of different wavelengths of light.

There are numerous systems for predicting how colours will combine to make other colours;  the CIE Chromaticity Diagram, the Munsell Colour System and the Ostwald Colour System have all been used.  The 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram is shown below:

See [[w:Chromaticity diagram|Chromaticity diagram]] for more information.

===The retina===
The retina contains photoreceptive cells called rods and cones and several types of neurons. The rods are generally sensitive to light and there are three varieties of cones sensitive to long, medium and short wavelengths of light (L, M and S type cones). Some of the ganglion cells in the retina (about 2%) are also slightly light sensitive and provide input for the control of circadian rhythms. A schematic diagram of the retina is shown below.

[[Image:Constudretina.png]]

The photoreceptors hyperpolarise (their membrane potential becomes more negative) in response to illumination. Bipolar cells make direct contact with the photoreceptors and come in two types, ''on'' and ''off''.  The on-bipolar cells are also known as ''invaginating'' bipolars and the off-bipolars as ''flat bipolars''. On-bipolars depolarise when light falls on the photoreceptors and off-bipolars hyperpolarise.  Action potentials do not occur in the bipolar or photoreceptor cells.

The retinal neurons perform considerable preprocessing before submitting information to the brain.  The network of horizontal and ganglion neurons act to produce an output of action potentials that is sensitive to boundaries between areas of differing illumination (edge detection) and to motion.

Kuffler in 1953 discovered that many retinal ganglion cells are responsive to differences in illumination on the retina.  This '''centre-surround''' processing is shown in the illustration below.

[[Image:Constudcentresurr.png]]

The centre-surround effect is due to '''lateral inhibition''' by horizontally arranged cells in the retina.

The structure of the response fields of ganglion cells is important in everyday processing and increases the definition of boundaries in the visual field.  Sometimes it gives rise to effects that are not directly related to the physical content of the visual field. The most famous of these effects is the Hermann Illusion.  The Hermann Grid Illusion is a set of black squares separated by white lines. Where the white lines cross it appears as if there are grey dots.

[[Image:Hermann grid.jpg]]

The grey dots are due to the relative suppression of on-centre ganglion cells where the white lines cross.  This is explained in the illustration below.

[[Image:Constudillfld.png]]

Notice how the grey dots disappear when the crossed white lines are at the centre of the visual field. This is due to way that ganglion cell fields are much smaller in the fovea.

There are many other retinal illusions. White's illusion is particularly strong and was believed to be due to  centre-surround activity but is now thought to have a complex origin. 

[[Image:constudwhites.gif]]

The grey lines really are the same shade of grey in the illustration. Mach's Illusion is another example of a centre-surround effect. Centre-surround effects can also occur with colour fields, red/green and yellow/blue contrasts having a similar effect to light/dark contrasts.

Lateral inhibition and the resultant centre-surround effect increases the number of cells that respond to boundaries and edges in the visual field.  If it did not occur then small boundaries might be missed entirely if these fell on areas of the retina outside of the fovea. The result of this effect is everywhere in our normal visual phenomenal experience so not only is visual experience a mapping of 3D on to a 2D surface, it also contains shading and brightening at edges that will not be found by photometers that measure objective light intensities. 

Photoreceptors become less responsive after continuous exposure to bright light. This gives rise to '''afterimages'''. Afterimages are usually of the opponent colour (white light gives a dark afterimage, yellow light gives a blue afterimage, red gives a green afterimage etc.).  Afterimages when the eyes are open are generally due to a lack of response to a particular frequency of light within the white light that bathes the retina.

It is clear that visual phenomenal experience is related more directly to the layout and type of activity in the retinal cells than to things in the visual field beyond the eye.

===Visual pathways===

[[Image:Constudeyepath.png]]

===The lateral geniculate nucleus===

Retinal ganglion cells project to the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei which are small bumps on the back of the thalamus. (Only 10-15% of the input to the LGN comes from the retina, most (c.80%) comes from the visual cortex).  The neurons in the LGN are arranged retinotopically so preserve the layout of events on the surface of the retina.

The LGN are arranged in 6 layers. The top two are known as Magnocellular layers (about 100,000 neurons with large cell bodies) and the bottom four are called Parvocellular layers (about 1,000,000 neurons with small cell bodies). Between the main layers are the Koniocellular layers that consist of large numbers of tiny neurons.

The left Lateral Geniculate Nucleus receives input from the right visual field and the right LGN receives input from the left visual field.  Each nucleus receives input from both eyes but this input is segregated so that input from the eye on the same side goes to layers 1, 3, 5 and from the other side to layers 2,4, 6.

The magnocellular layers contain neurons that have a large receptive field, are sensitive to contrast, a transient response and are not colour sensitive.  The parvocellular layers contains neurons that have small receptive fields, are colour sensitive, have a prolonged response and are less sensitive to contrast.

The LGN pathway from the retina is largely connected to the striate part of the visual cortex (cortical area V1) via a set of fibres called the optic radiation. There are reciprocal connections between the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus and the LGN.  The LGN are also interconnected with the Superior Colliculus and brainstem.

The LGN may be involved in controlling which areas of the visual field are subjected to attention (O'Connor ''et al.'' 2002).

===The visual cortex===

The input from the LGN goes mainly to area V1 of the cortex.  The cortex is arranged in six layers and divided up into '''columns'''.  Each column in the visual cortex corresponds to a particular area of the retina in one eye. The columns are arranged in rows called '''hypercolumns'''.  Each column within a hypercolumn responds to a different orientation of an optical stimulus at a given location (so responds to edges/boundaries that are oriented in the visual field).  Hypercolumns from each eye are arranged alternately and form a small block of cortex called a '''pinwheel'''.  At the centre of each pinwheel are colour sensitive cells that are usually not orientation sensitive. These coincide with the &quot;blobs&quot; that are seen when visual cortex is viewed using cytochrome oxidase dependent stains.  It is important to note that the &quot;hypercolumns&quot; merge into one another and respond to line stimuli that cover an area of retina so they may be physiological rather than anatomical entities.

The blind spot in each eye is represented by an area of visual cortex that only receives monocular input from the other eye (Tong &amp; Engel 2001).  The effect of the blind spot is illustrated below:

[[Image:constudblindspot.gif]]

Normally it seems that the blindspot is 'filled in' with background when one eye is used. However, Lou &amp; Chen (2003) demonstrated that subjects could respond to quite complex figures in the blind spot, although how far they were investigating 'blindsight' rather than visual experience in the blind spot is difficult to determine.

Different layers in the visual cortex have outputs that go to different locations. Layer 6 sends nerve fibres to the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei and thalamus, layer 5 to superior colliculus and pons, layer 2 &amp; 3 to other cortical areas.

There are two important outputs to other cortical areas, the '''ventral stream''' and the '''dorsal stream'''.  The ventral stream processes colour, form and objects. It proceeds to the inferior (lower) temporal cortex.  The dorsal stream processes motion, position and spatial relationships. It proceeds towards the parietal cortex. Lesions in the ventral stream can result in patients knowing where an object is located but being unable to enumerate its properties, on the other hand, lesions to the dorsal stream can result in patients being able to label an object but unable to tell exactly where it is located.

There is also a large output from the visual cortex back to the thalamus, this output contains more fibres than the thalamo-cortical input.

===Depth perception===

The world is three dimensional but the image on the back of the retinas is two dimensional. How does the brain give the subject a perception of depth?

Depth perception relies on '''cues''' which are data about the displacement of things relative to the body.  These cues consist of:

* the convergence of the eyes 
* the accommodation of the lens 
* binocular disparity -the difference between the images on the retinas- this was first suggested by Wheatstone.
* motion parallax - distant objects move slower when the observer moves - first suggested by Helmholtz.
* optical flow - the rate of expansion/contraction of a scene with movement towards or away from it  (Lee &amp; Aronson 1974).
* binocular occlusion - parts of a scene are invisible to each eye.
* body motion provides cues about near objects.
* vanishing points - the convergence of parallel lines.
* numerous other cues such as size constancy, texture etc.

Binocular disparity has been most extensively studied as a source of depth cues. When the eyes converge to focus on an object in from of them there is very little disparity in the images of that object on the two retinas. The angle at the object formed between the lines that project back to the pupils is known as the '''vergence''' at the object. The sphere where all objects have the same vergence is known as the '''horopter'''.

[[Image:Constudverge.png]]

When the disparity between the retinas is small a single image occurs in phenomenal experience which is accompanied by a sensation of objects with depth. This is known as '''stereopsis'''. If the disparity between the retinas is large double vision ensues, this is known as '''diplopia'''. The curious feature of stereopsis is that we can see no more of the object than is visible on the retinas and certainly cannot see behind the object. Stereopsis is more like a stretching of 2D space than actual 3D.

The '''empirical horopter''' is a zone where things are seen without diplopia.  The empirical and '''Veith Muller''' (geometric) horopters are different.  This difference is the result of both processing by the CNS and optical factors.  

'''Physiological diplopia''' refers to the stimulation of receptors in different parts of the retinas of the two eyes by the same object.  Physiological diplopia does not always give rise to subjective diplopia, objects close to the empirical horopter do not give rise to double vision and the zone in which this occurs is known as '''Panum's Fusion Area'''.  It is widest for objects that are distributed away from the nose (with 'temporal' locations) and for objects that are slow moving and poorly focussed.

In the review by Cutting and Vishton (1995) the contributions of each type of cue is discussed. Cutting and Vishton also present evidence that there are several zones of depth perception that are informed by different sets of cues. These are '''personal space''', which is the zone of things within arms reach, '''action space''', which is the zone in which we interact and where our motions have a large impact on the perceived layout,  and '''vista space''' which is the zone beyond about 30m that is informed by long range cues. 

The interesting feature of 3D perceptual space is that it is not seen. The sides of a solid object appear as intrusions or lateral extensions in 2D space, when we close an eye that has access to the side of the object and then open it again the side grows out into 2D space. The lack of 'seeing' depth is also evident when we close one eye when looking at a vista - nothing seems to change even though stereopsis has gone. This leaves the problem of what it is that constitutes the 'feeling' of depth. We have feelings that we can fall into space or move into it or around in it.  Depth seems to be defined by premotor modelling and the potential for occupancy by our bodies and limbs. As such it involves qualia that are different from those of vision and more akin to those that accompany movement, as an example, if you reach out to touch something, move the hand back, then consider the distance to the object it is evident that a feeling of the movement is still present. Is depth a quale of movement modelled during the extended present of perception?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Analogue''' electronics handles analogue signals. '''Analogue''' signals are signals having continuously varying amplitudes with respect to the time. For example the loudspeaker of a TV set or of a radio receives a voltage that usually is continually changing, which in turn causes a current to flow that changes in the same way and that activates the speaker cone to move, causing sound. This is an '''analogue''' device. 

'''Digital''' electronics handles digital signals. Digital signals are discrete signals. They have constant amplitude for a specific time period. Walking could be regarded as similar to a digital device. The number of steps per minute can vary, but each step is usually nearly the same. A digital signal can be regarded as a number &quot;packages&quot; that are almost the same, but the number of these packages that are delivered per minute varies. 

In another context, there are analogue [[w:Watch|watches]] and digital watches. The analogue watches have a minute hand and an hour hand, they keep moving all the time, while a digital watch has numbers showing, they change only once in a while.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Induction on a Summation Comment==
Was on the main page:
:[TODO: I added a proof for the closed form of the sum of the first n numbers, but I don't see how this helps insertion sort, so maybe this isn't the proof you were thinking of. - Nebu Pookins.]
Reply: That's exactly the proof needed, thanks! I'll read through it to look for any minor errors. It can help for the analysis of insertion sort, that being, an upper-bound on the number of compares for n elements. To find the first min, you need to do n-1 compares, to find the next min, you need to do n-2 compares, ... and so on, so the number of compares can be computed using this formula. I suppose while we're on the topic I should note that it might be nice if this series of books would always do more than just the regular &quot;O(f(n))&quot; analysis. For example, instead of just number of steps for sorting, it could be number of steps, number of swaps (if applicable), and number of compares. For hashtables, it will be expected lookup (O(1)), but also what the complexity of hashing a key is (O(k) where k is the key). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:49, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

If this article is to be of practical use, I recommend that the focus be placed primarily on more generalized and academic private pilot information as opposed to specific procedures, as someone who has not yet begun their training as a private pilot will little context or use for such information, while someone who has already begun their training should have access to more accurate and reliable sources. --[[User:67.123.165.163|67.123.165.163]] 02:20, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

all right, i'm going to revise it all a little as we go, but eventually, i'd like to have created a resource on the web that could give you all the stuff they put in those expensive training books, for free!  I dunno, maybe it won't be that easy.  Should I make a table of contents to organize this stuff, or should I simply remove it?

Many public, free sources of information about learning to fly are already available, especially for those who want to earn a pilot certificate, add a rating, or learn more about flying in the U.S. For example:

For information about learning to fly, see:

AOPA Learn to Fly page: http://www.aopa.org/learntofly/)

AOPA Flight Training Learn to Fly: http://flighttraining.aopa.org/learntofly/
Be a Pilot: http://www.beapilot.com/indexfl.html


The FAA offers many complete, public-domain training handbooks for free download in PDF format. These books are the official references for many pilot certificates and ratings. You can find the current list at: http://www.faasafety.gov/onlineresources.aspx?categoryId=47&amp;masterId=1

The following books available via the previous link are of particular interest:

The ''Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge'' (FAA-H-8083-25) is for aviators training for a private pilot certificate-and for pilots who want to refresh their knowledge of the fundamentals. It introduces pilots to the theory and practical knowledge they will need as they progress in their pilot training from aerodynamics, engines, flight instruments, and navigation to avionics, weather, and airspace.

This 352-page handbook is available for download in PDF format in four parts (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4).

http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/ 

Contents
Chapter 1-Aircraft Structure
Chapter 2-Principles of Flight
Chapter 3-Aerodynamics of Flight
Chapter 4-Flight Controls
Chapter 5-Aircraft Systems
Chapter 6-Flight Instruments
Chapter 7-Flight Manuals and Other Documents
Chapter 8-Weight and Balance
Chapter 9-Aircraft Performance
Chapter 10-Weather Theory
Chapter 11-Weather Reports, Forecasts, and Charts
Chapter 12-Airport Operations
Chapter 13-Airspace
Chapter 14-Navigation
Chapter 15-Aeromedical Factors
Chapter 16-Aeronautical Decision Making

The ''Airplane Flying Handbook'' (FAA-H-8083-3A) is the hands-on, how-to guide to flying all the maneuvers required for the private pilot and commercial pilot certificates. It is designed to assist student pilots learning to fly airplanes and to help current pilots and flight instructors expand their knowledge and skills. It's also one of the official references that pilot examiners use when testing the flying skills of pilots who are taking check rides.

This 210-page handbook is available for download in seven parts (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, and Part 7) in PDF format.

Chapter 16-Transition to Seaplanes
Chapter 17-Transition to Skiplanes
Chapter 18-Aeronautical Decision Making

The ''Instrument Flying Handbook'' (FAA-H-8083-15) is the FAA's guide to all of the aeronautical knowledge and skills required to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). It is designed for pilots training for an instrument rating, and for the instrument flight instructors who teach them. The ''Instrument Flying Handbook'' includes both theory and practical guidance on how to operate an aircraft solely by reference to instruments, from filing a flight plan and working with ATC to maintaining straight-and-level flight, flying DME arcs and holding patterns, and shooting ILS approaches.

This 280-page handbook is available for download in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2) in PDF format.

The ''Instrument Procedures Handbook'', a guide for advanced instrument pilots published by the FAA, is available for free download at:

http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/instrument_procedures_handbook/

The ''Aeronautical Chart User's Guide''

To learn more about aviation charts, you can download the Aeronautical Chart User's Guide (available in several parts in PDF format) from the FAA's National Aviation Charting Office (NACO): http://www.naco.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=naco/online/aero_guide

FAA regulations (FARs), the Aeronautical Information Manual, and many other references of interest to pilots, are available free online in both HTML and PDF format at http://www.faa.gov/atpubs/.

A wealth of practical information for pilots is also available free from the AOPA Air Safety Foundation's Online Safety Center at http://www.aopa.org/asf/. Resources include a variety publications in PDF format, free online courses, etc.

You can also find much free information about weather, avionics, and other subjects on the Web. For example, most manufacturers of GPS navigation gear offer their user manuals, PC-based simulators, training syllabi, and other resources via their Web sites. You needn't be an owner of the equipment to download the information and resources. See, for example, http://www.garmin.com/aviation/products.html#panel-mount.

== Subpages ==

I broke this into subpages directly following the top-level headings that were already present. In some cases, I think this leaves chapters that have too narrow a scope, but it seemed better to have it split down so that people could work on it. If someone wants to join some of the chapters together (or restructure them entirely) feel free. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 22:31, 12 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

I'm not quite sure what this is all about. The title would tend to suggest it's a guide to solutions to wiki-related things. Is this supposed to be like a catalog of open-source software? Perhaps a better name might be in order?

Also we don't really like users using very short category names like [[:Category:WS]]. Have a look at [[WB:NP]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:33, 11 August 2005 (UTC)


* Is not supposed to be a catalog, and not only about Open Source.  For now it is like this because OS is what is intresting for me. ut someone else can come and write pages about Proprietary software or even not related to computers maybe. Also tips and links to web resources for programmers or for system administrators. It can contain anythink usefull for whoever want to contribute.
* It is not good to call it catalog, list of, collection, database, etc because first of all there are already lists of on Wikipedia, and seccond, it means that everything is only a place to find mass-organised information that you still nead to process to find anything close to what you are searching for.  A better way to call it should be solutions, guidance, guides, expert advice, advice, customised  or special information. Some time people search for a very precise thing, and it is better to have a page that describes exactly what options he has for his very personalised and particular probem. It is about customisation, giving people exactly want to allow this.hat he is searching for and what are the posibilities for exactly what he is searching. This is why many pages are only about open source because this is what i am intrested in. Someone else whout also be intrested in proprietary software or anything else.
* A better name its ok. Maybe Wikiguidance is a good one, or Wikiadvice.
* The category WS is mostly used to include other categories and is supposed to contain a limited number of pages. About the other categories, for example,  WS/S:Name they can be changed into  Wikisolutions/Software:Name but this will make huge Categoty names and it is only for that reason i have used WS/S:Name.
* A change of name and even more of how categories and pages are named, should be done by a script, because it is quite difficult to do it manualy. Also i think if the project should stay on Wikibooks. It is a little special for a book but i think Wikibooks is the best place to put it on wikimedia.

: This sounds like a completely new project, and as such, we do not allow the use of Wikibooks to develop new projects, especially ones with goals as vague as &quot;It can contain anythink usefull for whoever want to contribute.&quot; People might consider it &quot;useful&quot; to contribute hardcore pornography, but we really don't w    roject is sufficiently different, they will grant you your own wiki on which to develop it. - Aya T C 16:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

: See [[Wikibooks:About]] for details of our project's goals. See also: [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Wikiversity]] for another example of a project that is in the process of being relocated. Note that [http://www.wikicities.com/ Wikicities] is a good place to start new projects, although they will only allow projects which are sufficiently dissimilar to ones they already host. This project you describle sounds somewhat similar to [http://answers.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Wikianswers], but if you can convince the admins there that your project is sufficiently different, they will grant you your own wiki on which to develop it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)


: Ok, i agree the project should be relocated since this will alow better definitions of rules. I am not intrested &quot;to contribute hardcore pornography&quot; but if someone is intrested in this maybe it is better to have less restrictive rules to avoid one or more forks in the future.

: Wikianswars is a good starting point, and it neads two rules: avoid to have two questions with the same answer(forks) and answers should be of two types: some that present the answer if it is simple and fully documented and unique. If the answer is not unique or simple then it should point to other web sites or wikis that try to give answers. In other words some answers cannot be given completly and should be redirected to more competent web sites. This type of answer is what wikisolutions was supposed to be.

: I will think about how to make the relocation (even if i don't like google adds and would like to see wikianswers relocated to meta or a new mediawiki project). First only important rules should be kept, the other will be only sugestions on my personal page. Seccond, all depends on  how people on wikianswers agree. If they do not agree to give complete answers or give external links if the answer is not unique then we nead two projects: one with simple &quot;embeded&quot; answers and the other with &quot;links to external solutions/answers&quot;. (example: what are the free linux drivers for audio?  must be a question that use external links and not try list the drivers inside the answer, witch is impossible to be complete and up to date)

: Relocation will take time. I will say on the main page that the project is relocating and all contributions should be done to wikianswers, but it may take time untill the merge is done. It should be nice and good to keep the pages in wikibooks until then with no new contributions. [[User:Moa3333|Moa3333]] 21:48, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

: [http://answers.wikicities.com/wiki/Talk:Main_Page#Future_of_Wikianswers here] is Wikianswers discussion page [[User:Moa3333|Moa3333]] 22:12, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

::Hello Moa3333. I've replied at [[Wikicities:c:answers:Talk:Main Page|Wikianswers]], which I don't think is the best location for this content. If you want to discuss this, my talk page at [[meta:User talk:Angela|meta]] (if you want to keep this in Wikimedia), or my talk page at [[Wikicities:User talk:Angela|Wikicities]] (if you want a wiki there), would be best since i check those more often than I check Wikibooks or Wikianswers. [[User:Angela|Angela]]

: Project migration finished. New project is caled [http://en.howto.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page the HowTo project].

== Status of [[Wikisolutions]] ==

This is more of a followup.  You had some discussions earlier with [[User:Aya]] about this project, and it is clear that the bulk of the project has been moved to Wikicities.  I would like some confirmation on that, and to decide what to do with the content on Wikibooks.  I could put this up for a VfD, but if you, the primary author for most of this content were to agree that it needs to be deleted, it will go.  There is quite a bit of material there, and I just want to make sure you have everything you are looking for and want to copy out before it disappears.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:31, 5 February 2006 (UTC)


Usualy all the pages are in the ne WikiHowTo project on wikicities since September 2005 or so. They were also modified since then, so the pages here are now old. It is ok to delete all pages, excetping the main page with the redirect. [[User:Moa3333|Moa3333]] 21:32, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

{{compactTOC}}

== A ==

* '''[[w:Alpha compositing|Alpha Channel]]''' is an additional channel in a 2D image for transparency. In an image element which stores a color for each pixel, an additional value is stored in the alpha channel containing a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel does not have any coverage information; i.e. there was no color contribution from any geometry because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is fully opaque because the geometry completely overlapped the pixel.

* '''Ambient Light''' is light that doesn't seem to come from a specific source, but is just there. Look under the desk - it's pretty dark, but there's some light there. In the real world, this is caused by stray photons bouncing around and occasionally ricocheting under the desk. Ambient light is the basic, minimal amount of light in the whole scene. Adding too much ambient light makes a scene look washed out. Since the light doesn't come from anywhere, all sides of an object are illuminated equally, and it won't have any shading on it. 

* '''[[w:Ambient occlusion|Ambient Occlusion]]''' (AO) is a ratio of how much ambient light a surface point would be likely to receive. It simulates a huge dome light surrounding the entire scene.  If a surface point is under a foot or table, it will end up much darker than the top of someone's head or the tabletop.

* '''[[w:armature_(sculpture)|Armature]]''' is the interconnection of bones that form the skeleton of an animated figure. The Inverse Kinematics library contains the code to make armatures move. The armature must still be [[w:rigging|rigged]] with 3D objects to give shape to its head, hands, trunk, feet, etc.

== B ==
*'''Background image''': a 2D image (&quot;picture&quot;) that is placed &quot;behind&quot; the entire 3D scene, like a backdrop on a movie set. Blender permits the placement of these images in all six directions from the origin: back, front, top, bottom, left, right.
*'''Bake''': to precompute computationally-intensive elements of an animation. For example, in a physics simulation involving the behaviour of fluids or clothing, you would set up the physical parameters, then compute (''bake'') the positions and shapes of the objects over the duration of the animation. Afterwards, you can assign materials and lighting, and then render the frames to produce the actual animation. Doing the baking as a separate step, and saving the results from that, means you can change your mind about the materials and lighting and rerender the frames more quickly.
* '''[[w:Bézier surface|Bézier surfaces]]''' were first described in 1972 by the French engineer Pierre Bézier who used them to design automobile bodies. Bézier surfaces can be of any degree, but bicubic Bézier surfaces generally provide enough degrees of freedom for most applications.

* '''BF''' is Blender Foundation

* '''Blend''' - ''to Blend'', working with Blender; also Blender's file extension.

* '''Bounce Light''': Simple lighting situations have a single light, called a key light, illuminating one side of an object. This creates strong shading and definition of the volume of the object. However, a 3D light will often make the contrast too great - the dark side of the object is completely black since no light is hitting it. In reality it would still be lit a little, just not as much as the brightly lit side, because of light bouncing around the room and hitting the dark side of the object. In realtime 3D, bounce light is not calculated, so you have to create it yourself. Either add a little ambient color, or put a second, less bright directional light pointing the opposite direction to give a little light to the shadows.

* '''[[w:Bump mapping|Bump mapping]]''' is a technique where at each pixel, a perturbation to the surface normal of the object being rendered is looked up in a texture map and applied before the illumination calculation is done. Bump Mapping use a gray-scale image map to change the direction of surface normals. You can use this to simulate height, so that you can paint wrinkles and bumps. 50 % grey means neutral (no change is made), lighter means higher, darker means lower. Note that the position of faces is not actually changed; by rotating just the normals, lighting will change too, to give the illusion of a height difference. This has downsides too: the outline of objects isn't changed, so the trick is given away. For similar effects you can use Displacement Mapping and Normal Mapping.

== C ==

* '''Caustics''' in optics is a bundle of light rays. For example a caustic effect may be seen when light refracts or reflects through some refractive or reflective material, to create a more focused, stronger light on the final location. Such amplification, especially of sunlight, can burn &amp;mdash; hence the name. A common situation when caustics are visible is when some light points on glass. There is a shadow behind the glass, but also there is a stronger light spot. Nowadays, almost every advanced rendering system supports caustics. Some of them even support volumetric caustics. This is accomplished by raytracing the possible paths of the light beam through the glass, accounting for the refraction, reflection, etc.

== D ==

* '''[[w:Depth of field|Depth of Field]]''' (DOF) is the distance in front of and behind the subject which appears to be in focus. For any given lens setting, there is only one distance at which a subject is precisely in focus, but focus falls off gradually on either side of that distance, so there is a region in which the blurring is tolerable. This region is greater behind the point of focus than it is in front, as the angle of the light rays change more rapidly; they approach being parallel with increasing distance.

* '''Diffuse Light''' is even, directed light coming off a surface. For most things, the diffuse light is the main lighting we see. Diffuse light comes from a specific direction or location, and creates shading. Surfaces facing towards the light source will be brighter, while surfaces facing away from the light source will be darker.

* '''Directional Light''' is a light that has a specific direction, but no location. It seems to come from an infinitely far away source, like the sun. Surfaces facing the light are illuminated more than surfaces facing away, but their location doesn't matter. A Directional Light illuminates all objects in the scene, no matter where they are.

* '''[[w:Displacement mapping|Displacement Mapping]]''' uses a greyscale heightmap, like Bump Mapping, but the image is used to physically move the vertices of the mesh at render time. This is of course only useful if the mesh has large amounts of vertices, but the (relatively) new &quot;Simple Subdiv&quot; subsurf option allows you to add more vertices at render time which will be moved by the displacement. This makes it much slower than Bump Mapping, as there need to be many more faces to render, but it is much more realistic.

== E ==

* '''Environment Maps''' (EnvMaps) is the method of calculating reflections. Involved rendering images at strategic positions and applying them as textures to the mirror. Now in most cases obsoleted by Raytracing, which though slower is easier to use and more accurate.

== F ==

* '''[[w:Focal length|Focal Length]]''' of a lens is the distance along the optical axis from the lens to the focus (or focal point). The inverse of a lens' focal length is called its power.

* '''[[w:Focus (optics)|Focus]]''' of a lens is the point onto which collimated light parallel to the axis is focused.

* '''Foreshortening'''

* '''[[w:Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]]''' lens is a type of lens invented by Augustin-Jean Fresnel. Originally developed for lighthouses, the design enables the construction of lenses of large size and short focal length without the weight and volume of material which would be required in a lens of conventional design.

== G ==

* '''GE''' is Game Engine.

* '''[[w:Global illumination|Global Illumination]]''' (GI) is a superset of radiosity and ray tracing. The goal is to compute all possible light interactions in a given scene, and thus obtain a truly photorealistic image. All combinations of diffuse and specular reflections and transmissions must be accounted for. Effects such as colour bleeding and caustics must be included in a global illumination simulation.

* '''[[w:Gouraud shading|Gouraud shading]]''' is a method used in computer graphics to simulate the differing effects of light and colour across the surface of an object. In practice, Gouraud shading is used to achieve smooth lighting on low-polygon surfaces without the heavy computational requirements of calculating lighting for each pixel. The technique was first presented by Henri Gouraud in 1971.

== H ==

* '''[[w:High dynamic range imaging|High Dynamic Range Image]]''' (HDRI) is a set of techniques that allow a far greater dynamic range of exposures than normal digital imaging techniques. The intention is to accurately represent the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes, ranging from direct sunlight to the deepest shadows. The use of high dynamic range imaging in computer graphics has been popularised by the work of Paul Debevec. Blender uses Yafray for these techniques.

== I ==

* '''[[w:Refractive index|Index Of Refraction]]''' (IOR) is about the way that light passes through different types of materials... diamond, glass, water etc. When a light ray travels through the same volume it follows a straight path. However if it passes from one transparent volume to another, it bends. This is why a straw in water looks bent. The amount of bending differs between materials. The angle by which the ray is bent can be determined by knowing two things: the angle at which the incoming ray has been cast and the Index of Refraction. This IOR value is unique for every material. Glass has an IOR of about 1.5 and water 1.3. By increasing the IOR value for a Blender material, you can control how much the environment behind the transparent object is distorted, and thus improving the realism of the shader. 

* '''[[w:Interpolation|Interpolation]]''' (IPO) is an animation curve: it indicates how the object must &quot;move&quot; between an initial and a final position, at the rate determined by the rendering engine. Objects can be animated in many ways. They can be animated as Objects, changing their position, orientation or size in time; they can be animated by deforming them; that is animating their vertices or control points; or they can be animated via very complex and flexible interaction with a special kind of object: the Armature.

* '''[[w:Inverse kinematics|Inverse Kinematics]]''' (IK) is the process of determining the movement of interconnected segments of a body or model, starting from the desired motion of the endpoints of the armature. Using ordinary Kinematics on a hierarchically structured object you can for example move the shoulder of a puppet. The upper and lower arm and hand will automatically follow that movement. IK will allow you to move the hand and let the lower and upper arm go along with the movement. Without IK the hand would come off the model and would move independently in space. The Blender Armature System includes Inverse Kinematics. For general armatures there are many possible solutions to the IK.

== J ==

* '''[[w:JPEG|JPEG]]''' Acronym for Joint Photographic Expert Group (pronounced jay-peg) is a commonly used standard method of lossy compression for photographic images. The file format which employs this compression is commonly also called JPEG; the most common file extensions for this format are .jpeg, .jfif, .jpg, .JPG, or .JPE although .jpg is the most common on all platforms.

== K ==

* '''Keyframe''' is a frame in an animated sequence of frames that was drawn or otherwise constructed directly by the user. When all frames were drawn by animators, the senior artist would draw these frames, leaving the &quot;in between&quot; frames to an apprentice. Now, the animator creates only the first and last frames of a simple sequence; the computer fills in the gap. This is called tweening.

== L ==

* '''[[w:Luminosity|Luminosity]]''' (more properly called luminance) is the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. In astronomy, luminosity is the amount of energy a body radiates per unit time. It is typically expressed in the SI units watts, in the cgs units ergs per second, or in terms of solar luminosities, Ls; that is, how many times more energy the object radiates than the Sun, whose luminosity is 3.827×1026 W.

== M ==

*  '''[[w:Motion blur|Motion Blur]]''' is the simulation of the phenomenon that occurs when we perceive a rapidly moving object. The object appears to be blurred because of our persistence of vision. Doing motion blur makes computer animation appear more realistic. It can be thought of as adding back some of the time dependence expressed in the Rendering Equation.

== N ==

* '''[[w:Del|Nabla]]'''. ''Ton wrote:'' Almost all procedural textures in Blender use derivatives for calculating normals for texture mapping (with as exception &quot;Blend&quot; and &quot;Magic). The texture normal, the derivative, is calculated by using four samples in the texture formula:
 
 s0= texture(x, y, z)
 s1= texture(x+nabla, y, z)
 s2= texture(x, y+nabla, z)
 s3= texture(x, y, z+nabla)

 normal[0]= s0-s1
 normal[1]= s0-s2
 normal[2]= s0-s3 

Up to now, the &quot;nabla&quot; offset was a constant (0.025) which worked fine in most cases, but doesn't give proper control over the way a texture is sampled, for example to make the effect smoother or sharper. This feature especially is useful in combination with the ColorBand feature.

* '''Non-Linear Animation''' (NLA) allows the animator to edit motions as a whole, not just the individual keys. Nonlinear animation is not just about editing and manipulating groups of keyframes, but it also allows you to combine, mix, and blend motions to create entirely new animations.

* '''[[w:Nonuniform rational B-spline|Nonuniform Rational B-Splines]]''' (NURBS) is a computer graphics technique for generating and representing curves and surfaces.

* '''Normal''' (Surface Normal) to a flat surface is a three-dimensional vector which is perpendicular to that surface. A normal to a non-flat surface at a point p on the surface is a vector which is perpendicular to the tangent plane to that surface at p.

* '''Normal Mapping''' is similar to Bump Mapping, but instead of the image being a greyscale heightmap, the colours define in which direction the normal should be shifted, the 3 colour channels being mapped to the 3 directions X, Y and Z. This allows more detail and control over the effect.

== O ==

* '''[http://orange.blender.org Orange]''' is the first Blender open movie project.

* '''Oversampling''' (OSA), also called '''Anti-Aliasing''' is the technique of minimizing aliasing when representing a high-resolution signal at a lower resolution. In most cases, anti-aliasing means removing data at too high a frequency to represent. When such data is left in a signal, it causes unpredictable artifacts.

== P ==

* '''Phong''' shading term is used indiscriminately to describe both an illumination model and an interpolation method in 3D computer graphics. Phong reflection is a local illumination model and can produce a certain degree of realism in three-dimensional objects by combining three elements - diffuse, specular and ambient for each considered point on a surface. It has several assumptions - all lights are points, only surface geometry is considered, only local modelling of diffuse and specular, specular colour is the same as light colour, ambient is a global constant.

* '''Point Light''' is a light that has a specific location and radiates equally out in all directions. Examples of point lights would be candles or bare lightbulbs. Surfaces close to the point light are brighter than those which are far away. Point lights have attenuation, which controls how quickly the light intensity drops off as you move away from it. Lights with high attenuation are very localized, while lights with low attenuation will spread farther.

* '''Polygonization''' ''(of meta-surfaces)'' is the process of approximating the meta-surface via polygons so it can be displayed/rendered in Blender.

* '''Purple''' runs as a normal Verse client. It implements a node database to mirror the contents of its host. It loads the plug-ins, which reside in libraries, from local disk as DLLs or shared objects depending on the platform.

== Q ==
* '''[[w:quaternion|Quaternion]]''' is a representation of 3D rotations with four numbers. It can be interpreted as an extension of complex numbers to 3D. The interpretation of the four numbers is not very intuitive for a human, but the numerical advantage of quaternions is that it is the smallest mathematical representation that does not suffer from the [[w:gimbal lock|gimbal lock]] [[w:mathematical singularity|singularity]] problem. This problem occurs for example with [[w:euler angles|Euler angle]] representations, when a small change in the 3D orientation can give rise to a large change in Euler angles.

== R ==

* '''Radiosity''' is a more accurate but also more process-intensive technique than raytracing, that calculates patterns of light and shadow for rendering graphics images from three-dimensional models. One of the many different tools which can simulate diffuse lighting in Blender.

* '''Raytracing''' works by tracing the path taken by a ray of light through the scene, and calculating reflection, refraction, or absorption of the ray whenever it intersects an object in the world. More accurate than Scanline, but much slower.

* '''Render''': to generate actual viewable images from a 3D model or scene. This may or may not need to happen in real time; for example an interactive game requires real-time rendering, whereas a feature film does not. These situations require very different rendering techniques.

* '''Refraction''' in geometric optics is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in velocity. It happens when waves travel from a medium with a given refractive index to a medium with another. At the boundary between the media the wave changes direction; its wavelength increases or decreases but frequency remains constant. For example, a light ray will refract as it enters and leaves glass.

* '''Relative Vertex Keys''' (RVK) are part of a keyframe animation system that operates on vertex level objects. Each (shape) key is stored as a morph target such that several keys may be blended together to achieve complex mesh animation. With RVK you can create facial expressions, speech, and other detailed animated keyframed movements within your mesh-based models.

* '''Rig:''' the controls that aid in the manipulation of a digital character.

* '''Rigging''' is the process by which a person creates constraints and relationships between objects that will generate controls to aid in the manipulation of a digital character.

== S ==

* '''Scanline''' is one row of pixels in the final render. Also the term for one of the methods of rendering which Blender can use. It is much faster than Raytracing, but allows fewer effects, such as reflections, refractions, motion blur and focal blur.

* '''Seed''': a starting number for generating a random-looking number sequence. Using the same seed will always give you the same sequence. Technically, such a sequence is not truly random, it is only ''pseudorandom''.

* '''Shader''': an algorithm for computing the appearance of a given material based on the colour, angle and intensity of the light. ''Specular'' shaders produce a more shiny, mirrorlike finish, while ''diffuse'' shaders give a duller surface appearance. There are also ''toon'' shaders, which are deliberately designed to produce an effect more akin to a cartoon drawing, with delineated object borders and less gradation of colours over a surface.

* '''Shadows''': simulated lights don't normally cast shadows. And, they also pass through solid objects - so a light inside a closed box would actually illuminate things outside the box as if the box were transparent. The shading on objects is only calculated based on the angle of the surface.

* '''Specular Light''' refers to the highlights on reflective objects, like diamonds, billiard balls, and eyes. Specular highlights often appear as bright spots on a surface, at a point where the light source hits it directly. Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular are called the three components of a light source. Each one is given a color, which, when added together, create the final color of a light. For most lights, the main overall color of the light is defined by the Diffuse color. Sunlight or lightbulbs would be white, while moonlight would be a darker blue, and a candle would be yellow. You can use the ambient color to adjust the overall color range of the light source; or, you can get a slight tint to shadows by making the diffuse component yellow and the ambient a slight blue. In many lights, the ambient color is left at black, meaning that it won't have any effect. Specular components are often left at white, but you can make them different colors to get interesting effects. Most of the time you can completely ignore the specular and diffuse settings on a light, but just be aware that the way you set the color is by specifically setting the diffuse color. The final color that an object appears to be is a combination of the light hitting it and the color of the surface.

* '''Spotlight''' is a light with both location and direction. A spotlight sends out a cone of light defined by the spotlight angle, and illuminates only objects within that cone. Spotlights also have attenuation, as well as a parameter that controls whether the spot of light is sharply defined or has smooth edges. These 4 types of lights are listed in order of computational complexity; the more lights you have, the more work the computer has to do. Generally it's a good idea to use directional lights whenever possible, since they're the cheapest, and use pointlights and spotlights sparingly.

* '''Stucci''' is one of the classes of blender textures. ''Stucci'' is not an English word, but is used in Blender as the plural of [[w:stucco|stucco]].

* '''Subdivision Surface''' (Subsurf) is the tool which subdivides your model at render-time, without affecting your mesh at design-time. There are two subsurf algorithms in Blender to choose from - ''Simple Subdiv'', which doesn't affect the shape of your mesh, and is used to add detail to displacement mapping or render-time radiosity, both of which operate on a per-vertex basis. The other is ''Catmull-Clark'', a common subdivision algorithm which smooths out curves, and allows you to make complicated smooth surfaces (e.g. people, plants, etc.) with very few faces. However this algorithm can sometimes (read: often) have strange results with meshes containing triangles or vertices with many edges (&quot;poles&quot;), unless it is correctly handled.

* '''Sub Surface Scattering''' (SSS) is a mechanism of light transport in which light penetrates the surface of a translucent object, is scattered by interacting with the material, and exits the surface at a different point. All non-metallic materials are translucent to some degree. In particular, materials such as marble, skin, and milk are extremely difficult to simulate realistically without taking subsurface scattering into account.

* '''Tuhopuu''' is an experimental version of Blender that is like a code playground, developers can put their new code in there to be tested and played with by users before it gets put into the official Blender. Tuhopuu is Finnish for &quot;Tree of destruction&quot;.

* '''Tweening''' is short for in-betweening, the process of generating intermediate frames between two images to give the appearance that the first image evolves smoothly into the second image. Tweening is a key process in all types of animation, including computer animation. Sophisticated animation software enables one to identify specific objects in an image and define how they should move and change during the tweening process. Another word for tweening is [[w:interpolation|interpolation]].

== U ==

* '''UV Mapping''' (UV) This refers to the process of re-parameterizing a 3d object with dimensions x, y and z into a 2d plane with coordinates u and v.  Most texturing requires this step because it tells the program HOW to apply a 2d image map onto a 3d object.  If all your textures must be 2d and flat, the easiest way to determine what pixel goes where is if your model is flattened and made 2d.  It also establishes a relationship between a 2d image and the mesh such that if the mesh deforms, the image map will deform along with it.  Think of it as skinning a cat and pinning its hide onto cardboard to facilitate painting it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dione.jpg|right|220px|Dione from Voyager 1]]
'''Dione''' is a moon of the planet Saturn. It was first photographed in some detail when the Voyager 1 mission passed by Saturn in 1980. The Cassini spacecraft started taking more closeup pictures in 2004, and we now know much more about this moon.

==How big is Dione?==
Dione is 1118 km across. This is much smaller than our Moon, which is almost 3,500 km across. It is one-fifth as large as Titan, the largest moon in orbit around Saturn.

==What is its surface like?==
This is a cold, icy world with no atmosphere. The side of the moon that faces toward the direction of its orbit is covered from craters that were made by collisions with asteroids. On the back side are bright, wispy streaks across the surface. These are cliffs in the ice that were caused when the surface shifted about.

==How long is a day on Dione?==
It takes 2.74 days to complete an orbit around Saturn. This is just under 2 days and 18 hours. It also takes  the same amount of time for the moon to rotate around the axis. This means that the same side of Dione is always facing toward Saturn, in much the same was as our Moon always keeps the same face toward us.

==What is it made of?==
Dione has a covering of ice surrounding a rocky interior. It has a higher portion of rock inside than any other moon of Saturn except Titan.

==How much would Dione's gravity pull on me?==
A person standing on the surface would weigh less than one-thirtieth as much as they would on Earth.

==Who is it named after?==
This moon is named for one of the titans from Greek mythology. She was an addition to the original twelve titans mentioned by the Greek poet Hesiod.

==How was it discovered?==
It was discovered by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini in the year 1684. At the time he was the director of the Paris Observatory in France.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Glitch010101. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Glitch010101~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

== Overview ==

The primary method of performing magic in the ''Harry Potter'' series requires the use of a magic '''''wand'''''. The wand serves to focus and amplify the magical energy present in the witch or wizard.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Wands are typically made of wood with a core of some magical material; we hear of wands made with  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix]] tail feathers, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorn]] tail hair, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|Dragon]] heartstrings, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] hair, but it is likely that there are many other possible materials that can be used. When a witch or wizard goes to buy a wand, they must try out different combinations of woods, cores, and lengths until they find a wand that works for them. One thing which is told to us repeatedly is that &quot;the wand chooses the wizard&quot;; that a particular combination of wood and magical core, with other details of their manufacture, make a particular wand ideal for a particular wizard, and that it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict what sort of wand an individual wizard will be best able to use. It has been suggested that the length of the wand depends to some extent on the person's height (as Hagrid's wand is the longest one we hear of), the wood depends on the person's astrological signs and personality, while the core of the wand also reflects the user's personality. Of course, for any such suggestion, we can likely find counter-examples. We are told at the outset that it is very difficult to use someone else's wand; and Harry finds out in person, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that this is true.

It is possible to do some magic without the aid of a wand, but that magic is usually spontaneous and found only in untrained children. This is how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] regrew his hair after the Dursleys cut it off, how he ended up on the roof of the school when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] and his gang were chasing him, and how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|he released the python]] in the zoo. It is suspected that accidental magic appears in moments of great stress or emotion.

Very few spells are shown that can be performed in a controlled manner without a wand. These include the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] transformation and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo transport]]. (Note that while this last does not require a wand, it does require other equipment, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo Powder]].) It is uncertain whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition and Disapparition]] require the use of a wand, as no wand gestures are indicated; we never see any wizards or witches apparating themselves without a wand. (Side-along apparition, as when Hermione carries Harry, with his broken wand, does not count, as Harry is not then Apparating, but rather riding on someone else's spell.) [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]], among others, do not have wands and yet can apparate, however their magic has been shown to be of a different class than human magic.

== Analysis ==

There seem to be a very limited number of wizards who can actually produce wands, and they all have their own preferred ingredients and techniques. The only working wandmaker we are directly introduced to is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]], who is the proprietor of a wand shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. Mr. Ollivander uses only three types of magical core for his wands: phoenix tail feathers, unicorn hair, and dragon heartstrings. Other wandmakers use other materials; for instance, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]'s wand is made with the hair of a Veela as the core, a material Ollivander does not use as he finds it makes for a temperamental wand. Ollivander immediately identifies the wand used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] as a &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] creation&quot;; while he does not much care for the style, he does seem to think that it is a good enough wand. His ready identification and his discussion of the wand style indicates that he is very familiar with the style of this other wandmaker, if not with him personally; this also would indicate that we are looking at a restricted community.

Wands are made from nearly every tree type, and the author has chosen the wood for each character's wand based on its symbolic connotation. Harry's wand, for instance, is holly, which is believed to repel evil. Holly also represents protection, joy, happiness, masculinity, and overcoming anger. Christians also believe that the holy cross was made from holly. The word holly is derived from &quot;holy&quot;. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum's]] wand is hornbeam, a wood that represents strength, stubbornness, passion, moral fibre, ethics, and loyalty. It is also associated with a person who is considered the &quot;salt of the earth&quot; or a &quot;common man&quot;. Rosewood, which is what [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour's]] wand is made from, represents inner beauty, kindness, and gratitude, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric's]] ash wand symbolizes adaptability, prudence, modesty, sacrifice, and sensitivity. 

Wood alone does not empower a wand. Presumably, its core material magically fuses with the wood it is embedded into, activating the wand's power. It also seems to become somewhat sentient, allowing it to bond to a Wizard who shares similar qualities. Magical creatures provide the core material; Mr. Ollivander's wands only contain Unicorn hair, Phoenix feather, or Dragon heartstring, though other wandmakers use additional substances. Harry's wand contains a Phoenix feather. A Phoenix is a mythical bird that continually dies by bursting into flames and is then reborn from its own ashes, an act symbolizing resurrection and purity. Krum's wand contains Dragon heartstring, and though a Dragon is often associated with evil and destruction, in many cultures it represents qualities such as strength, wisdom, purification, renewal, and power. The Unicorn hair in Cedric's wand represents purity, innocence, loyalty, and mankind's dual nature (evil and goodness). Fleur's wand confirms Ron's suspicions that she is part Veela. The hair forming its core belonged to her Veela grandmother, making Fleur one-quarter Veela. This wand's core is apparently unusual; it seems to surprise Mr. Ollivander when he finds it, and may reflect the Veelas' more temperamental and volatile natures. As seen earlier in this book, the Veelas' real appearance is far different than the images they can project. Though Fleur is certainly beautiful and alluring, we don't know much about her inner character; at the time we discover the core material of her wand, about the only exposure we have to her is her supercilious air when being forced to accept the &quot;little boy&quot; Harry as a competitor in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. The Veela hair may also represent transformation, adaptability, and even deception and seduction. Being that the hair belongs to someone closely related to Fleur, it may also symbolize the power of family, generational legacy, unity, and loyalty.

Ron's and Hermione's wands should also be noted. Hermione's is made from vine and contains Dragon heartstring. Vine can represent great bounty, renewal, and also extreme emotions such as joy and anger. Ron's first wand, his brother Charlie's hand-me-down, was ash and Unicorn hair. His second wand, the one that presumably &quot;chose&quot; him, is willow and Unicorn hair. Willow is associated with gaining knowledge, personal growth, healing, and repulsing evil. It can also represent death and mourning. Though wands typically perform less efficiently for someone who was not &quot;chosen&quot; or had not captured it from another Wizard, presumably a wand handed down within a family offers its allegiance to a close blood relative, in this case, Ron.

A wizard will generally have a single wand for an extended period of time, largely because it works well for him; and because a wizard is by and large powerless without his wand, he will protect it. This will allow wands to be used as a form of identification. We see a wand being used for identification in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where the disguised Hermione uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange's]] captured wand to prove her identity to a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]].

A little known fact unrelated to the series' plot is that the woods used in Harry's, Hermione's, and Ron's wands happen to correspond to some variants of the Celtic Tree Calendar, which is divided into thirteen lunar-based periods. Each one is represented by a different wood. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=18 The author has indicated] that quite by accident she had selected an appropriate wood for Harry's wand from this calendar; Harry, being born on July 31, receives a wand made of [[w:holly|holly]] wood. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=120 Similarly,] she selected [[w:crataegus|hawthorn]] wood for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]'s wand without realizing that it was correct for his birthday. She does say that not all wands are selected according to the Celtic chart; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s wand, for instance, by his birthdate ought to be [[w:elderberry|elder]], but how could Hagrid have a wand that was anything other than [[w:oak|oak]]? And while the Celtic assignment would suggest [[w:birch|birch]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s wand, there are reasons for making it out of [[w:taxus baccata|yew]]. To quote the author: &quot;It was not an arbitrary decision: holly has certain connotations that were perfect for Harry, particularly when contrasted with the traditional associations of yew, from which Voldemort’s wand is made. European tradition has it that the holly tree (the name comes from ‘holy’) repels evil, while yew, which can achieve astonishing longevity (there are British yew trees over two thousand years old), can symbolize both death and resurrection; the [[w:plant sap|sap]] is also poisonous.&quot; Ron's March 1 birthday falls within February 18 - March 17, which is ash. His new willow wand is outside this period, however. Hermione's vine wand reflects her September 19 birth date, which is within the Calendar's September 2 - September 29 cycle.   

As we learned in Book 1, Voldemort's wand is yew and contains a tail feather from the same Phoenix that donated the one in Harry's wand. In European cultures, yew wood, which is toxic, is generally associated with long life, death and resurrection, transformation, as well as evil; this certainly seems to fit Voldemort. This wood being combined with a Phoenix feather core is curious, however. While a Phoenix can represent resurrection, its fiery demise also symbolizes purification. This hardly seems to apply to Voldemort, who, if he is resurrected, will probably be as evil, if not more so, as when he died. It is curious why Mr. Ollivander would craft a wand from wood having such a dark connotation, though its particular magical properties would naturally be a consideration.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Dumbledore's wand, known as the Elder Wand, should also be mentioned. It is made from elder, a wood believed to intermingle both good and evil and whose flowers, which produce a strong odor, suggest death. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 The author has stated] that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestral]] hair lies within the Elder Wand's core. Thestrals, gentle magical creatures often associated with death, appear first in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. A wand containing a such a hair can only be mastered by a witch or wizard who is unafraid of death. 

The fact that &quot;the wand chooses the wizard,&quot; introduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|the first book]], becomes an important plot point in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the seventh book of the series]]. Voldemort, convinced that Harry's ability to avoid him is due only to his wand with its core that is twin to Voldemort's own, seeks a wand more powerful than Harry's. He searches for the fabled Deathstick or Elder Wand, a wand that is unbeatable in a duel. This wand has left a long and bloody trail through history, and Voldemort in the end tracks it to its last rumoured owners: the wand-maker Gregorovitch claimed to have it, but it was stolen from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], who in turn lost it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. Voldemort claims it from Dumbledore's tomb, but finding that it resists his commands, and believing that the wand will only transfer its allegiance when its previous owner is killed, murders [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], who had killed Dumbledore.

Mr. Ollivander tells Harry that death is not required to change a wand's allegiance, even the Elder Wand. Instead, merely forcefully removing it from its owner, either by physically wresting it from his hand or using a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament charm]], can cause a wand to change &quot;loyalty&quot;. (Presumably this only holds if the original owner does not reclaim his wand; else nearly every magical duel would end up with the loser left effectively wandless.) As a result, it being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] who had disarmed Dumbledore, the Elder Wand would owe allegiance to Draco. As Harry had captured Draco's regular wand, the one with which he had disarmed Dumbledore, the Elder Wand might transfer its allegiance to Harry; if not, according to what Ollivander tells Harry, it would still be Draco's wand, rather than Voldemort's. Thus Voldemort would be unable to receive its full benefit. As it turns out, the Elder Wand, apparently aware that Harry was holding the wand that had wrested it from its former owner, apparently had given its allegiance to Harry, and would avoid harming him.

While there is much talk in the seventh book about allegiances and awareness by the wands, it is never meant to be an indication that wands are alive. Like Muggle computers, the fact that a wand behaves in a particular manner may make it seem alive, but it remains inanimate and unthinking. A good indication of this is the way the Elder Wand shows allegiance to Harry; after all, it was not Harry who disarmed Dumbledore, but Draco. However, Harry is now carrying Draco's wand, which had itself transferred its allegiance to Harry when he wrested it from Draco. So the Elder Wand, rather than a specific person, apparently senses the holder of the wand that performed the successful charm as the one to whom it owes allegiance.

The opening is named after the 16th century Spanish priest [[w:Ruy López de Segura|Ruy López de Segura]]. &quot;It is the double king's pawn opening most commonly used in master play; it has been adopted by almost all players at some point in their careers and many play it from both the white and black sides.&quot;

White threatens to trade the bishop against the knight, leaving the pawn undefended. It is not a real threat as after 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5, Black can fork the knight and a pawn with 5...Qd4 or 5...Qg5. As nothing's urgent, Black can respond in a variety of ways. The most common move is the Morphy defence : [[/3...a6/]], forcing White to make a decision about his bishop. Many other moves are available, some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development.

=Sicilian Defence=

The moves '''1. e4 c5''' constitute the Sicilian Defence, a counter-attacking opening in which players typically attack on opposite sides of the board. The Sicilian emerged into the mainstream in the early 20th century as a somewhat tame variation, but with the discovery of new attacking ideas it became Black's most feared weapon by the 1950s and is, pound for pound, the most exhaustively analysed of all openings. Black's move c5 seeks to half-open the c-file for his or her own use, controls the important d4 square and allows his or her queen to venture out if desired, while the itinerant c-pawn itself is safe from attack, unlike the e-pawn after 1. e4 e5. It has the benefit of introducing an element of asymmetry into the position - White would not be advised to play [[/2. c4/]] imitating Black's move, since he could no longer control the d4 square with a pawn and thus will have trouble playing d4 later.

Faced with a pawn on c5, White may choose to play [[/2. d4/]] anyway which typically leads to a pawn sacrifice for quick development. After [[/2. d4/2...cxd4|2...cxd4]], White can play [[/2. d4/2...cxd4/3. c3|3. c3]], sacrificing another pawn in order to play 4.Nxc3 to gain an advance in development in the Morra Gambit. A more usual idea is for White to postpone d4 for a move while he increases his or her own control of the square. This can be achieved by either [[/2. Nf3/]] leading to the main lines of the Sicilian, or by [[/2. c3/]], attempting to establish a strong pawn centre. Much less common is the attempt to undermine the c-pawn's control of d4 by playing [[/2. b4/]] to tempt it off-centre. Since it is considered safe for Black to take the offered pawn and hold on to it, a recent idea has been to prepare the b4 move with [[/2. a3/]]. White can also push the e-pawn with [[/2. e5/]] in an attempt to cramp Black.

White may postpone the fight for d4, typically with [[/2. Nc3/]] though [[/2. f4/]] is also played. 2. f4 is a violent attacking move, 2. Nc3 typically leads to a closed position although f4 can subsequently appear.

===Statistics===
Approximate chances: White win 36%, Draw 29%, Black win 34% (source: 365chess.com) &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's start by jumping right in and looking at a game. The game commonly referred to as '''The Prisoner's Dilemma''' is a classic example used to demonstrate game theory. It is usually explained through the use of this story, although the actual game called '''The Prisoner's Dilemma''' - often just called '''PD''' for short, is not limited to this situation. The underlying dynamics of it can be used to describe all sorts of phenomena.
===The Story===
Two men, Andy and Bob, were arrested after an armed robbery. The police had enough evidence to convict the two for the theft of the get-away car, but not enough to convict them for the actual armed robbery. However, if the police could get a confession from either of the two men they could conceivably convict them both for the armed robbery. 

The police locked the two men in two separate rooms and gave them each the same offer:

:If Andy confessed and Bob stayed silent, then Andy would go scot-free and Bob would be charged for the robbery and get 10 years in jail. Of course, this worked the other way around as well. If Bob confessed and Andy stayed silent, Andy would receive the 10 years. 

:If Andy confessed and Bob confessed as well, then they would both receive 7 years in jail.

:If both Andy and Bob stayed silent, then they would both receive 2 years in prison for the get-away car robbery.

The two prisoners are left to make their decision without any way to contact each other. The question is: '''what did each person choose'''?

===Solution===
The solution that occurs every time this game is played (assuming each acts in his own best interests) is that both Andy and Bob will choose to confess, resulting in a sentence of 7 years each. This answer seems to be counter-intuitive, doesn't it? Why would both players choose to confess, an option that is clearly inferior to both of them staying silent and getting 2 years each? Not only this, but in terms of total years in prison, this is the worst possible outcome!

===Explanation===
The reason that both players choose to confess is easy to explain. Let's talk about Person A (and whatever holds for Andy, will hold for Bob as well because they are both in identical situations). 

The following is the explanation assuming that Andy &amp; Bob cannot communicate their choices to each other directly or indirectly.

Andy has the following Matrix:

'''If he confesses:&lt;br /&gt;'''

Minimum Jail Term: 0 Years (If Bob remains silent)&lt;br /&gt;
Maximum Jail Term: 7 Years (If Bob confesses)

'''If he remains silent:&lt;br /&gt;'''

Minimum Jail Term: 2 Years (If Bob remains silent)&lt;br /&gt;
Maximum Jail Term: 10 Years (If Bob confesses)


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:40%&quot;
|+ '''Table Format'''
|- style=&quot;background:paleturquoise&quot;
! style=&quot;width:20%&quot; | 
! style=&quot;width:20%&quot; | Bob remains silent
! style=&quot;width:20%&quot; | Bob Confesses
|-
| Andy Confesses || 0 || 7
|-
| Andy Remains Silent || 2 || 10
|}

The expected payoff for the game (the average amount of benefit that a strategy will provide) is better &amp;mdash; in this case, 3.5 years expected jail time for confessing versus 6 years for silence &amp;mdash; if Andy confesses.  Therefore, from a rational perspective, Andy should choose to confess rather than remain silent.

Also, it doesn't matter what Bob does - Andy is always better off confessing.  If Bob confesses, Andy can get either 7 years for confessing or 10 for silence, and if Bob is silent, Andy can get either 0 years for confessing or 2 for silence. Unfortunately for Person Andy, this also holds true for Person Bob - who is always better off confessing. This means that if both agents do what is in their best interests, they will be 7 years together in prison! This demonstrates that in many games the &quot;best&quot; solution - the one where the total utility of the outcome is highest - is not the one which will ultimately occur.

===1...d6===
In this opening, Black does not immediately fight for the center, but prefers to prepare counter-play while White advances his pawns.

If White dislikes this opening, he can play [[/2. Nf3/]] in order to transpose into the [[Chess/Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Defence]] (2...c5) or into the [[Chess/Philidor Defence|Philidor Defence]] (2...e5).

If White agrees to play this defence, he has no reason not to build his pawn center with [[/2. d4/]].

===2. Nf3===

White's move '''2. Nf3''' increased his control of the d4 square, enabling him to play d4 next move. Black cannot hope to resist White's plan any further, and should go about his own development. [[/2...d6/]] is the main line move, controlling e5 for a potential advance of the e-pawn and letting the queen's bishop out, while also holding down the c-pawn in case White should go down a different path. [[/2...e6/]] is an older move freeing the king's bishop although d6 will often follow soon. [[/2...Nc6/]] reserves options in the [[w:en:Center_(chess)#Centre/Center|centre]] and keeps an eye on d4, as does [[/2...g6/]] planning Bg7, and [[/2...a6/]] can restrain some of White's longer-term plans and provide the springboard for a b5 advance, though it neglects the centre. There are many slightly different Sicilians with similar plans for Black, in which various combinations of these moves may turn up in almost any order. 

The one significant departure from the main lines is [[/2...Nf6/]], evoking [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...Nf6|Alekhine's Defence]] by attacking the e-pawn to tempt it forward.

=Open Sicilian=
Black's 2...d6 gives him the option of several popular attacking lines, controls the e5 square, supports the c-pawn and activates his queen's bishop.

White's rationale for playing 2. Nf3 was to support a [[/3. d4/]] advance which he may now play. His best alternative to this, for rapid development, is [[/3. Bb5/]]+, forcing Black to block the check with a minor piece that would then be pinned to the king. Swashbuckling players might be tempted by [[/3. b4/]], planning an unopposed d4 when the Black c-pawn is diverted to b4.

= Evans Gambit Accepted =
===4...Bxb4===
Black has accepted the Gambit. White can now win a tempo in the fight for the center by playing [[/5. c3/]]. In this version of the Evans Gambit black has to play very well to defeat the opening.

=Sicilian Invitation (Réti Opening)=
===1...c5===
Black invites white to transpose into the Sicilian Defence with 2.e4.
White has a number of other choices here. 2.c4 transposes into a Symmetrical English. Many other moves are possible--the position is still very flexible for both sides.

=Queen's Pawn Opening=
=== 1.d4 ===

At this point, black must decide how to face white's aggression. Traditionally, the two most popular replies are [[/1...d5/]] and [[/1...Nf6/]]. Other moves tend to allow white a broad center with 2. e4. Allowing the broad center was frowned upon in classical times, but is more of a matter of preference today. Another reason [[/1...d5/]] and [[/1...Nf6/]] are the main replies considered is that many of the alternatives transpose into main lines anyway. One notable exception is the Dutch Defence: [[/1...f5/]] whose character is unique and prevents 2. e4. [[/1...d5/]] directly challenges white's plan to establish a broad center. [[/1...Nf6/]] prevents an immediate 2. e4 while maintaining flexibility to play a number of &quot;Indian&quot; systems or move back into a system typical of [[/1...d5/]].

To play 1. d4 correctly, the white player should learn the basic Queen's Gambit positions, the King's Indian, Queen's Indian, Nimzo-Indian positions, and even some of the Benoni positions. This may seem intimidating to the beginner, but fortunately it is not as difficult as it may sound at first. Further, there are several practical advantages to becoming familiar with playing 1. d4 as white:
* 1. d4 openings tend to be more forgiving than 1. e4 openings so far as traps are concerned. Pieces should be mobilised quickly, but it is less common for a natural-looking move to lead to a sudden demise.
* While there are many transpositions between the different 1. d4 openings, this is true because the underlying strategic goals are very similar. The Queen's Indian has much in common with some of the main variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined--much more so than the typical Caro-Kann has with the French Defence or Ruy Lopez in the 1. e4 world.
* Even today, at least at amateur levels, the 1. d4 openings are still less frequently encountered than 1. e4 openings. 

===Statistics===
Approximate chances: White win 38%, Draw 33%, Black win 29%&lt;br&gt;
Estimated next move popularity: Nf6 55%, d5 28%, e6 5%, f5 3.5%, g6 3%, d6 3%, c5 1% other moves less than 1%&lt;br&gt;

= Two Knights Defence =
===3... Nf6===
:The Black Knight move 3... Nf6 announces the Two Knights; this aggressive defence results in open and often complex play. David Bronstein suggested that the term &quot;Chigorin's Counterattack&quot; would be more appropriate and this is certainly borne out with current theory. The Two Knights has been adopted as Black by many aggressive players including Chigorin and Keres, and World Champions Tal and Boris Spassky.

The XGameStation (XGS for short), a one-of-a-kind do-it-yourself game console, was created by André Lamothe. In this book we hope to teach the user of this system to develop for it both in hardware and software. However, this book does not aim to teach what is already found in the XGS eBook. That means this book will not talk about subjects such as the design of the system itself. Instead, the book will focus on things like:
:Writing a Keyboard Driver
:Building an interface to NES Gamepads
:Playing songs using the built-in hardware
:Developing a card for use in the Expansion Slot

= French Defence =

After 1.e4 Black plays e6 signifying his intent to play the French Defense. The move 1...e6 bolsters support for the coming advance d7-d5, providing Black with a good stake in the center and allowing Black to decline recapturing with the queen after the plausible continuation exd5. In most lines White will follow up with 2. d4, with Black's only serious reply to this being 2...d5 (over 154 times more popular than 2... c5 in master play).

=French Defence=
White creates the ideal pawn center with pawns on d4 and e4.This allows white to control the center and develop bishops and queen actively. The French Defence goes on with [[/2...d5/]].

=French Defence=
By advancing the d pawn two squares black poses an immediate challenge to the powerful white center. The white player must now react by either advancing the pawn  which will lead to the advance variation where he/she will get to put immediate pressure on the black king side, but black will have more than enough to put the pawn wedge under serious attack with moves like c5, Nc6, Qb6 and Nh6 (followed obviously by Nf5).

Another choice for white is to defend the pawn with either Nc3 or Nd2. Out of this two possible defenses the first is the most common, as it does not block the bishop on c1 and puts some mild pressure on d5. Black has many possible answers, however, including the Winawer variation (3...Bb4), which leads to extremely complex positions (which are usually closed). Therefore the amount of theory behind Nc3 is too big and too complex for the move to be played lightly.

Nd2, on the other hand, is much safer but also less ambitious and harder to get an advantage with. Black will have the choice of either forcing e5 (with 3...Nf6) and attacking the pawn wedge at both base and head with the breaks c5 and f6, or exchanging an isolated d pawn for active pieces with 3...c5.

Finally, white may try the exchange variation 3 exd5, which is unambitious and gives black equal chances, but avoids the complications of the other variations.

= Open Sicilian =
The aggressive advance of White's d-pawn forms a classical centre (pawns on e4 and d4), a strong formation which threatens to gain a large space advantage by a subsequent d5 or e5. Black is therefore compelled to break up White's centre. In this Sicilian this is easily achieved with the exchange [[/3...cxd4/]], the control of d4 being the major reason the c-pawn was moved to c5 originally. With this natural move Black acquires a majority of central pawns and half-opens the c-file. His other means of attacking the centre pawns is with [[/3...Nf6/]], in an attempt to avoid the [[:w:Maróczy Bind|Maróczy Bind]] by tempting the b1 knight out, but White can simply take the c-pawn with quicker development. [[/3...Nc6/]] invites either d5 or dxc5 with a strong initiative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the first software development chapter of the book! To start this exercise you must have at least the following equipment:

*An XGameStation
*A Home PC
*The XGameStation Development Toolchain

The Development Toolchain can be found at http://www.xgamestation.com/ under the downloads section. The XGameStation itself costs $199, and you're on your own as to a Home PC. I myself have no experience with the Linux version created by a user - '''(Someone enter information on it here)'''.

First of all, plug your XGS unit up to the power adaptor and into the wall. Then use the parallell cable provided with it and connect it to LPT1 of your computer. Finally, start the XGS IDE.

In this exercise we will create the most simple program possible that will give immediate feedback. First, [[Deving_The_XGameStation/Wiring_LEDs|Wire an LED up]]. It should be connected between rb.0 and ground. Be sure to check the datasheet for your LED so that you have it properly biased, as putting it in backwards won't work! Also, make sure to put a 330ohm resistor in series with it to limit current. Not doing that will result in a burned out LED or even damaging a battery in some cases!  Let's start by entering this simple program into the IDE:

&lt;code&gt;
 DEVICE SX52       ;The XGS uses the SX52
 RESET Start       ;Start at 'Start' when processor is reset
 FREQ 80_000_000   ;Set for debug purposes, the SX-Key will use this as operating frequency (80 Mhz)
 
 DEVICE OSCHS3, IFBD, XTLBUFD
 IRC_CAL IRC_FAST              ;This prevents assembler warning
 
 org $0  ;Start program here
 
 Start:     ;Where program begins
  mov   !RB, #%00000000   ;Make RB output
  mov    RB, #%11111111   ;Turn on all bits in the port. The LED will light up!
&lt;/code&gt;

Now, hit the 'Assemble and Run' button on the Toolbar. If everything is connected correctly and you typed the program in correctly, it should say 'Programming Successful'. Now turn on your XGS and switch the SYSMODE switch to 'RUN'. Hit the Reset button. You LED should light up!

----
Todo - More LED's, maybe some animation with them, or something else

= Petrov's Defence =
===2...Nf6===

Black chose to counter-attack. Many continuations are possible for White.

:*[[/3. Nxe5/]] is the main line (or '''Classical Variation'''). In this line, it's not advised for Black to take White's pawn before having chased the knight. There is a famous trap : 3...Nxe4 4. Qe2 Nd6?? (or 4...Nf6??) 5. Nc6+ and Black's queen is lost.
:*With [[/3. Nc3/]], Black can easily transpose into the Four Knights Game with 3...Nc6. This option is sound when White wants to avoid the sharp lines of Petrov's Defence.
:*[[/3. d4/]] is the '''Steinitz Variation'''. Both players will usually plant their knights in advanced positions. Exchanges often occur in this line to avoid having too powerful an enemy knight in front of the king.
:*[[/3. Bc4/]] usually transposes into the Two Knights Defence (a variation of the Italian Game).
:*[[/3. d3/]] is, according to statistics, a much more effective move than it looks, though it's rarely played. White builds a strong fortress and Black is now forced to abandon the Petrov's lines and to defend his pawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hyperion.jpg|220px|right|Hyperion]]

Hyperion is a moon of Saturn.  It is completely covered in craters and spins at high speeds as it orbits Saturn.

==How big is Hyperion?==
Hyperion is 266 km wide. 

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Hyperion is red in colour. Some interesting features include the Bond-Lassell Dorsum, the largest ridge on Hyperion (and the only one to have a name), and the largest crater, which is 120 km wide and 10 km deep. There are also many craters on the surface of Hyperion which make it look like a sponge.

==How long is a day on Hyperion?==
Hyperion has a chaotic orbit. The day usually lasts about five hours.

==How long is its orbit around Saturn?==
It takes Hyperion about 21.28 days to orbit once around Saturn.

==What is it made of?==
Hyperion is made of water ice, and a small amount of rock.

==Who is it named after?==
Hyperion is named after a Titan in Greek mythology. He was the son of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). He was the father of Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn).

==How was it discovered?==
Hyperion was discovered by three people: William Cranch Bond, his son George Phillips Bond, and William Lassell in 1848. Lassell discovered Hyperion two days after the Bonds, and he beat them to publication. However, all three are given credit for its discovery.

== Overview ==

'''''James Potter''''' is the father of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], the hero of the series. James' death at the hands of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] offstage, just before the opening chapter of the first book, sets up the conflict in the entire series. James was born 27 March 1960 and died 31 October, 1981. He was 20 when his son was born and was 21 at his death.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Though introduced as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s dead father, James Potter plays no direct role in this book. His image appears in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]] when Harry finds it the first time at Christmas, and a large number of pictures of him are in the photo album given to Harry by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] just before Harry leaves the school for the summer. Hagrid has mentioned also that James Potter was head boy in his seventh year at Hogwarts. James apparently owned an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] that was given anonymously to Harry at Christmas, and then mysteriously returned to him in May when he had misplaced it. This Cloak becomes an important tool for Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in exploring the school.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher this year is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who was one of James' best friends; at a number of points in the story, there is discussion between Harry and Professor Lupin about James. Additionally, the scenes in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]] involve Lupin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], all James' close friends, and include a number of details about their mutual school days. One major revelation is that James was an unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]].

When Harry, Hermione, and Sirius Black are being attacked by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], someone casts a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]]; Harry initially believes it to be James.

It was also revealed at the end of this book that the form James took as an Animagus was that of a stag. This had earlier caused some disquiet to Lupin; Harry's Patronus charm took the shape of a stag, and Lupin seems to have recognized it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], while Harry is battling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] in the graveyard, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem effect]] causes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shadows]] of Voldemort's victims to appear, including Harry's father and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]] who speak with him. The shades gather around Voldemort, hindering his attack on Harry when he breaks the connection between the two wands, just long enough for Harry to escape.

In the book's earlier editions, there was the famous mistake of the wand order. The shadows appear from Voldemort's wand starting with the most recent and proceeding towards the oldest, but the earlier editions had James appearing before Lily, implying that he died after her. This was corrected by the author in later editions.

Harry also decides that, emulating his father, he will die fighting Voldemort, rather than hiding behind a stone, if he must die.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At the party held at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]] to celebrate Ron's being made a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] shows Harry a picture of the Order of the Phoenix from the time of Voldemort's first rise to power. Moody seems to think Harry will be pleased to see pictures of his parents in the Order; Harry feels that he has been ambushed by this sudden revelation.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|Late in the book]], Harry, while viewing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape’s]] memory in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], watches James Potter during his school days with his best friends Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.  

''“It was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James’s eyes were hazel, his nose was longer than Harry’s, and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows. James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry’s did, his hands could have been Harry’s and Harry could tell that when James stood up they would be within an inch of each other’s heights.”'' (Page 641 of the US edition)

In that memory, Harry sees his father, apparently unprovoked, tormenting Snape. The current-day Snape catches him and hauls him bodily out of that memory. Harry is deeply disturbed by what he saw, his perception of his father radically changed. He remembers Snape's earlier statement that James had almost managed to get him killed, and wonders where the truth lies; he himself would never have behaved as his father did, and yet everyone tells him James was such a good person.

Harry broods for a long time over this revelation, eventually breaking in to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s office so that he can talk to Sirius Black via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]. There, speaking with Sirius and Lupin, Harry learns that the memory is accurate, but that James matured into a kind and compassionate man. This hardly consoles Harry, though, realizing he is the same age James was in the memory, and that he is not beating up his fellow students.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry mentions, after Dumbledore's funeral, that he has to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], as that is where everything began. He feels, among other things, that he must visit his parents' graves.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry learns that Albus Dumbledore once lived in Godric's Hollow, just as Harry's parents had, and also that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] still resides there. Bathilda, old as she is, may remember details about the Potters and Dumbledore that she can share with Harry. Though Harry decides to visit Godric's Hollow, circumstances prevent his doing so until Christmas. In the meanwhile, he finds a letter his mother wrote to Sirius in which Lily says that Dumbledore borrowed James' Invisibility Cloak.

Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] arrive at Godric's Hollow on Christmas Eve. Crossing the village square, Harry sees that the war memorial, to a Wizard's eye, contains a statue of his parents and himself as a baby. He locates his parents' gravestone; Hermione creates a wreath of roses to lay upon it. Leaving the village, Harry finds the Potters' cottage; it has become a makeshift memorial, with the cottage's wall still bearing the scars from Voldemort's attack.

As they escape Godric's Hollow, Harry sees, through the shared link between his and Voldemort's mind, Voldemort's memories of the night his parents were murdered. James, caught unaware by Voldemort and without his wand, had fallen almost immediately.

When Harry, Hermione, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]  visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]], Harry learns that his father's Invisibility Cloak is probably one of the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. Because it was such a unique artifact, Dumbledore had borrowed it, wanting to study it. We will learn that Dumbledore, as a young man, was fascinated by the Hallows, and was unable to pass up an opportunity to investigate the Cloak, just as he was with the third Hallow later.

Harry eventually learns that his fate is inextricably entwined with Voldemort's, that he must face, and be killed by, Voldemort in order that Voldemort might die. His fear is too great to allow him to pass the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] guarding the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], so using the Resurrection Stone, Harry summons the shades of his parents, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black to sustain him as he goes to meet his death. Upon reaching the clearing where Voldemort awaits, he deliberately drops the stone, releasing the four shades.

== Strengths ==

It is implied by those who knew him that James was a powerful and talented wizard, able to master the Animagus transformation at fifteen. He also co-created the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] with Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew. From the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]], we understand that he defied Lord Voldemort three times, though no details are given as to how that happened. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] has stated that he had been one of the cleverest Hogwarts students of his time.

== Weaknesses ==

According to Remus Lupin, James' ultimate downfall was his trust in his friends, as he was betrayed by his close friend, Peter Pettigrew. It is possible that another weakness was concern for his wife and son, as he sacrificed his own life in an attempt to give Lily time to get baby Harry to safety.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

James married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]], who he met at Hogwarts. They had one child, Harry.

During his time at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], James was popular with other students, though he could be a rather arrogant bully. He, with active assistance from Sirius Black, and acquiescence from Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, often tormented a classmate, Severus Snape, resulting in Severus' permanent and unreasonable hatred for James, and later, Harry.

James was a devoted and loving husband and father who cherished his son, Harry. A letter that Harry found at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], indicated that James would often play with baby Harry.

== Analysis ==

We see James in two quite different lights. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|Severus Snape's memories]], from his first encounter with James in their mutual first year at Hogwarts up until &quot;Snape's Worst Memory&quot; in their fifth year, James was arrogant and a bully. Remus Lupin admits to Harry that this was how James behaved but had later chosen to mend his behaviour, becoming a self-sacrificing, caring and intelligent man who was extremely loyal to his family and friends. James was also mischievous and had a good sense of humour.

During James' teenage years, he had tried to attract Lily Evans' attention, but she ignored him, turned off by his bullying nature. Apparently, though, in his final two years at Hogwarts, he matured enough to show his sensitive side. We never see this, but James could not have remained the bully we initially see, and yet been the compassionate man Remus and Sirius describe, and certainly Lily would have remained aloof. However, James and Lily married shortly after graduating Hogwarts, and together joined the Order of the Phoenix, and had a son, Harry Potter. It was for his family's sake that James died, trying to give Lily enough time to escape with Harry. 

Harry was frequently told that he physically resembled his father. Based on others' recollections about James, Harry built a rather idealized image of him. But when Harry learned that fifteen-year-old James often bullied weaker students, including Severus Snape, the disillusionment proved difficult for him to deal with, though he still loved his father. Harry later accepted that his father must have matured beyond his earlier bad behaviour in order for his mother to have married him.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

When Harry summoned James' spirit with the Resurrection Stone, James told his son how extremely proud of him he was, that he loved him, and would remain with him until his life ended.

Throughout the series, we see Harry's image of his father mature as Harry matures himself. Hagrid's initial description of James and Lily leads Harry to form an idealized image of his father, one which is seriously shaken by the revelations in ''Snape's Worst Memory''. Harry is unable to get past this new image of James as a bully, in part because of sudden revelations concerning Dumbledore's past at the start of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', until very nearly the end of the series; in this, he is helped by the resolution of his worries about Dumbledore's past. It is only with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]]'s illumination of Dumbledore's personal history that Harry starts to apply the aphorism, &quot;knowing people by their choices,&quot; to his father and Dumbledore. By the end of the series, Harry's image of his father has become much more balanced and true to who we believe James actually was; Harry has grown out of his childish hero worship, and gained an understanding of the path that shaped James.

The absence of Harry's father makes his adoption of a series of father figures seem realistic. We can see that Harry tries to cast first Hagrid, then Lupin, into that role with limited success; then Sirius, with slightly better results; and finally, Dumbledore. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] provides some fatherly characteristics as well, particularly during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. One of the author's strengths is the way she is able to make Harry's unconscious search for someone to replace James in his affections seem natural, keeping it low-key enough that it doesn't intrude upon the story, while still making it apparent to the reader.

== Overview ==

'''''Veritaserum''''' is a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth. 

== Analysis ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Since the wizards have access to an infallible truth serum, some readers have questioned why this cannot be used by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]] to determine whether a suspect is innocent or not; and it has also been suggested that it could have been used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood_Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] in order to force [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace_Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] to divulge what he knew about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|the young Tom Riddle]]. However, anything so powerful would be bound to cause creation of counter-potions and counter-charms, just as a means for editing memories has sprung up in the wake of the creation of a device (the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]) for playing them back; and the author has stated, firstly, that Slughorn, being so powerful and cautious a wizard, is bound to have secreted about himself potions to counteract the effects of Veritaserum and other harmful (to him) potions; and second, that the existence of charms that prevent or alter the action of Veritaserum on suspects would make Veritaserum-induced evidence invalid in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot]].

It is certainly true that, while Veritaserum is mentioned several times in the books, it is only successfully administered once, to an unprepared, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]], and effectively unsuspecting victim, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet_of_Fire/Chapter_35|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']].

== Overview ==

The '''''Draught of Living Death''''' is a powerful sleeping potion.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Draught of Living Death brings upon its drinker a very powerful sleep that can last indefinitely. No antidote is mentioned in the books, though presumably there must be one.

This potion is mentioned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s first-ever Potions lesson. Snape asks Harry what he would get if he were to mix the root of Asphodel and an infusion of Wormwood; Harry, of course, cannot answer.

It is mentioned again in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s first NEWT Potions class, the class members are called upon to produce the Draught of Living Death. At this point we find that this potion also contains sopophorous bean juice and chopped valerian root, probably among other ingredients.

We do not, of course, learn the full set of ingredients for the Draught at any point. We do learn that the standard instructions do not produce as effective a Draught as is possible. Harry finds that the marginal comments in his textbook specify alterations to the standard formulas. Changes to the Draught of Living Death include crushing the sopophorous bean rather than cutting it, and stirring once clockwise after every seven times counter-clockwise, rather than continuously counter-clockwise. Following the marginal instructions results in Harry getting better results than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who is of course following the book's instructions precisely.

== Analysis ==

In the American edition of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], reasoning with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], says that if Draco chooses to abandon the mission he has been given, Dumbledore can protect him and his family, by making it seem that they are all dead, if necessary. One wonders whether the Draught of Living Death, or some derivative of it, would be involved in such a ruse.

name=Bezoar|
type=Device|
features=Cures most poisons|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]|}}

== Overview ==

A '''''bezoar''''' is a stone (actually a ball of compacted hair) that is removed from the stomach of a goat, and the ingestion of such a stone is said to cure most poisons.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We are first introduced to this artifact when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], in his first-ever [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] lesson, where he would go to find a bezoar.

The bezoar appears a second time in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] when it is the &quot;key ingredient&quot; that Harry forgets to add to his antidote in Potions class because of his anxiety over preparing to ask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]].

Bezoars are not mentioned again until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s Potions class, Harry is called upon to produce an antidote. Rather than creating a complex potion that would counter the mix of poisons in question, he simply retrieves a bezoar from the supplies cabinet. Professor Slughorn absently tucks it into his bag.

The bezoar then becomes vital to the story as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is given some poisoned mead while visiting Professor Slughorn; while Slughorn panics, Harry recalls the bezoar, retrieves it from Slughorn's bag, and feeds it to Ron, thus saving Ron's life.

== Analysis ==

Like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boomslang|Boomslangs]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dittany|Dittany]], bezoars exist in the world outside the series. In our world, bezoars are balls of compacted hair that collect in the stomach of a person or animal, and were once believed to have magical curative powers, very similar to what they are given in this series.  

With bezoars being so very useful in the case of poisoning, it is rather surprising just how uncommon they are. It seems that there are only a few, even in the supply cabinet in the Potions classroom; and it seems that Professor Slughorn, aware as he is of the effects of potions, does not routinely carry one in his bag. We must assume that they form very rarely in the wild.

Because it is mentioned that it is an ingredient in the antidote Harry is making just before Christmas in the fourth book, and because it is used directly, bezoars are listed both as magical devices and potion ingredients on the Magic overview page of this work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Optimization is the art and science of making your program faster, smaller, simpler, less resource hungry, etc.  Of course faster often conflicts with simpler and smaller so optimization is a balancing act.

This chapter is intended to contain a toolkit of techniques that you can use to speed up certain kinds of program.  Each technique will be accompanied by code that demonstrates the improvement.  Please note that the code is deliberately sub-optimal for two reasons: optimized code is almost always harder to understand and the purpose is that the reader should exercise the techniques in order to obtain greater understanding.  You should always be able to rewrite the code presented to obtain greater improvements but this will sometimes be accompanied by a reduction in readability.  In code that is speed critical choose speed over clarity, in code that is not speed critical you should always choose the most maintainable style; remember that another programmer coming to your code years later relies on you to make the code say what it means.  When you optimize the code you will often need to be extra careful in adding comments so as to ensure that someone maintaining the code doesn't throw away your hard earned speed improvement because he doesn't understand why you use what seems like an overly complicated method.

If you change code to gain speed you should write tests that demonstrate that the new code really is faster than the old.  Often this can be as simple as recording the time before and after a procedure and taking the difference.  Do the test before you change the code and after and see if the improvement was worthwhile.

Remember that the code has to work first.  Make it work, then make it work faster.  

Code that slowly gets the right answer is almost invariably preferable to code that quickly gets the wrong answer.  This is especially true if the answer is a small part of a larger answer so that errors are hard to spot.

Ensure that things work by writing tests, validation functions and assertions.  When you change the code to make it faster the results of the tests, validation functions and assertions should not have changed.

== Integers and Longs ==

In VB6 it is generally the case that a program in which all whole number variables are declared as Long will run faster than than the same program using Integer.

Use:
  Dim I as Long
not:
  Dim I as Integer

However, it is important to realize that the final arbiter of speed is measurement of performance under real life conditions; see the tests section below. 

The only reason to use Integer is when passing arguments by reference to functions defined in components that you cannot alter.  For instance most of the events raised by the VB6 GUI use Integer arguments instead of Long.  This is also the case with some third party DLLs.  Most Windows API functions require ''Long'' arguments.

===Tests===
Here is a simple test that illustrates that things are not always as they seem in the world of optimization.  The test is a simple module that executes two subroutines.  The two routines are identical except that in one all the whole number variables are declared as Long and in the other they are all declared as Integer.  The routines simply increment a number repeatedly.  When executed inside the VB6 IDE on my computer the results are (three consecutive runs in seconds):

  Long         11.607
  Integer       7.220
  Long         11.126
  Integer       7.211
  Long         11.006
  Integer       7.221


which appears to contradict my assertion that Longs are faster than Integers.  However when compiled and executed outside the IDE the results are:

  Long         0.711
  Integer      0.721
  Long         0.721
  Integer      0.711
  Long         0.721
  Integer      0.721

Notice that when running compiled the times for Long and Integer are indistinguishable.  This illustrates several important points about optimization and benchmarking.

;Timing jitter : timing an algorithm on a pre-emptive multitasking operating system is always an exercise in statistics because you cannot (not in VB6 at least) force the OS to not interrupt your code which means that timing using the simple technique of these tests includes time spent in other programs or at least in the System Idle loop.

;Know what you are measuring : the times measured in the IDE are at least ten times longer than those measured when the code is compiled to native code (optimize for ''fast'' code, integer bounds checking ''on'' in this case).  The relative difference in timing for Long and Integer differs between compiled and interpreted code.

For more benchmarks see Donald Lessau's excellent site: [http://xbeat.net/vbspeed/index.htm VBSpeed].

Here is the code:

  Private Const mi_INNER_LOOPS As Integer = 32000

    For iOuter = 1 To mi_OUTER_LOOPS
      iNum = 0
      For iInner = 1 To mi_INNER_LOOPS
        iNum = iNum + 1
      Next iInner

    Dim nStart As Double
    
    Dim lInner As Long
    Dim lOuter As Long
    Dim lNum As Long
    
    nStart = Timer
    For lOuter = 1 To ml_OUTER_LOOPS
      lNum = 0
      For lInner = 1 To ml_INNER_LOOPS
        lNum = lNum + 1
      Next lInner
    Next lOuter
    
    rnTime = Timer - nStart
    
  End Sub

==Strings==
If you have a lot of code that does a lot of string concatenation you should consider using a string builder.  A string builder is usually provided as a class but the principle is quite simple and doesn't need any object oriented wrapping.  

The problem that a string builder solves is the time used in repeatedly allocating and deallocating memory.  The problem arises because VB strings are implemented as pointers to memory locations and every time you concatenate two strings what actually happens is that you allocate a new block of memory for the resulting string.  This happens even if the new string replaces the old as in the following statement:

  s = s &amp; &quot;Test&quot;

The act of allocating and deallocating memory is quite expensive in terms of CPU cycles.  A string builder works by maintaining a buffer that is longer than the actual string so that the text that is to be added to the end can simply be copied to the memory location.  Of course the buffer must be long enough to accommodate the resulting string so we calculate the length of the result first and check to see if the buffer is long enough; if it is not we allocate a new longer string.  

The code for a string builder can be very simple:

  Private Sub xAddToStringBuf(ByRef rsBuf As String, _
                              ByRef rlLength As Long, _
                              ByRef rsAdditional As String)
    
    If (rlLength + Len(rsAdditional)) &gt; Len(rsBuf) Then
      rsBuf = rsBuf &amp; Space$(rlLength + Len(rsAdditional))
    End If
    Mid$(rsBuf, rlLength + 1, Len(rsAdditional)) = rsAdditional
    rlLength = rlLength + Len(rsAdditional)
    
  End Sub

This subroutine takes the place of the string concatenation operator (''&amp;'').  Notice that there is an extra argument, ''rlLength''.  This is necessary because the length of the buffer is not the same as the length of the string.

We call it like this:
  
  dim lLen as long
  xAddToString s, lLen, &quot;Test&quot;

lLen is the length of the string.  If you look at the table of execution times below you can see that for values of Count up to about 100 the simple method is faster but hat above that the time for simple concatenation increases roughly exponentially whereas that for the string builder increases roughly linearly (tested in the IDE, 1.8GHz CPU, 1GB ram).  The actual times will be different on your machine but the general trend should be the same.

It is important to look critically at measurements like this and try to see how, or if, they apply to the application that you are writing.  If you build long text strings in memory the string builder is a useful tool but if you only concatenate a few strings the native operator will be faster and simpler.

==ByRef versus ByVal==
Many books on VB tell programmers to always use ByVal.  They justify this by saying that it is both faster and safer.

You can see that ByVal is slightly faster by the results of the [[#Tests|Tests]]:

Empty functions:
  xTestByRef     13.4190000000017 
  xTestByVal     13.137999999999 

With a simple arithmetic expression in the function:
  xTestAddByRef  15.7870000000039 
  xTestAddByVal  15.3669999999984 

You can also see for that the difference is slight.  Be careful when interpreting coding benchmarks, even the simplest can be misleading and it is always wise to profile the real code if you think you have a bottle-neck.

The other claim is that ByVal is safer.  This is usually explained by saying that a function in which all arguments are declared ByVal cannot alter the values of the variables in the caller because VB makes copies instead of using pointers.  The programmer is then free to make use of the incoming arguments in any way he or she sees fit, in particular they can be assigned new values without disturbing the original values in the caller.

The safety provided by this is generally outweighed by the fact that the compiler is then unable to enforce type checking.  In Visual Basic Classic variables are automatically converted between ''string'' and ''numeric'' types when necessary and possible.  If arguments are declared ByVal then the caller can provide a ''String'' where a ''Long'' was expected.  The compiler will silently compile the necessary instructions to convert the ''String'' to a ''Long'' and carry on.  At run time you might, or might not, discover the problem.  If the string contained a number then it will be converted and the code will 'work', if it doesn't then the code will fail at the point where the function is called.

  Function IntByVal(ByVal z as Double) as Long
    IntByVal = Int(z)
  End Function
  
  Function IntByRef(ByRef z as Double) as Long
    IntByRef = Int(z)
  End Function
  
  Dim s As String
  's = &quot;0-471-30460-3&quot;
  s = &quot;0&quot;
  Debug.Print IntByVal(s)
  Debug.Print IntByRef(s)
  
If you try to compile the little snippet of code above you will see that the compiler stops on the line:
  Debug.Print IntByRef(s)
it hightlights the ''s'' and shows a message box saying 'ByRef argument type mismatch'.  If you now comment out that line and run again you will not get an error.  Now uncomment this line:
  s = &quot;0-471-30460-3&quot;
and comment out this one:
  's = &quot;0&quot;
Run the program again.  Now the program fails but only at run time with 'Runtime error 13: Type mismatch'.

The moral is:
*use ByRef to cause the compiler to typecheck the arguments in function calls,
*never assign to the arguments of a function unless they are ''output'' parameters.

Look at the  [[../Coding_Standards#Procedure_Parameters|Procedure Parameters]] section in the [[../Coding_Standards|Coding Standards]] chapter for some suggestions about how to name the arguments so that it is always clear which are ''in'' and which are ''out'' parameters.

==Collections==

Collections are very useful objects.  They allow you to write simpler code than would otherwise be the case.  For instance if you need to hold on to a list of numbers given to you by the user you probably won't know in advance how many will be supplied.  This makes it difficult to use an array because you must either allocate an unnecessarily large array so that you are sure that no reasonable user would supply more or you must continually [[Programming:Visual Basic Class/Keywords#Redim|Redim]] the array as new numbers come in.

A Collection lets you avoid all that because it expands as necessary.  However, this convenience comes at the cost of increased runtime under some circumstances.  For many, perhaps most, programs this price is perfectly acceptable but some programs take so long to run that you must try to squeeze the last drop of performance out of every line.

This frequently occurs in programs doing scientific computations (don't tell me C would be a better language for such things because the same constraints and optimizations apply to C and all other languages as well).

One of the reasons a Collection is a convenient tool is because you can use a string as a key and retrieve items by key instead of by index.  But every time you ask for an item in a collection the collection must first figure out whether you have supplied an Integer (or Byte or Long) or a String which of course takes a small but finite amount of time.  If your application makes no use of the ability to look up items by String key you will get faster programs by using arrays instead because VB doesn't need to waste time checking to see if you supplied a String key instead of a whole number index.

If you want a Collection to simply hold a list of items without keys then you can emulate this behaviour with an array as follows (note that this code is not optimal, optimizing it is left as an exercise for the student):

  Public Sub Initialize(ByRef a() As Variant, _
                        ByRef Count As Long, _
                        ByRef Allocated As Long)
    Allocated = 10
    Redim a(1 to Allocated) 
    Count = 0
  End Sub
    
  Public Sub Add(ByRef NewItem as Variant, _
                 ByRef a() As Variant, _
                 ByRef Count As Long, _
                 ByRef Allocated As Long)
    Count = Count + 1    
    If Allocated &lt; Count then
      Allocated = Count
      Redim Preserve a(1 to Allocated)    
    End If
    a(Count) = NewValue
  End Sub

To use the above code you must declare an array of Variants and two
Longs.  Call the Initialize sub to start it all off.  Now you can call
the Add sub as often as you like and the array will be extended as
necessary.

There are a number of things to note about this seemingly simply
subroutine:

*Once the array size exceeds 10 a new array is allocated each time an item is added (replacing the original),
*The size of the array (recorded in the Allocated variable) is always the same as the Count when Count exceeds 10,
*No provision is made to delete items,
*the items are stored in the same order as they are added.
*all arguments are declared Byref

It is unlikely that any programmer would want to include exactly this routine
in production code.  Some reasons why are:

*NewItem is declared as Variant but the programmer usually knows the type,
*The initial allocation is hard coded using a literal integer,
*The name of the subroutine is too simple, it will probably clash with others in the same namespace. 
*No provision is made for removing items.
*Three separate pieces of information must be kept together but they are not bound together.

The performance of the emulated Collection depends on the relative
frequency of calls to Add, Item and Remove (see [[#Exercises]]).  An optimized version must be optimized for the use to which it will be put.  If no lookups by key are performed there is no need to provide a function for it and there is especially no need to provide data structures to make it efficient.

===Exercises===

*Extend the code presented in this section to emulate the Collection class in more detail.  Implement Item and Remove methods, see the VB help files for details of the exact method declarations but do not feel obliged to replicate them exactly.

*Write a test program to exercise all the features and time them so that you can tell when to use a Collection and when to use your emulated version.

*You should be able to think of at least two distinct implementations of Remove.  Think about the consequences of different implementations.

*Write an explicit description of the requirements that your version of the Collection class satisfies.

*Compare the behaviour of the built in Collection class and the new class, note any differences and give examples of uses where the differences do and do not matter.

*If you haven't already done so implement lookup by key.

*Explain why emulating all of the features of the Collection class using exactly the same interface is unlikely to yield significant improvements in performance for at least one specific use case.

==Dictionaries==

In VB a dictionary is actually supplied by the Scripting Runtime component.  It is rather like a Collection but also provides a means to retrieve the keys that were used.  Also, unlike the Collection, the keys can be any datatype including objects.  The principal differences between Collections and Dictionaries are as follows:

* Dictionaries have Keys and Items properties which return variant arrays
* Keys can be any datatype not just strings
* Enumeration using For Each returns the Keys not the Items
* There is a built in Exists method.

As with Collections the convenience of Dictonaries is sometimes outweighed by their run time expense.  One reason Dictionaries are frequently used instead of Collections is simply because of the Exists method.  This allows you to avoid overwriting existing data or to avoid attempts to access non-existent data.  However if the number of data items is small then a simple linear search can be faster.  A small number in this case might be as many as 50 items.  You can write a simple class that can be used instead of a Dictionary as shown below; note that no attempt is made to replicate all the behaviour of the dictionary and that this is done intentionally.

  'cDict.cls
  Option Explicit
  
  Private maItems() As String
  Private mlAllocated As Long
  Private mlCount As Long
  
  Public Sub Add(Key As String, Item As String)
    
    mlCount = mlCount + 1
    If mlAllocated &lt; mlCount Then
      mlAllocated = mlAllocated + mlCount
      ReDim Preserve maItems(1 To 2, 1 To mlAllocated)
    End If
    maItems(1, mlCount) = Key
    maItems(2, mlCount) = Item
    
  End Sub
  
  Public Property Get Count() As Long
    Count = mlCount
  End Property
  
  Public Function Exists(Key As String) As Boolean
    
    Exists = IndexOf(Key)
    
  End Function
  
  Public Function IndexOf(Key As String) As Long
    
    For IndexOf = 1 To mlCount
      If maItems(1, IndexOf) = Key Then
        Exit Function
      End If
    Next IndexOf
    IndexOf = 0
    
  End Function
  
  Public Property Let Item(Key As String, RHS As String)
    
    Dim lX As Long
    lX = IndexOf(Key)
    If lX Then
      maItems(lX, 2) = RHS
    Else
      Add Key, RHS
    End If
    
  End Property
  
  Public Property Get Item(Key As String) As String
    Item = maItems(IndexOf(Key), 2)
  End Property
  
  Public Sub Remove(Key As String)
    
    Dim lX As Long
    lX = IndexOf(Key)
    maItems(1, lX) = maItems(1, mlCount)
    maItems(2, lX) = maItems(2, mlCount)
    mlCount = mlCount - 1
  
  End Sub
  
  Public Sub RemoveAll()
    mlCount = 0
  End Sub
  
  Public Sub Class_Initialize()
    mlAllocated = 10
    ReDim maItems(1 To 2, 1 To mlAllocated)
  End Sub
  

A simple test routine can be used to demonstrate that this class is
faster than the VB dictionary for certain tasks.  For instance adding
32 items to the dictionary and then removing them again is faster
using cDict but if you double the number of items the VB Dictionary is
better.  The moral is: choose the correct algorithm for the task at
hand. 

Here is the test routine:

  Option Explicit
  
  Public gsModuleName As String
  
  
  Private mnStart As Double
  Private mnFinish As Double
  
  Private Const mlCount As Long = 10000
  
  
  Public Sub main()
    
    Dim litems As Long
    litems = 1
    Do While litems &lt; 100
      litems = litems * 2
      Debug.Print &quot;items=&quot;, litems
      Dim lX As Long
      mnStart = Timer
      For lX = 1 To mlCount
        xTestDictionary litems
      Next lX
      mnFinish = Timer
      Debug.Print &quot;xTestDictionary&quot;, &quot;Time: &quot;; Format$(mnFinish - mnStart, &quot;0.000&quot;)
      
      mnStart = Timer
      For lX = 1 To mlCount
        xTestcDict litems
      Next lX
      mnFinish = Timer
      Debug.Print &quot;xTestcDict     &quot;, &quot;Time: &quot;; Format$(mnFinish - mnStart, &quot;0.000&quot;)
    Loop
    
    
  End Sub
  
  
  
  Private Sub xTestDictionary(ByRef rlItems As Long)
    
    Dim d As Dictionary
    Set d = New Dictionary
    
    Dim lX As Long
    Dim c As Double
    For lX = 1 To rlItems
      d.Add Str$(lX), Str$(lX)
    Next lX
    For lX = 1 To rlItems
      d.Remove Str$(lX)
    Next lX
    
  End Sub
  
  
  Private Sub xTestcDict(ByRef rlItems As Long)
    
    Dim d As cDict
    Set d = New cDict
    
    Dim lX As Long
    Dim c As Double
    For lX = 1 To rlItems
      d.Add Str$(lX), Str$(lX)
    Next lX
    For lX = 1 To rlItems
      d.Remove Str$(lX)
    Next lX
    
  End Sub

===Exercises===
*Write a version of the cDict class that allows storage of other data types, using Variant arguments for instance, 
*Check the performance using a similar test routine.  
*Write a new test routine that performs other tests.  Does the relative performance of the new classes and VB Dictionary change?
*What happens if you try to retrieve or remove an item that does not exist?  How does the behaviour compare with that of the Dictionary?

==The Debug Object==

The Debug object has two methods:

;Print:prints its arguments to the immediate window,

;Assert: pauses the program if its argument is ''false''.

Both of these only have an effect when running in the IDE; at least that is the conventional wisdom.  Unfortunately it is not quite true of Debug.Print.  This method doesn't print anything when the program is running as a compiled executable but if the arguments are function calls they are still evaluated.  If the function call is very time consuming you will find that the compiled version doesn't run as fast as expected.

There two things that can be done:

*Remove all Debug.Print statements before shipping the product,
*Only use variables or constants as arguments to Debug.Print

If your program is both very CPU intensive and under continual development the second might be preferable so that you don't have to keep adding and removing lines.

Debug.Assert doesn't suffer from this problem so it is perfectly safe to assert the truth of complicated and time consuming functions.  The assertion arguments will only be evaluated when running in the IDE.

===Exercises===
*Write a short program to demonstrate that Debug.Print evaluates functions even when compiled,
*Modify it to show that Debug.Assert does not suffer from this problem,
*Show that Debug.Print has zero execution time in the compiled version if the arguments are constants or variables.

==Object Instantiation==
Long words for simple concepts.  This section deals with the runtime cost of creating objects.  The jargon phrase for this is ''object instantiation'' which means creating an ''instance'' of a ''class''.  An ''instance'' bears the same relation to a ''class'' as a ''machine'' bears to ''plans'' for it.  For any given class there can be as many instances as you like.

If an object takes a long time to construct and you create and destroy a lot of them during the running of the program you might save some time by not destroying them but putting them on a list of ready made objects for later use.

Imagine a program that simulates an animal ecology.  There could be, say, two classes of animals: herbivores and carnivores.

If you want to see any results in your lifetime the simulation must obviously run faster than real life speed so a lot of herbivores in particular will be born, breed and be eaten.  If each of these is represented by an object that is destroyed when the animal it represents is killed the system will be repeatedly allocating and deallocating memory which is a relatively expensive business in VB6. In such a program you know that new objects of the same kind are continually needed so you can avoid some of the memory allocation overhead by reusing dead objects instead of destoying them and creating new ones.  There are many ways of doing this.  Which one you choose depends on how many different classes of object you have.  If there are very few then you can create separate code for each, this can then be very highly tuned.  On the other hand if you have dozens of different classes (perhaps you have extended the simulation to include competing herbivores) you will quickly find that you have a maintenance problem.

The solution is to create a class that describes a general purpose object pool and an [[../Interfaces|Interface]] that can be implemented by each of the classes.

Before I describe the class and the interface here is a summary of the requirements:
*Only one pool class needed,
*The classes being 'pooled' should need small modifications to only the initialization and terminaion code to fit the ''pooling'' concept,
*The code that uses the pooled objects should not have to change except for calling the pool's GetObject function instead of using the New operator.

The technique hinges on the fact that VB6 has ''deterministic finalization''.  Another piece of jargon that simply means that VB6 destroys (finalizes) objects as soon as they become unused.  Every time VB6 decides that an object is no longer in use it calls the Class_Terminate method of that object.  What we can do is add a simple piece of code to each class that puts the terminating object on a list of available objects.  VB will see that the object is now in use and not deallocate the memory that it used.  Later on, instead of using the ''New'' operator to create new object we ask the object pool to give us one that had fallen out of use.  Even if the object takes very little time to set up this will be quicker than using ''New'' because it avoid both the allocation and deallocation of memory.

Here is an example object pool class and a class that can use it:

  'ObjectPool.cls
  Private moPool as Collection
  Public oTemplate As Object
  
  Private sub Class_Initialize()
    set moPool = New Collection
  End Sub
  
  Public Function GetObject() as Object
    if moPool.Count then
      Set GetObject = moPool(1)
      moPool.Remove(1)
    Else
      Set GetObject = oTemplate.NewObject
    End If
  End Function
  
  Public Sub ReturnToPool(Byref oObject as Object)
    moPool.Add oObject
  End Sub

To use this class declare a public variable in a ''bas'' module and assign a new ObjectPool object to it:

  'modPool.bas
  Public goPool As ObjectPool
  
  Public Sub Initialize()
    Set goPool = New ObjectPool
    Set goPool.oTemplate = New Herbivore
  End Sub

Now modify your Herbivore class by adding a call to ReturnToPool to the Class_Terminate method and adding a NewObject method:

  Private Sub Class_Terminate()
    goPool.ReturnToPool Me
  End Sub
  
  Public Function NewObject() as Object
    Set NewObject = New Herbivore
  End Function

For some simple scenarios this might even work.  However, there are several flaws, and at least one is a major problem.  The problem is that the object you get doesn't necessarily look like a shiny new one.  Now for some applications this doesn't matter because the client code will reinitialise everything anyway but many programs rely on the feature of the language that automatically sets newly allocated variables to zero.  In order to satisfy the requirement for minimum changes in the client we should extend both ObjectPool and the objects that are pooled by adding a ReInitialize method to the Herbivore:

  Public Sub ReInitialize()
    ' Do whatever you need to do to make the object 
    ' look like new (reset some attributes to zero, 
    ' empty strings, etc).
  End Sub

Don't do any more work in ''ReInitialize'' than absolutely necessary.  For instance if one of the attributes of the object is a dynamically allocated array it might not be necessary to clear it; it might be enough to set a flag or counter to indicate that no array elements are actually in use.

Now modify the GetObject method of ObjectPool:

  Public Function GetObject() as Object
    if moPool.Count then
      Set GetObject = moPool(1)
      GetObject.ReInitialize
      moPool.Remove(1)
    Else
      Set GetObject = oTemplate.NewObject
    End If
  End Function

Now everywhere that you use New Herbivore use goPool.GetObject instead.  If the Herbivore object has references to other objects you might, or might not, want to release those references by setting them to Nothing in the Class_Terminate method.  It depends on the behaviour of the objects and the rest of your program, generally you should put off doing expensive operations for as long as possible.

The use of an ''object pool'' can improve the performance of certain types of program without requiring the programmer to radically change the program design.  However don't forget that you might be able to get similar or greater improvements by using a better algorithm; again timing tests are the key to knowledge in this area.  Don't assume that you know where the bottleneck is, demonstrate where it is by profiling the program.

===Exercises===
*Write a simple program that creates and destroys lots of objects and time it.  Now modify it to use ObjectPool.
*Define an interface for pooled objects and implement it.  Does eliminating the use of ''As Object'' change the performance?
*Notice that the moPool collection is used simply as a FIFO stack, that is no use is made of the ability to find items by key.  Is there an alternative that would be faster?
*Is the FIFO behaviour of the stack important, that is, is it a deliberate feature or simply irrelevant?

Tip #1 – Move as much code as possible outside of loops.
Loops are always the most important thing to optimize in your code. Always try to move as much as you can out of a loop. That way code doesn't get repeated and saves you some cpu cycles. A simple example:


Code:
for i = 1 to 50
x = b		' Stays the same with every loop, get it outside of the loop!
k = j + i
next iChange that to:


Code:
x = b	'Moved outside the loop

for i = 1 to 50
	k = j + 1
next i
That may seem like a no-brainier but you would be surprised about how many programmers do that. The simple rule is, if it doesn't change with every loop iteration then move it outside of the loop as it doesn't need to be there. You only want to include code inside a loop that MUST be there. The more instructions you can clear out of a loop the faster we can run it. 

Tip #2 – Loop Unrolling
Loop unrolling can eliminate some compare and jump instructions. (Compare and jump instructions are used to create loops, you don't see them in visual basic, its behind the scenes stuff that you learn in ASM.) It also takes advantage of the ability of modern cpus that can fetch several instructions at a time. In a nutshell you get a good speed boast by unrolling loops. 

But there is something we need to know about loop unrolling. The largest bottleneck on modern computers is memory. So the designers of CPU's like Intel and AMD addressed this problem by using a cache on their cpus. This is basically a memory location that is accessed much faster by the CPU then standard memory. You want your unrolled loop to fit in that cache, if it doesn't then it could slow down your code. So you may want to experiment with gettickcount when you unroll you're loop. 

Example Loop:

Code:
For i = 1 To 100
        b = somefun(b)
Next i
unrolled Example:

Code:
For i = 1 To 100 Step 2
        b = somefun(b)
        b = somefun(b)
Next i
You can get up to a 25% gain in speed depending on what you are doing, you just have to experiment with this.

Tip #3 – Avoid dividing if possible.
A divide instruction is one of the most if not the most expensive instruction you can perform on a CPU. It is faster to multiply then divide!


Code:
B = 40 / 2

is slower then

Code:
b = 40 * 0.5
You can also develop some interesting algorithms using subtraction to get your result that is much faster then using division. If your using division in a loop, it is a must to change it to speed up your code. (I was going to also recommend trying shifting the bits for division but I forgot some versions of visual basic doesn't include the shift operator).

Tip #4 – In a nested conditional branch such as select case and nested if statements, put the things that are most likely to be true first in the nest, with the least likely things last. 

Tip #5 – Avoid use of variant variables.
The variant variable is all nice when you are new to visual basic, but its a habit you need to break. A variant variable is converted into its proper data type at runtime which can be very expensive. 

Tip #6 – Be careful when you declare variables.
If you don't use as something with every variable you declare, it is a variant! For example:

Code:
Dim a, b, c as string.
A = A variant
B = A variant
C = A string
I've seen some people use the notation:

Code:
dim x
x = blah
That is a NO NO! It may work yes, but its going to cost you speed.

Tip #7 – Reduce common expressions.
Sometimes you have two different variables that use part of the same calculation. Instead of doing the entire calculation for both variables, eliminate the redundant calculation.

Example:

Code:
x = a * b + c
y = a * b + d

is slower then

Code:
t = a * b
x = t + c
y = t + d
That is especially true if your using a redundant expensive calculation in a loop. 

Tip # 7 – Use long or integer for calculations.
A long is a 32 bit number and is more natural on 32 bit processors. Avoid other variables such as double, single, etc

Tip #8 – Use inline functions inside of loops.
Instead of calling a function, stick the code in the loop. This will make you're program larger if you repeat it in enough loops and should only be done in critical places. The reason is due to the over head of calling a function. Before the program calls a function, it has to push some things onto the stack. At the very least it will push the instruction pointer (IE: Return Address). Memory access is slow so we want to avoid that in critical places. 

Tip #9 Avoid using properties in loops.
Properties are accessed a lot slower then variables, so use variables instead:


Code:
for i = 1 to 50
text1.text = text1.text + b(i)
next i

is slower then

Code:
for i = 1 to 50
strbuffer = strbuffer + b(i)
next i
text1.text = strbuffer

Tip #10 – Load all the data you need from the disk.
Instead of loading one file at a time, load all of them at once. This will avoid future delay for the user.

Tip #11 – Make good use of the timer control. 
You can do background processing while waiting on a user. Use this time to prefetch data, calculations that are need, etc. 

Tip #12 – Minimize dot notation in your objects!
Each dot you use in a object makes visual basic do a call.


Code:
Myobject.one.two.three

is slower then

Code:
Myobject.one

Tip #13 Allocate enough memory at once.
When you create a dynamic array and you want to add elements that haven't been allocated yet, make sure you allocate enough for all of them instead of doing it one at a time. If you don't know how many you need, times what you have allocated by 2. Allocating memory is a expensive process. 

Tip #14 Avoid built in functions in loops.
If you have a algorithm that is looped that requires the len of your string. Make sure you cache the size of your string in a buffer and not call the function len() with each iteration of the loop:

Code:
for i = 1 to 100
	sz = len(string)
	'Do processing
next i

instead

Code:
sz = len(string)
for i = 1 to 100
	'Do Processing with sz
next i

Tip #15 Hide the control when your setting its properties.
Every time you update the properties of your control, you make it repaint. So if your developing something that displays complex graphics, may be a good idea to reduce that from happening so much.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This editing guide is to help guide those wishing to add to the book &quot;Deving The XGameStation&quot;.

=== How to Edit this book ===

==== Links ====

First of all, the links used in this book are in the form of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Deving_The_XGameStation/Your_Page_Here|Link Text]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Which appears as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Deving_The_XGameStation/Your_Page_Here|Link Text]]&lt;br&gt;

'''Important''': Do not create that page or click on that link!&lt;br&gt;
Notice that we use the book name as the main directory and that we replace spaces with underscores (&quot;_&quot;).

==== Inserting Code ====
To insert code in book text, enclose it in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and make sure that every line starts with a space. Doing so correctly will result in something that looks like this:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
 PRINT &quot;I can count to 100!&quot;
 FOR i = 1 TO 100
  PRINT i
 NEXT i
&lt;/code&gt;

==== Signatures ====
Signatures are used to tell people who wrote what, or to mark something as their text. They should '''not''', however, be found in the general text. This is a community effort, and there is no need to clutter text with signatures. You should only use your signature for opinionated areas, pages you created (use it once, to show yourself as 'controller' of that page, as most of the knowleadge should have come from you).&lt;br&gt;

To place a signature, you must first be logged in. '''Although you can create and edit pages without an account, it is highly recommend you create one'''. Without an account you cannot place signatures.

Simply insert &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; where you want your signature or click on the signature button above the textarea, 2nd button from the right. A signature looks like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

...and the non-textbook pages it links to. Textbooks it links to are fair enough, they are what this project is all about.

I understand this will be contentious, and if it is removed it can be moved to a subpage of [[m:Wikiversity]] where this proposed project is currently being developed, or perhaps we could share the wiki at de.wikiversity.org.

Justifications:

* Not a &quot;textbook&quot; by any stretch of the imagination
* Violations of project goals in [[Wikibooks:Welcome]]:
** &quot;Any content unrelated to our project&quot; - this is a new proposed project
** &quot;Primary research&quot; - research in wiki-based e-learning
** &quot;Proposals or prototypes of new Wikimedia projects&quot;
* Spawns many encyclopedia-esque articles, and encourages others to do the same.

[[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

====Update 1====
I posted [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-August/003906.html this mail] in response to [[User:Anthere|Anthere]]'s suggestion that it ought to be okay to move this content to Meta, although I also suggested the possibility of using a [http://www.wikicities.com/ Wikicity]. Which would people prefer? I don't think de.wikiversity.org will be practical, since the user interface is largely in German. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:39, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

: Meta would be better than Wikicities. Being ad-free would go much more with the open college kind of idea, and it deserves to be part of the wikimedia project proper, and not something more loosely associated with it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:43, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

====Update 2====
Another possibility here (and I think this might be the best). We might be able to persuade the appropriate people to change the DNS name &quot;de.wikiversity.org&quot; to just &quot;wikiversity.org&quot;, update the UI elements to English, and make that site the canonical multi-lingual site for developing this project, in a similar fashion to the other multi-lingual sites such as Meta, Wikisource and Wikicommons. It seems silly to restrict this wiki to German, when it gets an average of aroud 2 edits per day. I've been chatting to people on IRC for ages about this, but still can't seem to find the right person who can make this happen. I shall keep trying. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:32, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

====Update 3====
It seems that the status of this project is still unclear. I got the impression that as long as this is the case, then Wikimedia admins are not prepared to make any changes to the Wikimedia servers, and that Wikicities would not be prepared to host it. Since de.wikiversity.org is apparently the correct place, it ought to go there. If you register a new account there, you can change your preferences to get the user interface in English instead of German. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:57, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

====Update 4====
It seems to me that the general consensus so far is, &quot;it's okay to move it ''when'' the right place exists to move it to.&quot; I had a chat with [[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]] (see [[m:User:Eloquence]] for details) about this, and it seems one of the pre-requisites for getting 'the right place' is going to require major software changes to the MediaWiki software (e.g. to support grading of courses and the like), which, to me, implies &quot;which we'll implement when we've finished optimizing MediaWiki for Wikipedia&quot;, which implies &quot;when the Wikipedia project is finished&quot;, which implies &quot;never&quot;. Although he did give me a rough estimate of 1-2 years. Perhaps we should move this VFD and the current prototype at [[Wikiversity]] into a feature request report on bugzilla. ;-) - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:58, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
::I gotta be blunt here that I don't like discussions about what happens here on Wikibooks to be made and decisions reached that are off-site, which is why I was pushing to move the existing content to Meta (where major policy decisions regarding this project are currently ''being'' made.)  It appears though, that Meta doesn't want it, and by us kicking it off Wikibooks is going to make this a truly orphaned project that even Wikicities wont take. (I had to say WTF over this point!?!?)  It does not take a &quot;major software change&quot; to move the current content, and that is pure buck passing IMHO.  Organizing the schools and even conducting courses does not require any change to MediaWiki software, especially if they are going to follow the Diversity University (http://www.du.org/) model, or even Virtual University (http://www.vu.org/), which started on a dial-up BBS for crying out loud.  If the user base that is going to use this project really could be there, then it needs to be started up and courses taught in an &quot;audit-only&quot; environment for now.  Can a single course be pointed to that is happening at the moment?  I point to these other two projects because I think they do many things that are part of the goals of Wikiversity, but the #1 difference is that they are successful and Wikiversity is not.&lt;p&gt;What this project needs is somebody to say &quot;damn the torpedos.... let's get this thing running '''NOW!'''&quot; and then doing something.  I see that perhaps [[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] may have that fire, as he is the one that seems to be making the most coherant statements of support for this project.  (I would nominate Gabe as the first admin/bureaucrat for this project, if it happens.)  I know I don't have the energy needed to get this going as I have different things I want to accomplish, and this is a major project to take on with a lot of problems to resolve, although if it would get it off of Wikibooks I could be persuaded to make a major stab at it.&lt;p&gt;The main reason why the Wikimedia Foundation doesn't want to &quot;turn it loose&quot; is pure burecratic BS and a fear that it will turn into another Wikispecies.  Wikispecies is a cool idea, but the &quot;founders&quot; of the project got cold feet part-way into putting in content and decided to do a major revision that took more time than anybody was willing to put into it.  The same issue applies to Wikiversity so far as the Foundation is concerned, because the goals and purposes of this project are not clearly defined, and it seems like the participants are trying to bite off more than they can chew by proposing an entire multi-college research university (with Carnegie-Mellon research status and accreditation as well) to be formed out of whole cloth rather than a simple adult education center with a few classes.  If more more thought is done on how to &quot;bootstrap&quot; this whole project, perhaps some thoughts on how to convince the Foundation board to let a seperate wiki be kicked loose to let this project try to develop on its own can be made.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:21, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Ok, so what does need to be done to turn this into a workable proposal?  Is there a list somewhere of steps we need to go through?  Do we have a list of their concerns about our scope that we can address (either by proving we can do it or altering scope)?  For one I'd toss accreditation out the window- worry about that much later if ever, and lets concentrate on putting up content for now.  Same with research- if you want to teach a class on what you're researching fine, but this wouldn't be the place to write research papers.&lt;p&gt;I'm willing to spend time and effort doing this, but I'm going to be limited in the next couple weeks.  Just bad timing-  I'm relocating at the end of the week, and will lose computer access for 2 weeks (unless work lets me keep my laptop) followed by limited access until I'm set up.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:35, August 14, 2005 (UTC)

====Update 5====
I just started a [[meta:Proposals for new projects#Wikiversity|New project discussion thread]] on meta, with links to everything that I can find so far.  This is really what the status of this project should have been all along, and IMHO would have been thrown into the heap of other project ideas that have been tossed on this page.  If Wikiversity needs to be restarted as a proposal, then perhaps this will get the notice it needs.  I'm going to squeek real hard on this one --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:17, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

Might I advise that everyone interested in contributing to Wikiversity should add their name to the &quot;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_new_projects#Wikiversity People interested in joining]&quot; list there. The bigger the show of support the more likely it is that Wikiversity will be seriously considered by the Foundation.

===Comments/Votes===

* '''Transwiki/Delete''' - For my reasons above, although beginning to lean towards '''give up with trying to admin this site''' since it's upsetting the status quo that Wikibooks is &quot;the canonical dumping ground for vanity pages and other crap that no-one else wants&quot;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' - Its a useful idea that can eventually grow to be something big.  At that point creating its own wiki might make sense, but until then doing so prematurely may kill it.  As for the reasons above-  wikibooks itself spawns many encyclopedia-esque articles, thats a reason to delete the entire site.  And calling it primary research is a stretch, the idea of a wikibook is primary research itself under that definition. --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:22, August 11, 2005 (UTC)
** You haven't actually addressed any of the points above. It's not a textbook, so it ought to be relocated. We can still move it to Meta, which wouldn't &quot;kill it&quot;. The other encyclopedia articles found on the site are being deleted, or pasted in as pages to other books. You also seem to misunderstand &quot;primary research&quot;. The Wikibook [[Chess]] is not primary research, unless we are to believe that the author of this book actually invented the game. Perhaps you should read the [[Wikibooks:Welcome]] page. Whether it's &quot;useful&quot; or not is surely irrelevant. I might find it &quot;useful&quot; to copy a complete fork of Wikipedia to this site, but does that mean I should? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:38, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
::I think transwiking it to meta would kill it.  As it is now, its not very prominent, at meta it would be even less so.  I hadn't even *heard* of meta until this debate, I had at least heard of wikibooks from several places before now.  I'd have 3 reasons why moving it at this point is a bad idea.

::#As we can't get en.wikiversity.org yet, it would need to be moved twice.  This is confusing and difficult to both users and contributors.
::#Putting it on Meta makes it less prominent, and won't net us more contributors
::#It does not yet have even 1 working course.  My experience with user contributed systems in open sourc shows that advertising something prominently before its ready for primetime causes permanent damage to the project in the public image.  It becomes thought of as immature and badly managed.  It really needs a selection of operational courses before that step is taken.

::I don't misunderstand primary research.  If you claim that writing a course is &quot;primary research&quot; into running wikicourses, then every wikibook in existance is &quot;primary research&quot; into writing a book.  Wikiversity is not primary research, any more than the book on Chess is.

::And while yes, wikiversity isn't quite a book, there is a definite linkage between instructional books and instructional courses.  Wikiversity can easily be seen as a framework of additional resources designed to help understand a wikibook.  While it may not be a perfect solution, keeping it here until its ready to be released as a stand alone project (meaning whatever magical permission we need and a sufficient base of courses to warrant it) is far better than throwing us somewhere in meta.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:57, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - and '''transwiki''' to Meta.  I have been reading a great deal of what Aya has been saying about Wikiversity, and it really is inappropriate to have on Wikibooks.  I just got into a little bit of a discussion about Wikiversity on Foundation-l (see http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-August/003871.html and my firey reply to the suggestion for yet another project being &quot;dumped&quot; on Wikibooks).  This whole thing should have been on Meta in the first place as an &quot;Alpha test&quot; (not even Beta like Wikinews) of the project.  Wikibooks is very much an inappropriate place to put any new project, even if it will have a close relationship with user on Wikibooks (which from my experience does not totally match up with reality).  Either that or it needs to be moved to Wikicities as a new project there.  BTW, I have a &quot;new project proposal&quot; that I did try to &quot;dump&quot; on Wikibooks, but before I got too far I removed the content from Wikibooks and instead put it on meta, and even put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags on the content to make sure it was removed.  I have been assured that an initial test page or two on Meta is perfectly reasonable for a new project that wants to get a &quot;look and feel&quot; down on a new project idea.&lt;p&gt;The main reason I think Wikiversity was put on Wikibooks is because one of the founders of Wikibooks really liked the idea and because there was at the time very little activity on Wikibooks, he could get away with it.  There was this ''idea'' that Wikibooks was going to support Wikiversity, but it appears as though they really support very different goals.&lt;p&gt;One other final and major reason for the transwiki to Meta is that most of the in depth discussion (what discussion there is) is happening on Meta as well with its own seperate community.  This is also happening with Wikijunior, and I'm trying to change that with Wikijunior.  If the whole project were on Meta, the contributors and the discussion could all happen at the same place.  If the admins on Meta were getting fed up with having to deal with all of the editing issues of Wikiversity, perhaps that will be enough motivation for &quot;green lighting&quot; Wikiversity onto its own server, where it really belongs ultimately, just as the German Wikiversity already is on its own Wiki server.&lt;P&gt;BTW, see also the Foundation-l discussion starting with (http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-August/003830.html) --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:57, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' and '''transwiki''' Unfortunately, that's really what we have to do here - especially as this is not a textbook, as previously mentioned. I think differently to Gabe Sechan, in that giving Wikiversity its own server might help to raise the profile of what is a worthwile initiative. The overlap between Wikiversity and Wikibooks is enormous and creating a seperate &quot;Wikiversity&quot; project might help to clarify the differences so we can minimise the duplication that might occur if Wikiversity remained a subproject of Wikibooks. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 23:02, August 11, 2005 (UTC)
** ''giving Wikiversity its own server might help to raise the profile of what is a worthwile initiative'' - I agree. I was really hoping to get en.wikiversity.org started up, but [[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] doesn't seem to be allowed to break the Wikimedia 'prime directive', which is that he can't make any server changes without the correct authorization. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:10, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Transwiki'''. This is going to be a lot of work, but it simply must be done. Hm. But does Meta want it? have you talked to the people there about this? I don't want it here, but I don't want to see it transwikied and then deleted en-masse either. Hm... [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:46, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
** ''But does Meta want it?'' - To be honest, I don't think anyone actually ''wants'' it. The question should really be which wiki ''should'' host it. Looking at [[m:Meta:About]], and related pages, it seems as if it's the most appropriate place. The other alternative I suggested was to share the de.wikiversity.org server, but all the UI elements are in German, so this may be less optimal. I'll have a chat with the Meta-types about this. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:10, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''keep'''. I think it is horrible to delete good content without having a place for it. Dumping it on Meta is another thing that I oppose as Meta has its function as much as Wikibooks has, ofloading it without a proper solution is morally wrong. Giving it a seperate &quot;server&quot; is nonsense, no project has its own servers except for Commons. When you mean that it should get its seperate &quot;project&quot;, that may be an idea. [[User:GerardM|GerardM]] 07:24, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
:::This is more a case of semantics, but by seperate project that means it has it own domain, unique set of admins, and seperate editorial policies.  The seperate editorial policies is already there, as well as semi-independent user base of support as well.  As far as seperate physical computers, that makes no difference either.  I don't care how the content is physically stored on hard drives, but by having seperate domains and work space (as well as seperate database tables) there is no reason to keep everything on the same physical &quot;server&quot;.  Besides, that is just a technical issue.  And besides, I think it should get it own seperate server so far as this is an experimental concept that needs some real leadership to decide what the future direction this project should be going.  As far as leadership ''here'' on Wikibooks, Aya is leading the way to try and get this content removed. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:19, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' from here, no question, and transwiki if people wish. It is clearly ''not'' suitable content for Wikibooks: [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Wikibooks is for writing free-content text-books]], and ''not'' [[Wikibooks:Welcome|a place for users to publish content unrelated to our main objective]]. [[User:Dan100|Dan100]] 08:29, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' and '''Transwiki'''. I'd like to see shelter extended until the project can be transplanted to the appropriate en.wikiversity.org domain.&lt;p&gt;There is no reason so urgent as to deport the Wikiversity. Yes, it is a &quot;prototype&quot;/&quot;proposal&quot; and yes, the sin is unforgivable. A blemish on an otherwise unadulterated body. But its presence here was not a dim-witted action.&lt;p&gt;A review of the obsolete, [[Wikibooks:What_Wikibooks_is_not]] reminds us that &quot;Wikibooks hosts instructional resources&quot;. Returning to the canon, [[Wikibooks:About]], I find as many inclusive attributes as I do exclusive injustices. Many of the existing schools serve as [[Wikibooks:Annotated_texts]] based upon developing Wikibooks. For instance: [[Wikiversity:School_of_Sociology]]. Take note of the [[Wikiversity:Logic]] branch of the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Philosophy]]. It is clearly situated as a learning aid, a primer for the student who is or will be reading associated Wikibooks. The [[Wikiversity:School_of_Literature_and_English_Studies]] quite clearly intends to develop books (though they're labeled &quot;courses&quot;) and the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Economics]] has taken care to link to Wikipedia when appropriate and to develop Wikibooks otherwise.&lt;p&gt;To [[User:Aya|Aya]]'s contention that the schools spawn encyclopedia-esque articles, I rebuke, that such articles are either incomplete manuals or misplaced Wikipedia entries (and can be added to, moved or deleted). There are pages that have yet to be collated and chapters that have yet to be written. Remember, [[m:Wiki is not paper]]. It is not criminal, that the schools are developing their books within the Wiki, instead of first developing them personally then posting them.&lt;p&gt;As they are currently manifest, the Schools are reading guides, to both Wikibooks and the Wikipedia. &quot;In order to properly instruct students in various disciplines&quot;, we will have to expand our Paper definition of a &quot;textbook&quot;.  Though the stated goals of the [[m:Wikiversity]] are strong and noble, they are inchoate, undeveloped. The items of the [[m:Wikiversity]] mission have rarely been attempted within the schools. What is developing in the womb of Wikibooks is quite in line with the [[Wikibooks:About|Wikibooks project goals]].&lt;p&gt;As for transgressions, regretfully the schools have not reached those aspirations. As I've said, within the current system, the &quot;content&quot; is quite related to Wikibooks, and the instruction of students in non-fiction. There has been no primary research conducted within any of the schools. The [[m:Wikiversity]] proposal is certainly a prototype whose only supporting proof-of-concept would be the de.wikiversity.org project. Though the work is at times sloppy, and quite clearly racing at the speed of a tortoise, it is quite thoroughly related to the instruction of people through the use of Wikibooks, with references to the Wikipedia for specific terminology. The Schools have not met a single goal for the [[m:Wikiversity|Wikiversity (meta)]] project. They have more commonality as vulgar aids for dense textbook material (as instructional guides to the self-taught/self-motivated) than they do amongst the dialectic nature of the academy. Please, build us a new home, don't send us back to [[Wikipedia:The Matrix|the source]]. It would be a violent gesture to rip out the working material built by the schools and transplant it into a foreign body. Many have not registered as contributors nor recognition of the landscape. When en.wikiversity.org is ready, then it will be a proper time for weaning. I doubt we'll have progressed so much toward the [[m:Wikiversity]] goals in the meantime, as to have egregiously distanced ourselves from the [[Wikibooks:About|goals]] of the Wikibooks. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 10:18, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Here is the ''urgency'' in deleting this content:  Because Wikiversity (and Wikijunior as well) exist on Wikibooks with their own guidelines, policies, goals, and content; many people think that Wikibooks is a place to dump any other kind of similar project.  This essentially turns Wikibooks into a virtual Wikicities.  That is not the purpose of Wikibooks, and we really don't have the user base nor the admins necessary to be able to keep track of all of this content.  This is not the only such project, but Wikiversity and Wikijunior in particular have more or less &quot;official&quot; sanction from the Foundation board (at least several board members are seeking to protect these projects).  This '''strongly''' encourages others to start similar projects on Wikibooks and really confuses people as to what the purpose of Wikibooks is all about.  All told, this project should ''never'' have been on Wikibooks in the first place, and what we are trying to do right now is to clean things up here.  Wikibooks has a tremendous amoung of neglect over the past year or so, despite the near heroic efforts of a couple of active admins who were seriously overloaded.  That things seem to be changing on Wikibooks is true, and part of that is because those who are here on Wikibooks trying to clean things up want this project to succeed.  With over 10,000 wikibook modules having been written, and a very steady addition to the number of Wikibooks on here (real Wikibooks, not special projects) this is turning into a successful project with some very real potential.&lt;p&gt;You must admit that at some point in the future that Wikiversity must go.  It needs to be on its own wiki server at some point in the future.  I fail to see what the difference is between Wikiversity and the host of [[meta:Proposals for new projects|other well meaning projects]] other than this seems to have the support of at least one Foundation board member.  We are not trying to ''rip out the working material built by the schools and transplant it into a foreign body'', but rather trying to put this content where it should have been in the first place.&lt;p&gt;If you want to have an experimental wiki, it really should be Wikicities.  That way the people who are interested will have full editorial control over the content, it will not have any conflicts with existing Wikimedia projects (Wikibooks in this particular case).  It is not my fault or that of anybody else here on Wikibooks that the Wikimedia Foundation is refusing to start any new major sister project, and it isn't my position to even to suggest how to accomplish something like that except to sweet talk the Foundation board into giving you a chance.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:12, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

::::The question is- what problems is it currently causing?  Is it actually causing overload to admins or is this a potential problem?  If it is, can this be solved through extra volunteers (I would gladly volunteer to do so)?  You may have an argument that it shouldn't have been here in the first place, but lets face facts- it *is* here.  Moving it would adversely effect the contibutor base for the project, as the set of people who would develop for either project has a large overlap.  This is a project that it seems everyone likes, including most admins of wikibooks.  It may not be the absolute best solution, but right now the best solution doesn't seem to be possible (a wikiversity.org site, with sufficient coursework to get interest from the get go).  It may not fit the ideal design of how wiki projects start, but thats life- sometimes worse is better.  I do believe this is better for both projects-  don't forget that a lot of wikibooks will get written/improvements added due to wiki courses.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:57, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

* no vote, since I don't work on wikibooks, although in my opinion the wikiversity pages should be moved somewhere else. Please do not use meta-wiki for it (that's not the place for it). Probably these pages could go temporarily to http://de.wikiversity.org (which is currently sort of a playground for experimenting with wikiversity) - this seems to be the place where it fits best. --[[User:Elian|Elian]] 14:19, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' on Wikibooks for now, but only if scope is limited in such a way that it is in reasonable compliance with Wikibooks policy (e.g. no original scientific research). Working on curricula or syllabi is borderline acceptable, in my opinion. If the Wikibooks community doesn't want it, the relevant pages could be moved to Meta -- if the allocated space there is clearly limited -- or an en.wikiversity.org demonstration wiki could be set up.--[[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]] 17:35, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
** Oh, how I would love it if an en.wikiversity.org wiki was set up. I've been [[m:Talk:Requests for new languages#Requests for new Wikiversity languages|trying to get this to happen for over a month now]], but have met with resistance every time. If you think you can make this happen, please do. Our best solution so far seems to be to share the de.wikiversity.org wiki. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:01, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
***Would de.wikiversity.org want us?  That sounds like a solution designed to cause problems.  We would then have a mix of english and german pages on one site, confusing both sets of users.  We'd have a bunch of pissed off german contributors who don't want us around (I can see the revert wars now).  And we'd have the very non-intuitive idea of looking for the english wikiversity under a german page.  It makes some sense in the technical sense (hey, its half right), but ignores the human factor of mixing 2 sets of users and contributors.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:57, August 12, 2005 (UTC)
****Regarding de.wikiversity.org, I took a look through the recent changes, and it now seems to get 1 or 2 edits per day on average. The project has no admins at all. I don't think there is a &quot;they&quot; to want us or not. Reading the content there, they seems equally confused at to what the project is all about. It's pretty much a dead wiki, so we might be able to breathe some life back into it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:09, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' for now, until en.wikiversity.org is created, as there still appears to be no urgency to delete this content, apart from being a little undefined and hence irritating to a few on this project (I admit I'm not really one). Why move it before a &quot;proper&quot; home for it is created? Maybe this is the incentive it needs? I must say, I am shocked to find Wikiversity on Vfd. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 21:14, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
**The problem is that it defies our rules. People can look at it (and, to a lesser extent, [[Wikijunior]]) and think they can start any crazy project they wish. I would be quite happy to keep it here for logistical reasons, BUT the problem of new rule-defying guinea-pig projects being started on us must not be underestimated.

***I understand the precedent argument, ie creating an excuse for other projects to be dumped on Wikibooks (although I don't know any examples), but maybe the healthiest view we can take on this (or mine at least) is to treat Wikiversity as an exception, an anomaly, and probably due to move at some stage soon, ie when that space is defined and provided. Until then I personally don't see the hurry - it's too interesting and huge a project to be kicked around. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 23:34, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Transwiki''' because it is not a textbook, and hence violates our rules. But, also because it encourages other new projects that don't conform to our goals. I've found the same thing with vandalism, if you fix it quickly, then you get less of it. I think that it has to do with what contributors perceive to be acceptable conduct. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:52, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
** The way I see it (as do many others) is that people don't read the rules, they just see what else is on the site, and mimic that, while changing it sufficiently to spread whatever it is they want to spread into the memepool. Maybe we need to sit back and rethink what this site is actually all about. I merely suggested it might be a good idea to only write 'books' because the site is called 'Wikibooks', which would make sense to newbies. A book, in my mind, is one of those things made out of dead trees, which usually contains a contents page, and several chapters about a specific topic. Now I realise that wiki is not paper, but without sticking to content that is book-like, how are newbies going to understand what sort of content we want here. Perhaps I'd be happier if Wikiversity was re-organised as a book. That is to say a book called, perhaps, &quot;The Wikiversity Project&quot;, which follows [[WB:NP]], and whose content is a guide to what the &quot;Wikiversity&quot; project will be, if and when it happens, rather than just a blind stab at a prototype for a project which no-one seems to be agree on the purpose of. It should focus more on the goals of such a project, and include information about any proposed software changes that would be required to the MediaWiki software in order to implement such a project, rather than just be a bunch of pages called &quot;School of Meaninglessness Studies&quot;, etc., linking to a bunch of fictional course units, although these could arguably be included in the book as examples of how Wikiversity might ultimately be structured. Maybe it's the form, rather than the content I object to. After all, Wikipedia and Wikibooks have a lot of content overlap, but one is formatted as encyclopedia articles, and the other as a book. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:56, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' until discussion of wikiversity as its own project and/or as a parent/child project of wikibooks identifies a clean distinction between the two; much harder to agree on how to migrate content to Meta, there is currently no good waz to mediate this kind of transwiki placement dispute, and the existing Wikiversity content (and links to it) is important enough to merit care.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 21:12, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' exactly as per Sj. It doesn't cause a problem for Wikibooks, so let it stay and grow until it finds a more permanent home. There's no value in deleting good information. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] 21:56, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
* '''Keep''', as with Sam. &quot;Transwiki&quot; means precisely nothing when there's nowhere to send it to (as a meta sysop, I'd have to delete it were someone to attempt to &quot;transwiki&quot; it there). [[User:Jdforrester|James F.]] [[User_talk:Jdforrester|(talk)]] 11:51, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' for now. I believe the Wikiversity is being judged according to what it ''could be'' instead of according to what it is ''now''. Most of the contributions to Wikiversity are textbook-like (please visit the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Mathematics]] for a good example). I believe that many contributors initially respected the Wikibooks policy, even though some of them probably had visionary dreams about what the Wikiversity could become. More recently, contributors have started to be more vocal about the possibilities and have sparked the debate about other types of content. The fact remains that most of the content is either of the &quot;reading list/bibliography/resources&quot; kind or the introductory chapter kind. I would personally love to have the Wikiversity in its own domain, with its own courses and other experimental learning techniques, but we are not ready yet. I think we still need to work a little more on our textbooks.([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 18:16, 26 August 2005 (UTC))
* '''Keep'''  When I first coined the name (at least I had not seen it used before) in a comment to Mav it was with a much grander vision than what I see now.  For now it is little more than a hierarchical series of textbooks in the form of course outlines; that leaves it best suited for Wikibooks.  When there is evidence that someone has in fact guided a &quot;student&quot; through at least a one semester course here in anything, and can report on his real experience, then maybe we will be ready to have this as a separate Wikiversity project. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 20:14, 16 September 2005 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' Until it get's it's own wiki
** Could you sign your vote, please? ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 12:24, 21 October 2005 (UTC))
* '''Keep''' and '''Transwiki''' when it gets its own wiki. It is a great idea and would definitly be better than what most online learners are doing with forums. Obviously, needs a great deal of work right now, and wikibooks is the project that wikiversity should be closest too; no other major wiki site is dedicated to learning other than wikibooks. Wikipedia is just a collection of knowledge, Wikinews is for news... but people go to wikibooks to learn. That is why wikiversity should stay here... no other project works enough with this one. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

=== What is the harm? ===
I read this entire page. Can someone please explain '''exacly''' what problems wikiversity causes for wikibooks? I just do not see how wikiversity pages harm anything. It seems like some people are making legalistic readings of what wikibooks should be so as to target wikiversity for elimination from this wiki. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 23:24, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
:As I tried to explain above, the main '''harm''' that is caused to Wikibooks by letting this project co-exist with Wikibooks is that it has seperate policies, goals, and users.  [[meta:Proposals for new projects]] has a list of other really cool ideas that well-meaning people (including myself) have proposed as new projects for consideration with the Wikimedia Foundation.  By allowing this project to be here it encourages other projects like those listed on meta to come to Wikibooks.  That is a major discussion and something that perhaps Wikibooks could become (as a spawning ground for new projects), but that is also a '''major''' policy change for not only Wikibooks but for the Wikimedia Foundation in general.  This in effect turns Wikibooks into a variant of Wikicities.&lt;p&gt;It is my belief that Meta is a much more appropriate place for things of this nature to occur, or perhaps some reassurance from the Wikimedia Foundation that if you start a project on Wikicities that there is a chance it could be &quot;brought in&quot; as Wikimedia sister project.  By being a Wikimedia sister project (like Wikibooks, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, etc.) you get a certain built-in user base and support team to help you out that being on your own doesn't exist.  That is the primary draw for all of these new proposals, and Wikiversity is just one of dozens that have been made over the years that doesn't have its own seperate wiki yet.&lt;p&gt;I also have a major issue with the current Foundation board over the stance for new projects to be started, just like Wikiversity.  There is so much resistance to starting a new major sister project that I have expressed that a [[meta:Proposals for new projects#Doing Research and Starting a New Project|disclaimer be added]] that no new project will ever be start for any reason unless it is a pet project of a board member.  I wrote the current &quot;disclaimer&quot; on Meta because I felt at least somebody tripping across those pages needed a little warning before going off and trying to start a new project idea.&lt;p&gt;Wikiversity should have been a new project proposal just like that, and there is a discussion page on Meta that talks about what the direction for this project should be.  Indeed, immediately after I write this comment I'm going off and writing up Wikiversity as a new project proposal where it should be.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:42, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that Wikiversity stuff doesn't belong here.  Wikibooks has an identity and mission, and other stuff doesn't belong here.  I don't know what Rob means about no new projects being created unless they are the pet project of a board member, and I invite him to email me personally to discuss this.  I think he's mistaken about something important. --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 15:04, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:Rob- Thanks for your reply. Yesterday I happened to notice a comment on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:History_of_Wikipedia  a wikipedia history page] from September 2003 to the effect that wikibooks did not even merit a wikipedia entry. At that time, there was already discussion at wikibooks of the idea of creating a wikiversity at wikibooks.  There was also discussion of the wikiversity concept at [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wikiversity  Meta] in 2003 including, “Wikibooks would be the bookstore of WikiU?” Clearly, it is easier to construct individual wiki books that it is to create a wiki university. Wikiversity has been in a holding pattern for the past two years. Some people have argued that there needs to be special new software support for a wikiversity, but I do not see that as a reason not to provide a wikiversity namespace now. The software support could come later. I think the main thing holding back wikiversity is related to why [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia Nupedia] failed. Nupedia was an early incarnation of wikipedia in which all articles were reviewed by experts, generally people with a Ph.D. Similarly, a wikiversity calls for experts who can create educational wiki pages. Generally, the people who are qualified to do this are busy earning a living and have little time or motivation to “give away” the expertise that they normally get paid for. Given these facts, wikiversity has been slowly developing as a few dedicated individuals spend their “spare time” to work on the project.

:There is an interesting phenomenon by which new wikis are created. Often, an existing wiki serves as an incubator for new wikis. It has never been clear to me why there are people who are in a rush to narrow the focus of existing wikis and sterilize them to remove everything that does not fit a narrow definition of the purpose of the wiki. Maybe a sociologist can explain why it is that people feel the need to specialize and exclude anyone/anything that does not fit a narrow  definition of a wiki’s mission. We have reached the point where a few guardians of wikibooks can no longer stand to have wikiversity present. It seems strange that a wiki that was struggling to be born just two years ago is now in a hurry to push another fledgling wiki out of the nest. I think many supporters of the wikiversity idea may wonder why other wiki projects have been given name spaces during the past two years while wikiversity has not. I suspect that most of the supporters of wikipedia are busy working to feed their families and do not have time to make noise and lobby for a wikiversity namespace, but if the wikiversity was created they would start to contribute to it. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 18:21, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

All of that is by-the-by. Wikibooks is a place to write free text books, ''not'' a place to run pet projects. Wikiversity should simply be deleted, and if people want to continue their project, find their own servers. [[User:Dan100|Dan100]] 18:51, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

==== undadored links ====

The main &quot;harm&quot; I have noticed it the use of undadored links links. Any unadored link goes into the main namespace of wikibooks. For example I found the a link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Human Resource Management]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[Wikiversity:School of Library and Information Science]]

Now guess what - That link is a redirect to [[Fire Officer IV/Human Resource Management]] and has nothing to to with &quot;Library and Information Science&quot;. This is ony one example. [[Wikiversity]] has hundreds of those unadored links pointing to Wikibooks. Most of which are - luckily - still red. 

There are several problems attached to this situation:

# [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks#Wikibooks_is_not_an_encyclopaedia]] - Quite a few of those links would better point to [[Wikipedia]].
# [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] - Quite a few of those pages break the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].
# [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote#.22eternal_stub.22_semi-books_should_be_merged]] - Quite a few of those pages would better be chapters of larger books.
# Those links will all be broken when [[Wikiversity]] gets it's own server. 

As it is the situation is bad for Wikibooks now and will be bad wir Wikiversity in the future.

===Reassurance===
Ok, can the most vocally opposed people here please assure those of us who are interested in preserving what Wikiversity has done so far '''will not be deleted until the new domain is created'''? Dumping onto meta is only slightly better but it seems like the frustration of wikibookians to rid themselves of this project is akin to chopping down some overgrown bushes in your garden and then throwing them into the neighbours' house. I do appreciate that it is annoying to many, but can you also acknowledge that many people would be completely shocked if this were to just vanish? Can we, for the moment, treat it as &quot;pending transwiki&quot; and then just pound the developers on it? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 15:57, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm sorry I didn't get it posted here earlier.  I have [[meta:Talk:Wikiversity#Wikiversity &quot;Relaunch&quot;|set up a time-table]] for what needs to happen with this project and is tied to this VfD.  If this process goes through according to formal Wikimedia Foundation policies, the earliest that it can be transwikied to a whole new server is going to be November 15th.  I think that a deletion of content from Wikibooks before then would be a very bad idea, and I for one will strongly object if it happens before that time.  Indeed, it won't be until January of next year on the time table before any serious deletion will really occur on Wikibooks.  Is that acceptable?

Apparently the Wikimedia Foundation board is also taking a strong interest in Wikiversity, and considerable effort has been made to try and keep it as some sort of Wikimedia project.  Of course the devil is in the details, and it is the details that need to be worked out.  If you want to see this project succeed, please get involved with the new project proposal, and voice your opinions on what Wikiversity should be looking like.  I am not trying to kill this project, but trying to find a good permanent home for it.  By turning this into a formal new project proposal, there are existing policies that can be enabled in order to make this whole project idea succeed.  In addition, '''DON'T STOP CONTRIBUTING TO WIKIVERSITY!'''  If and when Wikiversity gets moved somewhere else, what is added on to the current set of pages here on Wikibooks will be transfered and anything that can be done to demonstrate the viability of Wikiversity will be useful to the overall discussion of how valuable it will be to the Wikimedia Foundation.  Based on what I've seen so far and current support, I seriously doubt that it will be killed completely as a project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:35, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
:Thanks Rob, I think that overall that's a much better message to be sending. Yes, I am involved (sortof) in the project proposal and will be more so in the future. It seems that now what we need to do is get some developers' input - which seems harder now if Erik has indeed departed :( [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 08:46, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
::I fail to see what the big issues are from developers unless MediaWiki really is incredibly crufty with regards to namespace redirection (i.e. notation tags for interwiki links like wikisource: and wikipedia:).  That is a major bug, IMHO if that is the case, and something that needs to be changed.  The rest of what needs to be done in terms of setting up a seperate wiki is fairly normal and something that happens all of the time, particularly to new language domains.  And wikiversity.org is already &quot;owned&quot; by the Wikimedia Foundation, so only a couple of minor DNS records need to be modified in order for en.wikiversity.org to be created... again something like what should happen already for creating a new language wiki for existing project.  As for the new feature requests that pertain to Wikiversity, I think that they will get priority (and perhaps developer support) once the need for such features starts to come forward.  Do what can be done &quot;manually&quot; and then try to demonstrate why it would be useful.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:59, 20 August 2005 (UTC)


== Wiki software ==

Why doesn't someone create a wikibook or wikiversity on programming the wiki software and hope some wikibook users will help with implementing the new features? --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 20:36, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

There is documentation  on the MediaWiki codebase at [[http://www.mediawiki.org]].  Its not really the issue here though- while certain enhancements would be nice, we aren't stalled waiting on software changes.  This is really about where does/should the content be placed.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:59, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:abacus|abacus]] is an ancient calculating device formerly used all over the world. It was originally a dust board, that is a board covered with dust (or wax) on which to trace figures, such as a writing pad is used nowadays. Later it became a board with grooves in which to slide counters back and forth. Finally, it became the familiar abacus, a wooden frame with beads on rods. In modern times, it has fallen out of use, being replaced by written arithmetic and, more recently, calculators; however, it is still used in Asian countries, in particular China and Japan.

There are many methods to use an abacus, those presented here are mostly classical, Japanese methods.

== Overview ==

'''''Gregory Goyle''''' is one of Draco Malfoy's cronies.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Throughout the entire series, Gregory Goyle has very little independent activity. When we first see him, he has settled into the role of second sidekick to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], and with very few exceptions, he seems to have no activity separate from Draco for six years of the seven-year span of the story.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] introduces himself to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] on the Hogwarts Express, Goyle and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] are in attendance. Harry turns Draco's offer of alliance down, so Draco &quot;suggests&quot; that Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] should share their food, which Harry has bought from the cart. Goyle reaches out for some, and is attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], Ron's rat. Draco retreats in some confusion with Crabbe and Goyle.

It is mentioned that, when final grades were given out, Harry had hoped Goyle, &quot;who was as almost as stupid as he was mean,&quot; would fail; but he apparently scraped through.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry needs a distraction in Potions class to allow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to steal potions from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s office, he chooses to throw his firecracker into Goyle's cauldron of Swelling Solution.

Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stay at Hogwarts over Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, attempting to determine whether Draco knows who the Heir of Slytherin is, use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise themselves as Slytherins. Harry becomes a simulacrum of Goyle, while Ron becomes a copy of Crabbe. While they do fool Draco, and learn some useful things about him, they only find out that he does not know who the Heir is, either.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle visit Harry in his compartment on the Hogwarts Express, but are unable to take any action against Harry because of the presence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]].

In an attempt to scare Harry during the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]] dress as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], but their scheme unravels when Harry sends a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] to charge them down.

Harry later visits [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] via the secret passages and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility cloak]]; while there with Ron, they run into Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle, who start taunting Ron, believing him to be alone. Harry, from the concealment of his cloak, starts attacking them, but in the process becomes partially visible. Harry then has to hurry back to the school in order to convince Professor Snape that he has not been out of the school.

It is mentioned that during the run-up to the final Quidditch match, between Gryffindor and Slytherin, Crabbe and Goyle repeatedly appear near Harry but end up slouching off, disappointed, when Harry proves too well protected for them to work any mischief on him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

When Harry and Draco end up at wands drawn outside Potions class, their spells collide and ricochet. Hermione is struck by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Densaugeo|Densaugeo]], a spell that makes her upper teeth grow down past her chin, while Goyle is struck by Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Furnunculus|Furnunculus]] jinx and breaks out in boils.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

On the Hogwarts Express, Ron, with his new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]] powers, says that he is going to make Goyle write lines: &quot;''I must not look like a baboon's bottom.''&quot; Hermione says this is abuse of his powers, Ron says he is only getting Draco's buddies before Draco tries to get his.

Goyle's attempt to make the Draught of Peace in the first Potions class was dreadful; Hermione reports that when he had tried to put a sample in the flagon for grading, it had exploded and set his robes on fire.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] is examining the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures class]] taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]], she says to Goyle that she understands there have been injuries in that class. Goyle does not answer; instead, Malfoy says that he was slashed by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriff]].

As the two Beaters on the Slytherin Quidditch team, Derrick and Bole, have left, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]], the Captain, has had to find new ones. The two he has found are Crabbe and Goyle.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Crabbe and Goyle, under the influence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]] to make them look like little girls, together or separately guard the entrance to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] while Draco is working there. They both dislike this and ask Draco what they are supposed to be guarding, but Draco does not answer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

As he leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into the school from the Hog's Head, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] mentions that, as part of their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] course, students are now called upon to use the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]] on students who get detention. Neville had gotten one of his injuries for refusing, but Crabbe and Goyle seemed to enjoy it, perhaps because it was the first class they had ever been at the top of.

When Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle corner Harry in the Room of Requirement, it seems to be Crabbe and Goyle who do most of the talking. Goyle explains that they can do [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disillusionment|&quot;Diss-lusion charms&quot;]], and that they had been waiting for Harry. When Crabbe sets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]], Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape on brooms; Harry circles back to save Draco and Goyle, but Crabbe cannot be found.

== Strengths ==

Goyle's only real strength seems to be physical, coupled with enough low cunning to be able to align himself with one particular player and stay loyal to him. He has, in his somewhat slow way, decided that Draco is on the winning side, and has chosen to ally himself with Draco. This alliance remains strong, even when Draco requires him to take on the aspect of a girl three years his junior and stand about in the hall doing guard duty.

== Weaknesses ==

Goyle is basically incapable of independent thought; having allied himself to Draco, he receives all his instructions from Draco and seems to act only as Draco requires.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

He is very good friends with Draco Malfoy and Vincent Crabbe. Inasmuch as he is able, he hates Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and as directed by Draco, makes it his business to try and destroy Harry.

== Analysis ==

Goyle, like Crabbe, is present only to fill the role of dumb sidekick. The usual &quot;group of bad guys&quot; in many works of fiction consists of a &quot;brain&quot; component, almost always one smart guy or a shrewd guy with a smart guy in the background, and a &quot;brawn&quot; component, one or several muscular goons who exists simply to follow the orders of the smart guy, so that the smart guy doesn't have to risk discovery or injury in order to get his dirty work done. Crabbe and Goyle are almost  stereotypical brawn, while Draco is very much the brains of that particular operation. Unlike Crabbe, who starts balking at Draco's instructions in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Goyle has no ambitions of his own, though he seems to side with Crabbe over Draco during that arguement.

== Overview ==

'''''Vincent Crabbe''''' is one of Draco Malfoy's cronies.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Throughout the entire series, Vincent Crabbe has very little independent activity. When we first see him, he has settled into the role of first sidekick to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], and with very few exceptions, he seems to have no activity separate from Draco for six years of the seven-year span of the story.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] introduces himself to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] on the Hogwarts Express, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Gregory Goyle]] and Crabbe are in attendance. Harry turns Draco's offer of alliance down.

The night after the first Flying lesson, finding that Harry has not, after all, been expelled, Draco challenges him to a Wizard's Duel. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] immediately volunteers to be Harry's second; Draco selects Crabbe to be his second.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stay at Hogwarts over Christmas. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], attempting to determine whether Draco knows who the Heir of Slytherin is, use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise themselves as Slytherins. Ron becomes a copy of Crabbe, while Harry becomes a simulacrum of Goyle. While they do fool Draco, and learn some useful things about him, they only find out that he does not know who the Heir is, either.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle visit Harry in his compartment on the Hogwarts Express, but are unable to take any action against Harry because of the presence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]].

In an attempt to scare Harry during the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]] dress as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], but their scheme unravels when Harry sends a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] to charge them down.

Harry later visits [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] via the secret passages and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility cloak]]; while there with Ron, they run into Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle, who start taunting Ron, believing him to be alone. Harry, from the concealment of his cloak, starts attacking them, but in the process becomes partially visible. Harry then has to hurry back to the school in order to convince Professor Snape that he has not been out of the school.

It is mentioned that during the run-up to the final Quidditch match, between Gryffindor and Slytherin, Crabbe and Goyle repeatedly appear near Harry but end up slouching off, disappointed, when Harry proves too well protected for them to work any mischief on him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

As the two Beaters on the Slytherin Quidditch team, Derrick and Bole, have left, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]], the Captain, has had to find new ones. The two he has found are Crabbe and Goyle.

In the Quidditch match against Slytherin, Crabbe hits a Bludger at Harry after the whistle, and is harangued for it by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]]. This is the precipitating event that ends up with a brawl involving Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|George]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]].

It is mentioned that Crabbe is a member of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Inquisitorial Squad|Inquisitorial Squad]]. When Umbridge catches Harry in her office, where he has been trying to determine whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] has gone to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], she also sets the Inquisitorial Squad to round up his helpers. When they bring the helpers into Umbridge's office, it is Crabbe who is holding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

While Draco is working in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], he believes that he requires a lookout. He forces Crabbe and Goyle to disguise themselves as first-year to third-year girls by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry reaches Hogwarts, he hears from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] that Crabbe and Goyle are finally able to do something well. The Dark Arts classes (renamed from Defence Against the Dark Arts) now include using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]] on those who have earned detentions, and apparently both Crabbe and Goyle are very good at this.

Draco later sees Harry, Ron, and Hermione entering the Room of Requirement, and rounds up Crabbe and Goyle as backup as he no longer has his own wand. When Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle corner Harry in the Room of Requirement, Harry notes that Crabbe seems to have a very soft voice for someone so enormous. Crabbe explains how they had decided to hang back, to see if they could track Harry and bring him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] for their reward. When Ron calls out, Crabbe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Descendo|pushes]] a fifty-foot pile of junk over onto him. Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite|steadies]] the pile. When Crabbe tries to repeat the charm, Draco stops him, saying that if they wreck the room, they may lose the diadem. As part of the ensuing attempt to capture Harry, Crabbe creates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]], which rapidly consumes everything in the room. Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape on brooms that are stored in the Room of Requirement, and in the process rescue Draco and Goyle, but Crabbe perishes in the fire of his own making.

== Strengths ==

Crabbe is shown in his seventh year to be reasonably talented at the Dark Arts, a subject which wasn't taught during his first six years. Though his isn't very smart, he is proven to at least have his own thoughts and opinions. At the very least he seems to be more intelligent than Goyle.

== Weaknesses ==

Before his seventh year Crabbe was little more than Malfoy's bodyguard and thug who never showed any independent thoughts or beliefs. He also seems to have a bit of a temper as shown when he pelted a bludger at Harry after the Slytherins lost the Quidditch match in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 19|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

He is apparently very good friends with Draco Malfoy and Gregory Goyle, initially. This may just be an attempt to follow Draco's family's apparent power, as once Draco's family has fallen out of favour with Voldemort, he ignores Draco's instructions to a large extent in the Room of Requirement. His father (or possibly brother or uncle) was revealed to be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] when Voldemort called on him by his surname in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''.

== Analysis ==

Crabbe, like Goyle, is present only to fill the role of dumb sidekick. The usual &quot;group of bad guys&quot; in many works of fiction consists of a &quot;brain&quot; component, almost always one smart guy or a shrewd guy with a smart guy in the background, and a &quot;brawn&quot; component, one or several muscular goons who exist simply to follow the orders of the smart guy, so that the smart guy doesn't have to risk discovery or injury in order to get his dirty work done. Crabbe and Goyle are almost stereotypical brawn, while Draco is very much the brains of that particular operation. Crabbe seems to resent this slightly as in the Room of Requirement in the seventh book, he ignores Draco's orders and decides to take decisive action himself.

We have commented that Crabbe's allegiance to Draco may be based on Draco's family status. While it is true that Crabbe's willingness to take orders from Draco has faded along with the Malfoy family standing in Voldemort's councils, it is also true, as Neville notes, that Crabbe and Goyle have now found things that they are good at doing. Crabbe's acceptance of Draco's instructions may well have been partly from lack of confidence, and having found that he is good at the Dark Arts, he may now have sufficient self-confidence to stand on his own to some extent.

== Overview ==

'''''Pansy Parkinson''''' is a member of Slytherin House in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s year, with a face like a pug ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]). She and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] seem to have a romantic relationship towards the end of the series.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Pansy is seen at the Sorting, where her name, but not her house, is mentioned. 

After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville's]] accident in his first Flying lesson, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] jeers at Neville's expression; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] tells him to shut up, and Pansy accuses her of being sweet on Neville. She is here described as a &quot;hard-faced girl&quot;; as flying lessons are shared with the Slytherins, we can infer that she is in Slytherin house.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Pansy, who has been told about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s experiences with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] on the Hogwarts Express, calls across the Great Hall at breakfast to taunt him.

When Draco is injured by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriff]], we see Pansy at his bedside in the Hospital Wing.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Pansy is apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]'s date for the Yule Ball.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|Witch Weekly]] runs a story on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] suggesting that she has both Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] on a string, it is Pansy who discovers this. She throws a copy of the magazine to Hermione in Potions class.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Ron reports that Pansy Parkinson is one of the two prefects for Slytherin house, the other being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]].

It is mentioned that Pansy Parkinson shares one of the horseless carriages up to the school with Draco Malfoy and his cronies [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]].

On the second day of classes, Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle are laughing about something as they arrive at Care of Magical Creatures class. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] asks if anyone can identify the creatures she has in front of her, Hermione puts her hand up, and Draco imitates her. Pansy shrieks with laughter, then screams as the little bundles of twigs on the table jump up, revealing themselves to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Bowtruckle|Bowtruckles]].

At Gryffindor's first Quidditch practice, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle have accompanied Draco Malfoy to the pitch, and laugh appreciatively at every joke Draco makes about the Gryffindors. Harry in particular finds Pansy's screams of mirth annoying.

As the first Quidditch match approaches, Pansy tries to upset Harry by telling him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Warrington|Warrington]] is going to be trying to knock him off his broom. Harry responds that with Warrington's bad aim, he has nothing to worry about.

In the first Care of Magical Creatures class after Hagrid's return, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] is examining Hagrid's teaching. She has clearly already decided that Hagrid is a half-wit, so when she asks Pansy if she has trouble understanding Hagrid, Pansy plays along, saying that often the lessons just sound like grunting. Throughout the examination by Umbridge, Pansy is laughing, as are Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] is betrayed, Pansy is one of the &quot;''trusted'' students&quot; that Umbridge brings to break up the meeting. Pansy is able to get into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] and retrieve the parchment that shows the names of all the people in Dumbledore's Army, which she gives to Umbridge.

After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] depart the school, there are a number of attacks against Umbridge's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Inquisitorial Squad|Inquisitorial Squad]], of which Pansy is a member. It is mentioned that she misses an entire day's classes because she has suddenly grown antlers.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

On the Hogwarts Express, Harry, under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], sneaks into Draco Malfoy's compartment to try and find out what Draco is up to. Draco, who has his head in Pansy's lap, is boasting to Pansy that he may not be attending Hogwarts for his seventh year, that he has been given a greater mission. Pansy is stroking his hair as she listens.

Harry later tells Ron what he had overheard, and Ron, twice, says he thinks that Draco was boasting to impress Pansy.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

After Harry's return to the school, when all students are assembled in the Great Hall, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] voice is heard from outside, demanding that Harry Potter be surrendered. Pansy Parkinson, sitting with the other Slytherins, jumps up and points her wand at Harry, exclaiming that all they have to do is capture him and Voldemort will leave the school alone. The entire Gryffindor table rises and aims their wands at her and the other Slytherins, followed almost immediately by the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] dismisses her comment and immediately evacuates Slytherin House, while the of-age student wizards in the other three Houses are allowed to remain, if they so choose.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Her habit of selecting weaker opponents for her bullying would indicate a certain cowardice, common in bullies. Hermione seems to suggest she is unattractive, and Harry's opinion would seem to corroborate this, but we may have to discount this as being biased by Pansy's having targeted Hermione.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Pansy often picks on other students, mainly Gryffindors like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]. She tends to concentrate her aggressions on those less powerful, younger, or smaller than herself. Her friends are other Slytherin girls, and she is often seen giggling with them. In her sixth year, Pansy seems to like fawning over Draco Malfoy, fondling and stroking his hair.

== Analysis ==

Just as Harry has his nemesis in Draco, Hermione must have a nemesis as well, and apparently Pansy is selected for that role. We don't, however, see as much of her as we do of Draco; this may be because Hermione is playing a supporting role. However, Pansy's bullying behaviour, directed at Hermione among others, serves a larger purpose: the author is using Pansy as a way of showing that Draco's ongoing attacks against Harry and other Gryffindors are not a characteristic of Draco, but of Slytherin house as a whole. It is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] who tells us, in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', that
:''These cunning folks use any means, To achieve their ends.''
There is not anything inherently evil in this, but it does easily lend itself to abuses. In the case of Pansy and Draco, clearly the means used for advancement include putting down other students. Unpleasant as it may be, it seems that having Pansy portrayed in this way is intended to show that this sort of behaviour is accepted in Slytherin house in general.

== Overview ==

'''''Neville Longbottom''''' is a student in Gryffindor House and is in the same year as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]. In fact, they were born a day apart, Neville on 30 July, Harry on 31 July, a crucial element in the series' plot and one that significantly connects them.  Along with fellow classmates Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]], Neville helped battle powerful Dark Magic at Hogwarts. He lives with his grandmother, who has raised him since he was a small child.

Despite being born into a powerful wizarding family, a young Neville appeared to have inherited little magical ability. It was even feared he might be a ''squib''. He also suffers from a poor memory, though just why remains unclear. However, under Harry's influence, his magical skills have developed to where he has become a valuable asset to Harry and his fellow Dumbledore Army friends.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Neville is first seen on the Hogwarts Express platform, telling an exasperated older lady with a stuffed vulture on her hat that &quot;Trevor&quot; is missing. Aboard the train, Neville stops by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] compartment to ask if they have seen his pet toad, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]]. We discover shortly that Neville has also enlisted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione's]] help to search. At Hogwarts, the first-year students are shepherded into small boats to ferry them across a lake to the castle. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] asks whose toad he has found; Neville recognizes it as Trevor.

At the Welcome Feast, Neville is Sorted into Gryffindor House. Harry notes that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] takes a long time before deciding that Neville is a Gryffindor. During the feast, we overhear that Neville's grandmother was extremely pleased when Neville received his Hogwarts letter. His family had feared Neville was unable to perform magic, and had applied some extreme measures on him to prove otherwise. 

Very shortly, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] begins mercilessly persecuting Gryffindor students, particularly Neville and Harry. When Neville melts the cauldron that he shares with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]], Snape also holds Harry partly responsible, and penalizes him.

Neville's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augusta Longbottom|grandmother]] sends him a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Remembrall|Remembrall]], prompting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] to try and take it from him. Harry and Ron rise to his defence, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] also appears. Draco, outnumbered, departs.

Gryffindor and Slytherin houses have flying lessons with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]]. Neville, unable to control his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomstick]], falls off and fractures his wrist, and is taken to the infirmary. In Madam Hooch's absence, Draco spots his dropped Remembrall, and states his intention to hide it in a tree. Harry mounts his broomstick to chase him, and when Draco throws the Remembrall, Harry catches it before it hits the ground. Professor McGonagall, witnessing this, recruits Harry for the Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team.

Harry and Ron set out for the Trophy Room to engage in a Wizard's Duel with Draco Malfoy. Hermione follows, attempting to dissuade them, but discovers when she tries to return to the Common Room that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|the Fat Lady]] is away from her portrait, and she is locked out. Hermione decides to accompany Harry and Ron to the Trophy Room. On the way, they discover Neville, sleeping in the hall because he forgot the password. The four head to the Trophy Room, but Draco does not appear; rather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] arrives, evidently tipped off that some other student will be there. As the group attempts to escape, Neville crashes into a suit of armor, but they elude Filch and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]], only to find themselves in a room with an enormous, three-headed dog. Avoiding injury from the dog, all four return safe to Gryffindor Tower.

Some time later, Neville enters the Gryffindor common room with his legs immobilized by Draco's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Locomotor Mortis|Leg-locker jinx]]. Hermione frees him, and Harry gives Neville a Chocolate Frog. Neville returns the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] collector card inside the package to Harry. The card provides Harry an important clue about Nicolas Flamel and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] that Harry believes Snape is trying to steal for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

Draco uncovers the plan for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie Weasley's]] friends to take Hagrid's baby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert]], to Romania. Neville overhears Draco boasting that he will catch Harry and Hermione in the act, and goes to warn them, but Professor McGonagall catches him out after hours. Harry and Hermione are intercepted by Filch and brought before McGonagall, along with Neville. She assumes the three students were conspiring to get Draco in trouble and penalizes each fifty house points and gives them a detention. Draco, who had been caught earlier, is also penalized.

Detention is served with Hagrid in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Something has been injuring and killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], and the four students are tracking an injured one. Draco and Neville initially are teamed together, but Draco deliberately scares Neville. Hagrid then re-shuffles the groups, pairing Harry with Draco and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fang|Fang]], and making up another group himself with Hermione and Neville.

When Neville discovers the Trio's plan to prevent the Philosopher's Stone from being stolen and given to Voldemort, he attempts to intervene, saying they have already lost Gryffindor enough House points. Hermione reluctantly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|immobilizes Neville]]. 

At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore awards Neville ten House points for having the courage to stand up to his friends. This is the first time Neville has won any points for anything, and it wins Gryffindor the House Cup.

Finally, it is noted that despite his abysmal Potions grade, Neville has passed his exams.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Soon, there is a general assumption that whatever monster is resident within the Chamber is attacking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-borns]], those of non-Wizarding descent. When a brisk business in protective amulets ensues, Neville buys some. Though he is descended from old Wizarding stock, Neville fears his poor magical skills makes him practically a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]], and the monster had first apparently attacked Filch, petrifying his cat. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart's]] Dueling Club, Neville initially was paired with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. After that goes badly awry, Lockhart suggests having only a single pair compete while the rest watch. He chooses Neville and Justin, but Snape overrules him, cuttingly remarking that Neville causes havoc with every wand stroke. Snape suggests Harry and Draco Malfoy demonstrate instead.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

After accidentally inflating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]], Harry angrily departs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley home]]. While pondering what he should do next, Harry inadvertently summons the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|The conductor]] asks his name, and Harry, fearing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] is hunting him, says he is Neville Longbottom. When he arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Leaky Cauldron|The Leaky Cauldron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], the Minister for Magic, recognizes him.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], Harry sees Neville, whose grandmother is chastising him for forgetting his booklist.

On the Hogwarts Express, Neville and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] make their way to Harry's compartment. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] has boarded the train and enters the compartment, causing Harry to briefly lose consciousness. Later, Draco Malfoy overhears Neville mentioning the incident, and mercilessly taunts Harry about it.

In Divination class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] has Neville hand out teacups, predicting that he will break at least one. He breaks two.

In Snape's class, Neville's potion is a mess. Snape forbids Hermione to help him with it. By class end, Neville's potion is reasonably correct, but Snape assumes (without proof, but correctly) that Hermione helped him, and he penalizes her five house points.

During [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] teaches students how to combat a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]] using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]] charm. After Snape had made another cutting remark about Neville's wand abilities, Lupin has Neville lead off the demonstration. The charm forces the Boggart to assume whatever shape the caster is imagining. Neville's greatest fear is Snape, so Lupin tells him to picture Snape wearing his grandmother's clothing. Professor Lupin says it is laughter that destroys a Boggart, so the charm works by forcing it into a laughable form. As &quot;Snape&quot; emerges from a wardrobe, Neville successfully transforms the Boggart into Professor Snape's image wearing Mrs. Longbottom's clothes. 

When the real Snape hears that Neville caused the Boggart to assume his image, and how his image was changed by the charm, he mercilessly bullies Neville in Potions class.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] breaks into the castle on Hallowe'en, The Fat Lady's portrait refuses him entry into the Gryffindor common room. Black then slashes the canvas, terrifying the Fat Lady. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] takes over guarding the entrance, but changes the passwords several times a day. Neville, unable to remember them, writes down the entire list. Shortly before Easter, Harry finds Neville attempting to persuade Sir Cadogan to let him into the Gryffindor common room; it seems Neville has lost the list.

After Sirius Black breaks into Hogwarts again, Sir Cadogan proudly states that he had let a man enter Gryffindor Tower because he had the password; he had all of them on a list. Professor McGonagall, furious that someone wrote the passwords down, asks who was stupid enough to leave the list lying around. Neville shamefacedly admits he did. As punishment, Neville is barred from future [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] outings, receives detention, and is no longer allowed to know the password. He must now wait for someone to enter or leave Gryffindor tower to let him in. He also receives a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] from his grandmother.

Lacking parental permission to visit Hogsmeade, Harry intends to use the secret passage revealed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] while hiding under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] to accompany Ron there. Neville, almost painfully glad that Harry also is unable to visit Hogsmeade, nearly prevents Harry from getting to the secret passage.

At Easter break, it is mentioned that Neville looks strained. Like other third-years, he has received much homework to complete before Easter break ends.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]], Sirius Black reveals that Hermione's cat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]], had stolen Neville's password list for him.

Aboard the Hogwarts Express, Neville envies Harry and Ron attending the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]; his grandmother had refused to get tickets. When Ron produces his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] souvenir figurine, Neville watches entranced as it walks back and forth across Ron's hand.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] asks the students to name the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]. Neville timidly mentions the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]]. After class, Neville, profoundly shaken by something during Moody's demonstration, is invited to tea by him. Back in the dormitory, Neville shows off a book, ''Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties'', that Moody gave him. Neville seems cheered, both by the book, and Moody's mentioning that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] had said Neville was adept at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]].

When Harry opens the Golden Egg to solve the puzzle for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], it emits a loud, screeching noise. Neville, terrified, thinks it sounds like someone being tortured.

Neville invites Hermione to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], but she has a date. When Harry invites [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], she says Neville has already asked her. At the Yule Ball, Harry notes that Neville's dancing is even worse than his own; he seems to be treading on Ginny's feet rather a lot.

While left alone in Dumbledore's office, Harry discovers a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. It contains Dumbledore's memories, including one of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wizengamot|Wizengamot trial]]. Four Death Eaters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus Lestrange]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], are being tried for torturing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]] to insanity in an attempt to extract information about Voldemort. The Longbottoms, Neville's parents, were left incurably insane and now permanently reside in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]]. Neville has since been raised by his grandmother. Dumbledore cautions Harry never to mention this to Ron and Hermione&amp;mdash;it is Neville's secret to reveal.

After returning from the graveyard duel with Voldemort, Harry is taken aside by Moody, who boasts he had smoothed Harry's path through the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], leading him to Voldemort. The book he gave Neville contained information on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gillyweed|Gillyweed]], and Moody had expected Harry to consult with Neville prior to the Second Task. As Harry had never done so, Moody mentioned Gillyweed's effect within [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]'s hearing, and Dobby relayed that information to Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

On the crowded Hogwarts Express, Ginny leads Harry and Neville to a compartment with only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] sitting inside. Neville shows Harry his birthday present, a rare [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mimbulus Mimbletonia|Mimbulus Mimbletonia]] plant. When he points out the plant's defence mechanism, it suddenly sprays everyone and everything in the compartment with stinksap, just as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] arrives to say hello to Harry. After an awkward moment, Cho departs; Ginny cleans the stinksap off everyone.

Following the Arrival Feast, new Prefects Hermione and Ron, shepherding the first-years to Gryffindor Tower, have yet to arrive. Neville, however, knows the password (&quot;''Mimbulus Mimbletonia''&quot;) to enter. Inside, Harry learns that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus']] family nearly prohibited him from returning to Hogwarts after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] smeared Harry and Dumbledore's reputations. Neville defends Harry, saying his grandmother believes Dumbledore; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] is neutral. Everyone remains tense until Ron arrives, calming the situation with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]] powers.

Neville is an early member in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], and attends the group's maiden meeting at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]], during the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] weekend. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]] derides Harry's experience, Neville and others leap to his defence.

When Professor Umbridge bans all student groups, Neville is among the Gryffindors who Harry and Hermione reassure that the D.A. will still meet anyway, though in secret.

Later, while waiting to enter Potions class, Draco Malfoy taunts Harry over the ''Daily Prophet's'' claims that Harry suffers from mental problems. When Draco snidely remarks that people with mental disabilities should be kept in St. Mungo's, Neville, stung, leaps to attack Draco; Harry and Ron physically restrain Neville. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] appears and penalizes Gryffindor house for fighting. Harry, knowing about Neville's parents, understands why Neville flew at Draco, though he is unable to say anything to Ron, who is wondering what prompted Neville's outburst.

At the first Dumbledore's Army meeting in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], Neville works hard and actually [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarms]]. Harry leaves Neville to practice with Ron and Hermione.

In Hagrid's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]], the class learns about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]]. Only three students there have the ability to see them: Harry, Neville, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Theodore Nott|an unnamed Slytherin student]]. Hagrid explains that only those who have witnessed death can see the creatures.

At Christmas, while visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] in St. Mungo's Hospital, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny run into Neville and his grandmother, who are there to see Neville's parents, Frank and Alice. Harry knows that the former [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] and Order of the Phoenix members were tortured into insanity by Death Eaters. Now they are permanently hospitalized at St. Mungo's. Neville is embarrassed that his classmates now know about his parents, though Mrs. Longbottom says Neville should be proud of how his parents defended themselves against their attackers. After Neville and his grandmother depart, Harry admits to the others that he already knew Neville's secret, but Dumbledore had asked him never to reveal it.

After Christmas, there is a mass outbreak of Death Eaters from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]]. Among the escapees is Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry expects Neville to react fearfully upon hearing that the Death Eaters who tortured his parents into insanity are free; instead, it motivates him to work even harder in Dumbledore's Army. Only Hermione masters the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|Shield Charm]] faster than Neville.

Harry worries if he did the correct thing in being interviewed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']] about Voldemort's return. Neville, Dean, and Seamus assure Harry it was the right thing to do, saying it took much courage.

Neville continually works hard in Dumbledore's Army, mastering every spell. As Harry is thinking about Neville's progress, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] arrives, warning him that Dumbledore's Army has been betrayed.

When Harry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] at the Ministry, D.A. members create a diversion so Harry can try to contact Sirius using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]'s office. Neville, who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, is captured along with Ginny, Luna, Ron, and Hermione and brought to Umbridge's office. Harry and Hermione, after luring Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest, have escaped and meet up with the others. The students fly to the Ministry in London on Thestrals to rescue Sirius.

Sirius is not at the Ministry, and the students have been lured into a trap. When Ron finds a small glass orb with Harry's name on it, Death Eaters, led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], appear and demand that Harry hand it over.

The Death Eaters target Harry during the ensuing battle, and the students run for the Atrium. More Death Eaters appear, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Impedimenta|tripping]] the students as they rush for the exit. Knowing Voldemort only wants him, Harry runs into an amphitheatre to stand alone against the remaining Death Eaters. Neville charges in, fruitlessly casting Stunning spells, though he is quickly subdued. In an attempt to force Harry to hand over the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]] orb, Bellatrix Lestrange sadistically [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|tortures]] Neville, tauntingly saying she did the same to his parents. As Harry is about to surrender the prophecy, Sirius, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Shacklebolt]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]] arrive. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walden Macnair|Macnair]] grabs Harry by the throat, demanding the prophecy; Neville stabs Macnair's eye with a wand, freeing Harry. Harry has handed off the Prophecy to Neville, but when he is pulling Neville up the steps, Neville's robe rips, spilling the prophecy orb from his pocket to the floor, smashing it. The battle quickly ends after Dumbledore's arrival, though Bellatrix and Voldemort escape.

After the battle, in Dumbledore's office, Dumbledore tells Harry that Voldemort was seeking the Prophecy. Though the original was lost, Dumbledore knows its contents. The prophecy foretelling Voldemort's possible fate fit two boys: Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom, who were born a day apart. Dumbledore believes Voldemort attacked the infant Harry because he is a half-blood like himself, and therefore possibly more dangerous; Neville is a pureblood. By deliberately choosing Harry, Voldemort &quot;marked&quot; him as his equal, leaving behind the scar on Harry's forehead.

It is noted later that Neville makes a full recovery. He is in the Hospital Wing when Harry visits Hermione and Ron, who are recovering. Ginny, Luna, and Neville are also there visiting.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] === 

On the Hogwarts Express, Harry sits with Luna and Neville, while Ron and Hermione report to the Prefects' compartment. Harry finds he is popular again. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]], a fourth-year student, invites Harry to join her and her friends, but Harry declines, preferring his current companions' company. Romilda casts a disparaging glance at Luna and Neville before departing. Harry, noticing Neville's reaction to this, mentions that Romilda was not at the Ministry. This cheers Neville, and he talks about his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL results]], wondering if an Acceptable grade in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] is sufficient to progress to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT level-class]]. Harry, listening to Neville and thinking about the Prophecy, wonders what might have happened if Voldemort had chosen to attack Neville rather than him; would Neville have the scar and the popularity?

Harry and Neville are invited to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn's]] compartment for lunch. Once inside, it seems obvious that he only invited those students who are connected to famous wizards, or, like Neville, have distinguished themselves in some way. Slughorn asks about the Ministry battle, though neither Harry nor Neville is forthcoming, and Slughorn does not pry.

Professor McGonagall tells Neville that his Transfiguration OWL score is too low for her class. However, his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] grade is high enough for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick's]] NEWT-level class. Neville, disappointed, mumbles that his grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option. Professor McGonagall acerbically retorts that Augusta having failed her Charms OWL is hardly reason to deny Neville that opportunity, and adds Charms to his timetable, then sends him happily on his way.

Neville is seen little during the year, as he and Harry share few classes. Later, Dumbledore asks Harry to accompany him to where a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] may be hidden. Harry, suspecting that Draco's sinister task for the Dark Lord has been completed, worries about leaving the school unguarded while he and Dumbledore are away. He has Ginny, Ron, and Hermione and any other Dumbledore's Army members they can recruit to guard the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] and Snape's office. 

After the battle with the Death Eaters, Ron tells Harry that the only D.A. members who responded to Hermione's summons were Neville and Luna. Ron, Ginny, and Neville were guarding the Room of Requirement when Draco emerged, holding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hand of Glory|a dried-up hand object]]. Seeing the three students, Draco tossed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|darkness powder]] into the hall, apparently while guiding others from the Room of Requirement. It was too dangerous for Ron, Neville, and Ginny to cast any jinxes in the blackness.

Neville, injured in the battle, is in the Hospital Wing. Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione visit him there. Neville has recovered enough to attend Dumbledore's funeral.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

As Harry, Hermione and Ron roam the countryside on Dumbledore's Horcrux mission, they happen to overhear a conversation about some Hogwarts students breaking into Headmaster Snape's office in an unsuccessful attempt to steal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]]. Later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black]]'s portrait that Hermione is carrying in her beaded bag, confirms that it was Ginny, Neville, and Luna who were responsible and received detentions. Phineas reveals a few more details: after a low-level, student rebellion, Snape re-instated Dolores Umbridge's former decree banning all student groups. Harry suspects that Neville, Ginny, and Luna have taken over Dumbledore's Army to usurp the Death Eaters controlling Hogwarts.

When Harry, Hermione, and Ron [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] into Hogsmeade village, they set off an alarm. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]] rescues them from Death Eaters, and only reluctantly agrees to help sneak them Hogwarts, where another Horcrux is hidden. Aberforth sends a message via his sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana's]] portrait. Ariana soon returns; as her portrait swings opens, a secret corridor is revealed with Neville standing inside. 

Neville's battered appearance shocks Harry, though Neville is actually quite cheerful. Leading the Trio down a dark tunnel, Neville asks if they really broke into Gringotts and escaped on a dragon. Neville updates them on changes at the school. Any student refusing to Curse another student as punishment is beaten. The Muggle Studies teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]], insists all Muggles are dirty and stupid. Neville received one scar after asking her how much Muggle blood she had, though the Carrows punished him relatively lightly because he is a Pureblood. Neville helped re-build Dumbledore's Army, and they were pulling pranks and creating disruptions, but after Luna and Ginny departed the school, the rebellion died down. When Neville was identified as a ringleader, the Carrows tried to kidnap his grandmother as retaliation. Before going on the run, Mrs. Longbottom put at least one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|attacker]] into St. Mungo's Hospital. Neville decided he should also disappear.

Harry does not immediately realize that they have entered the Room of Requirement, which has grown bigger and become more comprehensive as Dumbledore's Army members went into hiding. The room is unable provide food, but when Neville's need became great enough, a tunnel leading to the Hog's Head Inn opened, and Aberforth has been sending supplies ever since. Seamus says Neville is the one who knows how to get the Room of Requirement to provide what they need.

Harry tells the group there is something that he, Ron, and Hermione must do, then they will leave. Everybody is dismayed, but Neville expresses what everyone is feeling: that they have shown loyalty to Dumbledore and have earned the right to fight Voldemort alongside Harry.

During the battle, Neville heads to the battlements with Professor Sprout carrying pots of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mandrake|Mandrakes]] to drop on the attackers. Neville's grandmother arrives to fight alongside her grandson, telling him how proud she is of his accomplishments. When Death Eaters breach the walls, Neville, in the Entrance Hall, is ready to lob [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Venomous Tentacula|Venomous Tentacula]] plants.

Harry, hidden under his Invisibility Cloak, heads to the Forbidden Forest to meet his fate. Along the way, he sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]] and Neville carrying [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey's]] body back to the castle. When Neville goes to search for more casualties, Harry reveals himself, and tells Neville that Voldemort's snake, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], must be killed if Voldemort is to be defeated. If he, Ron, or Hermione are unable to kill Nagini, then Neville must do the job. Neville does not understand, but agrees he will, if the opportunity arises.

After Harry's apparent death in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort orders the captured Hagrid to carry Harry's body as the Dark Lord and his army march to the school. At Hogwarts, Voldemort singles out Neville, saying he is a Pureblood from an old Wizarding family, and entices him to join his side. Defiant, Neville refuses and charges, only to be thrown into a full [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Body-bind]] by Voldemort, who then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summons]] the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] and pulls it onto Neville's head. He sets the Hat afire to show that there is no more Sorting and only one school House&amp;mdash;Slytherin. Neville casts off the Body-Bind, then pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Hat and beheads Nagini, Voldemort's last Horcrux.

Neville is only briefly glimpsed amid the battle's confusion; after the fighting, Harry notes that Neville has survived and is sitting exhausted in the Great Hall.

In the epilogue, Neville has become Hogwarts' Herbology professor and has married Hannah Abbott. Neville remains a close family friend to the Potters and Weasleys.

== Strengths ==

Neville is descended from a powerful magical family, and he has the potential to be a great wizard. His problems stem, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall's]] opinion, from, &quot;a lack of self confidence.&quot; Like Harry, he suffered an early childhood trauma. Despite his earlier lackluster abilities, Neville's magical power has grown substantially since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|his 5th year]] when he trained with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter's]] tutelage. With great determination, he worked harder than most to master defensive skills, and struggled to break through the fog that perpetually clouded his mind. 

Neville has shown courage and nobility from an early age as he silently endured a personal tragedy without ever seeking attention and sympathy. In his first year, he bravely confronted Harry, Ron, and Hermione, protesting their decision to protect the Philosopher's Stone. He was among the few D.A. allies who fought alongside Harry at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Department of Mysteries]], where he demonstrated immense courage and loyalty. He also showed leadership and bravery when, following Harry's departure, he helped reestablish and lead Dumbledore's Army (at great personal risk) to resist the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters']] controlling Hogwarts during his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|seventh year]]. During the battle at Hogwarts, Harry relies on Neville to kill Nagini, Voldemort's snake Horcrux. Neville never wavers in accepting and fulfilling the potentially deadly challenge.

Neville is gifted in Herbology and received an &quot;Outstanding&quot; on his O.W.L. Further, he received &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; in Defence Against the Dark Arts, possibly because of his work in Dumbledore's Army. He also received an &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; on his Charms O.W.L., and is encouraged by Professor McGonagall to take advanced study in that course.

== Weaknesses ==

During Neville's early years at Hogwarts, he could best be described as clumsy, shy, and had very low self-confidence. These traits seriously affected his Wizarding abilities and training. He was prone to mishaps or accidents, especially in Potions, due to his (fairly rational) fear of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], who constantly bullied him, further eroding his self-esteem.

Due to serious memory problems, Neville was unable to remember the simplest things, such as the Gryffindor passwords. His difficulty with Potions were likely memory-related as well.

As a young boy, Neville displayed no leadership abilities whatsoever and rarely took initiative in anything. His only interest appeared to be Herbology, which he does excel at. His shy, passive nature resulted in him rarely standing up for himself. Slytherin students particularly enjoyed heaping abuse on him.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Like Harry, Neville is an only child who was raised by someone other than his parents. In Neville's case, his grandmother, Augusta Longbottom, became his legal guardian after his parents were permanently committed to St. Mungo's hospital after being tortured into insanity by Death Eaters. Neville apparently loves his grandmother, but her stern, overbearing personality has created a barrier to their relationship, and he generally fears her.

Neville also loves his parents, but, being a small child when Death Eaters tortured them, he has never known the people they were before. Whatever they once were, he now sees only their vacant shells and uncomprehending expressions when he visits them in the hospital. Neville was embarrassed by his parents' conditions, and became particularly distressed when Harry and the other Weasley children accidentally saw his family while at St. Mungo's. They, however, supported him. Eventually, Neville fully embraces the heroic sacrifice his mother and father made in fighting Voldemort, and he is proud to be their son.   

The shy and rather nerdy Neville initially makes few friends at Hogwarts. Most students either tease him or ignore him completely. Harry and Ron, his dorm mates, always treat Neville cordially, but Harry tended to consider him as someone he would rather not be seen hanging out with. The two boys eventually become close, particularly after Harry discovers Neville's secret about his parents' fates. Having lost his own parents, Harry understands the emotional hardship this creates. Harry also learns that if circumstances had been a little different, Neville, rather than Harry, might have been &quot;The Chosen One,&quot; when a prophecy involving Voldemort could have fit either boy. If Voldemort had targeted Neville, a pure-blood, rather than Harry, who is a half-blood like Voldemort, it is highly improbable that Neville would have survived the Killing Curse as Harry did. 

With the many similarities between Harry and Neville's circumstances, and their tie to Trelawney's prophecy, it seems more than coincidental that they should also be assigned to the same Gryffindor dorm. Was this intentional on Dumbledore's part? We never know, but if it was, he may have intended that the two boys support each another in a way few others could. This hardly seems likely at first, as Harry has relatively little interest in or interaction with Neville. Their bond grows however, and Harry exerts a great influence on Neville, helping him overcome his magical handicap. Neville, in return, is among Harry's strongest supporters, risking his life in the battle at the Ministry of Magic, and stepping into a leadership role after Harry departs Hogwarts before his seventh year. It was only after Harry embraced Neville as a friend that most other students also did so; but as Neville becomes a capable wizard and a strong leader, he is acknowledged and admired for his own merits. During the final battle at Hogwarts, Harry tasks Neville to kill Nagini. Though not fully understanding why, Neville promises he will, and destroys Voldemort's last Horcrux. Harry never forgets what Neville has done for him. 

Romantically, Neville remains challenged throughout the series. He becomes close to Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, eventually reviving and leading Dumbledore's Army along with them, but both girls are only friends. He is also on good terms with Hermione, though their relationship is more casual. While at Hogwarts, Neville never has a girlfriend, nor is it known if there is anyone he is interested in. Though Luna would seem a suitable match, her personality is probably much too eccentric for the more conventional Neville. He surprisingly mustered the courage to invite Hermione, and later Ginny, to the Yule Ball in ''Goblet of Fire.'' Whether he was actually attracted to either or just felt comfortable enough to ask them as a friend is unclear. Hermione already had a date, and it was Ginny who accepted Neville's invitation, though she had no romantic interest in him, and was merely excited to be going to the ball. She was soon disappointed, however, upon learning that she could have instead gone with Harry, who was having difficulty finding his own date. Both Harry and Ron seemed mildly annoyed that Neville was able to procure a date to the ball before they did, even if it was Ginny.

Professor Dumbledore and Neville's teachers genuinely like him, though other than Professor Sprout who teaches Herbology, there apparently is little expectation regarding his academic performance. Professor Snape is overly critical regarding his in-class abilities, so much so that Neville becomes terrified of him. Under Professor Lupin's patient guidance, however, Neville is coaxed into performing quite well in the Defense Against the Dark Arts demonstration, infusing him with a much needed confidence boost that Harry is later able to build upon to improve Neville's magical skills in his own Defensive Arts class.  

In the Epilogue, it is learned that Neville becomes Hogwarts' Herbology teacher, and in later interviews, Rowling stated that he had married Hannah Abbott. This makes him the first Hogwarts teacher that is ''known'' to have a spouse. There were likely other married teachers at some point, but they are never mentioned in the series.

== Analysis ==

Early on, Neville could best be described as a classic &quot;misfit.&quot; His shy, awkward nature, as well as his magical deficiencies, make him off-putting to the more popular students and an easy target for crueler ones. Indeed, it appears he has few friends, and those students who are cordial, are seemingly only being kind. 

Neville shares a dorm with Harry and Ron, but in the early years, he and Harry are arguably more amiable acquaintances than friends; he and Harry grow much closer during their 5th year, however. Neville is seemingly clumsy and magically challenged in the first three novels, but by the fifth book, partially with Harry's help, he adopts a new persona, becoming a stronger, more capable character. Rowling may be saying that even the most seemingly hopeless student, given time and encouragement, can develop into a valuable asset. This is evident by Neville's growing role in Book 5, his extraordinary Herbology ability, and that, under different circumstances, ''he'' could have been &quot;the boy who lived.&quot;

Initially, Neville seems an odd choice to have been sorted into Gryffindor, a House mainly known for bravery and nobility. Neville is certainly a noble character, but his timid, fearful nature, along with his poor magical skills and memory problems, seem out-of-place with the more assertive Gryffindors. Though it is hardly overt, Neville has always had immense courage, first by overcoming his parents' tragic fate, which he keeps secret and never seeks sympathy for, then working hard to improve his magical deficiencies, despite his family's and many others' belief he is nearly a Squib. As his skills improve under Harry's guidance, Neville's courage grows in more obvious ways, and he is always ready to fight at Harry's side when needed. Harry becomes so confident in Neville's abilities that he eventually entrusts him with a vital and potentially deadly task in book 7. 

Neville's poor memory is ongoing in the earlier books. Another character, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], though never seen, is described in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|in the fourth book]] as also having a deficient memory. Her severe problems were caused by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory alteration charms]]. Some fan sites have suggested that Neville's memory problems are enough like Bertha's that they may have a similar cause. In Bertha's case, her memory was suppressed by Voldemort's allies to hide something important regarding the Dark Lord; Neville's memory may likewise have been altered, though with Bertha, there was likely no concern about causing any long-term damage. 

Prior to the seventh book's publication, there was speculation that a valuable secret may have been hidden within Neville's mind, and that it might be released via a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. No such secret ever emerged in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], however. Alternately, Neville could have been present when his parents were being tortured by Death Eaters, something that would likely have amused Bellatrix Lestrange while deeply traumatizing Neville. If that is true, Neville's grandmother, Augusta, may have liberally applied one or more memory charm to prevent Neville from repeatedly reliving that horrendous episode. Professor McGonagall does mention that Augusta failed her Charms OWL. While Augusta or other family members' intent would have been to alleviate Neville's anguish, the possibility that his memory issues stem from excessive or botched Obliviate charms is almost certain. Considering the damaging and apparently enduring effect the backfired memory charm had on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], these obviously must be applied with great skill and restraint to avoid permanent mental damage.

Neville's character became more significant in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', in which it was learned that, as infants, both he Harry were targeted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] as the potential enemy foretold in Sybill Trelawney's prophecy; but, Voldemort ''chose'' Harry over Neville, apparently believing Harry's half-blood status made him the more likely threat. In the seventh book, Neville, along with Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, re-form Dumbledore's Army and recruit more wizards to rebel against the new headmaster, Snape, and the Muggle Studies and Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, Alecto and Amycus Carrow, respectively.

== Overview ==

'''''Rufus Scrimgeour''''' is the Minister of Magic during ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' and the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', replacing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|disastrous events]] at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.  Scrimgeour is a former [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Rufus Scrimgeour is mentioned in passing as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] pass through the Auror's office at the Ministry of Magic, just before Harry's hearing.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In the first chapter of the book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] introduces the Muggle Prime Minister to Rufus Scrimgeour, saying he has been sworn in as Minister of Magic after the disastrous events at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and the following summer. These events include the escape of many prisoners from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], the deaths of two wizards, apparent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giant]] attacks in parts of England, and the collapse of a bridge with many Muggle casualties.

We hear that there has been some sort of confrontation between Scrimgeour and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], but we don't immediately learn what that confrontation involved.

Shortly before Christmas, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is taking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s party, Harry mentions that there will be a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Vampire|vampire]] there; Luna immediately asks if that would be Scrimgeour. Apparently, her father had written a story about how Scrimgeour is a vampire, but had had to shelve it on orders from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].

At Christmas, which Harry is spending at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]], Scrimgeour visits, using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]] as a pretext. Scrimgeour takes Harry for a walk around the garden, during which he tries to get answers out of Harry about what Dumbledore is doing, and suggests that the Ministry would be grateful if Harry was to visibly align himself with them. Harry, who is revolted by the Ministry's hypocrisies, asks if they have freed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] yet. Scrimgeour waffles, saying essentially that they have to appear to be doing something. Harry refuses further assistance, saying that the new Ministry is as bad in its own way as the old one was.

In discussion with Professor Dumbledore immediately after Christmas break, Dumbledore tells Harry that what Scrimgeour had talked to Harry about over the break is what the earlier confrontation had been about. The plan to use Harry as the Ministry's poster boy had been initially suggested by Fudge, and had not died when Fudge had left office. Dumbledore had been refusing to allow Harry's use as a figurehead.

At the end of the book, Scrimgeour again talks to Harry, asking what Dumbledore was doing, and again trying to elicit Harry's visible co-operation with the Ministry. Harry again refuses, saying he has seen no differences in the Ministry since Christmas that would make him change his mind.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Scrimgeour first re-enters our story when he appears at The Burrow on Harry's birthday. His arrival is announced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], which causes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] to depart hastily, as apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|werewolves]] are out of favour with the Ministry at present. Scrimgeour asks to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and tells them that they have inherited items from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], and he is there to present them. Hermione points out that he is only doing this because the Ministry is only allowed to hold on to bequests for thirty-one days, and they have used all thirty-one of them. Scrimgeour does not contradict her.

The specific bequests are: for Hermione, an original copy of the ''Tales of Beedle the Bard''; Scrimgeour asks if there is any significance to this choice, and Hermione says she is unaware of any. For Ron, Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]]. For Harry, there are two bequests. The first is the Golden Snitch that was used in the first-ever [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch game]] that Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 11|played for Gryffindor]]. Hermione says that Scrimgeour wants to see Harry take the Snitch because of its flesh memory: it is designed to remember the first hand that touches it, to assist in determining the winner of a match that is disputed, and may react to Harry's touch now. Again, Scrimgeour does not deny this, but quite evidently expects Harry to take the Snitch, bare-handed. Harry does, and nothing happens.

Dumbledore's second bequest to Harry is the sword of Gryffindor. Scrimgeour says that it is property of the school, and is not Dumbledore's to give.

The following day, the Death Eaters take over the Ministry of Magic, and according to the message from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], Scrimgeour is killed. We later hear from Remus Lupin, who heard from Arthur Weasley, that Scrimgeour was tortured for the whereabouts of Harry before he was killed. However, he did not give Harry away.

The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned, and has been replaced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]]. We learned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 1|the start of the story]] that Thicknesse is under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]].

== Analysis ==

It was inevitable that once the knowledge of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s return became public, Cornelius Fudge's days as Minister would be numbered. When Voldemort was seen in the Ministry, it became immediately obvious that Dumbledore had been telling the truth about his return for a year, and Fudge had been trying to discredit him for what suddenly seemed very petty reasons. It is not surprising that Fudge's tenure was less than two weeks after this revelation; it is equally not surprising that, given the fact that the Wizarding world was suddenly under siege, the obvious choice for Fudge's replacement would be someone from the Auror's office.

Scrimgeour seems to be cut of the same fabric as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch Sr.]], there to get the job done, and to tread on toes if that's what it takes. While we don't yet know if Scrimgeour has authorized the use of deadly force by Aurors, as Crouch did, he is keeping Stan Shunpike locked up without trial. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] told us long before that the same had happened to him; he had been sent to Azkaban without trial by Crouch.

== Overview ==

'''''Sybill (or Sibyll) Patricia Trelawney''''' is the Divination teacher at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was the great-great-granddaughter of the famous Seer, Cassandra Trelawney. She wears very large glasses that makes her eyes appear several times larger than they actually are, has a soft and misty voice. She is very thin and is always draped in a finely-woven, shiny shawl.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] choose to take Divination starting in their third year. Professor Trelawney opens with normal fortuneteller practices, vague predictions, including that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] will break at least one teacup, that something [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] is dreading will happen on the 16th of October, and that around Easter, &quot;one of their number will leave them... forever.&quot; Neville does in fact break two teacups while attempting to read tea leaves.

Professor Trelawney also sees the Grim, an omen of impending death, in Harry's tea leaves. The class is so upset by the revelations, that they are still visibly shaken the next period. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] mentions that Professor Trelawney has predicted the death of a student every year since she had been employed, and no students had yet died.

As far as the predictions go: Lavender receives news on 16 October that her pet bunny has died, and Hermione, fed up with Trelawney's babble, quits Divination just before Easter (leaving . . . forever). These events, tenuous as their connection may be, are linked back to Trelawney's earlier predictions by at least two students, Lavender and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]], and greatly enhance Sybill's reputation in their minds, at least. 

Ron and Harry, though they stay with the course, are unimpressed by the prediction side of it. Unable to read the future, they start fabricating predictions from tea leaves and, later, crystal balls.

As Harry completes his Divination exam, Professor Trelawney suddenly seems to fall into a trance, talking strangely, and utters a prediction that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]]'s servant will be freed, returning to him that night. When she returns to normal seconds later, she seems unaware that anything untoward occurred.

This prediction does come true; that night, following events in the Shrieking Shack, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] escapes and returns to Lord Voldemort's service. Harry later comments to Dumbledore that Trelawney seemed to have predicted that night's events, and Dumbledore remarks that he should consider giving her a raise, as that increases her number of actual prophecies to two.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

While Professor Trelawney is still teaching Divination to Harry's class, this year primarily astrology, her interaction with Harry seems to be involved primarily with setting him and Ron homework. Harry and Ron, after laboring over their star charts, fall back on the usual technique: making stuff up. Their predictions of disasters for themselves are quite successful, with Professor Trelawney even reading them out in class, but backfire when Trelawney requires them to continue for a further month of predictions. Ron bemoans the fact that they have run out of disasters.

Later in the year, Harry, bored as usual in Trelawney's class, falls asleep and &quot;dreams&quot; an episode with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew]]. Trelawney tries to pin some mystical interpretation on it, inquiring details of Harry's dream, but Harry refuses. It turns out that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] somehow receives information about this episode and publishes it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Professor Trelawney again is teaching Divination to Harry's class, this year concentrating on dream interpretation. Early in the year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] is created Hogwarts High Inquisitor by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] edict, and appears in her classroom with a clipboard, making notes. Trelawney, rightly, sees this as an intrusion, and is most upset by it. Umbridge asks Trelawney to justify her teaching techniques and requires a prediction from her; then is apparently unimpressed with the results.

Over the course of the year, we see Trelawney becoming more and more harassed and bedraggled in appearance, because Umbridge has placed her on probation. Harry also notes that she seems to leave a certain scent of cooking sherry behind her. When Harry stands up to Umbridge by giving an interview to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']], Trelawney breaks her usual pattern of predicting horrible death for Harry, instead predicting long life, many children, and election as Minister of Magic.

Finally, Umbridge fires Trelawney, and has put her and her trunks in the Entrance Hall, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] overrides her decision to eject Trelawney from the school grounds. Dumbledore says that while, as High Inquisitor, Umbridge has the authority to dismiss his teachers, she lacks the power to force them to leave the school, and it is his wish that Trelawney remain at Hogwarts. He also has to override Trelawney in this; her wounded pride compels her to leave and seek employment elsewhere, but Dumbledore refuses to allow that.

During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]], we learn that the thing Voldemort has been seeking, and the reason he lured Harry to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] concerning himself and Harry. Voldemort had earlier heard the first half of the prophecy, and as a result had attempted to kill Harry as an infant, unsuccessfully. In his office after the battle, Dumbledore tells Harry that the prophecy had been made to him by Trelawney. The prophecy, made shortly before Harry's birth, had been what persuaded Dumbledore to hire Trelawney as the Divination teacher; had it not happened, Dumbledore likely would not have allowed the course to be offered at Hogwarts. Events to date had made parts of the prophecy become true, and Dumbledore allows Harry to hear the entire prophecy. Harry is greatly disturbed, as it appears that the prophecy is saying that he must either kill Voldemort or be killed by him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Dumbledore apparently realizes that Harry is reluctant to discuss Trelawney's prophecy with anyone, as it seems to be impelling him to become a murderer, so he recommends that Harry tell Ron and Hermione about it. He does so, and is relieved to discover that they don't think less of him for the revelation.

Harry's interaction with Trelawney is very limited this year, as he had failed his Divination [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL]] so dramatically. We learn that both Trelawney and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], who was hired to replace her, are now teaching Divination. Parvati Patil seems somewhat disappointed that Trelawney is teaching sixth year. Trelawney still feels affronted, and seems to feel that Firenze is stepping on her turf, because we see her walking through the halls, smelling of sherry, and trying unsuccessfully to tell her own fortune. At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]]'s Christmas party, she is morosely drunk, and in mid-March we see her demanding, unsuccessfully, that Dumbledore fire Firenze.

Summoned to Dumbledore's office, Harry finds Trelawney sprawled on the floor outside the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. Helping her up, he discovers that she had been using the Room of Requirement as a place to hide her sherry; this time, though, she had heard someone inside &quot;whooping&quot;. When she had demanded to know who was there, everything had gone dark, and she had been rudely thrust back out into the corridor. Harry believes that the evident joy in the unknown person's voice indicated that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] had completed whatever it was that he was doing in the Room of Requirement, and he asks Trelawney to accompany him to Dumbledore's office, to tell Dumbledore what she had heard. On the way, she starts talking about the day she was hired. Harry has already heard the story from Dumbledore, and is somewhat interested to hear Trelawney's version, but when Trelawney mentions that the eavesdropper had been [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], Harry leaves her standing in the corridor and runs off to confront Dumbledore with this information.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

With Harry not attending Hogwarts, we see very little of Trelawney until the final battle. Trelawney helps her fellow professors and students during the battle that ensues at Hogwarts when Lord Voldemort and other Death Eaters attack it by throwing crystal balls down from upper landings of the staircase. A thrown crystal ball knocks out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] before he can resume an attack on Lavender Brown.

== Strengths ==

Trelawney actually does have the gift of Sight to a limited extent. Twice, over the course of some eighteen years, she has made prophecies: one has come true, and the other had partially become true at the start of the series, and is completed by the end. She does have some ability to mislead and misdirect; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] hang on her every word.

== Weaknesses ==

She pretends to be a better seer than she is; knowing that she is supposed to have the Sight, because of her ancestor, she plays that up for all she is worth, using the same tricks Muggle fortune-tellers use. She annoys some people but she cannot be relieved of her residence at the castle because of her real prophecies. She is very insecure, trying to preserve her position as superior to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]] after his hiring by bad-mouthing him and his techniques. When she is threatened with dismissal, and when Firenze is taking half the Divination classes, she also tends to retreat into alcohol; in the latter half of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and throughout ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', we never meet Sybill without smelling sherry.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Sybill Trelawney spends most of her time in the Divination tower/classroom and she is thus alienated from the rest of the staff, though the impreciseness of her subject, knack of overexaggerating, and questionable teaching methods often draw the ire of Professor McGonagall.  Her relationships with students aren't much better: she irritates Harry, Hermione, and Ron, but manages to gather a smattering of followers including Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown.  She also holds resentment towards Firenze when he is appointed as a second Divination teacher.

== Analysis ==

Overall, Trelawney likes to make big impressions, most probably because of her insecure nature. She enjoys predicting the deaths of students, one in each year, though none have died yet. She constantly predicts a gruesome death for Harry, possibly wanting the grand effect of having such a famous person die and predict it correctly.

Ironically, Trelawney's two wildest predictions turned out to be the only ones that were true. These two predictions were so wild that &quot;even [Trelawney] wouldn't say something as far-fetched as ''that''&quot;, according to Trelawney. These two predictions also happen to relate to Voldemort.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], as mentioned above, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] sacks Sybill and orders her out of the castle; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], while not disputing her authority to dismiss teachers, does dispute her authority to force people to leave the castle. He requests, quite forcefully, that Sybill stay in the castle, and has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] assist her in returning to her chambers. There is no reason for him to retain her in the school, except that she has twice now uttered prophecies about Harry and Voldemort, one of which has already come true, and one of which Voldemort is trying quite hard to retrieve. Presumably, Dumbledore feels there is some danger, either to the Order or to Sybill herself, if she is allowed to leave the protection of Hogwarts. Sybill remains unaware of this possibility of danger, apparently; she does not seem to be aware of having made either prophecy. Of course, Voldemort may not know of her lack of awareness, and may mean to kidnap her to retrieve the prophecy direct from the source, as it were.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#How would Professor Trelawney react if she knew she had made the prophecy about Harry?

#What does the way Trelawney treats Firenze say about her character?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The fact that Trelawney can, even if only very occasionally, make accurate prophecies, and the revelation (in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'') that there are enough prophecies made to fill what would appear a rather large warehouse, should inspire the reader to contemplation of the nature of time in the Wizarding world. We have already seen that there has been significant magical work done with time, as shown by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time Turner]] Hermione had used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]. The Time area of the Department of Mysteries shows that work in that area is continuing with some success. However, the fact that prophecies are so clearly valued would suggest that time travel, as performed by the Time-turner, is unidirectional; the time-turner can take you back in time to relive an hour or a day, but cannot take you forward to a future that has not yet happened. The value placed on prophecies, however, indicates that the Wizarding world does accept that some Seers can accurately predict events, and that it is an uncommon ability.

:'o - In front of a masculine or neuter noun that begins with a consonant. 
With neuter nouns, the following consonant is doubled

''plural''
:'e - In front of (any) plural noun that begins with a consonant. Feminine nouns double the consonant. 

*If the word is feminine, the first letter must be doubled
*In the case of masculine nouns the doubling may occur also, in front of the consonants: z-, b-, br-, v-, and g-.


:ll' or l' - In front of a noun, masculine or feminine, singular or plural, that begins with a vowel


'''Articulated Prepositions'''

Prepositions (proper): a, 'a, cu, d' / 'e, pe, tra, nfino a, addu.
In Neapolitan there are very few articulated prepositions, in particular:

:â = a + 'a (Italian, alla) = to the
:ê = a + 'e (Italian, ai, agli, alle) = to the
:ô = a + 'o (Italian, al, allo) = to the

In all other cases preposition and article are indicated separately.

== Overview ==

An '''''Acromantula''''' is a large venomous spider, covered in thick black hair. It is a carnivorous creature and has pincers which create a distinctive clicking sound when aroused. The female is larger than the male and lays up to one hundred eggs at a time. Acromantulae are intelligent beasts, capable of human speech, although not self-taught.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Acromantulae originated in Borneo dense jungles, where wizards were said to have bred them, and are one cause of the Ban on Experimental Breeding being put into effect. Acromantula venom is apparently exceedingly valuable, but it is nearly impossible to obtain from the living spider, and as acromantulae eat their dead, it is very uncommon to find one that can still be harvested. Their eggs — large, soft and white in colour — are Class A Non-Tradeable Goods.

Although it is not mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] is an Acromantula. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] population of Acromantulae are fathered by him, and he owes a debt to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who raised him in a cupboard in Hogwarts castle fifty years prior. The fact that he is an Acromantula is discovered in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood_Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major_Events/Third_Task|Third Task]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet_of_Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], an Acromantula is one of the dangerous creatures that the Champions must overcome to reach the Triwizard Cup at the center of the Maze; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] very nearly falls victim to it. Acromantulae also play a small role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where the Death Eaters drive them towards Hogwarts Castle as part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts|Hogwarts]].

== Analysis ==

Spiders in general, and large spiders in particular, have been a focus of human fear from time immemorial. Some theories suggest that fear of spiders may be inborn. Whether learned or inborn, extreme irrational fear of spiders, [[w:Arachnophobia|Arachnophobia]], is one of the most common types of [[w:phobia|phobia]] people suffer from.
The literary tradition is also rich in spider villains. One of the most obvious examples is the giant spider [[w:Shelob|Shelob]] in [[w:J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] ''The Lord of the Rings''

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''''Dreamless Sleep Potion''''' is a complex potion first mentioned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus_Snape|Severus Snape]] and later by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace_Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]]. Both Potions Masters used this potion as an example of how powerful potions could be.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus_Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] recommended that Harry be given the potion after he confronted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord_Voldemort|Voldemort]] at the end of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A (coil of) wire and a magnet, generating AC ==
'''Magnets''' attract iron and a few other metals, but here we are concerned with generating electricity. A simple experiment with iron filings and a magnet shows that there is such a thing as a ''magnetic field''; that field is strongest (the force of attraction is highest) close to the poles of the magnet, and gets weaker further away from the poles.

A '''wire''' is usually made of copper, and copper is neither attracted nor repelled by a magnet, however if a '''wire''', usually of copper, is inside a CHANGING magnetic field, or if the '''wire''' itself is moved to a place where the the magnetic field is of DIFFERENT strength, then a voltage is generated between the two ends of that '''wire'''. If there are two wires that are connected in series, then that voltage will be twice as much, and if it is a coil, in that CHANGING magnetic field, with n number of turns, then the voltage will be n times as large. If a voltmeter is connected to the terminals of that coil, and the coil is moved, or the magnet is moved, then the voltage will be shown on the voltmeter. That voltage's direction will keep changing, it will ''ALTERNATE'', as the changes are made, therefore that voltage is an Alternating Voltage, and if there is a circuit completed between the two terminals of the coil, then an Alternating Current (AC) will flow in that circuit.

* Usually one or more coils of wire are fixed on the outside of a circle, and an electromagnet is rotated inside, causing an alternating voltage and/or alternating current (AC) to be generated.

1 Think of a simple magnet that rotates; what happens? Starting with the magnet in a position so that the coil is half-way between the poles of the magnet, the magnetic field strength is zero at the coil, and therefore the voltage across the terminals of the coil is zero.

2. As the magnet rotates a little bit further, one of the poles gets closer to the coil, ''the fieldstrength changes'', and therefore a voltage appears across the coil's terminals; the polarity of that voltage depends on how the voltmeter is connected; reversing the leads will reverse the indicated polarity of the voltage. Also the polarity depends on whether the North-pole or the South-pole is closest to the coil. Because the magnet rotates, its poles ''ALTERNATE'' getting closer to the coil, and therefore the indicated voltage ''ALTERNATES'' as well.

* Normally the resulting AC voltage is connected to a transformer in order to increase the voltage to a suitable level for transmission over great distances, but in addition there are sensors and switches designed to switch off if the current is too high, and also to ensure the rotation of the magnet or equivalent is then stopped - or else the speed of rotation would increase, causing considerable destruction, even, maybe, loss of life.

&lt;TD&gt;Conic sections are graceful curves that can be defined in several ways and constructed by a wide variety of means. Most importantly, when a plane intersects a cone, the outline of a conic section results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
The circle is the simplest and best known conic section.  As a conic section, the circle is the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the cone's axis.
{{TextBox|The geometric definition of a circle is the locus of all points a constant distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from a point &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; and forming the '''circumference''' (C).  The distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the '''radius''' (R) of the circle, and the point &lt;math&gt; O = (h,k)&lt;/math&gt; is the circle's '''center''' also spelled as '''centre'''. The '''diameter''' (D) is twice the length of the radius.
[[Image:Circle-withsegments.svg|thumb|300px|right|Circle illustration with circumference (C) in black, diameter (D) in cyan, radius (R) in red, and centre or origin (O) in magenta.]] }}

== Equations ==

==== General Form ====
The general equation for a circle with center &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

{{Yellow Warning|The radius must be greater than 0.  If the radius is zero, the graph is a single point.  This is a ''degenerate case''. }}

In the simplest case of a circle whose center is at the origin, the equation is simply a restatement of the ''Pythagorean Theorem'':
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====General form====
The general form of a circle equation is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;/center&gt;&lt;-g,-f&gt; is the center of the circle.

==== Polar Coordinates ====
In the case of a circle centered at the origin, the polar equation of a circle is very simple because polar coordinates are essentially based on circles.  For a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;r = a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

In the more complicated case of a circle with an arbitrary location, the equation is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;r^2 - 2 r r_0 \cos(\theta - \varphi) + r_0^2 = a^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;br&gt;where &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the circle's center to the origin and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle pointing to the circle.&lt;/center&gt;

There are many cases that allow the equation to be simplified.  If a point on the circle is touching the origin, its polar equation may consist of a single trig function.

.....

==== Parametric Equations ====

When the circle's equation is parametrized with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the equation becomes
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x=h + r \cos t&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;y=k + r \sin t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

==Example==
Find the center and the radius of the following circle:
x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+8x-10y+20=0
find by:

x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+8x-10y+20=0  
&lt;br&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+8x-10y= - 20
&lt;br&gt;(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+8x)+(y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-10y)= - 20
&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;+16&lt;/u&gt;          &lt;u&gt;+25&lt;/u&gt;         &lt;u&gt;+16+25&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+8x+16)+(y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-10y+25)=21
&lt;br&gt;(x+4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(y-5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=21

&lt;br&gt;Thus:
&lt;br&gt;C(-4,5) radius=&lt;math&gt; radical(21)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

[[Image:Parabola.svg|thumb]]
The parabola is another commonly known conic section. The geometric definition of a parabola is the locus of all points such that they are equidistant from a point, known as the focus, and a straight line, called the directrix. In other words the eccentricity of a parabola is equal to 1. The solid formed by rotating a parabola about the axis is called a paraboloid.

==Graphing Parabola==
The general form of a vertical parabola is &lt;math&gt;(x - h)^2 = 4a(y-k)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The axis of the parabola is the line perpendicular to the directrix which passes through the focus, and is the line &lt;math&gt;x = h&lt;/math&gt;. It is also known as the line of symmetry.
* The vertex is the 'base' of the parabola and is located at &lt;math&gt;(h, k)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a positive &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; will move the parabola upwards along its axis &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; units, while a negative one will move it downwards. This is the same  regardless of whether &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a positive or negative number.
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the focal length of the parabola. The focus is located at &lt;math&gt;(h, k + a)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is positive the parabola opens upwards, whereas a negative &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; causes it to open downwards.
* The directrix is located at &lt;math&gt;y = k - a&lt;/math&gt;.

If the conic is horizontal, it is the same as a vertical parabola only along the x-axis rather than the y-axis. The general form is: &lt;math&gt;(y - k)^2 = 4a(x-h)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The axis of the parabola is the line &lt;math&gt;y = k&lt;/math&gt;.
* The vertex is located at &lt;math&gt;(h, k)&lt;/math&gt;. A positive &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; will move the parabola towards the right along its axis &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; units, while a negative one will move it towards the left. This is the same  regardless of whether &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a positive or negative number.
* The focus is located at &lt;math&gt;(h + a, k)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is positive the parabola opens towards the right, whereas a negative &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; causes it to open leftwards.
* The directrix is located at &lt;math&gt;x = h - a&lt;/math&gt;.

== Parametric Form ==
The parametric form of a vertical parabola is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=h + 2at&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y=k + at^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a horizontal one:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=h + at^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y=k + 2at&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For both of these forms:
* The vertex is at (h,k)
* The focus is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units from the vertex along the major axis.
* The gradient at any point on the parabola is t, which can be proved by differentiating the parametric form using the chain rule.

For information on how to graph the paramatric form, see [[Conic Sections/Parametric Form|Parametric Forms of Conic Sections]].

== Polar Form ==
The polar form of a parabola is given by &lt;math&gt;r=-\frac{2a}{1+cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Applications ==
Parabola have a number of uses in everyday life:
* Galileo showed in the 16th century that objects fired into the air at an angle to the ground followed the path of a parabola, a discover which led to more accurate of targeting of projectiles. 
* In optics, parabola are particularly useful because parallel beams incident upon a parabolic mirror are all directed towards the focus, and conversely a light source placed at the focus will reflect off the mirror as a series of parallel rays. This makes parabolic mirrors useful in telescopes, headlights, satellite dishes and much more.
* Another use of parabola is in training astronauts. A plane which follows a parabolic path into the air will cause passengers to experience freefall and therefore weightlessness.

      <comment>/* Graphing an Ellipse */  Equation is wrong. Otherwise, eccentricity will not be smaller than one.</comment>

The geometric definition of an ellipse is the locus of a point which moves in a plane such that the sum of its distances from the two points called foci add up to a constant(greater than the distance between the said foci). It can also be defined as a conic where the eccentricity is less than one. Ellipses have two directrices, one on each side.

==Graphing an Ellipse==
The general equation for an ellipse where its major, or longer, axis is horizontal is : &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Where the major axis is vertical, it is: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;
* The center is located at &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The foci are found at a distance of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; from the centre along the major axis, where &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The eccentricity of the ellipse can be found from the formula: &lt;math&gt;b^2 = a^2(1-e^2)&lt;/math&gt; where e is eccentricity. A higher eccentricity makes the curve appear more 'squashed', whereas an eccentricity of 0 makes the ellipse a circle.
* The directrices are the lines &lt;math&gt;x = \pm ae&lt;/math&gt;
* The major axis has a length of &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt; and the minor one &lt;math&gt;2b&lt;/math&gt;.
* The sum of the distance from each point to each of the foci is &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
* Assuming a perfectly reflective perfect ellipse, any light emitted from a focus of an ellipse will be reflected to intercept the other focus. This property is exploited in &quot;Whispering Galleries&quot; where 2 people stand at the foci of an arbitrarily large elliptical room and can clearly hear each other whispering.
* The reflective property is also useful in medicine, where it is used to treat gall stones. A machine emits sonic waves at one of the foci in an elliptical bowl, and the area of the patient where the gall stones are located is placed at the other focus. The waves are reflected and focused on the stones, causing them to be broken down and become small enough to pass from the body.
* The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci ([[w:Kepler's laws of planetary motion/First law|Kepler's first law]]). The orbits of objects in space are mostly elliptical in shape.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
A hyperbola can be defined as the locus of all points such that the difference between the distance of each point from two points known as the foci is constant. This is similar to an ellipse, however whereas in an ellipse the distances sum to a constant, here they subtract to one. A hyperbola can also be defined as the locus of all points such that the distance of the point to the closest focus divided by the distance to the directrix, a ratio known as the eccentricity, is a constant greater than one.

== Graphing Hyperbolae ==
The general form of a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis, i.e. the axis on which the foci lie, is: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis, on the other hand, is of the form: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
* The centre of the hyperbola is &lt;math&gt;(h,k)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The two foci are found at a distance of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; from the centre in each direction along the transverse axis, where &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* The eccentricity of the hyperbola can be found by &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;. A higher eccentricity makes the hyperbola 'steeper', whereas a smaller one makes it more 'curvy'.
* The vertices are a distance of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from the centre of the hyperbola in each direction along the transverse axis.
* The difference between the distances of any point from each of the foci is equal to &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt;.
* Hyperbola also have two asymptotes. An asymptote is a line that points on the graph continuously approach yet never reach. If you extended the graph vast distances along each axis, you would observe it getting closer and closer to the asymptote, however it would never actually reach it. The asymptotes can be found by &lt;math&gt;y=k\pm\frac{b}{a}(x-h)&lt;/math&gt; for a horizontal hyperbola, or &lt;math&gt;y=k\pm\frac{a}{b}(x-h)&lt;/math&gt; for a vertical one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The general form of any conic section is &lt;math&gt;Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0&lt;/math&gt;. In most cases, B=0 because any other value would cause the conic to be rotated and makes analysis much more difficult. For the rest of this page we will assume that B=0. The general equation can be algebraically manipulated to become the standard form of the specific conic it describes. However, it would first be useful to know what that conic is. That can be determined simply by comparing A and C. If either A or C, but not both, equals 0, the equation describes a parabola. If A=C, it describes a circle. If A and C are both positive or both negative, but not equal, it is an ellipse. If A and C have opposite signs, it is a hyperbola. If A=C=0, it's obviously just a line.

Welcome to Introduction to Programming in C,

==Goals==

The goal of this course is to teach the basics of computer programming and software engineering, as well as the C programming language.

==Prerequisites==

You must have a decent understanding of algebra, be capable of using a computer (edit files in a text editor and know how to run a program), and have bought or downloaded a compiler.  GCC, Visual Studio, or any other compiler should work.

No previous knowledge of programming is required.  In fact, this course may go very slowly if you do have previous programming experience.

==Enrollment==

The teacher requests that you post your user name and where in the course you are on the enrollment page.  This is for his conveniance, so he can judge how many people are taking the course, and how many office hours he needs to set and assignments he may need to grade.  And so he can cry for help if it looks swamped.

==Organization==

Lessons in this course will come as a combination of reading from the [[Programming:C_contents|C wikibook]] and lectures found here.  The book will spend most of its time teaching the syntax of the language, the point of the lecture will be to explain the concepts behind the syntax and explain how to use them to write good programs.

In addition to lectures and readings, there are quizes, homework, and projects.  Quizes are short series of easily answered questions and answers that you can use to check your knowledge.  Homework is longer and generally involves a program to be written.  Projects are large programming problems where collaborative effort is encouraged.

A lesson is not meant to cover a single lecture from a real world school.  It is meant to cover a single topic.  As such, some lessons will be significantly longer than others.  Don't force yourself to do every lesson in the same amount of time, relax and take it at a comfortable pace

==Other Resources==

Sometimes static web pages just aren't enough.  For more help with the material, we have office hours and our wiki forums.

Office hours are held at &lt;INSERT IRC SERVER AND ROOM HERE&gt; on &lt;INSERT DAY/TIME HERE&gt;.  You're welcome to stop in the room and see if people are there at any time, but we only promise to be present at the given hours.

THe wiki forums allows you to post a question to us, and we'l answer as we can.  Feel free to answer a previous poster if you know the answer.

==Lessons==

Lesson 1: Introduction

Quiz 1: If applicable

Homework 1: If applicable

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why not copy from &quot;List of characters in the Harry Potter books&quot; in Wikipedia?
:Our book may be able to use that list as a reference, but our purpose is different from Wikipedia. Each character needs time to be worked on. I think in the style of a book, we will expand over time, not just start with some huge list. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:41, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

== Alphabetical Order ==

We should group characters alphabetically because otherwise, an &quot;overlap&quot; of characters occurs. Lucius Malfoy is a member of the Malfoy family, a member of the Ministry of Magic and also a Death Eater. This can make finding characters easier. --[[User:Roonil Wazlib|Roonil Wazlib]] 15:19, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
:If people need to find characters, then they should be using the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Index|Index]]. The list now can always be reorganized some but its purpose is to put characters into groups. The character should go into the group he/she/it is most importantly featured in. Families will always get the character under their listing. I'm adding a message at the top of the page. Your issue should really be solved by using the Index. The purpose of the Characters page ''is'' groups. Also, I understand that some clashing may occur (i.e. I think the Black family members shouldn't be listed under &quot;Black Family&quot; or at least not until we can write up info on some of the main members first), but we have to work with the groups as best as possible. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:42, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

I agree to a certain point. I think that the characters should be listed in some type of order such as alphabetical order within the specific sections. This is just needed for the teachers section which has no seen organization.  --[[User:Luckrider7]]

:Teachers' section is alphabetical by last name, no? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 00:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Multiple Groups, Family Info ==

I am personally wondering why characters can not be put under several different groups. It could effectively show that these groups are in this family, in this House at Hogwarts, etc. If someone could explain why they need to be/should be in the group that they are most importantly featured in, then I will be quiet and move onto other thoughts. Also, I was wondering if somewhere else in the Muggle's Guide that would do a short summation of the family? It could even be on this page, just a short explanation of the family/group. Of course, if someone could point me in the direction where they are, again I'll just move on. Thank you for your help. ~[[User:Peloneous|Peter]] 03:16, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
:I do a lot of the oversight here, and you've brought up some valid points. If you can do a good job with it, then add multiple references to a character on the page. If it's done professionally, then it could work. Having small paragraphs about a group would not be a bad idea either. Stay away from descriptive sentences however; the Guide is about analysis, not description. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 04:51, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
::A thing has occurred to me, thinking about groups. In the students, would it not be useful to group students by year, as well as by house? We have a list of students by house now, but if I wanted to look up who was in Harry's year in each house, I would have no place to do that. Is that worth adding? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 20:36, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
:::I personally find that confusing and difficult to manage across all 7+ years of the book (since there were others ahead of Harry). Marking a character with something in the template might work, but I don't know if there's value in separating by year. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
::::No argument about complexity; it would be 13 separate years ranging from those who are 7th year as Harry is entering, up to those who are first-years in the seventh book. It's just that I think it might be useful to have an easy way to look up that the Slytherins in Harry's year are Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, one other unnamed boy, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, and three unnamed girls... just for instance. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 00:45, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Minor descriptions/explanations ==

I don't know whether it actually looks any good, however I have added bullet descriptions of what the staff memebers do at Hogwarts.  It looks a bit strange and hard to follow, but I thought this information should be included.  Thoughts?  --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 23:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
:I like the idea, but I think it could be added upon. Would you be interested in creating pages under the Magic section regarding those professors' subject areas and then linking to them? Having pages to explain the subjects the professors teach seems like it would be quite helpful. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:37, 11 June 2006 (UTC)
::Sure, I would but I'm just coming into exams right now, so it will have to wait until after then. But I like your idea.  I will work on it when I can.  --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 00:11, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Contradictions in sub-pages ==

There are some contradictory statements that the Longbottoms were tortured by either Barty Crouch Jr or by Bellatrix Lestrange. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 13:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
:In our current state of development, I think the best technique for this is to remove the content and let it be formed later. With a book so large, inspecting existing information can be much more difficult than starting new content from scratch. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:41, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
::This particular issue could easily be dealt with once the truth is established. I was not 'inspecting' pages looking for contradictions, but i had stumbled across one by accident. Since i don't have time to check the books right now to see which statement is right, i've just made a note of it, and will hopefully get it done in a while. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 13:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
::This first issue has been solved (a while ago). I've made about five pages have decent text and layout on this occasion. :-) -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 19:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

== Character Page Locking ==

I've placed this section above the status section so that people will hopefully notice it. Since the Characters page is insanely long, and even though I placed a warning on the page to ask people to stop adding characters, I'm considering protecting the page from editing to avoid junk three-word additions by anonymous editors. Does anyone else support this action, and are there other pages that anyone would like protected? With all the recent activity here, it's becoming a task to manage pages within the namespace. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
:I am slightly concerned about this. As I go through the chapter summary, I do keep finding characters which are not mentioned here, but have a role in the books, and I have to take the time to add them. For instance,a  while back I found that we had no entry for Bartemius Crouch Senior, and I haven't yet needed to check if there is an entry for Ludo Bagman. If you're OK with me asking periodically to have a character added, then fine, lock it up. I'm doing a lot of adding to the Magic page as well; I'd prefer that one not be locked.

::I won't lock anything for now then. We can let some time pass to get final characters in, but in the future I'd like to lock it once we think we have a sufficient set. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:23, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
:::Thank you. Case in point: I just had to add Armando Dippet. He's still a stub, but I'll template and fill him in over the next couple of days. He appears in CoS and HBP for sure that I can recall, and he may have a cameo in OotP as well -- one of the portraits in Dumbledore's office. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 08:22, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== Current Status ==

I notice that we have a Rosier Evans, a Rosier, and an Evan Rosier on the Characters page. I suspect that Rosier (a Death Eater, probably mentioned in either the Pensieve scenes or in the return of Voldemort) is not the same as Evan Rosier (listed as a Slytherin), but I think Rosier Evans is incorrect. I think we may have to combine these into one or two over time. I am not suggesting we do anything immediately; but I would like to keep a note here so that when we see &quot;Rosier&quot;s in the chapters, we can then decide how to correct it.

== Minor characters ==

I propose either deleting each or merging minor characters in one article which is redirected to by the individual pages.  [[User:John Reaves|John Reaves]] 06:35, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:This discussion is now at [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Characters not added ==

An anonymous editor recently added a number of characters and items to the Staff section. Some I have retained, but others I have had to back out. The standard edit line is not long enough to include my rationale, so I have put that information here.

*Bathsheba Babbling (Ancient Runes): While we know that Bathsheba did write the Ancient Runes text, we don't know that she is actually teaching the course; the name never comes up in the context of her being the teacher.

*Alecto and Amycus Carrow - The fact that these two are Death Eaters is something of a spoiler.

*Neville Longbottom. The fact that he survives to become Herbology master is more than a bit of a spoiler.

I am not entirely happy about leaving Professor Kettleburn or Wilkie Twycross in, as Kettleburn is mentioned only once in passing, and Twycross is actually a Ministry employee. However, I don't have sufficient reason to remove Twycross from the list, as he does teach at Hogwarts, and Kettleburn is saved by his more extensive appearances in ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:43, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:Another editor has added Professor Tofty, Griselda Marchbanks, Tiberius Ogden, and Eddie Carmichael. While all of these characters are very minor, Marchbanks in particular has a large enough role to warrant keeping her, even if only just; and all of them are at least as much present as Wilkie Twycross, mentioned above, and so I can't justify removing them. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:55, 16 March 2011 (UTC)

::Twice now anonymous editors have added Astoria Greengrass. I have reverted both times. Reasoning is this: The only mention of Astoria is in a family tree drawn up by Rowling after completion of the final book. We quite literally know nothing about her apart from the fact that she married [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] at some time after the close of the seventh book: was she a member of Slytherin House? Did she even attend Hogwarts? We don't know. Anything we were to write about her would perforce be speculation, and not something that would enhance our understanding of the Potter literature.

== &quot;Next Generation&quot; characters ==

I noticed that no one has contributed to this topic lately, and I was wondering if we should add any of the &quot;next generation&quot; characters mentioned in the Epilogue of Deathly Hallows - particularly Harry, Ron, and Hermione's children. [[User:Mollyingdc|Mollyingdc]] ([[User talk:Mollyingdc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mollyingdc|contribs]]) 15:21, 22 July 2013 (UTC)
:While there hadn't been any plan to add them, because of the minor role they had, on reflection we do have characters with smaller roles even than them -- someone mentioned who was simply seen at the Sorting and never again, for instance. If you want to add them, please feel free; there is information and guidelines at [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], and there's a link on that page to the prepared frameworks. If you do choose to add them, I'd greatly appreciate it if you would put links to the new pages in one spot, e.g. under a &quot;Next Generation&quot; header of the Characters page, so that I (or someone) can properly include them in the print version and various watch lists.

The notion of a singularity in general relativity refers to a region of space-time where the equations of physics break down and lose their predictive meaning as seen by some potential observer.
One kind of a singularity would be where things become infinite. This definition is limited as there are solutions to Einstein's field equations where there are no infinite quantities and yet the physical description through the mathematics becomes undefined. There has been a great deal of work leading to just what a good definition of a singularity should be.
One possible definition in general relativity is that it's a region of space-time in which timelike curves cannot be extended to all of the spacetime. In effect singularities are unphysical and indicate the breakdown of the theory.

== Overview ==

'''''Luna Lovegood''''' is a Ravenclaw student in the same year as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], one year younger than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

The Lovegoods are mentioned in passing as a family living near the Weasleys who could only afford to attend the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] by arriving a week early.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When we first see Luna, she is sitting alone in a compartment on the Hogwarts Express; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] says that the compartment is occupied, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] overrides him, saying that it's just Looney Lovegood. Entering the compartment, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] notes that she seems to be reading [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|''The Quibbler'']] upside down and wearing a necklace of Butterbeer corks. Harry sees that one of the articles in ''The Quibbler'' seems to involve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and borrows it from her to read the article, which states that Sirius is actually one Stubby Boardman, popular musician. Quickly leafing through the paper, Harry notes that it is all similar sorts of nonsense, before he hands it back. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], when she arrives, speaks disparagingly of the paper, whereupon Luna frostily replies that her father is the editor, and retreats icily behind her upside-down paper.

When Harry leaves the train, he sees that the carriages he thought were horseless are apparently being pulled by vaguely horse-shaped, winged reptilian creatures. He asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] what they are, but Ron cannot see them. Harry is only slightly reassured when Luna tells him that she can see them also.

Harry gets in trouble with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], for stating that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] had returned. Shortly after this, Luna stops Harry outside the greenhouses, saying that she believes him. Harry wonders how much the reassurance is worth, coming as it does from someone who seems to be wearing earrings made from radishes.

Luna is one of the twenty-five students who appear for the first meeting of the Defence Association, or as it is later known, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. At the first meeting in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], Luna says that Fudge has his own private army, so it is not surprising that he believes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] would be creating one. Asked about this, she says that Fudge has an army of Heliopaths. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] quickly moves on to the business of the meeting, rather than allowing Luna's odd views to take up time.

At the final meeting of Dumbledore's Army before Christmas, Harry arrives early to find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] has decorated the Room of Requirement for the season. He manages to get most of the embarrassing decorations down, but there are still some streamers and mistletoe. Luna, arriving, says that it looks very nice, but warns Harry that he shouldn't stand under the mistletoe because it is likely full of Nargles.

Since their announcement of the return of Voldemort, both Harry and Dumbledore have been repeatedly mocked in the public press, most notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Prophet'']]. In February, Hermione arranges for Harry to meet with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], the muck-raking journalist who had pilloried [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in the press the previous year. Hermione had discovered that Rita was an unregistered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]], and had forced her, under threat of revealing this to the Ministry, to stop writing for a year. It has occurred to Hermione that if Harry's full story gets published, it might help Harry's cause. Luna is present at this meeting because, as mentioned earlier, her father publishes ''The Quibbler'', and that would be the venue where the interview would be published. Rita is annoyed that the Quibbler doesn't pay for editorial content, but under threat from Hermione, interviews Harry and writes the story. Luna says that she does not know when the story will appear, because her father is expecting something big about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crumple Horned Snorkack|Crumple-Horned Snorkacks]] to come in that week.

Later, when Harry's interview appears, Luna says that her father is quite pleased. This edition of ''The Quibbler'' has sold out, and he is having to make a second print run.

Harry determines that his godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], may be being tortured at the Ministry of Magic by Voldemort, and that his only way to determine whether this is actually happening or not is to call Sirius at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] and see if he is there. The only unmonitored fire in the school is in Umbridge's office. Luna, who with Ginny has heard Harry shouting at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Hermione, volunteers to help; Harry sets her to guard one end of the corridor by Umbridge's office, so that he can break in and talk to Sirius. Luna's efforts come to naught, and she is apprehended by one of Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad and brought in to Umbridge's office. She stands, barely restrained and not resisting, apparently only somewhat aware of what is going on, though she does seem somewhat startled by Hermione's &quot;revelation&quot; of what it was that Harry was trying to do.

After Harry and Hermione have escaped Umbridge and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Luna, Ron, Ginny, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] meet up with them. When Ron and Harry wonder how they are going to get to the Ministry to save Sirius, Luna says that they will have to fly. Ron asks sarcastically if they will use the Snorkacks for that, and Luna says that's silly, Snorkacks can't fly, but &quot;they&quot; can. She points, and Harry sees two [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]] approaching, attracted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]]'s blood that has fallen on Harry and Hermione. Harry decides that he and Ron will head off to the Ministry, but Luna tells him that there are more Thestrals approaching, he and Hermione must really smell. Ron, Ginny, and Hermione are unable to mount the Thestrals, as they can't see them, but Luna dismounts and gets them settled on the creatures; backs, and they all take off for the Ministry.

Once at the Ministry, Luna accompanies Harry and the others as they go in search of the room where Sirius is being tortured. One room they find is a stone amphitheatre with a tattered veil hung in an archway. Harry is almost certain that he can hear people on the other side of the veil, and Luna says she hears them also. Eventually, they reach the hall of Prophecies, where they find that in fact it was a ruse, that Sirius is not there, and instead they are confronted by twelve Death Eaters. In the ensuing battle, Harry, Hermione, and Neville get separated from Luna, Ron, and Ginny. They meet in the antechamber, at which point only Luna and Harry are fully capable: Hermione has been knocked out by means of an unknown curse from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Antonin Dolohov]], and Dolohov also broke Neville's nose and wand, Ron has been hit by what acts rather like a drunkenness spell, and Ginny's ankle is broken. They are then forced to retreat back into the Department of Mysteries, where Luna is rendered unconscious, while trying to seal a door against the Death Eaters.

Following their return to Hogwarts, Harry is mourning Sirius' death. Meeting Luna by chance in the halls, he unburdens himself a bit to her, knowing that she has also seen someone die, because she had been able to see the Thestrals. She says that she had seen her mother die; she had been a very smart witch, and had been experimenting with new charms, when one had backfired on her. She goes on to say that she knows she will see her mother again, and that Harry will see Sirius again. Both of them had heard the voices on the other side of the veil in the room with the archway, and Luna believes that those are the dead, speaking to them. Harry somehow feels comforted by this.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

We first see Luna again on the Hogwarts Express. Here, she, Neville, and Harry share a compartment. Shortly, a group of fourth-year girls arrive; their spokesperson, one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]], introduces herself and invites Harry to come sit with them. Harry replies that he's with his friends, and will stay where he is, thanks anyway, and the girls retreat, confused. Luna remarks complacently that she is seen as being rather odd, and she knows that others call her &quot;Loony Lovegood&quot;. She also asks if Harry plans to start up Dumbledore's Army again, and Harry says there's not much point in it. Luna says that she liked the DA, it was almost like having friends. Harry, slightly discomfited, turns the conversation to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL scores]].

Ron and Hermione have had a bit of a falling out over Ron's ongoing infatuation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]], and Ron manages to say something particularly hurtful to Hermione. After class, Harry finds Hermione being comforted by Luna, and returns Hermione's things; Hermione thanks him and heads off to class. Luna comments that Ron is nice enough, but he can say hurtful things sometimes. Harry thinks that Luna is sometimes rather more honest than is comfortable. Harry has been under some pressure to select a date for the Christmas party that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] is holding, and decides that he can ask Luna to go with him, just as friends. Luna says that would be fine, and accepts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] overhears, and gleefully starts spreading the word throughout the school, as only he can.

Harry is relieved to find that Luna has left the butterbeer-cork necklace and the radish earrings off for the party, and escorts her up to Slughorn's office. There, Luna starts discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] and his plans for world domination with the drunken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], who proves a ready audience.

With the graduation of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], the school has been trying out new commentators for Quidditch, and much to Harry's surprise, Luna is the commentator for the Quidditch match that occurs in March, Gryffindor against Hufflepuff. Harry does not finish the match, having been hit in the head by a mis-hit Bludger, but Ron tells him later that the commentary was most entertaining.

Luna appears briefly again, carrying a message from Dumbledore. In the process of finding the message, which is notice of Harry's next private lesson, Luna finds, and presents to Ron, something looking like a large green onion which she says is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gurdyroot|Gurdyroot]], good for warding off [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Plimpy|Gulping Plimpies]].

Near the end of the book, Dumbledore tells Harry that they will be going to seek a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Before they depart, Harry gives Ron and Hermione the rest of his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]], and charges them with getting any DA members who will help and aiding the defence of the school. On their return, Harry and Dumbledore find the school under attack. In the aftermath, Harry learns that Hermione and Luna had been watching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s office. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] had gone to tell Snape that his assistance was needed, Snape had apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunned]] Flitwick. Departing his office, he had seen Hermione and Luna and sent them to aid Flitwick, who he said had apparently fallen and injured himself. Caring for Flitwick had effectively kept Luna and Hermione out of the battle.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Luna appears with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|her father]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]]'s wedding, where she is ecstatic at having been bitten by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|Gnome]]; apparently both she and her father believe it might grant her some special ability. Luna, annoyingly, recognizes Harry through his disguise ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]]), not seeming at all surprised that he looks different, or that he is using a different name. Once the music starts, she dances by herself.

Overhearing a conversation from outside their tent shortly before Christmas, Harry learns that Luna, Ginny, and Neville had been caught trying to break into the Headmaster's office at Hogwarts and steal the Sword of Gryffindor. While we learn that she was punished for this, we can only surmise that the punishment may have been the same as was meted out to Ginny at the same time: detention, to be served with Hagrid supervising.

Having also overheard that Luna's father was running one of a very few pro-Harry news organizations, Harry, Ron and Hermione visit him just after Christmas. Xenophilius provides what hospitality he can, but Luna does not seem to be present; Xeno says that she is down past the bridge, catching Plimpies. Harry wanders upstairs and looks around her bedroom, and finds that she has decorated it with pictures of herself, Hermione, Harry, Ginny, Neville, and Ron, wound around with what looks like a golden ribbon but is the word &quot;friends&quot; written over and over. Harry notes that the room is apparently unoccupied and has some months worth of dust. Xeno, confronted, explains that Luna had been taken off the Hogwarts Express on the way back from school for Christmas break, to force Xeno to toe the party line in what ''The Quibbler'' was publishing; and that he had reported Harry's presence to the Ministry in the hope that if they had Harry, they might release Luna.

When Harry, Hermione, Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] are captured by Snatchers, they are taken to Voldemort's headquarters in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. Harry, Ron, Dean, and Griphook are imprisoned in a basement room, and they find that Luna and Mr. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] are already there. Luna provides a sharpened bit of metal with which she is able to cut Harry's and Ron's bonds. Harry, seeing a sky-blue eye in the shard of Magic Mirror he still carries with him, calls for help. Shortly, Dobby appears, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] Luna, Dean and Mr. Ollivander to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], the home of Bill and Fleur. She says a few words at Dobby's funeral.

Luna appears back at Hogwarts shortly after Harry does; Neville has used the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]] that Hermione had created to announce meetings of Dumbledore's Army to summon the DA members to Hogwarts. She accompanies Harry to Ravenclaw tower, and shows him the bust of Ravenclaw with the model of the lost diadem. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]] surprises Harry and has him at wand point, Luna Stuns her. She admits that she is surprised at how loud it is.

Luna also helps out at the battle for Hogwarts. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to get to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], they find the path to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. Luna, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]] appear on the scene and cast their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronuses]], forcing the Dementors out of the way; however, they are then forced to retreat by oncoming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]].

Luna, along with Ginny and Hermione, are battling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] in the renewed battle in the Great Hall, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], enraged at the sight of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]] that barely misses Ginny, attacks Bellatrix.

At the victory celebration, Harry is sitting beside Luna. She recognizes that he feels very tired, and suggests that he should leave and get some rest; she calls out and points out the window, and as everyone nearby is distracted by this, Harry slips on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and departs, stopping only to gather Hermione and Ron as he does so.

== Strengths ==

Even though Luna is seen as an odd and weird person, she is quite clever. Possibly due to her odd family life, being raised by an eccentric like Xeno Lovegood, she sees things in different lights, and thus sees things that other people probably wouldn't. It is true that she believes in creatures, and magical properties of creatures and plants, that are not commonly accepted in the Wizarding world, but this could be seen as simply a mind that is a little more open than usual.  She is unusually perceptive about the people around her, such as when Luna immediately recognizes the disguised Harry at the wedding in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; just by the expression under his polyjuiced face. 

Despite being teased and having her possessions stolen by classmates, Luna feels little animosity towards them.  Luna seldom gets angry.  In tense or dangerous situations Luna is much calmer than the people around her.

== Weaknesses ==

Luna tends to &quot;space-out&quot; at times, making her somewhat oblivious to her surroundings. Her belief in plants, creatures, and other things outside the usual magical community's belief structure may be the sign of a mind that is a little too open, and acts to isolate her from her classmates. She has a tendency to be over-honest in her assessments of others, a trait which Harry finds somewhat dismaying at times.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Commonly referred to as &quot;Loony&quot; Lovegood, Luna is often alone, but she is not a loner. Her eccentric behavior and appearance have given her an unlucky reputation at Hogwarts that has led to practical jokes and unpleasant whisperings. Despite this, Luna remains friendly and fairly optimistic.

Luna is treated as an oddball and outsider by her Ravenclaw housemates.  She tells Harry that she is lonely without D.A. meetings in her fifth year implying that she has no friends in her own House.  All those she considers to be her true friends are Gryffindors.  

Perhaps because of her tendency toward introversion, Luna is one of the most observant characters in the series. She is known to voice even the most unpleasant of truths about other characters; notably, she comments to Harry in ''Half-Blood Prince'' that Ron can be quite cruel at times. However, her observations are never made with malice or contempt – she merely states the facts as she sees them.

Luna's friendships are few and far between. As a member of the DA, she is commonly seen with Neville Longbottom.  In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Harry invites Luna to accompany him to a party as &quot;just friends,&quot; at which she is ebullient.  Visiting her house in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; Harry finds a painting she made with the faces of Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Ginny linked together with the word &quot;friends&quot; over and over.  These friendships are very important to her.

Regardless of her quirky, sometimes inexplicable habits, Luna is a fiercely trustworthy, loyal friend.

Hey, is there any particular reason why you've blanked this book? If you want it deleted, just say so, as merely blanking it functions quite differently from true deletion and still allows the old version(s) to be viewed and restored by any user.

== Overview ==

'''''Legilimency''''', a compound of the Latin 'legere' (to read) + 'mens' (mind), is the art of, as one might suppose, reading another person's mind.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Characters like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] use Legilimency, especially to find out if someone is lying to them. Legilimency does not work well on wizards or witches who are experts in its counterpart, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] is a good example of this).

Professor Dumbledore orders Harry to take Occlumency lessons from Professor Snape in order to block the communications Harry is receiving mentally from Voldemort; Snape, of course, must then use Legilimency to give Harry something that he can attempt to block. Apart from the Occlumency lessons, Snape will attempt to use Legilimency directly on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 15|Christmas in Harry's sixth year]], only to be foiled by Draco's skill at Occlumency; and at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], where he detects Harry's intent to form spells and counters them. There are several places where Snape apparently uses Legilimency on Harry, without Harry being aware of the possibility; several times in the first three books, starting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 13|just before the match against Hufflepuff]], Harry has the uneasy feeling that Snape could read his mind. We also believe that Voldemort uses Legilimency to confirm Snape's story about the date of Harry's departure from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 30|when Harry returns to Hogwarts]] it seems that Snape is trying to use Legilimency on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] to see if Harry is nearby.

== Analysis ==

Legilimency is introduced in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' as being the reason that Occlumency is required. We are introduced to the idea that via the practice of Legilimency, Voldemort can read, if not minds, at least memories. Snape, in the abortive Occlumency classes, draws a distinction between Legilimency and reading minds, but Harry is unable to see what the distinction actually is, and Snape, due to his dislike of Harry, clearly does not want to spend any additional time on attempted explanations. It is possible that the distinction Snape is drawing is that between thoughts, which are extremely fluid, and the results of those thoughts, namely actions, words, senses, and memories. It is certainly true that Snape, in the Occlumency lessons, is able to retrieve memories from Harry's mind, and perceive what he is doing well enough that he is able to block every spell Harry tries to hit him with at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.

As we find in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Harry and Snape hate each other actively enough that Harry is unable to calm his mind, and Snape does not help matters by constantly needling him. As a calm mind is necessary for Occlumency, it would seem that this effort was doomed to fail from the outset. Dumbledore later says that he had made an old man's mistake, assuming that the feud between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and Snape was far enough in the past that Snape could put it aside.

As mentioned in the entry for Occlumency, it is one of Dumbledore's few mistakes to believe that Occlumency will, in fact, prevent Harry's recurring dreams. Legilimency, the ability to read another's mind, does not include the ability to plant visions in the head of another person, as far as we are told. Additionally, the channel used to transfer those visions, we later find, is a fragment of Voldemort's soul that is attached to Harry. Occlumency may or may not prevent the placement of these visions in Harry's dreams, but it seems unlikely given the information Dumbledore had at the time. However, even to Dumbledore, this was a new area of magic, so we must assume that he was doing the best he could with the tools he had.

One other question that arises is how Snape was able to send his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] to Harry in the Forest of Dean, a patch of mixed forest and fields covering some few acres, when Harry's exact position was masked by a large number of protective charms. It is possible that Snape used Legilimency to see through Harry's eyes, then quartered the Forest with his Patronus until Harry saw it.

== Overview ==

'''''Occlumency''''' is the ability to block one's mind from a Legilimens. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Occlumency is the counter to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]], of which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is a master. Characters like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] use Occlumency to hide their intentions. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is taught Occlumency lessons in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Both Snape and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] are accomplished Occlumens.

== Analysis ==

It is certain that Harry's ability to block his thoughts from Snape and Voldemort are not being helped by Snape's lessons. Harry's scar seems to prickle constantly after his lessons start, though that may be coincidence; it is at about the time that his Occlumency lessons start that Voldemort becomes aware that Harry can see into his mind on occasion, and it is shortly after that when Voldemort starts actively trying to get Harry into the Ministry. It is entirely possible that Harry's increased reaction may be due to increased probing from Voldemort. However, all through the lessons we see that Harry is unable to prevent Snape from viewing his memories, and at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], we see that Snape is able to block any of Harry's spells before he can complete it, because of Snape's being able to read his intentions.

== Questions ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

There is some question as to whether Occlumency would even work for Harry against Voldemort. Occlumency is designed to prevent an outside mind from being able to read what is happening within your mind, but as we learn in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], there is actually a fragment of Voldemort's soul within Harry. Does that bit of shared soul provide more access to Harry's mind than simple Legilimency? Harry never finds out, as he is never placed in a position again where he has to try and block Voldemort from his mind.

== Overview ==

To '''''Apparate''''' is to transport oneself from one place to another by dissapparating and reapparating, coined from the Latin '[[wikt:apparere|appareo]]', meaning to appear. Note that while the spelling '''apparation''' would seem to be more appropriate for this action, it is almost always spelled '''apparition''' in the books; we have retained this possibly somewhat illogical usage. While apparition is taught at Hogwarts, it is not an academic course. Apparition is an extra-cost course taught by a Ministry wizard, rather than by a school employee, and is taught outside of regular hours. No grades are given in the course; rather, once you determine you are ready and have passed the Wizarding age of majority, you may take an Apparition test from a Ministry examiner. The school Apparition lessons are not required to take the test, and are not sufficient to ensure a pass in the exam, though they surely help.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In order for a witch or wizard to be allowed to apparate they must first pass a test.  One cannot take the test until they are 17 years old. Apparition is very difficult and very dangerous: it is possible for a person to leave parts of their body behind (becoming ''splinched''), which results in usually serious and sometimes fatal damage as a significant piece of them may become detached. 

Note that in some editions of some books, this is spelled Apparation; however, the infinitive form, &quot;to apparate,&quot; is always spelled the same way. The term '''disapparate''' is often used to indicate the first part of the process, so for instance on finding a prisoner has escaped, one might more properly say that he &quot;disapparated&quot; rather than that he &quot;apparated&quot;.

The noise of someone disapparating can be rather loud; it is described in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] as being quite loud, like a car's backfire. The noise of someone apparating to where you are is described in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] as being a faint pop. Interestingly, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] disapparates from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s vicinity, that too is described as a faint &quot;pop&quot;.

There are three important things to remember when apparating, called the 3 Ds, which stand for destination, determination and deliberation.

*Step One: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired '''destination'''.
*Step Two: Focus your '''determination''' to occupy the visualized space. Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body.
*Step Three: Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, moving with '''deliberation'''.

== Analysis ==

Spells local to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] prevent apparition within the school grounds, part of the methods used to protect Hogwarts from outsiders. This is mentioned repeatedly by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], who read it in the book ''Hogwarts: A History''.

In order to allow the students to learn apparition, the spells preventing apparition within Hogwarts are locally and temporarily lifted in the Great Hall. We only see this being done in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s year group has the opportunity to learn; however, we can safely assume that every year group in turn has this opportunity.

Apparition is deliberately shown as being similar to Muggle driving, with an age limit, safety concerns, licensing requirements, and a proficiency test. It is, as such, an important rite of passage for a young wizard. The fact that Ron fails his test because of half an eyebrow echoes the type of failure that many readers of this book will experience, or in the case of older readers, will have experienced, at the hands of a Muggle driving examiner.

It is necessary to show that Apparition is not an instantaneous process, that it takes calmness, preparation, and deliberation to perform it; otherwise all Wizardly means of transportation, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|brooms]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]], would pale into insignificance. It is useful to note that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] comments in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] that some wizards will not Apparate because of the danger of splinching; they rely instead on their brooms and the Floo network.

It should also be noted that in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] reports that they can't leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] by Disapparating because the Ministry has, for Harry's &quot;protection&quot;, banned the use of Apparition, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo transport]] in the vicinity. The implication is that Apparition can be, if not prevented over a relatively wide region, at least detected and traced.

Apparition is also, apparently, range-limited. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is summoned from Nurmengard to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]. Voldemort is apparently unable to Apparate directly to Malfoy Manor and must fly for some time. This may be merely a plot device, to give the Trio time to escape, but it seems consistent with what we know about Apparition.

As noted, we first see Apparition when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] Disapparates from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. At the time, this is not named, and we have no understanding of the mechanism involved, or whether it is only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elves]] who can do this. Awareness that humans, also, can Apparate is not given to us until Harry's fourth year, when Mr. Weasley is talking to Harry and his own children about Apparition.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Why is it that Wizards and Witches are not able to disapparate for their own safety when they are faced with danger? For example, when Harry's mother knew that Lord Voldemort would likely try to kill her and Harry (after killing James, her husband) why didn't she just disapparate with Harry (in a side-along fashion, as in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']])? True, many wizarding houses have special spells placed upon them that will not allow for apparition, however, one would think that these could be lifted by the witch or wizard that placed the spell upon the home.
# Why in ''Harry Potter and the The Goblet of Fire'' does disapparition sound like a small popping, but in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' it sounds like a gun shot or a car back firing?  If apparition really is as loud as a car back fire it would be highly restrictive on when and where you could use it.
# Can muggles side-along apparate with wizards?
# What is it about Apparition that makes it so hard to do?

It is interesting that in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the two house-elves [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] are seen to apparate within the school, where in most earlier books Dobby, at least, apparently travels by more ordinary means within the castle. (He does apparate out of Harry's clutches when Harry is in the Hospital Wing, in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 10|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.) [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=73 J. K. Rowling has stated] that house-elf magic is different from human magic, and that they must be able to apparate in order to perform all their duties around the castle; so presumably the anti-apparition spells that block humans from apparating in the castle have been constructed to allow house-elves to continue to apparate. It should be noted that Kreacher apparently reported that he was able to Apparate out of the cave of the locket in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 10|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', although he didn't call it that: he said that his Master had summoned him, so he went. The implication is that, even when cast by a master wizard like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], anti-Apparition spells are of no use against house-elves, or a separate spell must be cast to prevent house-elves from being able to apparate. If in fact a separate spell must be used to prevent House-elf apparition, such a spell was deliberately not performed at Hogwarts since the ability to apparate is necessary to allow them to do their work. As Voldemort is known to &quot;look down upon 'lesser' creatures,&quot; it is most likely that he simply would not go to the effort of setting such a spell, as he would consider it a waste of effort to protect against such insignificant creatures. Voldemort's arrogant disregard for these sorts of magic which are outside of human capabilities shows a critical flaw in his character; magic beyond his understanding ultimately leads to his downfall.

Instantaneous transportation by matter transmission has been written about extensively by science fiction writers for years; [[w:Larry Niven|Larry Niven (Wikipedia link)]] has done considerable work on the mathematics involved and has reached some interesting conclusions. One issue, when transporting from one place on the surface of the earth to another, is the relative motion; because the earth is rotating, every point on the surface is moving in a different direction. Although it seems contra-intuitive, if you instantaneously transport yourself from Germany to London, keeping the speed of the earth's surface in Germany as you travel, you will find yourself propelled into the ground and towards the west at a speed of several hundred miles an hour as you arrive. This is quite possibly the reason for the limitation on long-distance Apparition, the limitation being the amount of differential velocity you can handle; possibly there are specialists in apparition who are able to apparate longer distances. Whether the author of this series is familiar with Niven's works is unknown.

== Overview ==

'''Avada Kedavra''', also known as the '''Killing Curse''', kills a person instantaneously and without injury. There is no countercurse for it, and only one person, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], has ever survived it. Along with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]], the Killing Curse is considered to be one of the most terrible curses in the magical world, called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]; the use of any of the three on another human being is punishable by a life sentence in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Avada Kedavra curse is recognizable by the flash of green light and the rushing noise emitted from the caster's wand. Along with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]], Avada Kedavra is considered to be one of the most terrible curses in the magical world, called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]; the use of any of the three on another witch or wizard is punishable by a life sentence in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Avada Kedavra is an Aramaic phrase that means &quot;I will destroy as I speak.&quot; Whether the words were chosen to be similar to the Muggle mock incantation &quot;abra cadabra&quot; is uncertain, but seems likely.  It is also known by most wizards as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s signature curse.

The Killing Curse is used numerous times by &quot;evil&quot; wizards, and very occasionally by &quot;good&quot; wizards: 

* In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', it is used, but not identified, by Voldemort against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]]. We are introduced to it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class by the false [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]], it is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]], at Voldemort's instruction, to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], and it is later used against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] by the returned Voldemort, though in this instance it is blocked by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect. 
* In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', it is used by Lord Voldemort against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], and blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes]], in the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle in the Ministry of Magic]]. While it is possible that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] uses it against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] in that same battle, the specific curse Bellatrix uses is not named, and Harry's expectation that Sirius will appear on the other side of the arch indicates that it was some other, non-fatal curse that simply happened to push him through the Veil.
* In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', it is used once by Bellatrix Lestrange to kill a fox, and once by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] against Albus Dumbledore. It's likely that this is also the curse that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]] attempted to use against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]]; the curse missed Lupin, hitting fellow Death Eater [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gibbon|Gibbon]].
* In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', there is description of multiple &quot;green flashes&quot; during the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], which leads us to believe that it is used by numerous wizards on both sides of that battle, late in Harry's seventh year. It is also used numerous times by Voldemort as he pursues the Elder Wand, and in a fit of rage against his own followers when he hears of the theft of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Cup Horcrux]] from Bellatrix's vault. It is also used by Death Eaters during Harry's escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], and by Voldemort against Harry in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. The spell also may have been used, though remaining unnamed, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] to kill Bellatrix Lestrange in a duel during the battle. It should be noted that it is highly unlikely that Molly would use an unforgivable curse, especially Avada Kedevra, as even a spell as simple as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|Expelliarmus]] could kill someone if it were used with enough force and directed toward the heart.
* While it is not actually stated, the &quot;green light&quot; that Harry remembers in his earliest memories, and which is mentioned in the first three books, is almost certainly from Voldemort's failed attempt to use the Avada Kedavra curse against Harry. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we see in Voldemort's memory that he used it against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|mother]], and finally against Harry himself.
* In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], we are told that when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Barty Crouch]] was the head of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror department]], Aurors were authorized to use deadly force against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. One must assume that this occasionally took the form of the Avada Kedavra curse.

== Analysis ==

The idea of causing death by a word is, perhaps, one of the ideas that makes one wish that magic actually existed, as the world would be, one supposes, much more civil if retribution for evil acts could be so quickly, easily, and finally applied. Of course, even in the Wizarding world, it is not so simple. From the outset, we have been told that the spell-caster's mindset is crucial to the operation of any spell, most notably with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]] spell used against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggarts]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] spell used against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. Additionally, Bellatrix Lestrange taunted Harry for his inability to cast a good Cruciatus curse during the battle at the Ministry. We imagine that in order to cast a Killing Curse that actually works, your mind must be filled with some emotion antithetical to your target. Whether that would be hatred, as required for the Cruciatus curse, or perhaps rage, which Voldemort seems to be so very good at, we do not know. A fair amount of mental power may also be required; it is possible that weaker wizards can't actually cast this spell.

Of course, the need for a specific mind set to cast the spell is not enough to prevent its being cast; the mind set can be learned. Hence the need to have use of the curse result in life imprisonment. This may seem a little harsh, given that there may be circumstances where the killing curse is your only option; but again, these are books written for children, and children need that reassurance that crimes will be punished.

#How did Harry Potter alone survive the Avada Kedavra?
#Did Lord Voldemort survive the curse when it backfired on him, and what state of life did he come into if he did?

It is perhaps important that Harry never uses this curse himself, despite using the other two Unforgivable Curses. Voldemort's demise is caused by his own use of the curse against Harry, and the rebound of that curse.

== Overview ==

The '''''Imperius Curse''''' forces the victim to obey the caster's commands. Along with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus Curse]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]], the Imperius Curse is considered to be one of the most terrible curses in the magical world, called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]; the use of any of the three on another human being is punishable by a life sentence in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Unlike the Killing Curse and the Cruciatus Curse, it is possible to fight this curse. However, only very skilled wizards are able to fight it, and only very powerful ones are able to cast it – it takes significant mental strength to impose your will upon another. Interestingly, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] seems to have an innate ability to fight the curse, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] is more susceptible to it than average.

The spell is first seen and described in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 14|the fourth book]], and the effects on Harry and Ron are described in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 15|the next chapter]].

== Analysis ==

When called upon to name the three Unforgivable Curses, it is Ron who comes up with this one. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] comments that this curse had made things difficult for the Ministry, as one could never be sure whether the person you had arrested was a true Death Eater, or was doing the will of a Death Eater who had remained hidden.

We see a number of people controlled by means of the Imperius curse throughout the series in and after the fourth book. Harry himself has need to cast this curse in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. The description that we receive at the time, of the action of the curse on the caster, lead us to believe that while a wand is necessary to cast this curse, the actions are somewhat longer-lasting; Harry, for instance, casts this spell on the goblin Bogrod, then on the Death Eater [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]], and has them both under his control at the same time. One gets the feeling that it is only necessary to actually have the wand actively engaged with the subject of the curse while he is getting his instructions; as is seen at the end of that episode, Travers has been instructed to hide himself, and he continues to serenely do so even after Harry has gone.

The effect of the curse on both the subject and the caster are described in the book. The subject of the spell apparently acts according to the caster's wishes because the spell provides a great serenity coupled with a clear set of instructions on what needs to be done. Basically this is an imposition of the mind-set of the slave, who has no responsibility save that of carrying out the instruction he has been given. It is because this mind-set is so comfortable that it can be hard to free slaves in any meaningful way.

The spell caster also gets a pleasurable jolt; Harry notes that when he first casts the spell, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], a &quot;feeling of tingling warmth&quot; in his wand arm. It is uncertain why this should be; this is the only time, apart from when Harry is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|dueling with Voldemort]] and experiences the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem effect]], that we hear of any effect on the caster of the spell.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The list of people we know who are controlled this way is quite large.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], we learn that initially [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]] is being controlled by his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius]]. Then, Bartemius is being controlled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]], while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] is being controlled by Barty. There is also a stretch where, possibly, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] is being controlled by either Wormtail or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. Voldemort tries to control Harry with this curse, and fails. It is perhaps ironic that Harry's ability to throw off the curse was nurtured by Barty Crouch, who claims to be Voldemort's greatest supporter.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], we believe that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sturgis Podmore|Sturgis Podmore]] was trying to get through a door at the Ministry because he was under this curse, and we are led to believe that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Broderick Bode]] was acting under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]'s instruction when he went mad. Harry guesses that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] may be controlled in this manner, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] says that is probably not the case.

We see relatively few instances of the curse in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. The story is littered with techniques meant to detect people under the Imperius curse or disguised by other means, which seem marginally effective; in fact, when we first see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] on the Hogwarts Express, we are almost led to believe that she is under the Imperius curse. There is an interesting case of Imperius-by-proxy as well; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] admits at the end of the book that he has placed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] under the Imperius curse, and it seems that while under control, Madam Rosmerta put [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] under the Imperius curse as well.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we see two people under the Imperius curse in the first five chapters: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]]. Once the Ministry falls, we can safely assume there will be many others, but they don't directly affect the story, except for the goblin Bogrod and the Death Eater Travers, as mentioned above.

†''Dimane'' is used more in Naples proper whereas ''craje'' is more common in northern Calabria. ''Craje'' comes from the Latin adverb ''cras'' (tomorrow) while ''dimane'' is constructed from  the Latin words ''de'' + ''mane'' (mane= morning, ''de mane''- in the morning) in the same manner as it is many other Romance languages.

      <comment>/* The race to the moon */</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Space exploration — A long dream ==

Going into space was always one of the biggest dreams people had, even thousands of years ago. Many science fiction authors wrote about traveling in space even before the first airplane flight in 1903.  One of the most famous science fiction books on space travel is ''From the Earth to the Moon'' by Jules Verne &amp;mdash; it was written in 1865, more than one hundred years before the first person walked on the moon. Jules Verne's idea was to use a giant cannon! That might seem silly today, but it shows how much our ideas on space travel have changed.

== The first exploration of space ==

[[File:Laika-space.jpg|frame|left|Laika: the first space traveller]]
Space begins about 100 km or 62 miles above the earth.  A more realistic way to travel in space is with a '''rocket'''.  Within a rocket is a controlled explosion.  However, exhaust (things left over after burning) is only allowed to leave the rocket in one direction.  As a result, the rocket is pushed in the other direction.  In 1942, the German rocket ''A-4'' became the first to reach that height, but it wasn't meant to do anything but fall straight down again and so wasn't terribly useful.  Still, it was an advance in rocket technology.

The Soviets were the first to put anything in space that would stay up: they launched the ''Sputnik 1'' satellite on October 4, 1957.  Within a month, the Soviets launched ''Sputnik 2'', and in that spacecraft was the first space traveler: a dog called Laika.

The launch of the ''Sputnik'' started the Space Race, a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to obtain more and more advanced space technology.  Americans were very surprised that the Soviets could have launched 'Sputnik', and began to design rockets and satellites of their own.  The race would last for the next few decades.

== A man in Space ==

On April 12, 1961, the first person was sent into space: Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet, riding in the spacecraft ''Vostok 1''.  The Soviets would send more people into space over the next few decades, and so would the Americans, but it wouldn't be until 2003 that another country would launch a spacecraft with a person in it: China, with the ''Shenzhou 5''.

== The race to the moon ==

At the beginning of the 1960s, American president John F. Kennedy made a famous speech in which he said that the U.S. was going to send people to the moon within the next 10 years.  And that's what happened: in July of 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped off the there spacecraft and said &quot;One small step for [a] man and one giant leap for mankind&quot;. He and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon where they put an American flag. Their footprints are still there because there is no wind or water on the Moon to wash them away.

== The Space Shuttle ==

After the Apollo program that sent people to the Moon, the U.S. built the Space Shuttle, that is like a jet-plane that can go to space and return! (With the help of rockets of course). The Space Shuttle helped construct the ISS (International Space Station) among another things.

The last space shuttle mission is on June 28 2011, but it will be replaced with new vehicles that will take mankind to the Moon, Mars, and beyond!

== Spaceships of the future ==

Right now, spaceships are not very efficient.  The Saturn V rocket was 363 feet tall, and it could only take people to the moon!  To get people further, better rockets must be invented. One of the most popular ideas for a rocket is the '''antimatter''' rocket. This type of rocket collides a small amount of '''antimatter''' with an equal amount of normal '''matter''' to create a large amount of energy!

Other ideas for going into space, that don't need rockets, have been thought of by scientists and astronomers.  One of these is a space elevator.  A space elevator is basically a big lift into space.  It will cost a lot less to get things up into space if a space elevator is built.
[[File:Lunar base concept drawing s78 23252.jpg|thumb|left|Is this what space travel will look like in the future?]]
Another idea, a bit like the Jules Verne idea, is an electromagnetic catapult.  This catapult works by accelerating the spaceship along a rail, similar to a maglev train.  Unfortunately, the air on Earth would set spaceships on fire as they launched, but scientists aren't thinking of putting one there:  one could go on the Moon!  The catapult on the moon could send metal and other resources to Earth's orbit, where a space station could collect them.

== Exploration beyond the Solar System ==

Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there some belive that aliens or other life may live on another plant. But, if this ever does happen probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so spread out that there are trillions of miles between stars that are &quot;neighbors&quot;. Maybe one day, your great grandchildren will be standing atop an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?

== The eye beyond Earth ==
[[File:HST-SM4.jpeg|thumb|left|The Hubble Telescope as seen by the space shuttle.]]
Many people say the very best invention ever (not just in space technology) was the Hubble space telescope (HST). Others say it's just the space station being selfish having the best technology in the world.

The Hubble Space telescope is a giant telescope that is in orbit around the Earth. Because there is no atmosphere, the Hubble Space Telescope has a clear view of even distant galaxies. One of the pictures the Hubble space telescope has made is called the 'Hubble Deep Field'. The Hubble Deep Field is a picture of some of the most distant galaxies, and it gives a snapshot of what the universe looked like when it was younger.
[[File:James Webb Space Telescope 2009 top.jpg|thumb|left|A futuristic space telescope planned for the year 2014]]
Even bigger telescopes are also in the planning, so we might be able to see right to the edge of the universe some day soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the beginning of this chapter Darwin says he intends to ask what are the origins of the races and the value of the differences among races as to classification. After noting that non-Caucasian people from different cultures were dissimilar in many ways, he then lists the reasons why naturalists might classify them as different species. These reasons include differences in habitat, physical features, intelligence, emotional makeup, and even body lice.

Darwin then argues against these reasons. He points out that individuals differ from others within their  group or culture, and unlike lower animals, they are able to interbreed with other groups of people. Furthermore,individual differences are outweighed by the many general similarities among all races. The characteristics of two ancient stocks of pig could be seen in modern pigs, but this could not be said for man which argues against more than one ancestral line according to Darwin. He describes the similarities of culture, nonverbal language and mental processes among the races which Darwin prefers to call &quot;subspecies&quot; if such a differentiation must be made at all.

In discussing the reasons for the extinction of ancient peoples, Darwin points to competition and the struggle for existence. He mentions cases where contact with &quot;civilized&quot; nations has led to the deaths of native peoples and explores the possible reasons for the mortality increase. Darwin argues against most reasons offered by others and states the main cause is sterility brought on by  changes in living conditions most of which happened as a result of contacts with Europeans. He adds that interbreeding appears to increase fertility in at least some cases. He also surmises that the changes in living conditions could have been caused by contact with other native peoples too. 

In the last paragraphs Darwin discusses the opposing views on the reasons for different shades of human pigmentation and the relationship of pigmentation to yellow fever immunity. The chapter ends with a note on the comparison of the brains in humans and apes. Darwin reiterates that there are fewer differences between the brains of a chimpanzee and a human than between a chimp and a lemur. He also quotes one of his critics on this point and offers further arguments as counterpoint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Invariant Sections/Standard GFDL notice==
I believe there should be some mention about invariant sections, cover page, etc. Isn't it? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 15:48, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
:The GFDL is very vague about what it really needs in the copyright disclaimer.  This is in fact one of the major weaknesses of the GFDL as opposed to the GPL (which requires only a simple &quot;Permission to copy this software is granted under the GPL&quot;).  This was one of the crazy ideas by [[w:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]] and some of other FSF people in regards to GNU documents.  The invarient sections were generally supposed to be things that you shouldn't mess with, such as they copyright notice, who the authors were, and citiation references.  Indeed, I feel that as a Wikibook these things should be in there, and perhaps even be put in as invariant sections as well.  And in this particular Wikibook we have a cover page, so the &quot;no cover page&quot; exception doesn't apply either, or must be modified somehow.&lt;p&gt;I need to read more into the GFDL and what it covers, particularly on the finer ugly legal points and what is needed for preparing an actual paper book as opposed to a bunch of web pages.  That is in particular why I added this copyright notice for editing here, as it does need some rework before it is used on an actual document.  If you do make changes here (and '''be bold'''), just make sure that there is a legal requirment that you are trying to resolve rather than simply copying the &quot;standard disclaimer&quot; used in Wikimedia projects.  BTW, I would also like to add a &quot;back cover text&quot; as well... I.E. the standard &quot;blurb&quot; about the book to explain what it covers if you saw it in a bookstore.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:13, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
::I don't know much about any &quot;legal requirements&quot; so can't &quot;be bold&quot;. But I just wanted to point out that we're probably better off specifying what is the cover page, etc.
::I remember seeing somewhere that Wikimedia intends to only have text that is GFDL '''with no invariant section''' but I don't have the time to search where these things were discussed. Thanks. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:19, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Omelet Recipes|Omelet Recipes]]

A '''French Omelette''' or is a dish consisting of fried beaten eggs, often with an added filling.

==Ingredients==

* 4 eggs
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]].

==Procedure==

# Loosely mix the eggs. Season the mixture with some [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]].
# Heat a frying pan.
# Add oil and a small amount of butter when the pan starts to get hot. Enough to coat the pan entirely, but no more. Remove any excess oil.
# Let the pan get as hot as you can, without burning the butter, and keep the flame high.
# Pour the egg mixture into the pan and quickly tilt the pan to let it spread around the bottom.
# With a spoon or spatula, pull the solidified edges towards the center and tilt the pan to let the egg mixture fill the gap again. Keep repeating this (quickly) until there's not enough liquid egg left to fill the gap. (The top of the omelette should still be liquid). 
# Turn the flame down a little lower to fold the egg. Use a spatula to pry the edges loose from the pan. When the omelette is completely loose from the pan. Fold one part over the other. You can fold half of the omelette over the other half, or fold one third of the omelette inwards and then fold the remaining flap over that, to create a thicker, less wide omelette.
# Slide the omelette onto the plate.

The center of the omelette should be just barely cooked, and a little runny. The outside should be cooked, but not browned (or slightly browned). The center will continue to cook after the omelette is removed from the pan, so be sure to eat it right away.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* The center of a good omelette should just be a little runny. When serving  omelettes to children, pregnant women, or elderly or ill people, give the omelette a little more time.
* To decrease the amount of eggs used, use fewer eggs, and add some milk.
* Omelettes are often cooked with extra ingredients, or a 'filling'. How ingredients should be added depends on the ingredient. Some ingredients, like cheese, can be added to the egg mixture. Some should be fried before making the omelette (possibly in the same pan as the omelette, before adding the eggs). To use the ingredients more as a filling, than as a part of the mixture, add them to the omelette  just before folding.
* There are many ingredients and fillings that can be used in omelettes. Some suggestions:
** pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]].
** Any kind of [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]].
** [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]].
** [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]].
** Chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], optionally with seeds removed.
** Ham/salami/prosciutto
** Mushrooms ([[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've moved this to Omelette Recipe temporarily, because I didn't really know what to do with it. This doesn't really agree with any kind of omelette recipe I've ever seen, so I wouldn't know what to call it, but just removing it seems harsh. Any thoughts? [[User:Risk|risk]]

:Yeah, what the heck? It's a very normal omelet recipe with good instructions. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:39, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:: True. I originally moved it to French Omelette, intending to only edit it slightly from general Omelette to French Omelette. However, as I was editing I found that I had to edit all the instructions to turn it in to a classic French omelette recipe, so I moved this here and started French Omelette from scratch. My only problem is the page title. Since the Omelette page now has a different function and this recipe doesn't signify any specific kind  of omelet (to my knowledge) I coulnd't come up with a proper name. [[User:Risk|risk]]

::: OK. This is just an Omelet. It's not French or anything else. Let's leave the complicated spelling for the French one. In general it is better to add a variation or a new recipe, unless you're sure the original just won't work. I assure you that this fairly plain and ordinary omelet is quite tasty. The only odd thing is having proportionately more egg white for better taste, nutrition, and physical characteristics. Note that omelets are generally listed on the [[Cookbook:Breakfast]] page, though maybe the Asian ones aren't served for breakfast. Also see ''inarizushi'' on the [[Cookbook:Sushi]] page.

:::: I'm with [[User:Risk|risk]] - this is not an omelet recipe. It may make a very tasty egg dish, but you'll have to invent a new name for it.   It's not how an omelet is prepared -

This guy wants us to put a nonstick pan on a freaking 500 degree F grill? I just so happen to be living in the great US, and a grill is something entirely different from what the English call a &quot;grill&quot;. Here we call it a broiler. And just so you know, if I tried to put a nonstick pan on an &quot;American&quot; grill, I'd be eating a Teflon flavored omelet.

:: Ok, that seems like a good name. Why move this page to Omelette Recipes, though? I proposed to turn omelette/omelet into a sort of disambiguation page, as I thought was the policy with this sort of thing. What's your intention with the omelette/omelet page now? [[User:Risk|risk]]

:::: Ah, so the redirect Omelette-&gt;Omelet Recipes just stays this way. That's OK. I thought you had some kind of other plan for the Omelet/Omelette page. [[User:Risk|risk]]
:::::Yes, I think so. I'd be happy to link it to the Basic Omelet recipe if it would be better to quickly direct people to a pretty decent omelet recipe. (I don't think the recipes that risk food poisoning are reasonable choices.) The mix-in varieties (Spanish and Denver) are not what people expect of &quot;Omelet&quot;, and the bacon-cheese one is too specific about the filling.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure==
Hm, I have a question on the structure here. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference Finite Difference Method] is a numerical method. I think it is a bit confusing to have such things in many places, especially since [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method Finite Element Method] often are needed when doing heat transfer stuff. I would vote for having an appendix which explains the '''basics''' of numerical methods and then goes on to talk about the '''basics''' of Finite Difference Method etc. Speaking about that, should the book be focused on &quot;pen and paper&quot; or computer calculations? In the courses I'm involved in we tend to do some simple stuff by hand and then they start using computers to get a feeling for more advanced stuff, but there's always a risk with using computers that they go for surface learning  (push that button, report to the teacher ;o) rather than deep learning (i.e. computer assignments need to be carefully designed) '''AND''' if one focuses on computer stuff in a wikibook, don't we end up in a conflict of interest (or are there apropriate free source software for these things)? [[User:Saittam|Saittam]] 13 Aug 2005

in my opinion, the book should talk about all kinds of heat transfer techniques and methods used to solve the problem. it is going to be an arduous task to put down a whole book on heat transfer. people who are going to refer to this are mostly going to use it as a reference. the approach has to be the same that is used in classrooms. we'll list the pen and paper methods and the comp methods, with the pen and paper methods preceeding the comp methods. the choice of the method is left to the user.

==Computer Stuff==

''if one focuses on computer stuff in a wikibook, don't we end up in a conflict of interest ...?''

I don't understand. Do your concerns also apply to the proprietary software used in the [[Pro Engineer]] and [[Microsoft Excel Programming Recipes]] wikibooks? What exactly are you concerned might happen?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

==LMTD==

The module currently says
''The efficiency of a counter flow heat exchanger is sometimes characterized by the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) between the fluids. Lower values of LMTD indicate better heat exchanger performance.''

I don't understand. What if the output of the initially &quot;cold&quot; fluid is exactly the same temperature as the output of the initially &quot;hot&quot; fluid?

Better yet, what if the output of the initially &quot;cold&quot; fluid is hotter than the output of the initially &quot;hot&quot; fluid? (This *can* happen in a highly efficient counter-flow heat exchanger, right?)

Or is the LMTD calculated from something *other* than the output temperatures?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

''Yes, see [[Wikipedia:Log mean temperature difference]].''

I don't think this is true at all.  The LMTD is what you start with in designing heat exchangers, and the last thing you want is a low LMTD.[[User:Chemical Engineer|Chemical Engineer]] 18:24, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

==Software==
''are there apropriate free source software for these things?''

Are you saying some people don't already know? :-)

Off the top of my head, I know some related open-source things that already have a wikibook:

Rather than jump directly from hand-calculations to specialized finite-element software, perhaps some intermediate 1D and 2D problems could use a general-purpose spreadsheet (perhaps [[OpenOffice.org]]).

[[Python]] ([http://www.scipy.org/ scientific python]) and [[Programming/LearnByExample/Octave | Octave]]
are good open-source tools for general 3D numerical calculations.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

==Lienhard and Lienhard==

Instead of starting this project from scratch maybe someone could approach Lienhard and Lienhard and see if they would be willing to allow their textbook to be used as the foundation for this Wiki entry.  I'm not sure how they would feel about letting people modify their copyrighted material, but it might be worth a shot.

==References==
I´ve been doing some search for information in this subject and found a couple of available textbooks on the internet that will surely be usefull for expanding and also refining the concepts of heat transfer. 

Please look at:

A Heat Transfer Textbook, John H. Lienhard V, Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I have added some links that I propose we break up this wikibook into pages, and these seemed logical to me (they're basically the same as the main headers now), if you think they're appropriate then let me know and I'll just move the information that's already here into those pages, if not feel free to revert my linkage adding.

Just as with groups, we can study ''homomorphisms'' to understand the similarities between different rings.

==Homomorphisms==
=== Definition ===
Let ''R'' and ''S'' be two rings. Then a function &lt;math&gt;f:R\to S&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''ring homomorphism''' or simply '''homomorphism''' if for every &lt;math&gt;r_1,r_2\in R&lt;/math&gt;, the following properties hold:
:&lt;math&gt;f(r_1r_2)=f(r_1)f(r_2),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(r_1+r_2)=f(r_1)+f(r_2).&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, ''f'' is a ring homomorphism if it preserves additive and multiplicative structure.

Furthermore, if ''R'' and ''S'' are rings with unity and &lt;math&gt;f(1_R)=1_S&lt;/math&gt;, then ''f'' is called a '''unital ring homomorphism'''.

=== Examples ===
# Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{Z} \to M_2(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; be the function mapping &lt;math&gt;a \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Then one can easily check that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism, but not a unital ring homomorphism.
# If we define &lt;math&gt;g:a \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; 0\\0 &amp; a\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, then we can see that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a unital homomorphism.
# The ''zero homomorphism'' is the homomorphism which maps ever element to the zero element of its codomain.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be integral domains, and let &lt;math&gt;f:R\to S&lt;/math&gt; be a nonzero homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unital.

''Proof:'' &lt;math&gt;1_Sf(1_R) = f(1_R) = f(1_R^2) = f(1_R)f(1_R)&lt;/math&gt;. But then by cancellation, &lt;math&gt;f(1_R) = 1_S&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, we could have weakened our requirement for R a small amount (How?).

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R, S&lt;/math&gt; be rings and &lt;math&gt;\varphi: R \to S&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism. Let &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt; be a subring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; a subring of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(R')&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(S')&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the kernel and image of a homomorphism are subrings.

''Proof:'' Proof omitted.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R, S&lt;/math&gt; be rings and &lt;math&gt;\varphi : R \to S&lt;/math&gt; be a homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is injective if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ker \varphi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:'' Consider &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as a group homomorphism of the additive group of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F, E&lt;/math&gt; be ﬁelds, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi: F \to E&lt;/math&gt; be a nonzero homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)^{-1} = \varphi(x^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:'' We know &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = 1&lt;/math&gt; since fields are integral domains. Let &lt;math&gt;x \in F&lt;/math&gt; be nonzero. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x^{-1})\varphi(x) = \varphi(x^{-1} x) = \varphi(1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)^{-1} = \varphi(x^{-1} )&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (recall you were asked to prove units are nonzero as an exercise). So &lt;math&gt;\ker \varphi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Isomorphisms ==

=== Definition ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R,S&lt;/math&gt; be rings. An '''isomorphism''' between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible homomorphism. If an isomorphism exists, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''isomorphic'', denoted &lt;math&gt;R\cong S&lt;/math&gt;. Just as with groups, an isomorphism tells us that two objects are ''algebraically the same''.

=== Examples ===
# The function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; defined above is an isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and the set of integer scalar matrices of size 2, &lt;math&gt;S = \left\{\lambda I_2| \lambda\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Similarly, the function &lt;math&gt;\varphi: \mathbb{C} \to M_2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; mapping &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; -b\\b &amp; a\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;z = a+bi&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism. This is called the ''matrix representation'' of a complex number.
# The ''Fourier transform'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}:L^1 \to L^1&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f) = \int_\mathbb{R} f(t)e^{-i\omega t}dt&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism mapping integrable functions with pointwise multiplication to integrable functions with convolution multiplication.

'''Excercise:''' An isomorphism from a ring to itself is called an '''automorphism'''. Prove that the following functions are automorphisms:
# &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}, f(a+bi) = a-bi&lt;/math&gt;
# Define the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) = \left\{a + b\sqrt{2} | a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \to \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}), g(a+b\sqrt{2}) = a-b\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Motivation ==
Let ''G'' be an abelian group under addition. We can define a sort of multiplication on ''G'' by elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; by writing &lt;math&gt;ng=\underbrace{g+g+\cdots+g}_n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. We can extend this to the case where ''n'' is negative by writing &lt;math&gt;(-n)g=\underbrace{-g-g-\cdots-g}_n&lt;/math&gt;. We would, however, like to be able to
define a sort of multiplication of a group by an arbitrary ring.

== Definition ==
;Definition 1 (Module)
:Let ''R'' be a ring and ''M'' an abelian group. We call ''M'' a '''left ''R''-module''' if there is a function &lt;math&gt;R\times M\to M\,:\,(r,m)\mapsto rm&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''scalar multiplication'', satisfying
:#&lt;math&gt;(r+s)m=rm+sm&lt;/math&gt;,
:#&lt;math&gt;r(m+n)=rm+rn&lt;/math&gt;, and
:#&lt;math&gt;(rs)m=r(sm)&lt;/math&gt;
:for all &lt;math&gt;r,s\in R,\ m,n\in G&lt;/math&gt;.
:We call ''R'' the ''ring of scalars'' of ''M''.


Note: We can also define a right ''R''-module analogously by using a function &lt;math&gt;M\times R\to M\,:\, (m,r)\mapsto mr&lt;/math&gt;. In particular the third property then reads:
:&lt;math&gt;m(rs)=(mr)s&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the two notions coincide if ''R'' is a commutative ring, and in this case we can simply say that ''M'' is an ''R''-module.


'''Definition 2:''' Given any ring ''R'', we can define it's ''opposite ring'', &lt;math&gt;R^{\mathrm{op}}&lt;/math&gt;, having the same elements and addition operation as ''R'', but opposite multiplication. Their multiplication rules are related by &lt;math&gt;r\cdot s = sr&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast to group theory, there is no reason in general for a ring to be isomorphic to its opposite ring.


The obervant reader will have noticed that the scalar multiplication in a left ''R''-module ''M'' is simply a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, R\to \mathrm{End}(M)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;rm=\phi(r)(m)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;r\in R\,,\, m\in M&lt;/math&gt;. We leave it as an excercise to verify that the scalar multiplication in a right ''R''-module is a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi^\prime \,:\, R^{\mathrm{op}}\to \mathrm{End}(M)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus a right ''R''-module is simply a left ''R&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;''-module. As a consequence of this, all the results we will formulate for left ''R''-modules are automatically true for right ''R''-modules as well.
There are no assumptions that the module is unital, namely that 1m = m for all m in M.

== Examples of Modules ==


1. Any ring ''R'' is trivially an ''R''-module over itself. More interestingly, any left ideal ''I'' of ''R'' is also a left ''R''-module with the obvious scalar multiplication. In addition, if ''I'' is a two-sided ideal of ''R'', then the quotient ring &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is an ''R''-module with the induced scalar multiplication &lt;math&gt;r(s+I)=rs+I\,,\,(s+I)r=sr+I&lt;/math&gt;.


2. If ''R'' is a ring, then the set &lt;math&gt;M_{n,m}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n\times m&lt;/math&gt; matrices with entries in ''R'' is an ''R''-module under componentwise addition and scalar multiplication. More generally, for any set ''X'', the set &lt;math&gt;R^X&lt;/math&gt; of function from ''X'' to ''R'', with or without finite support, is an ''R''-module in an obvious way.


3. The ''k''-modules over a field ''k'' are simply the ''k''-vector spaces.


4. As was shown in the introduction of this chapter, any abelian group is a &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;-module in a natural way. (&quot;Natural&quot; here has a rigorous mathematical meaning which will be explained later.


5. Let ''S'' be a subring of a ring ''R''. Then ''R'' is an ''S''-module in a natural way. We can extend this as follows. Let S,R be rings and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,S\to R&lt;/math&gt; a ring homomorphism. Then ''R'' is an ''S''-module with scalar multiplication &lt;math&gt;sr=\phi(s)r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;rs=r\phi(s)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s\in S\,,\,r\in R&lt;/math&gt;.


6. Any matrix ring of a ring ''R'' is a ''R''-module under componentwise scalar multiplication.


7. Any polynomial ring of a ring ''R'' is an ''R''-module with the obvious scalar multiplication.


8. If ''S'' is a subring of a ring ''R'', then any left ''R''-module is also a left ''S''-module with the restricted scalar multiplication. We will treat this more generally later.

== Submodules ==

'''Definition 3: (Submodule)'''
:Given a left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a submodule of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a subset &lt;math&gt;N\subseteq M&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
:# N is a subgroup of M, and
:# for all &lt;math&gt;r\in R&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt; n \in N&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;rn\in N&lt;/math&gt;.

The second condition above states that submodules are closed under left multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;; it is implicit
that they inherit their multiplication from their containing module; &lt;math&gt;R \times N \to N&lt;/math&gt; must be the restriction of &lt;math&gt;R\times M \to M&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 4:''' Any module ''M'' is a submodule of itself, called the improper submodule, and the zero submodule consisting only of the additive identity of ''M'', called the trivial submodule.


'''Example 5:''' A left ideal ''I'' is a submodule of ''R'' viewed as an ''S''-module, where ''S'' is any (not neccesarily proper) subring of ''R''.


'''Lemma 6:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module. Then the following are equivalent.
: i) ''N'' is a submodule of ''M''
: ii) If &lt;math&gt;r_i\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_i\in N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i\in I=\{1,\dots,k\}\,,\,k\in\N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I}r_in_i\in N&lt;/math&gt;.
: iii) If &lt;math&gt;r_1,r_2\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2\in N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;r_1n_1+r_2n_2\in N&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': i) =&gt; iii): &lt;math&gt;r_1n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2n_2&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; by the second property, then &lt;math&gt;r_1n_1+r_2n_2\in N&lt;/math&gt; by the first property of Definition 3.

iii) =&gt; ii): Follows by induction on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

ii) =&gt; i): Let &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_1=1\,,\,r_2=-1&lt;/math&gt;, then for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2\in N&lt;/math&gt; be have &lt;math&gt;n_1-n_2\in N&lt;/math&gt;, proving &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup. Now let &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt;, then for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;r_1,n_1\in N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_1n_1\in N&lt;/math&gt;, proving property 2 in Definition 3. {{Unicode|∎}}

The lemma gives an alternative characterisation of submodules, and those sets closed onder linear combinations of elements.


Analogously to the case of vector spaces, we have ways of creating new subspaces from old ones. The rest of this subsection will be concerned with this.


'''Lemma 7:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module, and let ''N'' and ''L'' be submodules of ''M''. Then &lt;math&gt;N\cap L&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule in ''M'', and it is the largest submodule contained in both ''N'' in ''L''.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in N\cap L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r,s\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;ra+sb\in N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ra+sb\in L&lt;/math&gt; since ''N'' and ''L'' are submodules, so &lt;math&gt;ra+sb\in N\cap L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\cap L&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule of ''M''. Now, assume that ''S'' is a submodule of ''M'' contained in ''N'' and ''L''. Then any &lt;math&gt;a\in S&lt;/math&gt; must be in both ''N'' and ''L'' and therefore in &lt;math&gt;N\cap L&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq N\cap L&lt;/math&gt;, proving the lemma. {{Unicode|∎}}


Now, as the reader should expect at this point, given submodules ''N'' and ''L'' of ''M'', the union &lt;math&gt;N\cup L&lt;/math&gt; is in general not a submodule. In fact, we have the following lemma:


'''Lemma 8:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module and let ''N'' and ''L'' be submodules. Then &lt;math&gt;N\cup L&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule if and only if &lt;math&gt;L\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;N\subseteq L&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The left implication is obvious. For the right implication, assume &lt;math&gt;N\cup L&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule of ''M''. Then if &lt;math&gt;n\in N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l\in L&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n+l\in N\cup L&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;n+l\in M&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n+l\in L&lt;/math&gt;. Assume without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt;n+l\in N&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since ''N'' is a submodule, we must have &lt;math&gt;(n+l)-n=l\in N&lt;/math&gt;, proving &lt;math&gt;L\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 9:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module, and let &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; be submodules for &lt;math&gt;1\le i\le k\in\N&lt;/math&gt;. Then define their ''sum'', &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k N_i=\left\{ \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j \,:\, n_{j}\in N_{j}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.


Definition 9 has a straightforward extension to sums over arbitrary index sets. This definition is left for the reader to state. We will only need the finite case in this chapter.


'''Lemma 10:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module and let ''N'' and ''L'' be submodules. Then &lt;math&gt;N+L&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule of ''M'', and it is the smallest submodule containing both ''N'' and ''L''.

''Proof'': It is straightforward to see that &lt;math&gt;N+L&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule. To see that it is the smallest submodule containing both ''N'' and ''L'', let ''S'' be a submodule containing both ''N'' and ''L''. Then for any &lt;math&gt;n\in N\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l\in L\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;n+l\in S&lt;/math&gt;. But this the the same as saying that &lt;math&gt;N+L\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;, proving the lemma. {{Unicode|∎}}


With Lemma 7 and Lemma 10 established, we can state the main result of this subsection.


'''Definition 11:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module. Then let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of submodules ordered by set inclusion.


'''Lemma 12:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt; forms a lattice, the join of &lt;math&gt;N,L\in\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt; being given by &lt;math&gt;N\vee L=N+L&lt;/math&gt; and their meet by &lt;math&gt;N\wedge L=N\cap L&lt;/math&gt;. 

''Proof'': Most of the work is already done. All that remains is to check assosiativity, the absorption axioms and the idempotency axioms. The associativity is trivially satisfied, &lt;math&gt;A\cap (B\cap C)=(A\cap B)\cap C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A+B)+C=A+(B+C)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;A,B,C\in\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt;. As for absorption, We have to check &lt;math&gt;A+(B\cap A)=A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\cap (A+B)=A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, but this is also trivially true. Lastly, we obviously have &lt;math&gt;A+A=A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\cap A=A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, so we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 13:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is a modular lattice.

'''Note:''' Recall that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is modular if and only if whenever &lt;math&gt;A,B,C\in\mathcal{S}(M)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;A+(B\cap C)=(A+B)\cap C&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;a\in A\,,\, b\in B\,,\, c\in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a+b=c&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;a=c^\prime&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c^\prime\in C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;b\in C&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;b\in B\cap C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a+b\in A+(B\cap C)&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, we have &lt;math&gt;a+b\in A+B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a+b=c\in C&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;a+b\in (A+B)\cap C&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 14:''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module. A submodule ''N'' is called ''maximal'' if whenever ''L'' is a submodule satisfying &lt;math&gt;N\subseteq L\subseteq M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L=N&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L=M&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 15:''' Every submodule of a left ''R''-module is contained in a maximal submodule.

''Proof'': Let ''N'' be a submodule, and let &lt;math&gt;S=\{L\in\mathcal{S}(M)\,|\, N\subseteq L\subset M\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''S'' is a poset under set inclusion. Let &lt;math&gt;\{U_1,U_2,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; be a chain in ''S'', and note that &lt;math&gt;U=U_1+U_2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule containing each &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''U'' is an upper bound for the chain. Then, since each chain in ''S'' has an upper bound, by Zorn's Lemma ''S'' has a maximal element, ''P'', say. ''P'' is obviously an ideal containing ''N''. By the definition of ''S'', ''P'' is also a maximal submodule of ''M'', proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}

== Generating Modules ==

Given a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, we define the left submodule generated by &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the smallest submodule (w.r.t. set containment) of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;RA&lt;/math&gt; for a reason which will become clear in a moment.

The existence of such a submodule comes from the fact that an intersection of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules is again an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module: Consider the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of all submodules of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty. The intersection of the modules in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; clearly contains &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and is a submodule of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  Further, any submodule of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; also
contains the intersection. Thus &lt;math&gt;RA = \cap S&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is unitary, the elements of &lt;math&gt;RA&lt;/math&gt; have a simple description; 
:&lt;math&gt;RA = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n r_i a_i \mid n\in\N, r_i \in R, a_i \in A \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, every element of &lt;math&gt;RA&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a finite left linear combination of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
This equality can be justified by double inclusion: First, any submodule containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; must contain 
all left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-linear combinations of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; since modules are closed under addition and left multiplication
by elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;RA \supseteq \{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i a_i \mid n\in\N, r_i \in  R, a_i \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Secondly, the set of all such linear combinations forms a submodule of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (use &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_1 = 1_R&lt;/math&gt;) and hence it contains &lt;math&gt;RA&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generating Submodules by Ideals ==

Consider any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, left ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;, and left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
One can think of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; as a subring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (non-unitary when &lt;math&gt;I\ne R&lt;/math&gt;) and hence
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-module using the regular multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

If we consider the set &lt;math&gt;IM=\{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i m_i \mid n\in\N, r_i \in I, m_i \in M\}&lt;/math&gt; we obtain a submodule
of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. This follows from our discussion of generated submodules. However, since &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is not unitary,
it is not necessary that &lt;math&gt;IM=M&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus, we may consider the quotient module &lt;math&gt;M/IM&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly this is an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module but it is also an &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; module under the obvious action.

;Proposition: Given an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;module &lt;math&gt;M/IM&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt;-module with multiplication &lt;math&gt;(r+I)(m + IM) = rm + IM&lt;/math&gt;. 
;proof.
:To show that this is well defined, we observe that if &lt;math&gt;r + I = s+ I&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;r-s \in I&lt;/math&gt; and hence
::&lt;math&gt;(rm +IM) - (sm + IM) =  rm -sm +IM = (r-s)m + IM = 0 + IM&lt;/math&gt;
:since &lt;math&gt;(r-s)m \in IM&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
::&lt;math&gt;(r+I)(m+IM) = rm + IM = sm + IM = (s+I)(m+IM)&lt;/math&gt;
:which proves that the action of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M/IM&lt;/math&gt; is well defined. It follows now that &lt;math&gt;M/IM&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt;-module simply because it is an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module.

== Quotient Modules ==

Recall that any subgroup &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of an abelian group &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; allows one 
to construct an equivalence relation; for &lt;math&gt;m,m^\prime\in M&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;m \sim m^\prime \iff m-m^\prime \in N&lt;/math&gt;.
Cosets of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, equivalence classes under the relation above, can then be endowed with
a group structure, derived from the original group, and is given the name M/N. The sum of two cosets &lt;math&gt;m+N = [m]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;m^\prime+N = [m^\prime]&lt;/math&gt; is simply &lt;math&gt;(m + m^\prime) + N = [m+m^\prime]&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lemma 16''' Let ''M'' be a left ''R''-module and ''N'' be a submodule. Then ''M/N'', defined above, is a left ''R''-module.

''Proof:'' ''M/N'' is obviously an abelian group, so we just have to check that it has a well-defined ''R''-action. Let &lt;math&gt;r\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define &lt;math&gt;r(m+N)=rm+N&lt;/math&gt;. The distributivity and associativity properties of the action are inherited from ''M'', so we just need well-definedness. Let &lt;math&gt;m,m^\prime\in M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m-m^\prime \in N&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;r(m-m^\prime+N)=r(m-m^\prime) + N = N&lt;/math&gt; since ''N'' is a submodule, and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}

== Module Homomorphisms ==

Like all algebraic structures, we can define maps between modules that preserve their algebraic operations.

;Definition (Module Homomorphism)
:An &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:M\to N&lt;/math&gt; is a function from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
:#&lt;math&gt;\phi(m+m') = \phi(m) + \phi(m')&lt;/math&gt; (it is a group homomorphism), and
:#&lt;math&gt;\phi(rm) = r\phi(m).&lt;/math&gt;

When a map between two algebraic structures satisfies these two properties then it called an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-linear map. 

;Definition (Kernel, Image) 
:Given a module homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:M \to N&lt;/math&gt; the kernel of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the set
::&lt;math&gt;\ker \phi = \{m\in M \mid \phi(m) = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
:and the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the set
::&lt;math&gt;\phi(M) = \{n \in N \mid \exists m \in M, \phi(m) = n\} &lt;/math&gt;.

The kernel  of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the set of elements in the domain that are sent to zero by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
In fact, the kernel of any module homomorphism is a submodule of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. It is clearly a subgroup, from group theory, and
it is also closed under multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\phi(rm) = r\phi(m) = r(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for 
&lt;math&gt;m \in \ker \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, one can show that the image of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a submodule of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

Also I have started trying to make some big additions to this wikibook, but this is the first time I have ever contributed so please tell me if I do anything wrong.

I've moved all 5 pages to [[WB:NP]] friendly names... --[[User:Azertus|Azertus]] 23:00, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

== Illustrations needed ==

At a minimum, I suggest two illustrations for each conic, one showing the plane intersecting with the cone to form the conic, and another showing the conic straight on, with characteristic points (center, foci, vertex) and lines (axes, directrix, asymptotes) of the conic section denoted. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 02:38, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

== Revamping ==
I hate to be so assertive, but here's what I plan on doing in terms of structure:

Conic Sections Introduction: Just what it says. Connections to Flatland.

Types of Conic Sections &lt;br&gt;
General Conic Sections: Two equation formats (Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0 and (x-h)^2/A+y^2/B=1)&lt;br&gt;
The Circle&lt;br&gt;
The Ellipse&lt;br&gt;
The Parabola&lt;br&gt;
The Hyperbola&lt;br&gt;
Lines and Points: Unofficial Conic Sections: just to mention it.&lt;br&gt;

Features of Conic Sections&lt;br&gt;
Foci of Conic Sections: The foci, directrix, and defining conic sections in terms of that.&lt;br&gt;
Conic Sections as Loci: defining conic sections as loci. No axes involved.&lt;br&gt;
Eccentricity: Stuff about eccentricity. Identifying conic sections by eccentricity.&lt;br&gt;

Conic Sections as Algebraic Relations&lt;br&gt;
Intercepts of Conic Sections: finding x and y intercepts. How this can help graphing &lt;br&gt;
Translation of Axes: how the take the ABCDEF format and transpose the x and y axes&lt;br&gt;
Rotation of Axes: derivation of most things worth knowing about rotation&lt;br&gt;
Rotation of Axes (examples): examples on a ''seperate'' page&lt;br&gt;
Slopes of Conic Sections: Calculus stuff. Implicit derivation&lt;br&gt;

Concluding Remarks: applications of conic sections (parabolas as paths of objects under gravity, for example)&lt;br&gt;
Acknowledgements and Further Reading: Just that. Some sources contributors have found helpful.&lt;br&gt;

Just leave it be for a while. I'll at least establish the structure, and then some.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Naming Conventions==
Regarding titlecase: This runs counter to Wikipedia's [[w:Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)|naming convention]]. I think it is noteworthy that this titlecase convention was created, and enforced solely by, [[User:AlbertCahalan]]! (See also [[User talk:AlbertCahalan#Regarding really obscure names (on User talk:Geocachernemesis)]]). Since coming over from Wikipedia, I had been somewhat annoyed with the Cookbook's use of another convention, but I had assumed that it had been adopted through some sort of democratic process. Nope! It was imposed by fiat.

You can verify this easily by looking through the page histories. All calls for titlecase in [[Cookbook:Grunt Work|Grunt Work]], etc. were written by Albert, as are all those redirects. As far as I know, he never even made any argument for the change. 

:Since [[Cookbook:Grunt Work|Grunt Work]] was created by me (Albert) with many items, pointing out that I wrote one particular item is misleading. You make it sound as if I just tacked that item onto the page. It's one of 9 items I added, and was one of the 7 original items. You could equally well point out that all calls to stop spammers and vandals were made by me. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

What's the rationale behind Wikipedia's convention? Please read this: [[w:Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (capitalization)#Article titles]].
In short, it makes linking easier. --- [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 23:58, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:It was in use before I showed up, and rather common in fact. It was so common that I was rather jolted by finding a few pages without it, so naturally I fixed them to be consistent. It's funny that you should point out the Wikipedia rational, because it ''does not work'' here. That is, unless you suggest eliminating the &quot;Cookbook:&quot; prefix. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:15, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::It may work if the bug to create a proper &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace on wikibooks is fixed. That aside, it's not that great a rationale for a cookbook anyway since you'll not generally be looking for something uber-specific (unlike an encyclopedia where the thing you want to look up has an obvious name). Perhaps we should try to find a consensus among contributors about what the case ''should'' be, apart from what it is already, and if that is the wikipedia case, we can go ahead and change everything. That ''is'' within our powers. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:41, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Albert and I have discussed this issue at length, but we couldn't agree. I'm like PurplePieman, because I came over to Wikibooks from Wikipedia, and I found it confusing that the Cookbook appeared to be using several different capitalisation rules.

::: As it is, Wikibook's [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] doesn't propose any particular rules for capitalising book sub pages. But, I agree with Kellen, maybe we should try to come to a consensus (not just for the Cookbook, but for the whole of Wikibooks).

::: I agree with Wikibook's naming policy, in that we should use title caps or preferably title case for the titles of books. I would also prefer that we use Wikipedia's naming convention, of capitalising only the first letter and all proper nouns in the titles of sub pages of a book.

::: Note that simply by fully defining the capitalisation rules for Wikibooks, we are not saying that they need to be enforced immediately. We can do what has been done with the / and : page delimiters, they are recommended for all new Wikibooks, but it is highly recommended that existing books be changed to conform over time. I would be willing to invest my time to help the Cookbook conform, if I'm needed.

::: For the Cookbook, it is possible to argue that each sub page containing a recipe should also be titled in title case, because it is the title of the recipe (e.g., ''Toad in the Hole'', and not ''Toad in the hole''). I'm pretty neutral on that one, though it may cause confusion for some contributors. But, in my opinion, ingredients should never be in title case, only the proper nouns should be capitalised ( e.g., ''Brown sugar'', and not ''Brown Sugar''). What does everyone else think? [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
::::I not strongly for or against title case, but I am against a wikibooks wide standard. Wikibooks is standardized in a different way from Wikipedia, that is by book and not wiki-wide. This allows for greater flexibility in determining the appropriate layout for a certain book. If a book decides to go with chapter titles like &quot;Limits and Continuity&quot; title case might look better, whereas chapter like &quot;The repurcussions of the Bay-of-Pigs incident&quot; might look better in regular case (or whatever it's called). However, we should really have that discussion elsewhere. On the case of the cookbook, I think recipe titles like &quot;Vegetable Lasagne&quot; look better in title case, whereas ingredient titles, like &quot;Brown sugar&quot; do look better in regular case (it's sugar, not Dickens). Then again, using that as a rule might lead to an awful lot of grey areas where page are both recipe and ingredient (like the recent Italian Pasta). [[User:Risk|risk]] 06:50, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

::::: Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Cookbook will be getting it's own name space any time soon. So, it will continue to be part of Wikibooks. Wikibooks policy is currently being consolidated, and the aim seems to be to simplify existing policies and remove policies that differ needlessly from those of other Wikimedia projects. I understand why the Cookbook needs to differ from other books in certain ways, like using a certain layout template, etc. But being needlessly different from the rest of Wikibooks makes the jobs of administration more difficult, as they may need to learn a whole new set of guidelines for each book that they encountered in Wikibooks. When monitoring recent changes to Wikibooks, administrators have to be able to make quick decisions about what is correct, and what is not. I suppose that the main problem is that contributors tend to stick to their own books, and are not interested in Wikibooks as a whole. I would urge contributors to the Cookbook to make sure they contribute to the overall health of Wikibooks from time to time (you don't need to be an administrator to fight vandalism). [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:47, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::: Actually I think the namespace thing might happen [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1969 soon]. I'm not sure how to get a listing of the existing namespaces though (the &quot;extended&quot; ones, not the 0-15 standard ones). I like the idea of having per-book naming conventions, but this requires casual contributors to learn new rules for each book and requires dedicated contributors to form new rules for each book which seems rather haphazard. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:11, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::: Hopefully we get our own namespace soon, that would make things easier. As you say, rather haphazard, and there is always the danger that the contributors to the book can't agree.;) [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:14, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

== Some measurement templates ==

If you want to use these, or, even better, make them part of the main Cooking namespace, check these templates for shorthanding links to measurements. I made only the most basic ones. [[User:Jfingers88/Templates]]. [[User:Jfingers88|Jfingers88]] 00:32, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

== Seasonality Templates ==
I added the seasonality templates, but they got rv'd. Why was that? (I don't mind so much, but I figured this was the place for them). [[User:Risk|risk]] 13:14, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
: Ack sorry dude; that was very sloppy on my part. I saw in red: '''navigationasfdasdf''' and figured you'd accidentally submitted, but didn't do a close look at the rest. I've fixed it now. Sorry again. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:46, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

==Default sort key==
I thought I'd bring up the new &lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORT:foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; key. This new feature can be used when categorizing pages in the cookbook. In the example above, any page with the default sort key set to ''foo'' would appear in each category as if each category was pipe-tricked to sort by ''foo''. For example:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Chocolate recipes|Chocolate Chip Cookies]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Cookie recipes|Chocolate Chip Cookies]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Easy recipes|Chocolate Chip Cookies]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

could be replaced with:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORT:Chocolate Chip Cookies}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Chocolate recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Cookie recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Easy recipes]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Going forward, this could save some time for editors categorizing pages here. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORT:{{PAGENAME}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; ? They should fix this on the category pages. Bleh. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Measurement ==
I just came to the Cookbook site looking for some recipes and found that the ones I read were, effectively, nearly useless because lots of measurements were given in &quot;cups&quot; without any attempt to disambiguate US or Imperial cups (the same problem as with pints). Sure 20% may not seem a large margin of error, but in a sense why bother giving measurements at all if they can't be given correctly. I'm guessing that most contributors are from the US so the measurements are _probably_ US cups, but could there be a convention about this please? [[User:Francis Davey|Francis Davey]] ([[User talk:Francis Davey|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Francis Davey|contribs]]) 17:16, 5 March 2011 (UTC)

:I would agree that the majority of the time &quot;cups&quot; will refer to the US version.  Most of the other readers will contribute using metric units instead.  Unfortunately there are few contributors to the Cookbook so I'm not sure that there will be much feedback.  If you post a notice at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]] we could get more attention to the issue on this page.  I have no problem with defining some standards on this page.  There would be a problem in not knowing for sure what the original contributors were intending with their &quot;cups&quot;.  If there are metric units as well, we can probably work backwards from those to determine which &quot;cup&quot; is the actual one intended, then change the &quot;cup&quot; to the one defined in the standard we formulate on this page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:41, 5 March 2011 (UTC)

::Most folks who contribute probably don't think much outside the system they've learned. Another possibility would be to convert wiki recipes to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage formula percentage] (which would first require density calculations to assign missing weights to each volumetric ingredient), to analyze the recipe, but determining outliers (the ~20% error Francis Davey mentioned) would either require several similar recipes to compare against or knowledge of the correct range of values that would be typical.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=XqKF7PqV02cC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Figoni's Table 1.5], gives a formula &quot;baker's percentage&quot; for a date filling which has no flour at all (but that later seems to go into a baked product).  Figoni also says, &quot;For baked custard, each ingredient is expressed relative to the dairy ingredients---milk and cream.&quot;  According to algebraic substitution, any recipe's ingredient or ingredient combinations could arbitrarily be assigned the 100% figure typically used for the &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=6Cox1IpjqU0C&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false flour mass]&quot; in a baker's percentage.  Consider a hypothetical fresh salsa formula, (no flour, just tomatoes, onions, cilantro, chili peppers, fresh garlic, lime juice, and salt) where the 100% ingredient substitution could be &quot;chopped tomato mass = flour mass&quot; and all other ingredient masses are handled in the normal baker's percentage way. Tomatoes are of varying weights, some large and some small, so once the tomatoes are chopped (there is no need for 1/2 a tomato remainder as might happen with a weight based formula), as the 100% ingredient, that weight (mass) is used to calculate the remaining ingredient weights, and the salsa is more consistent from batch to batch whether made from large tomatoes or smaller ones. Wiki cookbooks could be on the leading edge of cookbook publishing if all recipe's ingredients eventually had one column for formula percentage, a separate second column for weight measure, and a third for volumetric measure. Volume measurements are good for speed, weights are good for accuracy, and baker's and formula percentages are good for comparison and analysis, recipe design, and scaling ingredient weights for either slightly or largely different batch sizes. It's just something to muse. [[User:Gzuufy|Gzuufy]] ([[User talk:Gzuufy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gzuufy|contribs]]) 21:56, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

:::Goodness, I can tell you've put a lot of thought into that.  I can really only invite you to dive in as I don't do much cooking from recipes, much less think I'd be able to get a handle on that system you describe. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

::::The analysis is somewhat time consuming, but it's not that hard.  Anyway, I took the plunge and decided to analyze one recipe.  The analysis is currently posted on my talk page section titled by the cookbook's recipe name, and seems to support Frances Davey's observation regarding cup variances, particularly with regard to flour weight in a bread recipe.  When flour weight can be measured accurately, the spreadsheet model shows that variances from other ingredients that lack other severe instructional ambiguities decreases to less than 1% (though I haven't illustrated this point in the analysis).  This is why folks like myself cannot use volume-based recipes, and I'm in the U.S. where they are endemic. I'd be interested in any comments anyone might have regarding the analysis, particularly whether it would be of any value posted on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Whole-Wheat_Bread recipe page it was derived from], along with any changes it may need. [[User:Gzuufy|Gzuufy]] ([[User talk:Gzuufy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gzuufy|contribs]]) 06:24, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

:::::According to the recipe template documentation:
::::::&quot;*/ Quantities should be listed in whichever system (imperial or metric) the recipe was created in, with the other system's equivalent values listed immediately after, in &quot;()&quot;.  This lets users know which units are &quot;original&quot; and which are estimated conversions. Always provide volume measurements. In some countries, kitchens are simply not equipped to measure by mass or weight. (yes, they lack a balance or scale) Do not specify the size of normal chicken eggs; &quot;Large&quot; in the USA is similar to &quot;size M&quot; (not size L) in the EU, and other countries will surely have their own ideas as well. /*&quot;
:::::&lt;s&gt;So, I think it's safe to assume that if you see a &quot;cup&quot;, it's imperial&lt;/s&gt;. My question is about giving equivalents.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis.

And why not use this template? It'd previous name, Template:Foreword, made it appear like it was an official template to use. It has since been applied to many books, where the message itself was inappropriate for the book. It's wording also serves to discourage contributors.

As of this writing, this template is only used by a book that is going to be deleted anyway. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:04, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

The example of a word that appears to be masculine while being feminine (la photo) is not a good choice, because photo is the abbreviated form of «photographie», which is feminine like all words ending in «ie». &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:70.48.92.222|70.48.92.222]] ([[User talk:70.48.92.222|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.48.92.222|contribs]]) 05:05, 14 August 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Beau and sympa ==

Somebody corrected &quot;nice&quot;to be &quot;sympa&quot; instead of &quot;beau&quot;.

This made the text not match the audio lesson, so I changed it back, and made nice &quot;handsome&quot; so it won't get changed back, as I am sure that both are accurate definitions.

I think it's important that the text match the audio- the reason I played the audio was to try to correct my pronounciation of &quot;sympa&quot;.

== Un chaton ==
We should put &quot;chat&quot; instead of &quot;chaton&quot;...

== Liaison ==
In '''English''' it's spelled with one &quot;i&quot; (Liaison) and NOT with two i's (''Liaiison'', which is French)

==le/les==

These are pronounced differently, because it's required to determine plurality/singularity of a noun. But I was under impression that &quot;s&quot; at the end of the word doesn't affect pronunciation. Is this an exception to the rule? I suppose &quot;mes&quot; is also pronounced like &quot;les&quot;. Also I said &quot;le jus d'orange&quot; to a flight attendant and he thought I wanted two, so apparently he thought I said &quot;les&quot;. I think it's pretty lame of a language to not clearly express such a difference. Also ''au-dessus''/''au-dessous'', why did anyone thought it is a good idea? But I digress. I should've probably said &quot;un jus&quot;, because it is indefinite, but maybe I wanted a specific one? [[User:Grue|Grue]] ([[User talk:Grue|talk]]) 10:03, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

== Chat/Chatte ==

The feminine form of cat in French &quot;chatte&quot; is never used, because it is a slang term for the vagina (I'm sure you know which one I mean).  Somebody might want to think about using a different example.

== Mistake? ==

Talking about ''il y a'': &quot;It is important to remember that verb stays as a form of be and not have.&quot; - isn't that supposed to be the other way around?</text>

The exact date when Aboriginal people arrived in Australia from Asia is contested, however it is widely regarded to have been somewhere between 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. Evidence of settlement from 40,000 years ago has been confirmed.  Tasmania was first inhabited by the Tasmanian Aborigines. Evidence indicates their presence in the region, later to become an island, at least 35,000 years ago. Rising sea levels cut Tasmania off from mainland Australia about 10,000 years ago.

Captain Cook was the first European recorded to have contact with the East coast of Australia.

I haven't written anything about integral balances (analysis of degrees of freedom, split conditions, etc. etc.) here.

'''Breakfast Waffles''' - These basic breakfast waffles are simple and predictable to make.  The batter can be made in about 15 minutes, so they are suitable as a last-minute addition to a breakfast.  They are made fluffy by beating the egg whites separately and folding them in as the last step.

*1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1/2 lb (approx. 1 3/4 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Mix|Mix]] egg yolks and milk. 
#Add flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and [[Cookbook:Mixing|mix well]]. 
#Add the oil. 
#[[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] the egg whites until stiff and then [[Cookbook:Fold|fold]] into the batter.

It would be great to have some pronounciation .mp3's here :D
: yes, please do that if you find that it would be great :) --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 01:13, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

The game of go is usually called いご（囲碁）in Japanese, not just ご (碁）.  I recommend changing the vocab list.  [[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 05:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

: OK --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

== Choice of Vocab ==

I changed quite a few of the words (and incidentally found several errors, which I fixed). Here's how I chose the vocab: 
*kept the number of words the same (I hope)

: you can change the word count, but ANY changes here must be ported back to the hiragana lists at once. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

*kept words for every hiragana symbol (although I'm tempted to delete にょうかん (court lady) which seems like a silly word to learn.

: court lady is an extremelysilly word to learn, but I have not able to find any other words that could replace it... --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

*focussed on having lots of nouns and adjectives from the JLPT Level 4 list. These will be the most useful for simple sentences. 
*made sure adjectives came in pairs (hot-cold, strong-weak, big-small, etc)
*eliminated some words that I thought would not be productive vocabulary at first
**not JLPT4: せっぷく(ritual disembowelment)、ち(blood)、りゅう(dragon)、（い）ご(go)、ぜん(Zen)、etc. 

:: these were not taken out of nowhere... perhaps, we were unable to find any good JLPT4 words... but these are pretty popular and good words to know, please put at least some of them back :) --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

**JLPT4 but not good to memorize out of context: ああ(ah, oh, yes)、しかし(however)、おなじ(same)、etc

:: maybe... --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

To do:
*Fix word order (alphabetization). Sometimes it was wrong, especially the voiced sounds.

: yes they might have gone out of sync --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

*Further revisions? Reversions?

: the thing is that this course is created for the Latvian otaku society to be used right now. Please note that reason for me to be hesitant to change something as the course is used by real persons, and if something changes, I need to notify them so that they could go back and recheck everything. What I did just yesterday, was to change the links I give when I release the pages (friday evening or saturday noon) to point to the revisions I approve. But thanks to you (many thanks for helping us!) I might make it a tradition to do a second release (bugfix release) a week after the first release of any page. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 10:20, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

*Make sure hiragana pages agree with new word lists.

-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 07:47, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

Is all of the vocab supposed to be on the hiragana pages? I just noticed that the hiragana pages don't even have all the vocab from the previous vocab list. :Example: あたらしい

: look at the ra group :) --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 07:40, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

So the audience for the English language wikibook on Japanese is the &quot;Latvian otaku society&quot;? Well, at least it's defined now. That also explains some of the special-interest word choices. -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 01:22, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

: Yes, there were some discussions about my decision to work on English language wikibook. The motivation was to create a course useful to other people, not just to the Latvian otaku society. The reason I pointed that out is that these people are learning from the course right now, it is not like creating a paper book which will be used only when complete, but rather like TV lessons that people are going through as they are appearing. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 07:40, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

::I apologize for any discontinuities that my editing introduces. However, I would suggest that on balance it's worth it. New vocab will have be introduced along the way anyway, so any missing vocab can be introduced then. [[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 11:55, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

::: It is better to have inconsistent editing, than none at all, and you are surely doing a good job correting our mistakes and improving the lessons. The local team working on the lessons had similar problems when working on their first pages, they've learned quickly, so will you, I hope. But as there is undoubtable difference in effectiveness of communication between local teamwork and discussions in the pages like this, that is why I kindly ask you to signup for Skype to fill the gap in communication. Another option would be taking out our discussions about the course to the japanese-wiki list (oh, just noticed that that you did join the list... I am sorry, seems that I had some troubles with my email filters so I did not notice your email, I will answer it later...). One thing though I wanted to state clear: the list and many of its members were actually originally working on another course (lets call it &quot;the original course&quot;); the course called &quot;The New Thread&quot; is a project I have started separately from the original course for the members of local otaku forum, and placed in this wiki so that wider community could benefit from and contribute to it. Now some of the original team are improving the new thread course, but the thing is, there are inconsistencies between conventions and guidelines of the original course and the new thread course. In your email you have pointed out ove of such, namely the pitch accent indication. It might have been a good intention to get it into the original course thread, but the new thread states clearly that &quot;There will be no attempts to indicate pitch in this course&quot; (from the introduction page). If you find any references to pitch accent in the new thread course, please report that to me, or delete them yourself. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

: Ah, yeah, ToothingLummox, why do you whing the romaji was missing on some of the earlier pages? It was not. Also I do not understand the motivation of changing, for example, onna to onnanoko and some other words. Do you want me to revert some of your changes? I have my reasons of making things as they are here because of the vision of how the course will be progress in future. We need to cooperate more closely, and discuss all the changes. Is it possible to reach you through Skype? --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 07:59, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Sorry about the romaji. On the あ and か pages I filled it in for all the words before I realized romaji was only being added for words containing unknown hiragana. On the other pages I supplied it only when it really was missing. I didn't replace おんな in the word list, but you're right, it seems to have disappeared from the あ hiragana page. Oops. Also, I was wondering whether you're planning to use おんなのひと when you get around to it, since it is more appropriate in normal neutral-polite conversation than just おんな. I noticed that it didn't make the word list, even though it could be formed from おんな and ひと. 

::I don't have skype, but I suppose I could get it if it becomes necessary. Do you have a syllabus or something? I've read the course outline but it's pretty vague. What exactly will be in the &quot;basic structures&quot; lessons (I did look at the unfinished lessons)?

::: The basic structure list is not ready yet. I will try to form some kind of preliminary list soon. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:: The order in which the verbs are being taught seems to imply that we won't have any negative sentences (based on 未然形) for a very long time. And so many important constructions (like anything requiring an auxiliary verb and probably the past tense) won't be available until the students learn 〜て in the advanced section!

::: It is supposed to be so. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::Or take the 連用形 verb section. My understanding is that the 連用形 is just a base form of the verb. Which endings, if any, are you teaching? 〜ます? 〜たい? 〜はじめる？

::: There will not be many things told in the rentaikei section. Most probably, as we are already using it, there will only be a few sentences about it. Endings that require different verb form from rentaikei will not be mentioned in that section. The good example you have is ~masu, which will appear first in renyoukei section. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::::I was asking about the renyoukei, not the rentaikei.  -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 06:09, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::::: Oh, sorry. It will be explained that it is used for ~masu, ~tai, ~te (possibly, that form may be explained there), ~ta and word combinations (that includes the ~hajimeru). You don't have to think whether there will be a particular ending - the course is to go as deep as possible, so if something can be explained, it probably should be explained. And if something could have been explained but it is not, please report that, or add the information yourself. As the guidelines say, the course is not a fast way to learn the language, but rather a long one. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 11:09, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::: ~te is also often explained from the rentaikei, and it could also be explained from the imperative, or for that matter, from just about ''any'' form. I understand that the course is &quot;deep&quot; as opposed to &quot;horizontal&quot; (I'm not sure that &quot;deep&quot; is a good idea), but there are still choices about when and how to introduce material. Have you thought about the dependencies? What needs to precede what?

::::::: yes, i have thought that dependencies will appear somedey :) ... I am still not sure whether to put that te form (you may see in the outline that it is placed after other verb forms; but here I just told you I want it in renyoukei). The motvation to put it in the renyoukei section is that it is formed from that form... I know I stopped on the basic structures page and I need to make a detailed planning further... will try to do that ASAP. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 14:02, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::::I don't think -te should be taught from the renyoukei just because  &quot;it is formed from that form&quot; historically. The sound changes are pretty severe. A good reason to teach it from renyoukei is that the students already know -masu and will use mixed -te and -masu sentences before learning rentaikei. A good reason to teach it from rentaikei is that that rentaikei is the form that appears in dictionaries- in other words, rentaikei is going to end up being the base form that students use most often. Another good reason to teach it from rentaikei is that -te and -ta (past tense) are basically the same. -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 07:19, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::::::I don't know much on the subject, but perhaps we should teach a few words from renyoukei and show how they are related to rentaikei. We can then teach the rentaikei for for the remainder of the lessons. Sorry if this isn't possible or makes no sense; like I said, I don't know much on the subjec :) &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 16:59, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::I think perhaps you and I are on slightly different wavelengths here. I have two books here (the popular ''A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar'' and ''A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar'') which contain nothing but grammar explanation- some 1300 pages of it.  Exactly how detailed are you planning to get? -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 12:29, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::: I know several books on Russian, English and some other languages that are about that half long, but my understanding is that these books are mostly watery explanations on something should be understood intuitively. The things like, for example, ~hajimeru verb ending should not be explained separately - they need to be understood intuitively based on general principles of language. Just now you probably think I contradict myself... I am not. The course should not be converted to a 1300 page long grammar reference book (or more... you don't have &quot;a dictionary of advanced japanese grammar&quot;... :) ) because (a) nobody would read it and (b) I believe many concepts may be explained differently from how they are usually explained. It should answer the question &quot;why?&quot;, not just list everything possible. I will think of better explanation later... I need the explanation myself :) --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 14:02, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::And is there any intention to teach communicative (as opposed to grammatical skills) like requesting, suggesting, asking, arguing, inviting, praising, or getting someone to repeat themselves? Spoken contractions? Or what about situational skills, like making phone calls and ordering food?

::: If possible, no exceptions will be made to the sequentiality of the course. Communicative skills will only be given at the end of the grammar course, in the advanced section (or maybe additional section will be added after it). The course outline is not at all predefined for the rest of our lives, but rather my first iteration. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::Given the order in which things are listed, it's not clear to me how anyone is going to be able to practice what they've learned. Especially when they seem to be given way too much information at the same time.

::: It must be possible for an average student to keep up with the course timeline. Any event of the course giving more information than may be understood should be pointed out and resolved. As for examples, the number of them will increase in time, as we will have something to give examples for at the learners' current level of understanding the language. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

::::It is very difficult (even for the students themselves) to judge whether they have been able to absorb the material. I have no doubt that they can read through a page or two of explanation every week, but have they really learned it? Have they gained any kind of fluency? For example, they have been given a lot of vocab, but have little opportunity to use it. Most of it isn't being used in the lessons.  Nor are most of the honorifics. Nor most of the ko-so-a-do pronouns.  Of course, the students can always relearn the info when they need it. But doesn't that defeat the purpose? Meanwhile important structures are avoided. I suspect that the &quot;deep&quot; format of the course is in fundamentally in conflict with what the learner needs when learning a language.
:::::Information overload?
:::::*the variety of ko-so-a-do pronouns. They should at least be separated as the honorifics were into &quot;learn now&quot; and &quot;learn later.&quot;
:::::*the use of ko-so-a-do pronouns in discourse
:::::*the variety of honorifics, and especially the amount of detail given.
:::::*the many uses of various particles. And the more complete the explanation, the less useful the lesson becomes.
::::-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 06:09, 29 August 2005 (UTC)
::What do the students hope to do with Japanese anyway? Read manga? Watch movies? Get kanji tattoos without embarassing themselves?

::: If they want to do the last, the have found a wrong course. As for the ultimate goal of the course, it is for students to be able to communicate freely. And that also include to be able to watch movies (including historical ones) and anime. And just to put things straight, preparing students to pass JLPT level 1 is not the goal of the course. It is pointed in the guidelines as an outcome, but not a goal. If necessary, topics that are not required for passing JLPT1 will be included here without hesitation. One old discussion even accused me in trying to make a kokugaku course... :) --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:::: I've already read it (and edited it, too. Nothing is sacred!), but it's pretty vague. The lesson outline doesn't have enough detail. - [[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 14:29, 27 August 2005 (UTC)



:: You should ALWAYS have the romaji word right after the katakana/hiragana/kanji so the reader can be sure they are reading and pronouncing correctly. Learners of japanese have to practice sounding out and reading japanese just like we learned english in first grade by sounding out and reading the letters. This will help our reading proficiency by knowing that we are reading japanese correctly.

Regarding communication, it would be a good choice to use the mailing list whenever possible to discuss stuff like this. It's much more readable for long discussions like this and their are searchable archives that are very beneficial to new users who want to start contributing to this wikibook. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 19:47, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

== parts of speech ==

I just discovered that I miss the information about what part of speech each of these words is. I was trying to make up some examples, and noticed that there is no way students will differentiate between nouns like &quot;kirei&quot; and adjectives like &quot;ookii&quot;. What do you think about this? Can somebody add this info here if you agree it is really needed? Or I am just a baka gaijin who fools himself into thinking that it is important? --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 16:35, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

:I don't think we want to add parts of speech info to every word on vocab lists. The part of speech is usually obvious from the English word anyway. Some books add（な）after na-adjectives like ''kirei'' (it's not really a noun). I think that works pretty well.

:きれい（な）　　　　　pretty, clean

:It's a little problematic for words like ''baka'' which are both nouns and na-adjectives. If you only want to use it as a noun, then don't add（な）.

:Another solution is to separate vocab lists into different parts of speech, in other words have separate i-adjective, na-adjective, noun, etc. lists.

:I also think that words like ''ue'' and ''naka'' are difficult. They are nouns in Japanese but resemble English prepositions. You could change them to 〜のうえに, I would probably just remove them from the vocab list and instead introduce them when teaching ''aru''. Maybe we should create a small dictionary, separate from vocab lists, with all the words from all the lessons? A dictionary could contain more complete part of speech info.

:I think a basic problem is that the students have been asked to memorize a lot of vocab that they don't know how to use.  We could get away with it if we stuck to 〜''masu'' and 〜''desu'', but even that is not a terriffic solution. I don't think that asking the students to memorize vocab from the hiragana lessons was a good idea.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Rhea true color.jpg|thumb|right|Image of Rhea from the Cassini spacecraft]]

==How big is Rhea?==
Rhea is 1530 km in diameter (the distance from one side to the other through the center). Rhea is relatively large when compared with the moons of other planets in the Solar System.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Rhea is heavily cratered and has bright wispy markings on its surface. The surface can be divided into two categories. The first area contains craters which are more than 40 km wide, while the second area contains craters smaller than this.

The '''leading hemisphere''' is heavily cratered and is the same brightness throughout. As on Callisto, the craters are eroded. On the trailing hemisphere there are bright swaths on a dark background and few visible craters. These bright swaths may be material from ice volcanoes early in Rhea's history when it was still liquid inside. However, recent observations of Dione, which has the same bright streaks, shows that these are in fact ice cliffs. Therefore, it can be assumed that the bright streaks on the Rhean surface are also ice cliffs. When Cassini does its flyby of Rhea on  November 25, 2005, we will know for sure.
 
==How long is a day on Rhea?==
One day on Rhea is equal to four and a half days on Earth.

==How long is its orbit around Saturn?==
One orbit around Saturn also takes four and a half days. Rhea has '''synchronous rotation''', meaning that it takes the same amount of time for it to complete one orbit as it does to complete one rotation on its axis. This also means that the same side of Rhea always faces Saturn.

==What is it made of?==
One third of Rhea's mass is rock, found at its core. The rest is water ice.
 
==How much would Rhea's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on Rhea's surface, you would weigh less than you would on Pluto &amp;mdash; which is about 6% of what you do on Earth.

==Who is it named after?==
Rhea is named after a Titaness in Greek mythology. The name was suggested by astromoner William Herschel in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'', in which he suggested the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Cronos (the Greek Saturn), be used. Before that, it, Tethys, Dione, and Iapetus were called ''Sidera Lodoicea'' (&quot;the stars of Louis&quot;) to honour king Louis XIV.

==How was it discovered?==
Rhea was discovered by Giovanni Cassini on December 23, 1672.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types of Abacus ==

There are many sorts of abacuses from different times and places. In modern times, the ones most used are:
* The Chinese abacus, the ''suanpan''. It may have 7, 9, 11 or 13 rods. Each column has 2 upper beads (''quinary'') and 5 lower beads (''unary''), separated by a bar passing through the abacus.
* The Japanese abacus, the ''soroban''. 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 or 31 rods. 1 quinary and 5 unary beads. Reference point.
* The modern soroban (since 1922, gaining popularity from 1945 onward). 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 or 31 rods. 1 quinary and 4 unary beads. Reference point.

[[Image:Sorobansm1.jpg]]

The above is a Japanese Soroban with a zeroing mechanism. By pressing the button two levers push the top beads up, and the other beads down, resetting the abacus.


The reference points allow the user to choose one rod as the base rod that counts mutiples of one. This is very useful when calculating with decimal numbers or with numbers that end with zero.

This course uses the modern soroban with as many rods as necessary for the examples.

== Unary and Quinary Beads and Activation ==

The unary beads are the lower beads, and they represent one unit each. The quinary beads are the upper beads, and represent five units each. Beads are counted when they are pushed to the central bar and are then said to be ''activated''.

== Representing Numbers ==

The numbers from 0 to 9 are represented as follows:
==== Soroban ====
&lt;pre&gt;
0:  OOOO-|-O
1:  OOO-O|-O
2:  OO-OO|-O
3:  O-OOO|-O
4:  -OOOO|-O
5:  OOOO-|O-
6:  OOO-O|O-
7:  OO-OO|O-
8:  O-OOO|O-
9:  -OOOO|O-
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== Suanpan ====
&lt;pre&gt;
0: 00000-|-00
1: 0000-0|-00
2: 000-00|-00
3: 00-000|-00
4: 0-0000|-00
5: 00000-|0-0
6: 0000-0|0-0
7: 000-00|0-0
8: 00-000|0-0
9: 0-0000|0-0
A: 00000-|00-
B: 0000-0|00-
C: 000-00|00-
D: 00-000|00-
E: 0-0000|00-

Hi there.

I see you have reverted my efforts to make this book conform to our [[WB:NP|naming policy]]. Is there some reason why you think that this policy should not apply to you? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:29, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm very sorry. I am quite confused about naming policies, and I chose the hyphen system because it looks better than the slash. When I saw it had been changed I thought I must have made it that way in the beginning, and I corrected it. However, when making your changes you left one page with the other system, so it had to be changed for consistency. My apologies. - 216.187.106.148; 22 August 2005</text>

[[w:David_A._Kolb|Kolb]]'s learning theory hypothesizes that there are 4 major learning styles: activist, reflector, theorist and pragmatist.  Each style means that individuals have a preferred way of learning.

An activist prefers to learn by doing - getting involved in activities in a hands-on way.
A reflector learns best by thinking about actions and considering questions that have been posed.
A theorist is a person who prefers to learn by considering ideas, concepts, models and theories.
A pragmatist learns best by considering how an idea, concept, or experience would work best when applied in a new or different situation.

==CONJUGARE - CONJUGATION==

Four conjugations, according to the different terminations of the verbs:

First conjugation, with &quot;-a&quot; as a termination in the infinitive: There are two ways of conjugating verbs of this type, and there is no way of telling by looking at the infinitive which one it will be (it just needs to be memorized).

first way (shorter conjugation)
a cânta - to sing

**eu cânt - I sing
**tu cânţi - you sing
**el/ea cântă - he/she/it sings
**noi cântăm - we sing
**voi cântaţi - you (pl) sing
**ei/ele cântă - they sing

second way (longer conjugation) 

a lucra - to work

**eu lucrez - I work
**tu lucrezi - you work
**el/ea lucrează - he/she/it works
**noi lucrăm - we work
**voi lucraţi - you work
**ei/ele lucrează - they work

Second conjugation, with &quot;-ea&quot; as a termination in the infinitive: a tăcea - to be silent

**eu tac - I am silent
**tu taci - you are silent
**el/ea tace- he/she/it is silent
**noi tăcem - we are silent
**voi tăceţi - you (pl) are silent

Third conjugation, with &quot;-e&quot; as a termination in the infinitive: a merge - to go

**eu merg - I go
**tu mergi - you go
**el/ea merge - he/she/it goes
**noi mergem - we go
**voi mergeţi - you go
**ei/ele merg - they go

Fourth conjugation, with &quot;-i&quot; as a termination in the infinitive: There are also two different ways to conjugate verbs of this type, and once again, there is no way to ''a priori'' tell which one to use. One must learn which pattern a particular verb uses (although one does get a &quot;feel&quot; for it after a while).

First way (shorter conjugation)

**eu fug - I run
**tu fugi - you run
**el/ea fuge - he/she/it runs

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jet propulsion had its beginnings in the turbo superchargers devised by Dr. Sanford Moss in 1918. These were used to improve the performance of reciprocating engines at high altitudes.

Frank Whittle received the patent in 1930 for a jet engine. Hans von Ohain received the German patent in 1935. The first jet aircraft was the [[wikipedia:Heinkel He 178|Heinkel He 178]] flown in 1939 with a von Ohain engine producing 4.9kN of thrust.

The first American jet was the [[wikipedia:P-59 Airacomet|Bell P-59 Airacomet]] flown in 1942.

The first combat jet was the Gloster Meteor which entered service with 616 Squadron Royal Air Force in May 1944. They were initially deployed against V1 flying bombs and specifically prohibed from flying over Germany. The germans also had a jet fighter in operational service before the end of the war the [[wikipedia:Messerschmitt Me 262|Messerschmitt Me 262]]. A large number of these were built toward the end of the war but supply of engines was so limited that less than 30 were in service at any one time.

The first American civil jet engine was the [[wikipedia:General Electric J47|General Electric J47]] certified in 1949. The first civil jet aircraft was the [[wikipedia:De Havilland Comet|De Havilland Comet]] flown in 1949. Three of the nine initially built exploded because of fatigue problems in the pressurised fuselage.

The first civil American jet was the [[wikipedia:Boeing_707|Boeing 707]] flown in 1954, powered by the [[wikipedia:Pratt_%26_Whitney_JT3C|JT3C]] turbojet.

The first high bypass turbofan was the [[wikipedia:General Electric TF39|General Electric TF39]] used on the [[wikipedia:Lockheed C-5a|Lockheed C-5A]] which first flew in 1968 and paved the way for the engines used in the 747 and other widebody aircraft in use today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Engines are certified to deliver standard thrusts depending upon flight conditions. Thrust is typically measured in kN or lbs.  A 'rating' is a predefined power setting that the pilot can select which may be appropriate for particular flight conditions.  Rating terminology differs between civil and military aircraft, reflecting the different requirements of these types of aviation.

==Civil Aircraft Ratings==
The following ratings are typical of commercial airliners.  The aircraft/engine manufacturer will have to declare two principal ratings to the [[:Wikipedia:aircraft certification|certifying authorities]], since these define the safe limits of operation of the engine/aircraft - these are the Maximum Take-Off (MTO) rating, and the Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT or MCN) rating.

===Maximum Takeoff thrust(MTO)===

This is the maximum thrust that the engine can deliver for 5 minutes in the take-off envelope of the aircraft. Peak thrust is usually achieved when the engine is static, however the most demanding condition for a modern turbofan engine is end-of-runway or lift-off conditions, typically at about 0.25Mn.  This condition usually generates the highest stresses and temperatures in the engine, hence use of this rating is only permitted for up to 5 minutes of operation.  

It is used, as the name suggests, for take-off when the aircraft is at its heaviest and has to be accelerated to take-off speed in a finite runway distance.  The higher the thrust available from the engine, the shorter the runway can be, or the greater the aircraft payload can be.  This affects which airports an aircraft can be operated from, and the economics of operation.  As an alternative to payload, a higher thrust rating allows more fuel load to be carried into the air, so extending range of operation.  These trade-offs between available thrust, runway length, aircraft weight and range may need to be assessed for each flight, and is part of a commercial pilots preparation prior to take-off.  An aircraft may take-off with less than maximum take-off thrust to reduce wear on the engine and extend its life.  This is usually termed a 'reduced thrust' take-off, and is used to reduce engine maintenance costs.

It is a condition of certification that an aircraft should be able to take-off if one engine fails at the most critical point in the take-off run, when it is going too fast to be able to come to a safe stop in the remaining runway.  In the case of twin engine aircraft, they have to be capable of taking off on one engine, so that in normal operation 'de-rate' is usually applied as an excess of thrust is available.

If an engine exceeds its 'redline' speeds or temperatures when running at MTO thrust, it is no longer considered airworthy.

Sometimes referred to as 'TOGA' thrust, short for take-off/go-around.

===Maximum Continuous thrust (MCT)===

Outside the MTO [[wikipedia:flight envelope|flight envelope]], the MCT rating defines the maximum thrust that can be demanded by the pilot from the engine.  As such, it has particular significance with respect to engine failure in flight, as the aircraft will have to proceed to its destination or nearest diversion airport at max continuous thrust.  If the engine cannot achieve this thrust level whilst staying within it operating limits for engine speed and temperature, (the 'amber line'), it is no longer considered airworthy.

===Maximum Climb thrust (MCL)===

This is the thrust rating the manufacturer recommends be used during the climb phase of a typical flight.  It may be the same as max continuous thrust, and usually is for a three or four engined aircraft.  The top of the climb phase is typically the most challenging condition for a turbofan engine outside the take-off regime, and is a critical design requirement.  De-rate can be applied to MCL thrust to extend engine life, but at the cost of a slower time to climb and slightly increased trip fuel consumption.

===Maximum Cruise thrust (MCR)===

Sometimes defined, but not a particularly useful rating since in cruise the pilot/autopilot will use the thrust required to maintain constant altitude and air speed to meet with air traffic control requirements.

===Flight Idle===

The idle rating is the minimum thrust that can be used whilst the aircraft is in flight.  It is largely defined by the requirement to keep the engine running, possibly supplying secondary services to the aircraft such as hydraulic and electrical power, and, especially at high altitude, to supply passenger air at a minimum pressure.  The flight idle rating is important in that the lower it is, the quicker the aircraft can descend (without going into a dive). It is often determined by stability considerations such as flutter and surge margin.

===High or Approach idle===

In the final phases of approach to landing it is important to be able to provide rapid response to throttle movements, this may require the engine to be running at a higher speed than ideal to be able to provide rapid acceleration if required.  There may be a maximum response time requirement to achieve 'TOGA' thrust if a landing is aborted.

===Ground Idle===
Used for maneuvering on the ground.  Typically defined by the need to keep the engine running and supplying power and services to the aircraft.  Generally, the lower this value the better, since brake wear is a significant factor in aircraft running/maintenance costs.

===Example ratings===

The figure below shows the typical behavior of a modern turbofan. The orange curves show maximum cruise thrust at altitude. The take-off thrust is about 25% higher than the cruise thrust at sea level since it is permitted for short durations only.

==Military Ratings==
Combat aircraft have very different requirements to civil aircraft, and different rating terminology is used, especially for aircraft using reheat or afterburning for thrust augmentation.

===Military Thrust===
Typically used to define the maximum available thrust without use of reheat.  Sometime referred to as max 'dry' thrust.

= Anderssen's Opening =
===1. a3===
This opening move does little for development or control of the center. In some cases, White can transpose the game to an opening where 1.a3 might have been useful, but using a tempo on such a move already on move one seems premature. In fact, this opening is based on the idea that White is playing with the black pieces, but he has the move 1.a3 already played. If a game starts 1.a3 e5 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3, Black cannot proceed in Ruy Lopez-fashion, and if Black plays 3...Bc5, then 4.Nf3 puts Black into the Two Knights' Defence and White's a3 precludes many possibilities.

Named after the German chess player Adolf Anderssen, who played this opening a few times against Morphy. This is a waiting move that doesn't do anything useful in itself, although it allows white to play b2-b4 and move the dark-squared bishop to b2. In this sense, it can be viewed as a reverse St. George Defence (1. e4 a6) with an extra move.

There are a variety of ways for black to respond to this move, including:

*1...e5 or 1...d5 - The game can transpose into lines similar to the Sokolsky/Orangutan Opening (1. b4) should white eventually play b4.
*1...g6 - This can be annoying for white if he was planning to play b4 and Bb2 because the long diagonal is now contested.
*1...c5 is a relatively unexplored option.
*1...f5 is another relatively unexplored option.
*1...Nf6 - can transpose into other lines

==Statistics==
No stats as 1. a3 occurs rarely among serious chess players.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My original name was [DdB]--Shift-- and I would have used this very gawdy nickname were it allowable, as I see no problems with using the same name all the time.  After realizing that this tends to scare people away (even though the tag is meaningless now, it's fun to watch reactions!) I decided to use the base name, arguably uncreative, and found it had already been used.  Therefore, my name in the context of wikibooks will be notShift (first letter forcefully capitalized.)

I expect to contribute to a few videogame manuals only for the time being, but may expand further if my interests sway in those directions.

On a more recent note, it seems that I have mistaken the discussion page for the actual user page.  The contents of the latter have been pasted here, this used to be blank.  I am mistaken thus!</text>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Engine Performance describes the most important attributes of the engine for the aircraft.  These are primarily the thrust available to propel the aircraft, and fuel consumption.

==Fuel Consumption==

===Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC)===

Typically quoted in mg/Ns for engines. Is usually much higher at cruise than at static. A typical high bypass engine will consume about 8mg/Ns at maximum takeoff and 15mg/Ns at maximum cruise thrust. Typical large engines today have TO thrusts approaching 480kN. Typical cruise SFC is around 15mg/Ns.  A low bypass military engine will have TO SFC of about 18mg/Ns which rises to 50mg/Ns if afterburner is used.

Available thrust is usually quoted in kN or lbs. Fuel efficiency is usually quoted as a specific fuel consumption 

&lt;math&gt;SFC = \frac{fuel flow, (g/s)}{ thrust, (kN) } &lt;/math&gt;

SFC can only be directly compared at a specific flight condition, usually a nominal cruise condition.

==[[Jet Propulsion/Specific impulse|Specific impulse]]==

Specific impulse is defined as the thrust (N) divided by the fuel weight flow rate (N/s). The resulting measure is usually quoted in seconds and defines the weight fraction  that is necessary to give a particular delta V for a rocket or range for an aircraft with a given lift to drag ratio.

For a jet engine the specific impulse can be determined from the specific fuel consumption. The product of SFC and Specific impulse is one. The conversion factor between SFC (mg/Ns) and Specific impulse (s) is 102,000mg/N (1E6mg kg-1 /9.81N kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). A high bypass turbofan engines have cruise SFC around 15mg/Ns, and takeoff SFC of 8mg/Ns.

An air-breathing jet engine typically has a much larger specific impulse than a rocket: a turbofan jet engine may have a specific impulse of 7000 seconds or more at sea level whereas a rocket would be around 200-400 seconds. Air-breathing engines are more propellant efficient because the actual exhaust speed is much lower, since the air provides the oxidizer and because (inert) air is added to the reaction mass. The actual exhaust velocity is lower and the jet engine uses far less energy to generate equal thrust. 

We can also see the effect of an airbreathing engine acting on an infinitely large reaction mass in propulsion impulse figure below. In such a case the entire energy goes into accelerating the vehicle rather than the exhaust from the engine. Thus also explains why the space elevator is much more energy efficient to get vehicles into space since the climbers are close to acting on an infinitely large mass. The energy requirements are still very large. What we can also see from the diagram below is that with increasing speeds the reaction engines become progressively more &quot;efficient&quot;, getting closer to the infinite mass case.

==Range==

The [[wikipedia:Breguet_Range_equation|Breguet Range Equation]] gives the range achieved by a vehicle. For a constant L/D ratio of the aircraft 

&lt;math&gt;Range=u I_{sp}\left(\frac{L}{D}\right) \ln \left(\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

R = distance flown (m)

u = velocity (m/s)

I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = specific impulse (s)

L/D = lift-to-drag ratio (dimensionless)

W&lt;sub&gt;initial&lt;/sub&gt; = gross aircraft weight at the start of cruise (kg)

W&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt; = gross weight at the end of cruise (kg)

|width=&quot;640&quot;|Example 9.3: Breguet Range Equation
|-
|For an aircraft with 50% fuel, velocity of 600 m/s, an L/d of 10 and engines with a specific impulse of 3000s the range is:

&lt;math&gt;R = (600m/s) (3000s) (10) \ln(100%/50%) = 12,477km&lt;/math&gt;
|}


==Endurance==

The [[wikipedia:Breguet_Range_equation|Breguet Range Equation]] can be modified to give endurance. For a constant L/D ratio of the aircraft 

&lt;math&gt;Endurance = Range/u = I_{sp}\left(\frac{L}{D}\right) \ln \left(\frac{W_{initial}}{W_{final}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Endurance =  (3000s) (20) \ln(100%/50%) = 41588s = 11.55 hours&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Thrust==

The thrust of a jet engine is determined by the difference in momentum of the fluids flowing in and out of the engine. If the mass of fuel added is negligible then  the thrust is:

:&lt;math&gt; T = \dot{m}(u_{exit}-u_{inlet}) &lt;/math&gt;


Engines are certified to deliver standard thrusts depending upon atmospheric conditions. Thrust is typically measured in kN or lbs.

Engines are certified to deliver standard thrusts depending upon flight conditions. Thrust is typically measured in kN or lbs.  A 'rating' is a predefined power setting that the pilot can select which may be appropriate for particular flight conditions.  Rating terminology differs between civil and military aircraft, reflecting the different requirements of these types of aviation.

==Aircraft Ratings==
The following ratings are typical of commercial airliners.  The aircraft/engine manufacturer will have to declare two principal ratings to the [[:Wikipedia:aircraft certification|certifying authorities]], since these define the safe limits of operation of the engine/aircraft - these are the Maximum Take-Off (MTO) rating, and the Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT or MCN) rating.

===Maximum Takeoff thrust(MTO)===

This is the maximum thrust that the engine can deliver for 5 minutes in the take-off envelope of the aircraft. Peak thrust is usually achieved when the engine is static, however the most demanding condition for a modern turbofan engine is end-of-runway or lift-off conditions, typically at about 0.25Mn.  This condition usually generates the highest stresses and temperatures in the engine, hence use of this rating is only permitted for up to 5 minutes of operation.  

It is used, as the name suggests, for take-off when the aircraft is at its heaviest and has to be accelerated to take-off speed in a finite runway distance.  The higher the thrust available from the engine, the shorter the runway can be, or the greater the aircraft payload can be.  This affects which airports an aircraft can be operated from, and the economics of operation.  As an alternative to payload, a higher thrust rating allows more fuel load to be carried into the air, so extending range of operation.  These trade-offs between available thrust, runway length, aircraft weight and range may need to be assessed for each flight, and is part of a commercial pilots preparation prior to take-off.  An aircraft may take-off with less than maximum take-off thrust to reduce wear on the engine and extend its life.  This is usually termed a 'reduced thrust' take-off, and is used to reduce engine maintenance costs.

It is a condition of certification that an aircraft should be able to take-off if one engine fails at the most critical point in the take-off run, when it is going too fast to be able to come to a safe stop in the remaining runway.  In the case of twin engine aircraft, they have to be capable of taking off on one engine, so that in normal operation 'de-rate' is usually applied as an excess of thrust is available.

If an engine exceeds its 'redline' speeds or temperatures when running at MTO thrust, it is no longer considered airworthy.

Sometimes referred to as 'TOGA' thrust, short for take-off/go-around.

===Maximum Continuous thrust (MCT)===

Outside the MTO [[wikipedia:flight envelope|flight envelope]], the MCT rating defines the maximum thrust that can be demanded by the pilot from the engine.  As such, it has particular significance with respect to engine failure in flight, as the aircraft will have to proceed to its destination or nearest diversion airport at max continuous thrust.  If the engine cannot achieve this thrust level whilst staying within it operating limits for engine speed and temperature, (them 'amber line'), it is no longer considered airworthy.

===Maximum Climb thrust (MCL)===

This is the thrust rating the manufacturer recommends be used during the climb phase of a typical flight.  It may be the same as max continuous thrust, and usually is for a three or four engined aircraft.  The top of the climb phase is typically the most challenging condition for a turbofan engine outside the take-off regime, and is a critical design requirement.  De-rate can be applied to MCL thrust to extend engine life, but at the cost of a slower time to climb and slightly increased trip fuel consumption.

===Maximum Cruise thrust (MCR)===

Sometimes defined, but not a particularly useful rating since in cruise the pilot/autopilot will use the thrust required to maintain constant altitude and air speed to meet with air traffic control requirements.

===Flight Idle===

The idle rating is the minimum thrust that can be used whilst the aircraft is in flight.  It is largely defined by the requirement to keep the engine running, possibly supplying secondary services to the aircraft such as hydraulic and electrical power, and, especially at high altitude, to supply passenger air at a minimum pressure.  The flight idle rating is important in that the lower it is, the quicker the aircraft can descend (without going into a dive). It is often determined by stability considerations such as flutter and surge margin.

===High or Approach idle===

In the final phases of approach to landing it is important to be able to provide rapid response to throttle movements, this may require the engine to be running at a higher speed than ideal to be able to provide rapid acceleration if required.  There may be a maximum response time requirement to achieve 'TOGA' thrust if a landing is aborted.

===Ground Idle===
Used for maneuvering on the ground.  Typically defined by the need to keep the engine running and supplying power and services to the aircraft.  Generally, the lower this value the better, since brake wear is a significant factor in aircraft running/maintenance costs.


===Example ratings===

The figure below shows the typical behavior of a modern turbofan. The orange curves show maximum cruise thrust at altitude. The take-off thrust is about 25% higher than the cruise thrust at sea level since it is permitted for short durations only.

==Military Ratings==
Combat arcraft have very different requirements to civil aircraft, and different rating terminology is used, especially for aircraft using reheat or afterburning for thrust augmentation.

===Military Thrust===
Typically used to define the maximum available thrust without use of reheat.  Sometime referred to as maximum 'dry' thrust.

===Maximum Takeoff thrust===

This is the maximum thrust that the engine can deliver for 5 minutes at standard sea level atmosphere. Peak thrust is usually achieved when the engine is static.

===Maximum Climb thrust===

This is the maximum thrust that the engine can deliver for 5 minutes at standard sea level atmosphere. 

===Maximum Cruise thrust===

The thrust allowable for unlimited flight duration at the design altitude.

===Maximum Continuous thrust===

Also called the maximum maneuver thrust. Sometimes is same as maximum cruise.





===Example: Installed thrust ratings===

The figure below shows the typical behavior of a modern turbofan. The orange curves show maximum cruise thrust at altitude. The TO thrust is significantly higher than the cruise thrust at sea level since it is permitted for short durations only..

White has played a very poor move and allowed Black the quickest possible checkmate&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Fool's Mate]] &amp;ndash; in the opening game of chess: Mate in two moves.  The mate almost never occurs in practice but is commonly known among chess players, due to it being the fastest possible checkmate.

A variation of this mate occurs when White advances the f-pawn two squares: '''1. f4 e6 2. g4 Qh4#'''. White can also move his g-pawn before the f-pawn.

==Resurrection of the Dead==

I'm glad that this Wikibook has been &quot;resurrected&quot; from the dead.  I fought to have this put in here, and I guess that I'm going to have to put in some content now.  :)  Still, I think that this Wikibook does have some merit, although this current state should be considered just a stub, not a complete Wikibook.</text>

: The problem appears to be that the parameter is being passed with an underscore in place of the original space (e.g., ''Robert Horning'' is being converted to ''Robert_Horning''). We need some way of stripping the underscore back out again before including it in the URL. The problem is that virtually no processing of the parameters is possible within  templates, hopefully that will change in future. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:15, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

Well. The best I can do with a single parameter is this (I'm using a new template here, since the other one is 'live'):

* {{user2|Robert%20Horning}}

The links work fine, but the name looks messy.

With two params you could have a inclusion that looks like this:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{user2|Robert%20Horning|Robert Horning}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

[[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:45, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

:I've added a second parameter to this template. Just use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{user|your user name|whatever you want to appear}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it should work fine. I use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User|Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which produces {{User|Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος'''}}. This way, Robert can have the template work by doing what Aya suggested above, but no need to use 'user2'. As my signature shows, you can use this to do whatever you want: change a %20 into a space, or change your username into Greek.

John Smith appears commonly in Wikipedia guidelines and honestly I've never heard of Bill Bailey. :P [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]]&amp;nbsp;{{toolbar|separator=dot|[[::User talk:Kayau|talk]] | [[::Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] }} 15:17, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

:How about Jimbo Wales -&gt; Karl Wick (the founder of Wikibooks) and Bill Bailey -&gt; E=MC^2.  The last one is supposed to be an example of a user with an = sign in their name and it actually had been Billbailey=legend before I edited it.  E=MC^2 is actually a user here with a user page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:37, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

I don't see why we even need a bunch of practically duplicate templates. Seems like we would be better of with just this one template with some parameters like checkuser=yes, global=yes, admin=yes, etc. to add more links. Getting back on topic though I think John Smith, Test, or Test user would be better than an account in use by a person because whatever name is used might get unwanted attention. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:10, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

:We had a handful of User* templates already, so I went about cleaning them up, ensuring they had documentation, ensuring they had a consistent look, checking that links still worked, and checking for categorization or protection needs.  I only brought in a few that we didn't already have.  I certainly expected an objection from you, Darklama, and am aware of situations like with {{tl|CompactTOC8}} handling all the other variations besides {{tl|CompactTOC}}.  I didn't import all the CompactTOC* templates, for instance, because there it makes sense to avoid template duplication.  With these, people don't want to have to throw in a huge number of parameters to a template that's supposed to '''save time and hassle'''.  When I import histories, you can't tell what was already here and in use.  All I can say is that you should compare the length of [[Template:User information templates]] with [[w:Template:User information templates]] to see how I'm not doing a full-fledged pull. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:30, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

:: We had only a few to begin with. I saw that most of the templates did not exist yet when you first began importing. How do you know what people do or don't want? There doesn't seem to be any reasoning to what you decide to import. I guess I'm a bit involved and annoyed because I spent time in the past trying to reduce the number of templates we had because many were going unused and remembering which to use in what cases wasn't easy either. People are trying to find ways to make Wikipedia easier for more users to use, and I think Wikibooks was better off than Wikipedia in that regard, lets not repeat Wikipedia's mistakes. There is also no reason to assume that older templates Wikibooks had were copied from Wikipedia or even based on what Wikipedia had, so by importing you also potentially endanger Wikibooks' own unique history since merges make it harder to follow edit histories.
:: I think there isn't a need to have a whole lot of parameters. I think the first thing is the links provided from User0 through User4 can be the default links shown with just a few additional parameters for the tools that Wikibooks has with global working with the other parameters to provide global logs when checkuser or admin links are wanted for example. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:57, 23 October 2010 (UTC)
==Edit counter==
The edit counter used in this template no longer exists, or is in a different location. I fixed this on the  {{tlx|Usercheck}} by changing it to '''[http://toolserver.org/~tparis/pcount/index.php?name=Example&amp;lang=en&amp;wiki=wikibooks this counter]''', which is the one used on Special:Contributions. I can't do that here because it's protected, so an admin needs to change this.

:[[File:Yes_check.svg|15px|link=|alt=]] '''Done''' Thanks for pointing this out.  I had remembered to fix the box below the listings on user contributions pages but forgot about templates using the same tool. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:35, 21 March 2012 (UTC)</text>

=Ware Opening=
===1.a4===
:The Ware opening attacks the b5 square and threatens to bring the a1 rook to the game. However, the b5 square is non-essential and if Black plays 1...e5, the f8 bishop prevents developing the white rook for the moment. The reply 1...e5 also gains space for Black in the center, something that openings should do but the Ware Opening does not do.

==Statistics==
This opening has no statistics as it almost never occurs among serious chess players and is a fundamentally unsound opening.

=Durkin Opening=
===1.Na3===
The Durkin Opening or Sodium Attack (Sodium due to the algebraic notation Na3, Na being the chemical symbol for sodium) is rarely played. The move does little to enhance the White position, although some sources consider it to be better than its reputation.

Black's best response is 1...d5, although 1...e5 is sometimes seen. White may continue with 2.b3, preparing to fianchetto with 3.Bb2, or with 2.c4. Alternatively, if black plays 1...e5, white may choose 2.Nc4 to put pressure on the e5 pawn.

==Statistics==
No statistics as 1. Na3 is very rarely played.

==Procedure==

# Sprinkle one teaspoon of the yeast over 1/2 cup of the water in a medium bowl, stir to mix and let stand 10 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup flour, cover tightly with plastic and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
# In a large bowl, sprinkle the remaining teaspoon of yeast over one cup of warm water, mix and let stand 10 minutes. Add the first yeast mixture (now risen) along with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 teaspoons of salt, mix well. Add the remaining flour gradually, mixing well after each addition until well incorporated. On a lightly floured work surface, turn the dough out and knead until soft, about 10 minutes.
# Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Oil an 11&quot; x 14&quot; (28 cm x 36 cm) baking pan and turn the risen dough out onto the pan, flattening it out to the edges. If the dough springs back too much to cover the pan, allow it to rest for 10 minutes before resuming. Cover with a clean towel and let rise 45 minutes to an hour. 
# Preheat oven to 425 F (220 C). Remove towel and press indentations into the dough with your fingertips, then drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt and place pan in oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until the top is golden. Remove the focaccia from the pan as soon as it is out of the oven and let cool on a rack before serving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Jotomicron,
I noticed that you started to make some improvements to the [[Portuguese/Contents|Portuguese Wikibook]] a while ago, but haven't seen you around since then. I started writing this book, despite my lack of knowledge, because the best way to learn something is to teach it. But if you want to, please, feel free to come and help out, especially with the more advanced stuff. I have no doubt I have made millions of mistakes as well...

== Clinical and Pathologic Factors predicting recurrence ==
:''See also:'' [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Prostatectomy#Natural history after RP|Natural history after RP]] section at [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Prostatectomy|Prostatectomy]]
The ''prognostic factors'' that most consistently predict for disease recurrence and overall survival are: 
* 1 penetration through the prostatic capsule (pT3a),
* 2 the presence of tumor at the inked surgical margins, 
* 3 high preoperative PSA, and 
* 4 unfavorable surgical Gleason score.
* 5 invasion of the seminal vesicles
* 6 Nodal involvement
* 7 PSADT &lt;=10 mo
* 8 PSA velocity (Annual PSA velocity of more than 2.0 ng per milliliter and PSADT &lt;= 3 mo) 
&lt;br /&gt;
* PMID 15247353, 2004 — D'amico AV et al: &quot;Preoperative PSA velocity and the risk of death from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy N Engl J Med.&quot; 2004 Jul 8;351(2):125-35.
** RESULTS: As compared with an annual PSA velocity of 2.0 ng per milliliter or less, '''''an annual PSA velocity of more than 2.0 ng per milliliter was associated with a significantly shorter time to death from prostate cancer (P&lt;0.001) and death from any cause (P=0.01)'''''. An increasing PSA level at diagnosis (P=0.01), a Gleason score of 8, 9, or 10 (P=0.02), and a clinical tumor stage of T2 (P&lt;0.001) also predicted the time to death from prostate cancer. For men with an annual PSA velocity of more than 2.0 ng per milliliter, estimates of the risk of death from prostate cancer and death from any cause seven years after radical prostatectomy were also influenced by the PSA level, tumor stage, and Gleason score at diagnosis. 
** CONCLUSIONS: Men whose PSA level increases by more than 2.0 ng per milliliter during the year before the diagnosis of prostate cancer may have a relatively high risk of death from prostate cancer despite undergoing radical prostatectomy.

** PURPOSE: A short posttreatment prostate specific antigen (PSA)-doubling time (DT) following radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy was evaluated as a surrogate end point for prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM).
** CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment PSA-DT appears to be a surrogate end point for PCSM following surgery or radiation therapy. We recommend that consideration should be given to enrollment onto a clinical trial and/or initiating androgen suppression therapy at the time of PSA defined recurrence '''''when PSA-DT is less than 3 months''''' to delay the imminent sequelae of metastatic bone disease.

** 60 pts. Analyzed how PSA doubling time (DT) changes over time -- eventual DT vs early DT. 
** DT did not accelerate. Distant mets developed in 60% of pts with eventual DT &lt; 6 m. For DT of 6-12 mo, DM in 20%.

** Results and Conclusions: surgical margin status was an important independent predictor of PSA recurrence and secondary treatment (p = 0.06 and 0.0011, respectively). ''The number of positive margins and positive margin location had little impact on the outcomes measured''.

** RESULTS: Preoperative PSA, pathological stage, margin status and prostatectomy Gleason score were independent predictors of time to postoperative PSA failure.
** CONCLUSIONS: Pts who are high risk for early PSA failure can be identified and can be selected for adjuvant therapy trials. ''Unfortunately, the use of this endpoint does not allow one to identify the source of recurrence with a high degree of accuracy.''

** Prospectively followed untreated pT3 pts.
** Poor prognostic factors were number of surgical margins involved by tumor, pathologic Gleason score and pre-prostatectomy PSA level. PSA recurrence in 20.8% of pts with 1 surgical margin involved, 40.9% with 2 margins, and 50% with 3 or more margins; in 20.3% with Gleason score &lt; 7, 33.9% with Gleason score 7, and 74.2% with &gt; 7; in 17.3% with PSA &lt; 10, 45.4% with PSA &gt; 10. 
** High risk (Gleason 7-10, PSA &gt; 10, 2 or more positive margins) or low risk (the others). Risk of recurrence 8.5% for low risk and 44.8% for high risk.

** The Authors compared the long-term results of postprostatectomy radiotherapy (RT) from two institutions, one adapting a prospective policy of adjuvant RT (69 patients) and the other salvage RT (88 patients). The salvage group underwent RT after longer postoperative intervals (median, 40.3 vs. 2.9 months; S.S.) and had higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values before starting RT (4.5 vs. 0.86 ng/mL; S.S.). Both groups were routinely treated to a minimal total dose of 60 Gy. 
** &lt;u&gt;Results:&lt;/u&gt; Of the 69 patients referred for adjuvant RT, 22 (32%) had nonzero PSA values before RT. Multivariable modeling of BRFS found only the PSA value before RT to be statistically significant (p &lt;0.0001). RT after prostatectomy was equally effective in either setting when the pre-RT PSA level was &lt;1 ng/mL. When the PSA value before RT was &gt;1 ng/mL, the 5-year BRFS for each group was inferior.
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Although the adjuvant treatment policy was associated with significantly improved BRFS, this was attributable to low pre-RT PSA values. When the treatment groups were stratified for pre-RT PSA level, the differences in BRFS were not statistically significant. Patients with a rising PSA level after prostatectomy, regardless of their initial risk, should receive prompt referral for RT.

** PURPOSE: The Authors' study was limited to men with organ confined cancer and a single positive margin. 
** MATERIALS AND METHODS: They retrospectively evaluated the records of a nested matched cohort of 76 patients with pathological stage T2N0 prostate cancer and ''a single positive margin'' who underwent adjuvant radiation therapy within 3 months of radical prostatectomy. ''There was a positive margin at the prostatic apex in 35 cases'', prostatic base in 18, posterior prostate in 11, urethra in 7, and prostatic apex and urethra in 5. These patients were matched 1:1 with 76 controls who did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy. Neither group received androgen deprivation therapy. Patients and controls were matched exactly for the margin positive site, age at surgery, preoperative serum prostate specific antigen, Gleason score and DNA ploidy. Biochemical relapse was defined as posttreatment PSA greater than 0.2 ng./ml 
** RESULTS: Overall there was significant estimated improvement plus or minus standard error in 5-year clinical and biochemical progression-free survival in 88% vs 59% (S.S.) of patients treated with adjuvant radiation therapy versus no radiation therapy. No patient who received radiation therapy had local or distant recurrence, while 16% of controls had recurrence (S.S.). 
** CONCLUSIONS: Patients with localized prostate cancer and a single positive surgical margin appear to have a lower rate of biochemical relapse at 5 years when adjuvant radiation therapy is administered. Definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of adjuvant radiation therapy for patients with involved surgical margins awaits conclusion of randomized clinical trials.

** 149 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were found to have pT3N0 prostate cancer, had an undetectable postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and had no immediate hormonal therapy. Fifty-two patients received adjuvant RT within 3 to 6 months of surgery. Ninety-seven underwent radical prostatectomy alone and were observed until PSA failure. From these two cohorts, we matched patients 1:1 according to preoperative PSA (&lt;10 ng/ml vs. &gt;10 ng/ml), Gleason score (&lt;7 vs. &gt; or =7), seminal vesicle invasion, and surgical margin status. Seventy-two patients (36 pairs) were included in the analysis. Median follow-up time was 41 months. We calculated a matched-pairs risk ratio for cumulative risk of PSA relapse (a rise above 0.2 ng/ml). 
** RESULTS: After controlling for the prognostic factors by matching, there was an 88% reduction (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78-93%) in the risk of PSA relapse associated with adjuvant RT. The 5-year freedom from PSA relapse rate was 89% (95% CI: 76-100%) for patients receiving adjuvant RT as compared to 55% (95% CI: 34-79%) for those undergoing radical prostatectomy alone. 
** CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that adjuvant RT for pT3N0 prostate cancer may significantly reduce the risk of PSA failure as compared to radical prostatectomy alone. Its effect on clinical outcome awaits further follow-up.

** 53 pts. RT for pathologic seminal vesicle invasion and negative pelvic lymph node dissection (pT3cN0). 
** 18 men had an elevated PSA immediately after surgery and received salvage RT. For this group, 3-yr bNED rate was 38%. The other 35 men had undetectable PSA at 3 months. 15 received RT and 20 were observed. 3-yr bNED was 86% for immediate adjuvant RT vs 48% for observation group.
** Conclusion: adjuvant RT reduces risk of biochemical failure for men with pT3b disease and undetectable PSA after surgery.

** Between 1970 and 1983, 159 patients underwent RP for newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and were found to have pathologic Stage T3/4. Forty-six received adjuvant RT and 113 did not. Radiotherapy usually consisted of 45-50 Gy to the whole pelvis followed by a boost to the prostate bed of 10-15 Gy, to a total dose of 55-65 Gy.
** RESULTS: 
*** The actuarial survival at 10 and 15 years was 62% and 62% for the RT group compared to 52% and 37%, respectively, for the RP group (N.S.). 
*** The disease-free survival for the RT group was 55% and 48% at 10 and 15 years, respectively, compared to 37% and 33% for the RP group (N.S.). 
*** Similarly, there was no difference in the rate of distant metastases between the two groups. 
*** In contrast, the local relapse rate was significantly reduced by the addition of postoperative radiotherapy. The actuarial local control rate at 10 and 15 years was 92% and 82%, respectively, for the RT group vs 60% and 53% for the RP group (S.S.). 
** CONCLUSIONS: While postoperative pelvic RT significantly improves local control compared to RP alone for pathologic Stage T3/4 prostate cancer, it has no impact on distant metastases and consequently does not improve survival. These data are consistent with the conclusion that many patients with pathologic Stage T3/4 prostate cancer have occult metastases at presentation and will not be cured by local therapies alone. The optimal treatment for this patient population remains to be established.


== Timing of RT ==
* '''MRC/NCIC &quot;RADICALS&quot;''' [http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/studies/PR10.asp Protocol] (ongoing)
** Randomized. 2x3 design evaluating timing of RT and duration of ADT. First randomization: Arm 1) Early adjuvant RT vs. Arm 2) Salvage RT with PSA rise. Second randomization: Arm 1) No ADT vs. Arm 2) Short-term (4 months) ADT vs. Arm 3) Long-term (2 years) ADT


== RT + Hormones ==
* '''Analysis of [[Radiation Oncology/RTOG Trials/8531|RTOG 85-31]]''' (1987-92)
** PMID 10475361, 1999 — &quot;Does androgen suppression enhance the efficacy of postoperative irradiation? A secondary analysis of RTOG 85-31.&quot; Corn BW et al. Urology. 1999 Sep;54(3):495-502.
** Of the pts treated on 85-31, 139 were s/p prostatectomy, 71 with RT + immediate androgen suppression and 68 with RT alone (and hormones reserved for relapse). 
** At a median f/u of 5 yrs, PFS (failure defined at PSA of &gt; 0.5) was 65% vs 42%; for different endpoints, 71% vs 46% (PSA of 1-3.9) or 76% vs 55% (PSA &gt; 4). No differences in distant failure or overall survival.
** Conclusion: pts with indications for post-op RT should be considered for RT + hormones. No overall survival difference.

** Anatomic boundaries described for CTV (prostate bed)
** &lt;u&gt;Inferior border&lt;/u&gt;: penile bulb or 8mm below vesico-urethral anastomosis (whichever is more superior)
** &lt;u&gt;Anterior border&lt;/u&gt;: posterior edge of symphysis pubis, up to top of symphysis pubis. Then 1.5cm anteriorly to posterior bladder wall (to account for bladder deformation)
** &lt;u&gt;Posterior border&lt;/u&gt;: anterior rectal wall and levator ani; superiorly mesorectal fascia
** &lt;u&gt;Lateral border&lt;/u&gt;: medial border of levator ani and obturator internus; superiorly the sacrorectogenitopubic fascia
** &lt;u&gt;Superior border&lt;/u&gt;: surgical clips (excluding high lymphadenectomy clips) or 5mm above inferior edge of vas deferens. Include retained SVs when pathologically involved
** Borders extended 1 cm beyond gross recurrent disease

[Epub ahead of print])
** Retrospective. 334 high risk patients (pT3-T4 and/or SM+, N0), s/p RP and adjuvant RT. Dose &lt;70.2 Gy (median 66.6 Gy, n=153) vs &gt;=70.2 Gy (median 70.2 Gy, n=181). Median F/U 10 and 7 years
** Outcome: Median TTF 36 vs 38 months (NS), but 5-year bPFS &lt;70.2 Gy 71% vs. 70.2 Gy 83% (SS), 5-year DFS 88% vs 94% (SS)
** Conclusion: Strong support for adjuvant EBRT dose &gt;= 70.2 Gy after RP

*** ''Salvage RT'': TCP consistent with radical RT TCP, suggesting macroscopic disease. Radical RT TD50 65.9 Gy, slope 2.6%/Gy; salvage RT TD50 66.8 Gy, slope 3.8%/Gy
*** ''Adjuvant RT'': TD50 60 Gy
*** Conclusion: Both adjuvant and RT salvage doses still on steep part of dose-response curve.
** '''Salvage dose; 2008''' PMID 18207668 -- &quot;Improved outcomes with higher doses for salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy.&quot; (King CR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 May 1;71(1):23-7. Epub 2008 Jan 22.)
*** Retrospective. 122 patients, pN0, salvage RT. Median prostate bed 60 Gy (n=38) or 70 Gy (n=84). Median F/U &gt;5 years
*** Outcome: 5-year bNED 60 Gy 25% vs. 70 Gy 58% (SS). Prognostic factors: dose 70 Gy, post RP PSA &lt;=1 ng/ml, no SV+
*** Conclusion: Significant dose response; recommend salvage dose 70 Gy to prostate bed

=== Neutral Colour Shoe Polish ===

To make a neutral-colour, home-made shoe polish, you would need:

*'''[[w:soap|Soap flakes]]'''              30 g (1 oz)
*'''[[w:Potassium carbonate|Potassium carbonate]]'''           15 g (0.5 oz) (Obtain from [[w:chemist|chemist]]/[[w:pharmacist|pharmacist]])
*'''[[w:Beeswax|Beeswax]]'''                       150 g (5oz)
*'''[[w:Gum arabic|Gum arabic powder]]'''  15 g (0.5 oz)    
*'''[[w:Powdered sugar|Icing sugar]]'''    45 g (1.5 oz)     

Slice the beeswax and add to 568 ml (a [[w:pint|pint]]) of [[w:water|water]].  Stir in the soap flakes and potassium carbonate. Boil until a smooth paste. Whilst the mixture is still hot (turn off the heat, but act quickly), add and stir the gum arabic powder and icing sugar.   For a specifically black polish, 280 g (10 oz) of [[w:charcoal|charcoal powder]] from the chemist may be added at this stage.

In recent history the black colour comes from an [[w:aniline dye|aniline dye]].  The next recipe indicates that [[w:nigrosene|nigrosene]] (generically, a black dye made from oxidised [[w:aniline|aniline]]) was domestically procurable in the [[w:1940s|1940s]].

Note that the above recipe uses potassium carbonate (potash) whereas the following recipe uses potassium bicarbonate, which is not potash.   [[w:Imperial measure|Imperial Measures]] are in brackets.

=== Black Shoe Polish ===
Melt wax in boiling water and stir in the potassium, using a large pot to allow for the mixture foaming up.   Dissolve the nigrosene in a little cold water and stir it in thoroughly, bring to the boil, and simmer gently for some minutes, stirring it until it creams.   Take mixture off the fire, and stir in the turpentine.  Put away in small tins, tightly closed.

[ ... p194: ] N.B.- In following recipes which contain kerosene, methylated spirit, turpentine, petrol, benzine or any other inflammable ingredient, great care must be observed to avoid making preparation near a lighted stove or naked flame of any kind.

----

Two robots are dropped from an airplane and land on a single line (with discrete positions) using a parachute which is left at the landing point. The robots are both facing north, they are an unknown distance apart, and one has landed directly east of the other. 

The robots are now to be programmed such that they meet each other. They can be instructed to move left or right to a neighboring position and to check whether a parachute is present at the current location. If the other robot is met both robots stop there and live happily ever after.

The parachute check might conditionally execute any number of instructions and any block of instructions may be repeated unconditionally. Write down a program that both robots can follow simultaneously and which guarantees that they meet.

One possible algorithm is the following, which is executed simultaneously by both robots:

&lt;pre&gt;
10 Go right
20 Go left
30 Go right
40 If Not Parachute GOTO 10
50 Go right
60 GOTO 50
&lt;/pre&gt;

The idea is that both robots go slowly (10, 20, 30) until one of them hits a parachute, accelerating to catch up with the other robot.

==[[Korean/Conversation lessons plan]]==
'''Attention contributors:''' please review or contribute to [[Korean/Conversation lessons plan]] before making significant changes to the lessons in conversation lessons. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 01:33, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

==Recommended changes==
This page needs some changes....
*반말 shouldn't be in lesson 1. Most textbooks start with very formal language (eg 안녕하십니까?), but I think 안녕하세요 is probably better to start with. We can make a  brief note of the different levels of politeness, but introduce them in more detail in a later level.
*Lesson 1 should include self-introduction, which is currently in Lesson 2.
*The grammar note about the infinitive should be in a later lesson, and actually it's a bit mixed up anyway.
*Joseph might not be the best choice of names, since the Korean form is usually 요셉 (from Latin?), not 조세프.

I'll work on it when I have time. --[[User:Chamdarae|Chamdarae]] 17:00, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

== About Chinese characters ==

I saw unnecessary chinese characters written in dialogue section. It is weird to write both Korean and Chinese for common used words like 안녕. What would it be like if I wrote English sentence like &quot;Hello (Hola), Joseph?&quot;. It is only used if it may be confused without it, though it is seldom used even under the circumstances, nowadays. I left them in vocabulary section to help learners, but deleted them in dialog section. I deleted chinese characters of dialogue, vocabulary so on. I left it for preposition 조사(助詞) not to be confused with another such as investigation 조사(調査). --[[User:Only2sea|Only2sea]] 15:40, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

The obvious difference is that &quot;Hola&quot; is not part of the English language. 漢字 are a part of the Korean language. There is no comparison. Just teaching 한글 would be like just teaching かな in Japanese: i.e. useless for the serious learner. If you can't read Chinese characters, you are in a difficult position as a learner. I find that unleass you can read hanja, learning Korean is actually more difficult, simply because there are too many words that sound the same, and can easily be mixed up. The words &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Hola&quot; are not interchangable; whereas 안녕 and 安寧 are the same word, written in two ways. I found it extremely annoying as a learner of Korean that there are almost no books that teach Korean and hanja to whitey-type foreigners at the same time, and would like this project to be an exception. Why should you have to trawl though a stupid 한자사전 to find a word that could just as easily be in the bloody textbook? --[[User:Ce garcon|Ce garcon]] 11:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Sure, hanja are a part of the Korean language, but they are pretty archaic, and there is much discussion in Korea itself about whether or not they should still be used. North Korea has already gone the whole hog and fully disbanded them. So, a full third of native Korean speakers don't know any hanja anyway. Also, if you've been in Korea lately, you'll probably notice that there is barely any hanja around these days. It is only used sparingly in newspapers, books, and in some brand names.

One can very easily write essays, articles, or even books in Korean; and read/comprehend those written by others without having to know a single hanja. Saying that a serious learner must learn hanja is just stupid. Most young Koreans these days barely even know the 500 that they are supposed to learn. Saying that a serious learner of Korean must learn them is like saying serious learners of English must learn Beowulf; or what about Anglo-Saxon runes?. It just doesn't hold water.

With a bit of extra time spent, it isn't really that difficult to gain a meaning from context anyway, and in spoken form, one has no choice.

Japanese is completely different, where kanji are still used very extensively (and it's necessary to know them). But the case is not the same in modern Korea at all.

:As a compromise between the needs of hard-core linguistic researchers and casual learners, I've begun to link new hangeul vocabulary items to their corresponding Wiktionary entries.  We can leave only the hangeul here and allow the reader to click through to see the various nuances of each new vocabulary word, including its hanja for Sino-Korean words. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 01:12, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

Naya, so far, none of your argument has made any progress as to why Hanja should not be learned. You also attacked your own argument by saying &quot;It is used in newspapers, books, and in some brand names&quot;. If it's used, even though not common, why shouldn't they learn it? If you want to gain only basic fluency, then don't learn Hanja. If you want to gain mastery, then learn it.  It's as simple as that. 

And nowadays, certain universities accept people based on Hanja proficiency certificate. And I don't know if you lived in Korea before but certain students in law or other field have said some professors teach using Hanja and without knowing them, your study becomes intensely harder. Some of those younger generation can stay stupid if they want, there are PLENTY of younger people, which I am of one, that know Hanja. 

It is part of our language which is used along with Korean language, Anglo-Saxon and Beowulf evolved to be what forms the current English. They're not quite the same comparison. 

&quot;Hanja is not necessary to learn&quot; is merely an excuse made by lazy Korean native who is not as intelligent in our language or lazy non-native Korean learners who think basic fluency is all they need. I made my case. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:70.107.78.200|70.107.78.200]] ([[User talk:70.107.78.200|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.107.78.200|contribs]]) 2008-06-01T04:58:42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:On an English website for learners of Korean I can't help but think that the reason for including Chinese characters is because white people think they are cool. I, personally, being a speaker of Japanese and Korean can't help but be in awe and captivated by Chinese characters. However, when I speak to Koreans about them they tend to make a clear distinction (though perhaps a blunt one) between words that are written with hanja and words that are &quot;우리나라말&quot;. This frustrates me to no end, and I argue the point with them until all parties are equally frustrated: these people are not scholars of Korean and are in no position to say with authority what IS or IS NOT Korean, but they are the people and they (ultimately and despite the efforts of scholars) decide where the language is going. Very few of my friends under the age of 20 can write as many Hanja as me, and even in University it is not required that students learn hanja unless they are studying 국어 (though as mentioned above, they might be necessary in some field (actually, in science or law I can't imagine how one could get by without them)). I even met a young man who couldn't write the hanja for his name (he thought he could, then tried and failed and was all &quot;oh, I'll get back to you on that&quot; ^.^). Koreans in my experience speak English far better than they write hanja.

:So I think that calling it &quot;an excuse made by lazy Koreans&quot; is not correct: not learning hanja is what realistic Koreans with no need for hanja in their daily lives do. Learning hanja is something that is done by people who have a special interest in hanja or who have an overly nostalgic regard for what is essentially now a part of Korea's history. If people who do learn hanja want to call people who don't &quot;lazy&quot;, this is probably motivated by pride more than anything else. I can imagine a similar scenario in which a young and prideful calligrapher might say &quot;'shodo is not necessary to learn' is an excuse made by lazy Japanese.&quot; Similarly, I'm sure, some Korean's might have the balls to say go out and say &quot;'English is not necessary to learn' is an excuse made by lazy Koreans.&quot; Ultimately though I think that these kinds of arguments are themselves laze. 

:In the end, and regretably, I agree that hanja hasn't much of a place in a beginner's guide to Korean (and besides, if you don't already know hanja having some Chinese scribbles beside your Korean vocab isn't going to help you: perhaps there should be a second article dedicated to helping learners who want to learn sino-korean characters?).

== 저도요 ==

Is 저도요 appropriate for lesson 1?  My Korean proficiency is poor, but 저도요 seems to be 저 (&quot;I&quot;) + 도 (&quot;also&quot;) + 요 (sentence ending for 해요체 speech level).  So, 저도요 appears to be in the 해요체 speech level but the rest of the lesson uses 합쇼체.  Is there a better form (e.g. *저돕니다?) or is 저도요 unrelated to speech level? [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 03:08, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
:: 저도요를 굳이 영어로 번역하면 Me too이고 해요체가 맞습니다. 합쇼체는 -해 주십시요. -하십다가 붙은 것을 말합니다. --[[User:Pakman|Pakman]] ([[User talk:Pakman|talk]]) 04:25, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

== 는/은 vs 이/가  ==

Are there plans to include a discussion and explanation of this? I find it an extremely challenging topic and even native koreans have difficulty in trying to explain when one should be used over another. If there already is one in here somewhere, I wouldn't mind being pointed towards it.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] ([[User talk:Crossmr|talk]]) 06:23, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

: [[Korean/Particles]] is a good place to contrast the subject particles 이/가 with the object particles 을/를 and to explain how the topic particles 는/은 are used instead when the noun is the focal point of the sentence (so long as it's clear from context whether it's the verb's subject or object).  I know there are more nuances involved (e.g. whether the sentence has multiple topics or whether a contrasting topic was already introduced), but I'm not an expert speaker of Korean, so I expect I don't fully understand the distinction.  Do you have any thoughts about how to explain those particles?  If so, try in [[Korean/Particles]].  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] ([[User talk:Rodasmith|talk]]) 18:16, 4 January 2008 (UTC)
::Unfortunately I don't, I'm still having two or three koreans try to explain it to me, which is why I was hoping it would be here. The moment I do fully understand it, you can be sure I'll be here to write something about it.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] ([[User talk:Crossmr|talk]]) 06:59, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

== 한국어 vs 한국말 ==

since I'm just having a look around, I've noticed a few places where there is a reference being made to korean language and the former is being used, yet everything I've read and the Koreans I've spoken to indicate I you should be using the latter to refer to the Korean language as 말 is the suffix which denotes its a language, is there a reason the former has been used here?--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] ([[User talk:Crossmr|talk]]) 07:02, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

: In the &quot;language&quot; sense, [[wikt:어|어]] and [[wikt:말|말]] are synonyms, but 어 is from the Chinese word [[wikt:語|語]], so [[wikt:한국어|한국어]] has a more formal feel to it, whereas the slightly more casual word [[wikt:한국말|한국말]] uses the native Korean word 말.  [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] ([[User talk:Rodasmith|talk]]) 18:35, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

:: 어는 한자어고, 말은 순우리말... 한국어는 한자어 + 순우리말의 합성어 입니다. 그리고 한국어를 한글이라고도 하는데 세 말은 모두 같습니다. 한국어를 유창하게 작성하시는 분이니 굳이 영어로 쓰지 않았습니다. --[[User:Pakman|Pakman]] ([[User talk:Pakman|talk]]) 04:23, 30 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

= English Opening =
===1. c4===
This opening is very flexible. It can transpose into many others:

:[[/1...e5/]] is a &quot;reversed&quot; [[Chess/Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Defence]].
:[[/1...c6/]] will usually either transpose into the [[Chess/Caro-Kann Defence|Caro-Kann Defence]] or the [[Chess/Slav Defence|Slav Defence]].
:[[/1...e6/]] will probably end up in a [[Chess/Queen's Gambit|Queen's Gambit Declined]].
:[[/1...Nf6/]] or [[/1...g6/]] are likely to transpose into an [[Chess/Indian Defence|Indian Defence]].
:[[/1...d5/]] is seldom played but may transpose into the [[Chess/Queen's Gambit|Queen's Gambit]].
:[[/1...f5/]], the Anglo-Dutch Defence, leads to sharp tactical lines for black, but can open a powerful kingside attack.
:[[/1...b5/]] normally gives good chances for black, even though the Halibut Gambit is considered unsound at the professional level.

Most &quot;pure&quot; English lines come from the Symmetrical Variation ([[/1...c5/]]) and are quite hard to play and to understand.

===Statistics===
Approximately chances: White win 37%, Draw 34%, Black win 29%&lt;br&gt;
Estimated next move popularity: Nf6 31%, e5 23%, e6 13%, c5 12%, g6 8%, c6 6%, f5 4% other moves less than 2%

=Benko Opening=
=== 1. g3===
This move ready to fianchetto the Bishop to g2 has many long term prospects of applying pressure on the centre and Black's Queenside. The ease with which White can castle Kingside often aids White's position; the difficulty with this opening is that it doesn't immediately put pressure on Black's position and therefore Black can usually take a setup of choice.

===Statistics===
Approximate chances: White win 38%, Draw 36%, Black win 28%&lt;br&gt;
Estimated next move popularity: d5 34%, Nf6 18%, g6 18%, e5 16%, c5 10%, f5 3%, e6 1% other moves less than 1%

=Bird's Opening=
===1. f4===
This is not a very common move; its aim is to over-protect the e5 square which later can be occupied by a White Knight. Black sometimes attempts to stop this plan as early as move one, by responding with e5, the From Gambit.

== Statistics ==
Approximately chances: White win 35%, Draw 25%, Black win 39%&lt;br&gt;
Estimated next move popularity: d5 49%, Nf6 15%, e5 11%, c5 9%, g6 8%, d6 2% other moves less than 0.5%

=Sokolsky Opening=
===1.b4===
This opening is also known as &quot;Polish Opening&quot; or &quot;The Orangutan&quot;. Some common ideas motivating this move:
* Fianchettoing is often a good idea, why not grab a little space?
* At some point a quick b4-b5 might dislodge a knight on c6.
* Trading the b-pawn for the c-pawn may give white central power.
* If 1...e5 or 1...e6, usual play either continues with 2.a3 or 2.Bb2. The idea after Bb2 is that the black can't play Bxb4 right away, anyway. E.g., 1.b4 e6 2.Bb2 Bxb4? 3.Bxg7 where black loses material, and 1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 Bxb4!? 3.Bxe5 and black loses a central pawn for a flank pawn.

== Statistics ==
www.chess.com's Game Explorer Master Games DB shows 1704 games with 1.b4: White wins 37%, 41% are drawn and Black wins 22% of all games 
www.365chess.com's Big Database shows 6360 games with 1.b4: White wins 33%, 26% are drawn and Black wins 41%
ChessBase's Big Database 2010 has 14,389 games with 1.b4 giving White a 47.6% winning percentage - which is very bad when compared to White's winning percentages with 1.e4 (53%) 1.d4 and 1.c4 (+54%) and 1.Nf3 (55%) The average FIDE rating of all players is 1926, the average performance rating is 1942 which again compares unfavorably with the average ratings of all players employing 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4  and the average performance ratings of these openings (both categories are +2200) The average rating of all players employing 1.e4 in the DB is 2135 with an average performance rating of 2161.

Few Grandmasters (GMs) employ this opening in serious games. GMs Ivanchuk and Fischer played it three times - in simultaneous exhibitions. GMs Hort, Ljubojevic, Miles, Petrosian and Smyslov played it at least once against fellow GMs or IMs (International Masters); Larsen played it in at least 4 serious games. The Big Database has 291 games (out of almost 5.5 million) played with at least one player having a FIDE rating of 2400 or higher. The winning percentages for these games are: White 46%, Drawn 30%, Black 24%.

Surprisingly there are a few fairly recent books on this opening. Not surprisingly none are by GMs although two are by IMs.

''Play 1.b4! Shock your Opponents with the Sokolsky''  Language: English

''The Sokolsky 1.b4 (Orangutan) Foxy 106''  by IM Andrew Martin
ChessOnDVD, 2010, DVD  Language: English

In theory and practice Black usually responds by playing in the center with ...d5 or ...e5, or by exploiting the weak position of the pawn by playing ...e5 or ...e6. The flexible 1...Nf6 has been played as well.

=Saragossa Opening=
===1.c3===
A rarely played move as it takes away the Knight's developing square c3.
It is likely to transpose into a London System, Torre attack or Colle system, where the pawn structure is generally c3, d4, e3.

===Statistics===
No statistics as 1. c3 occurs rarely among serious chess players.

=Grob's Attack=
===1. g4===
This opening is a bit of a trap with some clever lines, Black would be best advised to develop normally and not over reach to take the g4 pawn, unless  the accurate theory is known as there are many tricks, but assuming you avoid them, it is equal.

===Statistics===
No stats as 1. g4 occurs rarely among serious chess players.

=Desprez Opening=
===1. h4===
1. h4 is a rather useless move that does nothing to assist the important central squares.
No top masters have ever used it in professional play, although some, most notably Hikaru Nakumura, play it during blitz.
It could be said that White has made his position worse, as castling Kingside is now less attractive.

This move is rarely seen among serious chess players.

Black has many decent replies, but normal would be 
*[[Chess Opening Theory/1.h4 d5|1...d5]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

1.d5 gives Black the center while making 2.Rh3 impossible.
==Statistics==
No statistics as 1. h4 is rarely played.

= Ammonia Opening =
===1. Nh3===
The Ammonia opening is based on the chemical formula of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the fact that ammonia, like this opening, 'stinks'. An alternative title is the 'Amar' opening. Chess author Tim Harding has jokingly suggested that &quot;Amar&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Absolutely mad and ridiculous&quot;; that sums up this move!

It's not bad, it just does not improve White's position, as such it's a wasted opportunity.

Normal replies would be
*1...[[/1...e5|e5]]
*1...[[/1...d5|d5]]
as this has effectively given the first move to Black (though the Knight may, of course, change the way Black proceeds).

=Barnes Opening=
===1. f3===
Quite a rarely played passive starting move that gives up White's first move advantage.
White's position is slightly weakened by the White King exposure to a check on the h4 - e1 diagonal. The Kingside Knight's favourite developing square f3, is also not currently possible.  In fact, this is arguably the worst possible first move by White.

If Black replies 1...d5, play could go into a reverse Dutch defence, another possibility for White is to transpose into a [[Chess/Blackmar-Diemer Gambit|Blackmar-Diemer Gambit]]
1.f3 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nc3.


Black's best move is to take advantage of the potential White King exposure to a check on the h4 - e1 diagonal. So
*1...[[/1...e5|e5]]

This move is usually a way for the white player to taunt black, especially if his rating is much higher, basically giving black an edge straight away. In this fashion, white is oftentimes seen playing 2.Kf2.

===Statistics===
No stats as 1. f3 occurs rarely among serious chess players.

== Modeling Tools ==
Long gone are the days when you had to do all software designing planning with pencil and paper, it's known that bad design can impact the quality and maintainability of products, affecting time to market and long term profitability of a project.

The solution seems to be CASE and modeling tools which improve the design quality and help to implement design patterns with ease that in turn help to improve design quality, auto documentation and the shortening the development life cycles.

=== UML (Unified Modeling Language) ===
Since the late 80s and early 90s, the software engineering industry as a whole was in need of standardization, with the emergence and proliferation of many new competing software design methodologies, concepts, notations, terminologies, processes, and cultures associated with them, the need for unification was self evident by the sheer number of parallel developments. A need for a common ground on the representation of software design was badly needed and to archive it a standardization of  geometrical figures, colors, and descriptions.

The UML (Unified Modeling Language) was specifically created to serve this purpose and integrates the concepts of [[w:Grady Booch|Booch]] (Grady Booch is one of the original developers of UML and is recognized for his innovative work on software architecture, modeling, and software engineering processes), [[w:Object-modeling technique|OMT]], [[w:Object-oriented software engineering|OOSE]], [[w:Class-Relation|Class-Relation]] and [[w:Object Oriented Role Analysis Method|OOram]]and by fusing them into a single, common and widely usable modeling language tried to be the unifying force, introducing a standard notation that was designed to transcend programming languages, operating systems, application domains and the needed underlying semantics with which programmers could describe and communicate. With its adoption in November 1997 by the OMG ([[w:Object Management Group|Object Management Group]]) and its support it has become an industry standard. Since then OMG has called for information on object-oriented methodologies, that might create a rigorous software modeling language.  Many industry leaders had responded in earnest to help create the standard, the last version of UML (v2.0) was released in 2004.

UML is still widely used by the software industry and engineering community. In later days a new awareness has emerged (commonly called UML fever) that UML ''per se'' has limitations and is not a good tool for all jobs. Careful study on how and why it is used is needed to make it useful.

== What kind of verb is smart? ==

When you look up a verb in a Gothic dictionary, you will be told
* whether it is '''strong'''  or '''weak'''
* which class it is in. There are seven classes of strong verbs (''1'' to ''7'', or ''I'' to ''VII'') and four classes of weak verbs.

Strong verbs are marked with ''sv'' or ''abl.V.''. Weak verbs are marked with ''wv'' or ''sw.V.''. For example, look at the entries for ''skreitan'' (a strong verb) and ''skritnan'' (a weak verb) in [http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/DictionaryPS.htm#S this modern dictionary] and [http://www.wulfila.be/lib/streitberg/1910/html/B124.html this facsimile of a 1910 dictionary].

== Things which are the same for both strong and weak verbs ==

=== Present tense ===

The present tense goes as follows:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! Person
! Singular
! Dual
! Plural
|-
! First
| ik qiþ'''a''',&lt;br&gt;𐌹𐌺 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰&lt;br&gt; I say.
| wit qiþ'''os''',&lt;br&gt;𐍅𐌹𐍄 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐍉𐍃&lt;br&gt; the two of us say.
| weis qiþ'''am''',&lt;br&gt;𐍅𐌴𐌹𐍃 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌼&lt;br&gt; we say.
|-
! Second
| thu qiþ'''is''',&lt;br&gt;𐍄𐌷𐌿 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌹𐍃&lt;br&gt; thou sayest.
| jut qiþ'''ats''',&lt;br&gt;𐌾𐌿𐍄 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰𐍄𐍃&lt;br&gt; the two of you say.
| jus qiþ'''iþ''',&lt;br&gt;𐌾𐌿𐍃 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌹𐌸&lt;br&gt; you all say.
|-
! Third
| is qiþ'''iþ''',&lt;br&gt;𐌹𐍃 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌹𐌸&lt;br&gt; he says.
| ''(use the plural)''
| eis qiþ'''and''',&lt;br&gt;𐌴𐌹𐍃 𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌽𐌳&lt;br&gt; they say.
|}

== How strong verbs behave ==

=== Infinitive ===

The infinitive of strong verbs always ends in ''-an''. For example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! Infinitive
|-
| qiþ'''an''',&lt;br&gt;𐌵𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌽&lt;br&gt; to say.
|}

== How weak verbs behave ==

...

== Irregular verbs ==

=== wisan, 𐍅𐌹𐍃𐌰𐌽, to be ===

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! Infinitive
|-
| wisan&lt;br&gt; 𐍅𐌹𐍃𐌰𐌽&lt;br&gt; to be.
|}

= Giuoco Pianissimo =
With 4.d3, White plays the Giuoco Pianissimo (Italian: &quot;very quiet game&quot;).  White aims for a slow buildup deferring d4 until it can be prepared.  By avoiding an immediate confrontation in the center White prevents the early release of tension through exchanges and enters a positional maneuvering game.  If White plays c2-c3, the position can take some characteristics of the [[Chess/Ruy Lopez|Ruy Lopez]] if his bishop retreats to c2 via Bc4-b3-c2.  (The alternative move order 4.c3 [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...e5/2._Nf3/2...Nc6/3._Bc4/3...Bc5/4._c3/3...Nf6|Nf6]] 5.d3 is common in master play.)  Despite its drawish reputation, this variation became more popular after being taken up by Anatoly Karpov in the 1978 World Championship{{Citation needed}}.

&lt;math&gt;y'+3y=sin(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1:  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int 3dx=3x+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}=Ce^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting C=1, we get &lt;math&gt;e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;


Step 2: Multiply through

&lt;math&gt;e^{3x}y'+e^{3x}3y=e^{3x}sin(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3: Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{\int P(x)dx}y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{3x}y=e^{3x}sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4: Integrate

&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dx} e^{3x}y)dx=\int e^{3x}sin(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{3x}y=\frac{e^{3x}(3sin(x)-cos(x))}{10}+C&lt;/math&gt;

Step 5: Solve for y

&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{3sin(x)-cos(x)}{10}+\frac{C}{e^{3x}}&lt;/math&gt;



2)

&lt;math&gt;y'+\frac{1}{x+3}y=7x^2+4x&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1:  Find &lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dx}{x+3}=ln(x+3)+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^{\int P(x)dx}=Cx+3C&lt;/math&gt;

Letting C=1, we get &lt;math&gt;x+3&lt;/math&gt;


Step 2: Multiply through

&lt;math&gt;(x+3)y'+(x+3)y=(x+3)(7x^2+4x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3: Recognize that the left hand is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^{\int P(x)dx}y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} (x+3)y=(x+3)(7x^2+4x)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4: Integrate

&lt;math&gt;\int (\frac{d}{dx} (x+3)y)dx=\int (x+3)(7x^2+4x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+3)y=\frac{7x^4}{4}+\frac{25x^3}{3}+6x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

Step 5: Solve for y

&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{\frac{7x^4}{4}+\frac{25x^3}{3}+6x^2+C}{x+3}&lt;/math&gt;

=4. d3 Giuoco Pianissimo=
White plays the Giuoco Pianissimo (Italian: &quot;very quiet game&quot;). This solid but passive opening more often occurs through the Bishops opening (2. Bc4) move order.

=Lopez Opening=

White's second move prepares to push a pawn to d4, establishing a pawn center. However the idea is too slow as Black can respond vigorously with 2...d5 to eliminate transpositional possibilities. After 1.e4 e5 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 there is no 4.Nc3 to chase the queen away and gain a tempo.

Iapetus is a moon of Saturn.

==How big is Iapetus?==
Iapetus is the third-biggest moon of Saturn, and is about 1436 km wide. 

==What is its surface like?==

From space, Ieaptus' two-tone colour is quite obvious. One hemisphere is a dark reddish-brown colour, while the other, while the other is bright and heavily cratered. The effect is like a ying-yang symbol.

Scientists don't know where the material covering the dark hemisphere comes from, but they think it might come from space or from inside Iapetus. If it came from space, it might have come from meteroites or the surface of comets, or it might have been knocked off from another moon of Saturn, Phoebe. If the material came from the inside of Iapetus, it might have come from '''cryovolcanoes''' or evaporation of water ice.

When ''Cassini'' flew by on Decembr 31, 2004, a ridge was discovered on Iapetus. It is 1300 km long, 20 km wide, and 13 km high. It follows Iapetus' equator almost perfectly, and is heavily cratered, and therefore ancient.

For now, scientists are not sure of the origins of the ridge. One theory is that the ridge is icy material that rose from inside the moon and solidified. The other is that Iapetus once grazed the outer edges of Saturn's rings.

==How long is a day on Iapetus?==
One day on Iapetus is equal to 79.32 days on Earth, or about 79 days, 7 hours and 41 minutes. It takes the same amount of time to finish an orbit around Saturn. This means that the same side of this moon is always facing Saturn.

==What is it made of?==
Iapetus is made of mostly ice, with a small amount of rock.

==How much would Iapetus' gravity pull on me?==
If you were standing on Iapetus, you would weigh about 1/40 of what you do on Earth.

==Who is it named after?==
When Iapetus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea were discovered, they were named ''Sidera Lodoicea'' (&quot;the stars of Louis&quot;) to honour king Louis XIV. However, astronomers called them and Titan ''Saturn I'' through ''Saturn V''. Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered, in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended to Saturn VII.

The name Iapetus was suggested by astronomer John Herschel (son of William Herschel, also an astronomer) in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope''

Iapetus is a Titan from Greek mythology. He was son of Uranus and Gaia, and father (by an Oceanid named Clymene or Asia) of Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius. Through Prometheus and Epimetheus and Atlas he is an ancestor of the human race.

==How was it discovered?==
Iapetus was discovered by Giovanni Cassini on October 25, 1671.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Initial value problems ==

Initial value problems still exist in higher orders.  However, since we have to integrate twice or more, there will be more than one constant of integration, and it will not always be a single arbitrary. It will be shown in a later section by the ''existence theorems'' that an equation of order n in an initial value problem satisfying suitable conditions will a solution given n arbitrary contents, and therefore will contain, in general, n arbitrary constants.

=== Second order initial value problems ===

Let's take a simple equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}=2&lt;/math&gt;. 

To solve this, we integrate twice:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2x+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=x^2+Cx+D. \,&lt;/math&gt; 

Plug it in and check, this is the solution.  Notice the 2 unknowns.  In order to solve that, we need two initial conditions.  For normal equations, this would do it - two equations, two unknowns.  The problem here is that the two constants depend on each other. Suppose we had the initial conditions

::&lt;math&gt;y(x_0)=b_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y(x_1)=b_1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

There are multiple curves for ''y'' that could hit those two points.

How can we get around that?  We can't do it with 2 initial conditions for ''y''.  Instead, we need an initial condition for ''y'' and ''y''&amp;#39;.  Even more - they need to be for the same point.  We need 

::&lt;math&gt;y'(a)=b_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;y(a)=b_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;. 

With these you can plug in ''y''&amp;#39; and solve for C, then solve for D.

===n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order initial value problems===

So, generalizing, for the particular solution to an ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order DE, we need ''n'' initial conditions.  The initial conditions must take the form

::&lt;math&gt;y(a)=b_0,\ y'(a)=b_1,\ y''(a)=b_2,\ldots,\ y^{(n)}(a)=b_n&lt;/math&gt;

==Separable Equations==

Bad news - separable equations don't really exist in higher orders.  You end up with only a small subset of problems that can be solved like that.

===Second order separables===

There are no real second order or higher separable equations.  Mainly because we have 3 variables.  However, suppose we had an equation of the form

::&lt;math&gt;y''=f(y')g(x). \,&lt;/math&gt; 

While that isn't a separable equation we can solve for ''y'' - it is a first order separable for ''y''&amp;#39;.  We can replace ''y''&amp;#39; with ''v'' (and ''y''&amp;#39;&amp;#39; with ''v''&amp;#39;) and solve for ''v'', then integrate with respect to ''x'' to solve for ''y''.

''Example needed''

===n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order separables===

We can do the same thing in ''n''th order equations.  If we have an equation of the form

::&lt;math&gt;y^{(n)}=f(y^{(n-1)})g(x), \,&lt;/math&gt;

we can use separable techniques to solve for ''y''&lt;sup&gt;(n-1)&lt;/sup&gt; and integrate ''n''-1 times to solve for ''y''.

==Linear Equations==

Linear equations do exist in higher orders.  They aren't as easy to solve though - there is no method like we demonstrated for first order equations.  We'll spend the other lessons in this chapter dealing with the one easily solved subset - constant coefficients.

===Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions===

In first order equations, we were promised a unique solution if all terms of the function were continuous.  In ''n'' dimensions, its similar.

Given an initial value problem

::&lt;math&gt;y^{(n)}+p_1(x)y^{(n-1)}+...+p_n(x)y=f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

with initial conditions at ''x''=''a'', we are promised a unique solution if

::&lt;math&gt;p_1(x),\ p_2(x),\ldots,\ p_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

are all continuous over some interval I.

=== Superposition principle ===

In many higher order equations, there are more than one solution to a problem. For example, the second-order DE

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}-y=0&lt;/math&gt;

is satisfied by both

::&lt;math&gt;y=C_1e^x \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=C_2e^{-x} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Plug them in - they both work.  So how do we get that unique solution we were promised?

We add them.  This is the superposition principle:

:&lt;big&gt;If &lt;math&gt;y_1=f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2=g(x) \,&lt;/math&gt; are both solutions to a linear differential equation, then &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)+g(x) \,&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution.&lt;/big&gt;

Let's illustrate this. Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' are solutions, where ''y=u'' and ''y=v'' are distinct solutions, comprised of functions of ''x'', of the DE

::(1)&lt;math&gt;a\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+b\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}+cy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

::(2)&lt;math&gt;a\frac{\mathrm{d}^2u}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+b\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}+cu=0&lt;/math&gt;

and

::(3)&lt;math&gt;a\frac{\mathrm{d}^2v}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+b\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x}+cv=0&lt;/math&gt;

A second order DE needs two arbitrary constants to properly define it. So, assume that the general solution is

::(4)&lt;math&gt;y=Au+Bv, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where A and B are our constants. Then,

::(5)&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=A\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}+B\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;

and

::(6)&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}=A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2u}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+B\frac{\mathrm{d}^2v}{\mathrm{d}x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting back into our original DE, (1), we get

::(7)&lt;math&gt;a \left( A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2u}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+B\frac{\mathrm{d}^2v}{\mathrm{d}x^2} \right)
+b \left( A\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}+B\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x} \right)
+c \left(Au +Bv \right)
=0&lt;/math&gt;

Now, regrouping to get all functions of ''u'' together, and functions of ''v'' together, we have

::(8)&lt;math&gt;A \left( a \frac{\mathrm{d}^2u}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+b\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}+cu \right)
+B \left( a \frac{\mathrm{d}^2v}{\mathrm{d}x^2}+b\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x}+cv \right)
=0&lt;/math&gt;

From our definitions in (2) and (3), we have

::(9)&lt;math&gt;A\times0+B\times0=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, since A and B are just numbers, this is true, therefore our original assumption must be true, so

:::&lt;math&gt;y=Au+Bv \,&lt;/math&gt;

is the general solution, and ''y=u'' and ''y=v'' are distinct solutions. Now to solve the equation, we need to find ''u'' and ''v''. This is done in the next lesson.

==T-t too...==
Say the following phrase:

'''L-l-loo, l-l-low, l-l-law, l-l-lah, l-l-lay, l-l-lee'''

Now, replace the first consonant with another consonant, for example:

'''M-m-moo, m-m-mow, m-m-maw, m-m-mah, m-m-may, m-m-mee.'''

Continue through the alphabet.

==Pss, Pss==
At breakneck speed:

'''Pss, pss, ch-ka ch-ka {kiss} {click with tongue, wink with eye} ah'''

Then try backwards.

'''Ah! {wink and click} {kiss} ch-ka ch-ka pss.'''

Try saying this at a fast pace:

Betty bought a bit of butter,
But the bit of butter Betty bought was bitter,
So Betty bought a bit of better butter,
To make the bit of bitter butter better.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cma. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cma~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

PalmOS is the operating system for Palm handheld computers.

==Getting Started==
===Handheld Basics===
Upon powering up a Palm Handheld users will see the &quot;Home&quot; applications page.  This page displays the applications on the handheld.  Users can also organize applications by Main, Utilities, Games among other categories for easy access.

Using a pen-like instrument, called a Stylus, users can input data using Palm's handwriting recognition software called Graffiti.

===Datebook (Calendar)===
The Palm Datebook is one of the main applications included in the Palm OS. It is a digital version of the calendar or datebook usually found in a regular organizer. This application is used to write down appointments and events and offers four views:

Daily: the user can see all the appointments and events for a single day, divided in an hourly schedule.

Weekly: the user can see all the appointments and events for a single week, divided in days and into which appointments for each day can be seen up to a 1-hour detail.

Monthly: the user can see all the days of a month, in which appointments are only seen for each day in a collective perspective, shown as one or several appointments for the morning, or for noon, or for evening/night.

Agenda: the user can see a digest of the day in a format that shows the most immediate appointments and the most immediate tasks (See the ToDos or Task List).

A calendar is, essentially, a document that shows a timeline, with a given detail. In a regular paper organizer, the calendar &quot;application&quot; comprises several sets of sheets separated according to the detail they express in relation to the timeline, like the yearly, monthly, weekly or daily sections. Ideally, in a paper organizer, all these different formats shall express the same information the user writes into, with a given detail strictly due to the detail a certain timeline format shows. The purpose of these documents is to reach a time management status. And that set of sheets with the minimal detail chosen by the user to write down the specific activities to accomplish is usually referred to as the datebook, because it's there where the user will write down appointments and events related to the day-to-day needs. A regular paper calendar offers several problems to the user: how to use all these different sections of the timeline in a practical manner, use them with an effective sense of accomplishment, and with the least loss of information possible.

The Palm Datebook is used just as all these sections of the paper organizer, but instead offers them all within a single application. The different detail of the timeline is observed, but there is no difference in the information abroad all these timeline &quot;formats&quot;, for they belong to the very same application. This type of application made an old dream possible: to express the very same information in different detail, abroad different timeline formats.

According to the different Palm OS-based models, and according to the versions of this OS itself, the Date Book application can appear to be named as such, or as Calendar. In the latest versions of the Palm OS Garnet, both appear to be listed within the applications of the OS, but only one appears available to the user; this circumstance is due to the posibility to synchronize the very same application with different folders containing similar information, a folder called Date Book and a folder called Calendar. Anyway, the user has only one application to use for his everyday needs.

===Address Book (Contacts)===
palm os specially build for developing mobile like applications. In fact, a mobile device have a small capacity memory rather than computer system.

===To-do List (Todos)===

===Memo Pad (Memos)===

===Note Pad (Notes)===

===Calculator===

==Handhelds==

===3com / Palm / PalmOne / Palm, Inc.===

====PalmV====
With its sleek, legendary design, '''PalmV''' and '''PalmVx''' are marketed toward corporate executives and alike. It has successfully turned Palm handhelds from &quot;geek's toys&quot; to a fashion accessory and a symbol of status. PalmV comes with 2MB RAM in addition to 2MB of flash ROM while a later released Vx offers 8MB for more storage.
===Sony===
====S series====
=====PEG-S300=====
'''S300''' is Sony's first attempt in PalmOS market. A grayscale, 16MB model offers Sony's original designs such as '''Jog Dial''' and '''Memory Stick''' that later revolutionized the Palm handheld market.
=====PEG-S500C=====
====TH series====
=====PEG-TH55=====
One of the best handheld ever made, Sony's '''TH55''' offers innovative '''CLIE organizer''' which allows users to draw freehand notes, add stickers and even insert photos and sound clips on datebook entries, calendar and notes. TH55 is the only model in the TH series; Sony did, however, offer an alternative ''TH55DK'' model in Japan with dictionaries included. Sony also sold other models in the Europe (TH55/E1 and TH55/E2, which offer bluetooth) and in Asia-Pacific (TH55/H).
===Handspring===
===Symbol===
===Kyocera===

==Hacks==
Hacks are programs that extend the function of your palm. Sometimes called &quot;Extensions,&quot; hacks enable your Palm handheld to do more than its original OS is capable of. Hacks such as inverting backlight foreground/background and changing system fonts are available for download. You need to install a hack management program before using hacks. There are three hack management programs.
* [http://www.daggerware.com/hackmstr.htm Hackmaster] (Shareware)
* [http://www.linkesoft.com/english/xmaster/ X-Master] (Freeware)
* [http://www.tealpoint.com/softmstr.htm TealMaster] ($9.95)
* [http://yahm.palmoid.com/yahmv.htm YAHM (Yet Another Hack Manager) for Palm OS 5 and above and can be used on older palms such as the Palm IIIx] (Freeware)
TealMaster and X-Master claim to be 100% compatable with Hackmaster.

'''Note''': Hacks are generally incompatible with PalmOS 5.x and 6.x as they are based on a different processor.

WARNING: As of above, be extra careful using applications that speed up processing power, (CLOCK APPS), most of them are designed to work on EZ Motorola Processors.

==Misaligned Digitizer==
Sometimes your digitizer(touchscreen) goes out of alignment. You can usually align it by going to the Prefs app. But what if you screen is so out of alignment you can't go to Prefs? Install [http://members.xoom.it/gudang003/download/ZDigitize.zip Z-Digitizer]. It will let you align your screen after every soft reset. So just hotsync Z-Digitizer to your palm, poke the hole at the back, and you're back in business!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Homogeneous Equations of Constant Coefficients==

Consider a DE of the form

::&lt;math&gt;p_0(x)\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+\ldots+p_{n-1}(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+p_n(x)y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Constant coefficients refers to the left hand side of a differential equation - the coefficients of all terms of ''y'',(i.e. ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), etc) are constants.  While this may seem unrealistic, this actually happens frequently in electric circuits and harmonic motion.

&quot;Homogeneous&quot; refers to the right hand side of the equation.  If ''f''(''x'')=0, the equation is '''homogeneous''', if it isn't, it is '''nonhomogenous'''.  Again, it seems useless but it isn't.  And it makes for a much easier to solve problem.  We'll deal with nonhomogenous equations later.

So a homogenous equation of constant coefficients is an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+c_1\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+c_2\frac{d^{n-2}y}{dx^{n-2}}+\ldots+c_ny=0&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc are all constants.

==Second order equations==

In order to show how these equations are solved, lets start with the most basic case - a second order equation

::&lt;math&gt;A\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+B\frac{dy}{dx}+Cy=0&lt;/math&gt;

where A, B, and C are constants.

===The Auxiliary Quadratic===

For a DE

::&lt;math&gt;a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy=0,&lt;/math&gt;

Make the following substitution:

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{mx}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives also

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=me^{mx}\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=m^2e^{mx}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The DE is now

::&lt;math&gt;am^2e^{mx}+bme^{mx}+ce^{mx}=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by &lt;math&gt;e^{mx}&lt;/math&gt; gives (note:&lt;math&gt;e^{mx}&lt;/math&gt; can never equal zero)

::&lt;math&gt;am^2+bm+c=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the '''auxiliary quadratic''' (AQ) of the DE. There are four classes of outcomes to the auxiliary quadratic:

#&lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac &gt; 0, \,&lt;/math&gt;, giving two distinct, real, roots.
#&lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac = 0, \,&lt;/math&gt;, giving two coincident real, roots.
#&lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac &lt; 0, \,&lt;/math&gt;, giving complex roots.
:''a'': Purely imaginary roots.
:''b'': Complex-conjugate pair.

The method of solution of the DE depends on the class of AQ.

===Class 1: Distinct, Real Roots===

Consider the DE

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\frac{dy}{dx}-6y=0 &lt;/math&gt;

The AQ is

::&lt;math&gt;m^2+m-6=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(m+3)(m-2)=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us the following roots:

::&lt;math&gt;m=2, \ m=-3&lt;/math&gt;

Going back to the substitution we made to obtain the AQ, we have

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{2x},\ y=e^{-3x}&lt;/math&gt;

as two distinct solutions to the DE. According to the [[../Higher 1#Superposition_principle|superposition principle]], the general solution is therefore

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{2x}+Be^{-3x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

====General Solution to Class 1 DEs====
:Generalizing, for the Second Order DE

:::&lt;math&gt;a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy=0&lt;/math&gt;

:with the auxiliary quadratic given by

:::&lt;math&gt;am^2+bm+c=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:with roots ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'', the general solution is

:::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{\alpha x}+Be^{\beta x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Class 2: Coincident, Real Roots===

Consider the DE

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-4\frac{dy}{dx}+4y=0 &lt;/math&gt;

The AQ is

::&lt;math&gt;m^2-4m+4=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(m-2)(m-2)=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

so, &lt;math&gt;e^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a solution. However, we cannot have it as both solutions as the factor of two produced will be absorbed into the constant, leaving us with only one constant, and therefore a DE without a full solution.

For the other solution we will use the Method of Reduction of Order.  To do so we assume that it is in the form of:
::&lt;math&gt;y_2=u(x)y_1=u(x)e^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
At the end we will check if our assumption is correct.  We will now substitute this equation and solve for u(x)
::&lt;math&gt;y_2''-4y_2'+4y_2=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;u''(x)e^{2x}+2u'(x)e^{2x}+2u'(x)e^{2x}+4u(x)e^{2x}-4(u'(x)e^{2x}+2u(x)e^{2x})+4u(x)e^{2x}=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;u''(x)e^{2x}=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;e^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt; is always non-zero so the only way the product can equal zero is if:
::&lt;math&gt;u''(x)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating twice offers
::&lt;math&gt;u(x)=a_1x + a_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore
::&lt;math&gt;y_2=(a_1x+a_2)y_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_2=(a_1x+a_2)e^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Our general solution is:
::&lt;math&gt;y=C_1y_1+C_2y_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=C_1e^{2x}+C_2(a_1x+a_2)e^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(C_1+a_2)e^{2x}+C_2a_1xe^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Because each constant is arbitrary we can simply write
::&lt;math&gt;y=C_1e^{2x}+C_2xe^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Method of Reduction of Order can be used on different equations and u(x) does not always equal x.  You can see below that &lt;math&gt;y=xe^{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid solution.
::&lt;math&gt;y=xe^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=2xe^{2x}+e^{2x}=e^{2x}(2x+1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=2e^{2x}+2e^{2x}(2x+1)=e^{2x}(4x+4)\,&lt;/math&gt;

To check substitute these into the original DE:

::&lt;math&gt;e^{2x}(4x+4)-4e^{2x}(2x+1)+4xe^{2x}=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;4xe^{2x}+4e^{2x}-8xe^{2x}-4e^{2x}+4xe^{2x}=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;y=xe^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a solution as well.

====General Solution to Class 2 DEs====
:Generalizing, for the Second Order DE

:::&lt;math&gt;a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy=0&lt;/math&gt;

:with the coincident root ''&amp;alpha;'' of the AQ, the general solution is

:::&lt;math&gt;y=(A+Bx)e^{\alpha x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Class 3a: Purely Imaginary Roots===

To have complex roots, the AQ must have a discriminant less than zero, so

::&lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Also, for the solution to be purely imaginary, the value of ''b'' must be exactly zero.

Therefore,

::&lt;math&gt;4ac&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that ''a'' and ''c'' have to have the same signs: either ''a'' and ''c'' are both positive or they are both negative. If we consider our general second-order DE:

::&lt;math&gt;a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy=0&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''b'' to zero gives

::&lt;math&gt;a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+cy=0&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing through by ''a'' gives

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\frac{c}{a}y=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the ''y'' term is always positive, and this can be represented by

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\omega^2y=0&lt;/math&gt;.

(I'm using ''&amp;omega;'' here as it is used for simple harmonic motion, which is the primary use of this DE). There are now two paths to the solution of the DE. The first relies on us spotting that we can use the cyclical nature of trig. functions when derived. Substitute the following

::&lt;math&gt;y=\cos \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=-\omega \sin \omega x\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=-\omega^2 \cos \omega x\,&lt;/math&gt;

And check in our DE:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\omega^2 y=-\omega^2 \cos \omega x+\omega^2 \cos \omega x=0&lt;/math&gt;

This checks out, so &lt;math&gt;\cos \omega x\,&lt;/math&gt; is a solution. A similar result holds true for the substitution using &lt;math&gt;y=\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Our solutions are therefore

::&lt;math&gt;y=\cos \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

So the general solution is

::&lt;math&gt;y=A\cos \omega x+B\sin \omega x. \,&lt;/math&gt;


The other method of solving this equation is to use Euler's Formula:

::&lt;math&gt;e^{\omega ix}=\cos \omega x +i \sin x \,&lt;/math&gt;

:and

::&lt;math&gt;e^{-\omega ix}=\cos \omega x -i \sin x \,&lt;/math&gt;

From our original DE, we have an AQ of

::&lt;math&gt;m^2+\omega^2=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

giving us roots of

::&lt;math&gt;m=\pm i \omega \,&lt;/math&gt;

so the general solution, similar to the Class 1 DEs, is

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{\omega ix}+Be^{-\omega ix} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=A(\cos \omega x +i \sin \omega x)+B(\cos \omega x -i \sin \omega x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(A+B)\cos \omega x+i(A-B)\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since A and B are arbitrary, we can set new constants for convenience, letting our new A equal A+B and our new B equal ''i''(A-B).

Thus we have as our general solution

::&lt;math&gt;y=A\cos \omega x+B\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

====General Solution to Class 3a DEs====
:Generalizing, for the Second Order DE

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\omega^2 y=0&lt;/math&gt;

:the general solution is 

:::&lt;math&gt;y=A\cos \omega x+B\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Class 3b: Complex Conjugate Roots===

Since it is a proven theorem that complex roots of polynomials always occur in conjugate pairs, the only remaining class of AQ is the one with complex conjugates for solutions.

Given that the solutions are complex, we know that in the AQ

::&lt;math&gt;am^2+bm+c=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac,&lt;0,\ b \ne 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; (see Class 3a).

The roots of this are in the form

::&lt;math&gt;(p \pm iq)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution is then

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{(p+iq)x}+Be^{(p-iq)x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{px} \left( Ae^{iqx}+Be^{-iqx}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

From Euler's Formulas, we can now get

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{px}\left( A\left(\cos q x + i \sin q x \right)+B\left(\cos q x - i \sin q x \right) \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{px}\left( (A+B)\cos q x+i(A-B)\sin q x \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

As A and B are arbitrary, we can collapse them as in Class 3a, so that we have the general solution

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{px}\left( A\cos q x+B\sin q x \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

====General Solution to Class 3b DEs====
:Generalizing, for the Second Order DE

:::&lt;math&gt;a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy=0&lt;/math&gt;

:with an AQ with roots

:::&lt;math&gt;m=p \pm iq,&lt;/math&gt;

:The general solution is 

:::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{px}\left( A\cos q x+B\sin q x \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;


We have now covered all possible types of homogeneous second-order differential equation, and we didn't even have to integrate anything! We will now have a look at higher order equivalents.

==''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-Order Equations==

How do we expand the above to the ''n''th order?  Well, the ''n''th order has the same requirements of orders of ''x'' as second order equations do.  So we still need functions involving &lt;math&gt;e^{mx}&lt;/math&gt;.  There's just 2 major differences.  Firstly, we'll have more terms - we won't just be able to plug into the auxiliary quadratic equation to get the roots.  Secondly, there are more roots.  We'll end up with ''n'' roots, so ''y'' will be the sum of ''n'' equations.

===An Example of a Third-Order Equation===

Consider the third-order DE

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}-4\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-7\frac{dy}{dx}+6y=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Find the roots of the auxiliary cubic equation of the form

::&lt;math&gt;m^3-4m^2-7m+6=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;m=-1,2,3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Our distinct solutions are therefore

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{-x},\ e^{2x},\ e^{3x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us a general solution

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-x}+Be^{2x}+Ce^{3x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Pericyclic reactions''' are one of the three major classes of organic reactions, along with polar/ionic reactions and radical reactions. Pericyclic reactions have been understood only relatively recently compared to the other classes.

In a polar/ionic reaction, one reactant (the nucleophile) donates two electrons to another (the electrophile) to form a bond. In a radical reaction, each reactant donates one electron. In a pericyclic reaction, only the &amp;pi; bond electrons are involved, and all bonds are changed in a single cyclic step without any intermediates being formed.

[[Image:Dielsalder.png]]

Using the [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Diels-Alder reaction|Diels-Alder reaction]] as an example, pushing arrows are used to show electron flow, but they are drawn in a circle, and the direction of the arrows can arbitrarily be shown as clockwise or anticlockwise. All the bonds are made and broken in a single step. This is called a '''concerted''' reaction.

The types of pericyclic reactions are:
*Cycloadditions (including the Diels-Alder reaction)
*Electrocyclic reactions
*Sigmatropic rearrangements

== [[Programming:Windows Programming]] ==

This book is in pretty lousy condition, and I would like to start a project soonish (within the next few weeks) to try and expand this book. I have started a basic outline [[User:Whiteknight/Windows Programming|on my user page]] to try and lay out the things that (I think) this book should cover. I see that you have been a contributer to this book in the past, and I would therefore like to get your input on the current outline, and see if there is anything that i should add, or anything that I should remove from it.

The outline can be found at [[User:Whiteknight/Windows Programming]]. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:35, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:My contribution was simply to list VB as one of the programming tools.  Nonetheless I'd be happy to contribute if I can find both the time and the necessary expertise.  I have only two comments so far on the proposed outline.  Firstly I think that the .NET stuff should come later in the book because .NET is not really Windows specific and other topics such as device drivers, DLLs (both traditional and COM), and shell programming are more important.  In fact I think it could be argued that .NET deserves only a passing mention.  Secondly I think that it is a very ambitious work.  When I think of the size of Charles Petzold's original Programming Windows book which doesn't have anything like the range you are proposing I wonder if you aren't biting off more than we can chew, there is material for a whole series of books but let's see how it goes.  Is there a central location for discussions of your outline?  Should comments go to your talk page, the talk page of the outline or...? --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 08:53, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
::Discussion can really go anywhere, although i suppose we should probably limit it to the talk page of the outline. My idea with creating a book as ambitious as this one is that if any particular section gets too big, it can be easily separated out into it's own book. However, there are alot of important topics to discuss when talking about programming windows. Petzold is an impressive book (i have 2 editions of it on my shelf), but it falls far short of explaining everything there is to say on the subject. Also, if we look at [[WB:WIW]], I am constantly reminded of the statement &quot;wiki is not paper.&quot; We don't have the size limitations that a physical paper book would have, and so we are capable of creating a monstrous book such as this. I am more then willing to contribute a very large amount to this project myself, so hopefully we can get a few more contributers on board, eventually. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 14:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

=[[Talk:Religions And Their Source/3. Present Day Religions/1. Some Major Religions/3. My Dissatisfaction With Existing Religions|Religions and their Source]]=
Thanks for suggesting that the Dissentions on:

&quot;Talk:Religions And Their Source/3. Present Day Religions/1. Some Major Religions/3. My Dissatisfaction With Existing Religions; 17:15 . . Kwhitefoot (Talk) (Someone seems to have misunderstood the point of the discussion page)&quot;

should be put on the Discussion page. Is it OK if I (David Hockey, the origional author) move them there? [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 19:47, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

If I, or someone, does this, how do readers know to check the Discussion Page for suggested changes? [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]]

:Surely it's obvious that the discussion page is where discussions should occur.  Sorry, being facetious, you wouldn't have asked otherwise.  My solution in the book I am editing ([[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]]) was to add a note explaining how readers should use the book to the introduction.  As no one seems to be reading it I have no idea if it works :-/  Another option would be to provide a separate page for Dissenting Opinions so as to avoid distracting the reader while still having the Dissent as part of the book.  By the way, I think the conventional spelling is ''dissension'' not ''dissention'' and anyway I'm not sure that it's the correct word to use as it usually implies not merely disagreement but discord [http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;field-12668446=dissension&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname] (on the other hand the example in question was pretty discordant in my opinion, so perhaps it is appropriate after all).  

:As to whether you or someone else can move them: of course you can.  The real question is how to do it without getting into an edit war.  As the dissenter is anonymous in this case you can't easily discuss the point with him or her (him I think).  My own reaction if this happened to a book I was largely responsible for would be to move it to the discussion page and attach an explanation to the discussion page and a link to it from the book page.  After a decent interval I would then remove the link.  I'm no expert so don't take this as advice, just an idea.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:26, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, Kwhitefoot. I like what you wrote and have been thinking about how to apply it. I won't be able to do that for a few days (going to see the kids) but will try it on return. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 13:57, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

: Hello Kwhitefoot.
: I haven't been able to find the original references, but Global Footprints was part of it. Here is their site:  http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/
: And here are some quotes:
: “Accepting 12 percent as the magic number for biodiversity preservation, one can calculate that from the approximately 2 hectares per capita of biologically productive area that exists on our planet, only 1.7 hectares per capita are available for human use.”  http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/benchmark.htm
: and, “Footprints are too large. Most countries presented in this report live on footprints larger than what their own ecosystems can support. On a global basis and even by conservative measures, humanity’s footprint has overshot global capacities by over 35 percent.”
: “Population versus consumption. The numbers show the impact of both consumption and population. Clearly, the high levels of consumption in industrialized countries take the biggest share of the planet’s bounty. But with ever larger populations it becomes progressively less likely that a reasonable quality of life can be secured for everybody. Particularly the rapidly growing populations will lose their prospects even faster.” from http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/numbers.htm

: It is more than energy use I was referring to. I know that this site is only one of many differing points of view. That’s one of the discussion points, I guess!  [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:24, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I think that those quotations and urls would make good footnotes/endnotes.  Armed with that information a reader can dig further and come to a reasoned agreement, or disagreement, with your points.  Also I think that such information will help defend the book against charges of violating the [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] policy.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 08:09, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

::: Thanks for the idea. I have added a reference to the site in the text and kept our discussions on the discussion page (maninly because adding an endnote means I would have to change all the endnote numbers to the other endnotes to this chapter).  [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:25, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

== VB book query ==

hi ,I am an experienced pascal programmer ,who knows come C.

I'm looking for an online tutorial source to study VB from scratch(having some previous experience in othe languages) ,after accomplishing this I'd like to know more about DB interfaces such as in Exel and access scripts.

There are ''so'' many sources on the Net ,do you believe the current version of the VB wikibook is sufficient and complete as a tutorial that'll guide me thorugh all various aspects I needed ,or do you recommende an exisintg site ..?

thank's for all your honest help..:)

[[w:user:Diza]]

:I'd love to be able to say it was that good but unfortunately it isn't.  In fact I doubt that any book on any subject could ever be that good.  However, I have a fairly wide experience of VB6, including using it and VBA to drive Excel, Word, Access and various other programs so if you are willing to help we might be able to turn the book into the book you need by working together.  I also have about thirty years of experience of writing in various other languages (that's a statement of fact, not a boast - it's not all useful and the early years were certainly nothing to be proud of).  If you look at the history of the various pages you will see that the rate of additions to the book has declined over the last month, and that isn't just beause it was Christmas; the principal reason is that I realized that I was simply writing chapters that interested me and that I really didn't know if they were of use to anyone else.  One of the problems with Wikibooks is that it is very hard to know if anyone is reading a book (really reading it as a textbook I mean, not just using it as part of the great World Wide Web reference library).  So to summarize: if you would be willing to read some of the book and comment on its structure, content and quality and to name topics that are missing that you need I'll try to fill them in.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:20, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

So ,by Help you mean commentery.Oky.

I'll try to start learning from elsewhere and report back to you on the WWW best places difference to this book.[[image:smiley.png|40px]]

:Thanks.  Don't forget that you can contribute as well.  Even if all you do is add chapter and section headings that can help.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 07:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== Link to Advanced page in C sharp ==

The Advanced page as well as several others are referenced in the table of contents header seen at the top of the page. Advanced is only meant in that context, as a content section. That's why the links aren't there (they're already above in the TOC). -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 03:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

:: So I see, but that header is not visible when you are looking at the little list of advanced topics so it isn't exactly reader friendly.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 17:42, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

=Coding Cookbook=

This surely overlaps with the http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Source_code which is also much more extensive and has more comments attached to the code.  Without explanatory comments it surely doesn't qualify as a textbook or even an instruction manual.  Is there any point in having both?  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 12:25, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
: Good question! Well, to begin with, before I started I searched to find a similar project and didn't find anything. I haven't search Wikisource, since (quote from [[Help:How to start a book]]) &quot;Original, finished work should go to Wikisource. Wikibooks is a place to develop books&quot;, and this seems to me something that will never be finished. I have taken a quick look at [[wikisource:Source code]] and must say I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the missing links and unclear structure... -- [[User:Pbb|Peter]] 12:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

=Hit counters=

We should press for hit count sampling using Wikibook's own counters. They used to have counters on each page when the project was started but all we need is access to occasional sampling of single pages. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

:You are right.  And the load shouldn't be very great if only a small proportion of pages are sampled at anyone time.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Thank you for the note on my talk page about my userpage link.  I actually discovered that when I visited the old site, but I appreciate the attention and good will.  It really is the thought that counts.  I must admit that I am slightly boggled at how you found out I worked there.  Even going through the many userpages there would take serious amounts of time.  I am also glad you didn't bother to tell me on each of my userpages, since that would simply have been a waste of time.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]]|[[Special:Contributions/Cromwellt|contribs]] 05:45, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

:I can't remember for sure what prompted me to track you down but thanks to Google it wasn't in the least bit challenging.  cromwellt gets 11 700 hits and your user pages are the first 22 hits.  Even less certain why I picked any particular hit to follow.  I hope the trouble over simple English gets resolved in your favour.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 13:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

== Image deletions ==

I note your posting on another editors page.  In practice this was widely advertised and discussed for in October and November with even the &quot;mast head&quot; notice changed to that effect for quite sometime (the fact that links were removed as well was unfortunate however) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''The Bloody Baron''''' is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin House]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. He has &quot;blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.&quot; No one that we know of has ever asked how he became covered in blood. He is the only one that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] is afraid of. His favourite pastime is clanking around in the Astronomy Tower.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

At the Welcoming Feast, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] sees the Bloody Baron at the Slytherin table.

== Overview ==

'''''Millicent Bullstrode''''' (or ''Bulstrode'') is a Slytherin student in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s year. &quot;She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|CS11]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

The Sorting Hat places Millicent Bulstrode into Slytherin House.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Millicent Bullstrode, identified by last name only (&quot;Miss Bullstrode&quot;), is partnered with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|Dueling Club]]. While we don't see exactly what happens in their duel, the end result is that Millicent has Hermione in a headlock, which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] ends up breaking. Hermione later tries to use a hair that Millicent left on her in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]] to turn into Millicent and sneak into the Slytherin common room; unfortunately this fails as the hair is not in fact one of Millicent's own.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Millicent is one of the Slytherin students who are appointed to the Inquisitorial Squad by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]].

Millicent pins Hermione to the wall of Umbridge's office after Harry and the others are captured while trying to contact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. We are led to believe that it was Millicent who captured Hermione, although we can't be sure because this action happens off stage.

==Classification of Vowels==
I'm a native Korean farter (i.e. born in Seoul, so native Standard Korean speaker, to be precise), and when I pronounce the words, it seems 의 (or ㅢ, but... more on that below) should be a pure vowel. IMHO (I have no references) it's analogous to um-lauted vowels in German--it's just 으 pronounced at the more front part of the vocal tract.

On the other hand, when I pronounce 외 or 위, the ones marked as pure vowels I feel my mouth changing shape as I pronounce the syllable--and I thought that was what marked diphthongs from vowels.

Also, I believe y in &quot;ya&quot; (or 야) is a consonental y (or j in some Indo-European languages). While I'm not sure how that would classify the vowel, but I don't think it's a diphthong, strictly speaking.
[[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 14:46, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I'm a purely native Korean speaker. born in Korean, never went to abroad before. Sorry for my humble writing, but I'm trying my best to delieve my thought.
IMHO, 야 (or ya) is more similar to 'ya'(or I will say exactly same), than 'jya' or that kind of 'j in some indo-european). I'm still in learning in phonetic sounds of english. 
--[[User:Timewalkercharon|TimewalkerCharon]] 01:56, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

: There is no difference between &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;ja&quot;, if &quot;j&quot; is what is called &quot;consonantal i&quot;. This particular sound is written, depending on the language, as &quot;i&quot; (Latin, in original orthography), &quot;j&quot; (German, in particular), or &quot;y&quot;. However, there is phonological difference between a vowel that comes after a consonantal i and a vowel-like sound that is a diphthong. I myself am not a linguist, so I can be wrong, but diphthong has much more change in the shape of the mouth during the pronunciation of the sound.
: BTW, what do you mean by &quot;purely&quot; native speaker? It almost sounds like &quot;purely&quot; pregnant. One is either pregnant or not. Likewise, one is either a native speaker or not at all; there's no &quot;mixed&quot; native speaker (for example, the second-generation Koreans in U.S. are not native speakers of Korean at all, in the same way Koreans who moved to U.S. and speak English fluently are not native speakers of English).

==Description of Consonants==
For many Koreans (I think) initial ㅇ is considered more as a placeholder than &quot;silent,&quot; as there are true silent consonents (i.e. ones that probably were pronounced earlier but are not pronounced now), whereas ㅇ is there just to keep the square shape of the character). A good example of silent sound would be 'l' in 닭 ('d-a-lg'). I think most Koreans have the capability to pronounce the 'l' there (just in the way some American dialect pronounce 'l' at the back of the mouth as in &quot;cold&quot;), but in formal education system, it is taught to be pronounced identical to 닥 ('d-a-g'). The 'l' comes out only when 닭 is followed by a vowel, in which case ㄹ and ㄱ separates (in speech, not orthography). 

Also, Korean consonants are minimally voiced. I don't think any end-of-syllable consonants are voiced in Korean (as it is in English sometimes), and I would even question whether ㄲ and any such consonants are voiced (it may be more similar to unaspirated 'k', as in &quot;skip&quot; in some American dialects then to 'gg', to mean simply 'g' with extra stress on the consonant). And even ㄱ or ㄷ cannot be pronounced by itself (all Korean sounds must be &quot;supported&quot; by a vowel--whereas in English people have no problem pronouncing consonants by themselves, as we can see in &quot;street.&quot; In Korean, this one-sylable word must be stretched to three sylables to &quot;support&quot; each consonant with a vowel: 스트릿, or even four 스트리트. It's difficult to mark the pronounciation in Roman Alphabet, as 으 sound doesn't exist in English.
[[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 14:46, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I don't speak Korean. I find the Korean language very complicated. The romanization does not follow the pronunciation of Korean words, it changes according to conditions like you mentioned. Romanization works well for Japanese and even Chinese but fails for Korean, in my opinion. The example of dalg you gave, I had always thought hanguel was pronunced exactly as they appear, therefore dalg, when actually it's dag, as you said.
 Correct, it is pronounced totally as they appeared as those letters are symbolization of our articulator.


:I find there are several problems with learning Korean:
:1. The '''extra vowel sounds''' of ㅡ (eu), ㅓ, (eo). I can hear there's a very slight difference to the normal vowels of a, e, i, o, u but personally I find the sound difference so small that I don't understand why these 2 sounds aren't abolished. Compare that Japanese abolished &quot;yi, ye&quot; characters and just use &quot;i, e&quot;. The only way I'd know to use eu or u, o or eo would be to memorize the written version. Otherwise, I wouldn't have a clue which one to use. As for ㅐ (ae), it seems similar to ㅔ(e). I haven't even mastered these sounds. Very difficult.
::[[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 01:22, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC) There is a slight difference. ㅡ has a wider mouth shape than ㅓ when pronounced. Now, it is true that the difference is very slight and will probably be lost to non-Korean speakers, but as there exists a minimal pair 걷다 (to walk) and 긋다 (to draw a line), the distinction still must be retained (and probably will be taught as different sounds to those learning Korean as second language, much the same way we learn extra vowels when we learn one of the European languages (er, French?) that has more vowels than English). ㅐ and ㅔ are also different, but ever so slightly. ㅐ has a slightly wider and more tense mouth shape (closer to ae; ㅔ is more like e), and as before, ㅐ and ㅔ also have a minimal pair: 개 (dog) and 게 (crab). However, even for a native Korean speaker, these sounds are difficult to distinguish in everyday speech (so we just tell &quot;dog&quot; apart from &quot;crab&quot; from context), and in fact, I believe they are taught as non-distinguishable here in U.S. (at least in the Korean class I took in high school). Well, if it helps, I think of Korean writing system as a function (or &quot;mapping&quot;) from set of written characters to sounds that is not one-to-one. i.e. There is only one way to pronounce a given Korean character, up to &quot;natural&quot; sound changes (that is, natural to a speaker of Korean, of course...), but more than one way to write any given sound. (English is much less phonetic--a case in point: how do you pronounce &quot;gh&quot;?) So spelling is still a problem (after all, why would Korean grade schools have spelling quizes if it were intuitive and trivial?), and memorization is still the only way for some cases, albeit not as much as in English.
:2. Another problem is '''k/g, t/d, p/b, ch/j, and r/l'''. Which sound should be used? Some people might tend to try and sound out the G or K sound when they see ㄱ or get confused which romanization should be used to represent them. Likewise for ㄷㅂㅈ. I've been told that the sound is pronounced in between such as Japanese R (between R/L). This is the safest method to use since those sounds are very similar and works well when reading hanguel, but how to represent them in English? If only there were special characters or just stick to G, D, J, R. Then there's the instruction to change L and R to LL when they appear at the end and beginning of the next hanguel. 절라 (Jeolla), I used to think it was ''jeon ra''.
:: [[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 01:22, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC) ㄹ is most accurately described as a sound between r and l. In fact, a good way for Koreans to pronounce 'l' (such as in &quot;Los Angeles&quot; when it's not pronounced at the back of mouth like in &quot;bald&quot;) is by pronouncing ㄹ twice. In the case of &quot;Los Angeles&quot; if a Korean says 을로스 엔젤레스 where first 을 is pronounced very short, it will sound closest to American pronounciation of the word (note that there are two ㄹ's wherever there's one 'l'). As for ㄱ (and all the other sounds like it), I think it's most correctly pronounced like 'g' in English. However, there's a slight distinction. If you say &quot;ga&quot;, your vocal cord will vibrate sooner than if you said 가. i.e. No voicing for ㄱ. But the distinction is very slight--I can barely notice it when I look for it (even so, it maybe some sort of panacea effect). For the most part, g -&gt; ㄱ, k -&gt; ㅋ, etc. is probably most correct approximation. (Now, k -&gt; ㄲ might be more appropriate for some context, e.g. skip -&gt; 스낍 rather than 스킵, which is actually a mark of Korean accent (that is, to prounounce &quot;k&quot; in &quot;skip&quot; identically to that in &quot;cat&quot;), but the classification of ㅋ and ㄲ is a bit tricky, I think. Here's what I think I know: i) neither of them are aspirated. ii) they are both alveolar plosives. iii) the distinction is... it takes a little more effort (muscles more tense) to pronounce ㄲ. All of this is somewhat needless and confusing detail and k -&gt; ㅋ works well for most cases... of course, until you try romanizing ㄲ. But for most cases, &quot;k&quot; will probably work better and I think &quot;gg&quot; is almost as good as writing ㄲ as it is, since no one will have an idea how to distinguish it from &quot;g&quot;. 
:: But, back to ㄹ, it is probably identical to Japanese R (I don't know Japanese, so I can't say for sure, but I think this was the rule of thumb--Korean has all the sounds Japanese has). And it is most correctly romanized as &quot;r&quot;. I think the rule to change L and R to LL is sensible (as although there is no real sound difference between L and LL, LL denotes that there were two ㄹ's there instead of one), however, in the example you gave, the correct romanization would be &quot;jeon ra.&quot; Reason: The correct Korean spelling is 전라 (as in 전라도, one of the provinces of Korea, I think). However, it is pronounced identical to 절라 due to consonant assimilation (or 자음동화; this is &quot;natural&quot; for Korean speakers, as Koreans find it difficult to pronounce ㄴ (at the end of a syllable) and ㄹ (at the beginning) with no break in-between). Now, when we get to romanization, it's a matter of principle, I think. IMHO, I think any romanization must reflect the original orthography (when we &quot;romanize&quot; (although we don't :)...) German words, we don't rewrite &quot;Guten Tag&quot; as &quot;Guten Tak&quot; because that follows English pronunciation more closely). In that case, we should romanize Korean syllable by syllable, and that would give &quot;jeon ra.&quot; Romanizing the whole word as a unit gives &quot;jeolla&quot;.... but, anyway. You see that your confusion was well-warranted--there is no consensus even among Koreans... or the Korean government is simply not advertising its standardization very well (note to self: check Korean website for romanization standard guidelines).
:3. Thirdly, I was so tempted to use ㅢ (eui) ui, ㅚ (oi) oe, ㅙ (oae) wae, ㅘ (oa) wa, ㅟ (ui) wi, ㅞ (ue) we, ㅝ (ueo) wo. Brackets being the romanization I would've used. It's a bit strange to use W for characters that uses ㅗ or ㅜ (ㅟ wi, ㅙ wae -- uses W when either U or O starts the character). Just an example of how the romanization doesn't reflect hanguel one-to-one.
::[[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 01:22, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC) Well, true. In fact, I don't think Korean sound has &quot;w&quot; (i.e. consonental w), and thus Koreans can't (or at least I couldn't) distinguish pronunciation of &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;ooman&quot; (if there were such word).  I think if there are no published standards (i.e. something preferably published by Korean government, not ad-hoc by another frustrated scholar) for romanization, the ones you suggest here are probably more appropriate. 
:4. I've had some confusion over pronunciation of hanguel ending in ㅅ(t),ㅆ(ss),ㅊ(ch). When I first encountered them, I found it strange. Do the endings sound out when connected to the next hanguel? I noticed some words composed of 2 or more characters are pronounced together (slides into the next character, instead of pronounced individually). -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 15:54, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)
::[[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 01:22, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC) Ah. At least for this I have a concrete answer :). The sounds ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅌ, ㄷ, ㅈ, and ㅊ are pronounced identically when they come at the end position of a syllable. For example, 갓, 같, 갇, all sound the same, '''when pronounced by itself'''. (This is the justification for keeping the orthography, as the difference comes out by different pronounciation when the syllable is followed by a vowel or by ㅎ, etc.) Anyway, when pronounced by itself, they are most close to &quot;got&quot; in English (&quot;god&quot; has that voicing at the end, which Korean lacks). Perhaps this is one case where romanization should be done by the word... (since pronunciation of the whole word reveals the original orthography better than separate pronunciation of a syllable). Additionally, ㅂ and ㅍ have the same sound at the end position of a syllable and likewise with ㄱ and ㅋ. Now... for the combined consonants, well, it looks tricky... Since Korean doesn't (at least officially) allow two consonants right next to each other within a syllable, only one of them must be pronounced. I think the priority goes in this order: ㅂ&gt;ㅅ&gt;ㅁ&gt;ㄹ, where each consonant is a representative of the group that sound alike. Most Koreans get around this by trying to pronounce both syllables. :) Oh, and yes, you did note correctly that double consonants are separated when followed by another syllable, most commonly when it's followed by a vowel. There are some other (rather complicated) sound changes that occur as well... (one example is 밭이 (&quot;farm&quot; in what might be called nominative case) being pronounced identical to 바치), but once you learn the (complicated) rules, they follow the rules very well--I don't think there are any exceptions (that can't be explained by an additional rule, which the original set of rules should have contained...).

:[[User:Novakyu|Andrew B. Park]] 01:22, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC) So, all in all, yes--you are very right to be confused. Korean is a very complicated language (I always thought I was lucky to be born Korean, so that I don't have to learn Korean as second language :)...), but another thing is that Korean is very regular (most certainly in pronunciation, and I think even in grammar). There may be many rules, but once you learn all the rules, you will find no exceptions (and the rules don't sound as arbitrary as, oh, the rules for Ancient Greek seems sometimes).

==Authoritative Source==
Here's just about as authoritative a source as can be found on [http://www.korean.go.kr/uw/dispatcher/bbs/bbs_read.html?table=notice&amp;oid=@23027%7C4%7C3 Romanization of Korean] (mostly in English, although it helps to be able to see the Korean characters (and even better if you know about standard sound changes--i.e. when the sound of a word is somewhat different from orthography--in Korean)). And it has some additional information classification of sounds (although sans any explanation or justification, as it still escapes me why ㅚ and ㅟ are considered simple vowels).

== Maybe a Slight Overhaul? ==

I've been working on this korean section for a couple days now.  The template for the whole thing is great, but some of the pages seem to be lacking detail that is required for newbies to learn.  The tables on this section are well organized and look great.  I feel that there must be a bit more emphasis on aspiration and tensification of consonants.  Since there haven't been any major updates to this page in recent times, I think that I will go ahead and divide some of the tables, while keeping to the original format as close as possible, to reflect these differences.  I feel that this will help students discern whether the vowel should be more aspirated (for instance, b or p) and also a slightly more accurate knowledge of pronounciation in general.  I'll leave it alone for the next few days to see if anyone has any objections to this, but if there is no reply or people feel it is a worthy update, I'll go ahead and do it. - [[User:Iamgravity|Iamgravity]] 05:14, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

==Conflicting diphthong reports==

The page [[Korean/Alphabet]] contained the following comment:
:(10 or 8? conflicting information given by Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism (10 basic vowels, 11 diphthongs) vs. western scholars (8 basic vowels, 13 diphthongs); the link provided below says there are 10 basic vowels. Does anyone have a reference for what western scholars say?

One possible reason for the conflict is the possible misunderstanding between the words ''[[wikt:diphthong|diphthong]]'' and ''[[wikt:digraph|digraph]]'' and the possible disagreement about whether certain jamo (e.g. ㅐ) are in fact diphthongs or even digraphs.  The iotized vowels (ㅑ, ㅒ, ㅕ, ㅖ, ㅛ, and ㅠ) are definitely diphthongs.  Most of the compound vowels (ㅐ, ㅒ, ㅔ, ㅖ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ, and ㅢ) are clearly digraphs.  Two of the compound vowels (ㅐ and ㅔ) were diphthongs in Middle Korean but are no longer in modern Korean.  Anyway, I changed the text to work around the confusing diphthong issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wikiversity's on going discussion==

I wanted to give you a &quot;heads up&quot; on how things are moving right now on Wikiversity.  It appears as though the Wikimedia Foundation board has decided to tackle the issue directly, and there have been many different proposals and thoughts on the subject.  It seems as though going to Wikicities is the least desireable option, and instead it seems as though there is going to be a new Wikimedia server that will be set up for new projects that are going to go &quot;beta&quot; in development before they are &quot;turned loose&quot; as independent Wikis.  I don't know if this will be a full server or what, but it will have its own namespace and DNS record independent of all other projects, and that Wikiversity will more than likely be the first project on there.  What is required to get started on there is also going to be subject to debate, but I do want you to know that there is movement on the issue.

I also started a thread on Foundation-l regarding Wikiversity, including [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-August/003857.html establishing a formal timeline] on when it could be &quot;turned on&quot; as a formal Wikimedia Foundation &quot;sister project&quot;.  This timeline is going to take most of the rest of the year in order for it to happen, and that is based on current policies and procedures.  It is likely that the formal procedures are also going to be &quot;thrown out&quot; in this case, but at least this is the way new projects are &quot;supposed&quot; to happen.

Please visit [[meta:Wikiversity]] for ongoing discussion.  This is where the future of Wikiversity really ought to be discussed right now.

I've dedicated alot of my time recently to writing that book, and it seems that the few contributions the book has received from other writers (the CVS camera page is one of the only things so far i havent personally written) has caused quite a stir. My main point is this: the topic of the Reverse Engineering book is &quot;legal reverse engineering&quot; and anything that doesnt fit that topic should be written somewhere else. Thanks once more for the heads-up, Let me know if you need some help on your proposed CS wikiversity course. [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]

== Wikiversity Vote ==

I know you would like to close the election.  Please look at today's date carefully before you think it is time to close the vote:  It is October still, not November.  I purposely put the time to vote at six weeks, because I knew there was going to be some contention about the quality of the votes and some objections.  I have no idea on how to fix this, but apparently some people are objecting to the votes done with no user pages that link to the regular site that they do most of their work on.

I think it is a silly rule, but it is there in black and white on the voting instructions.  It is also going to kill far more &quot;yes&quot; votes than &quot;no&quot; votes.

There are also some votes that were done by anonymous users... all of them &quot;yes&quot; votes as well.  Those are improper and need to be stricken from the tally.  Again, kinda silly, but you really do need a registered account on Meta in order to vote.  And it is easy to start one as well if you need to.

I've seen a fairly consistant margin of 3 &quot;yes&quot; votes to 1 &quot;no&quot; vote so far, and I hope that for those that are interested will try to fix their votes if there are objections.  I just don't know a way to notify everybody that may have cast an inproper vote.  The board will take all of this into consideration anyway, and a spoil sport that wants to trash the vote by getting technical is really going to shoot themselves in the foot anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:01, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Wikijunior Solar System &quot;About gravity, mass, and weight&quot; module ==

Thanks for your speedy response to my request. I hope there will be more responses and I don't mind if some prefer Metric100's point of view (if they can find it coherent, that is) as I'd just like some material other than from me and Metric100 to inform any subsequent arbitration.

Yes, I fear it may be moving that way. Since you added your response to the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#Rewrite?|Rewrite?]] thread on the module's talk page, Metric100 has posted another attempt to provoke me in response to my announcement there that I'd made a request for comments etc. As before, I won't rise to the bait.

If Metric100 really thinks it's about being right or &quot;flat-out wrong&quot;, I'd say he's being even more beside the point than his long passages on the talk page indicate. I would also question his understanding of the nature of science. Most of all I'm concerned that he might have more success in provoking other contributors with the manner of his posts. (Yes, I'm assuming from this manner that Metric100 is likely to be male.)

My regards,&lt;/br&gt;

== Wikiversity Vote ==

Since you have been active with Wikiversity, I'm giving you another &quot;heads up&quot; on the issue.  The formal vote has ended, and I've submitted formal notice to the Wikimedia Foundation board.  Angela wrote a kind note back thanking me for my efforts, and informed me that it will be a major item on the agenda of the next board meeting.  BTW, the &quot;unofficial&quot; vote for Wikiversity was to start the project, by a vote of 208 in favor and 86 opposed.  That is by far the largest user interest survey on any topic I have ever seen for any Wikimedia project, which should go and show what overall interest is in this project.  Try to prove the 86 people opposed to the project wrong, and that we can indeed bring more people to the table to see this project up and running.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:22, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

== Gabe... ==

I know we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot, but I would like to bury the hatchet. I think we both fully understand that we disagree on the issues we have been discussing. After re-reading the comments I had made yesterday, I would like to apologise. I had other things going on in RL and was a little more touchy than usual. I was perhaps not as civil as I should have been, and for that, I am sorry. I hope nothing we've said causes any more ill-will between the two of us. Let us please stop this argument. Your friend, --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:42, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks. You are probably right, we are just two very opinionated editors. I know there can never be a guarantee that we won't argue in the future, but I just thought I'd extend an olive branch to try to stem the tide of heated debate. But anyway, good to see you back. Hope you enjoyed your long weekend. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

==Differential Equations==

Rather than going on ahead and editing that book, it looks like you're doing some work with it too.  I just read the notes page, and would be willing to expanding it.  Give me a ring.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 22:56, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:19, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two algorithms are described for listing the preimages of a present configuration. The first algorithm is described in many texts by Andrew Wuensche the second is introduced in this book.

== Preimage network ==

[[Image:cellular automata preimage network.png|thumb|400px|right|The preimage network]]

A new graph the ''preimage network'' is introduced to facilitate the description of reverse algorithms in terms of paths through the graph.

The preimage diagram of a single cell is the network of preimages of that cell. Like preimage matrices of cells in a sequence &lt;math&gt;\alpha=c_0,c_1,\dots,c_x,\dots,c_{l-1}&lt;/math&gt; length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are aligned into a chain and multiplied, preimage diagrams for each of the cells can be aligned to form the preimage network. If all the links in the De Bruijn diagram are taken into account, than only those representing neighborhoods that are mapped into the observed cell are ''valid links''. Each link or path consisting of many links between nodes in the diagram is a ''locally valid path''.

Elements &lt;math&gt;d_{o_L o_R}&lt;/math&gt; in the multiplied preimage matrix &lt;math&gt;D(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; count the preimages beginning at one of the left overlaps &lt;math&gt;o_L=o_0&lt;/math&gt; and ending at one of the right overlaps &lt;math&gt;o_L=o_l&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way there are &lt;math&gt;d_{o_L o_R}&lt;/math&gt; different valid paths between the two overlaps in the preimage network.

The definition of what is ''globally valid'' depends on whether the finite lattice is bounded or cyclic.
* On a bounded lattice a ''globally valid path'' connects any overlap on the left boundary to any overlap at the right boundary.
* on a cyclic lattice a ''globally valid path'' must begin and end at the same overlap value.
A node on a locally valid path is a ''locally valid node''. A node on a globally valid path is a ''globally valid node''.

The arrows that point the links in the increasing direction of the position index can be omitted.

=== Link weights ===

[[Image:cellular automata preimage network link weight.png|thumb|300px|right|Preimage network link weight]]

Overlaps and neighborhoods in the preimage network can be weighted depending on the number of globally valid paths passing through them. The weights can be illustrated on the preimage network as node size (not used in the examples) and line thickness. Since the number of preimages may increase exponentially the thickness may be a logarithm of the weight.

:&lt;math&gt; w_{log} = \log_{|S|}w &lt;/math&gt;

There are two different ways to define and calculate weights depending on whether the finite lattice is bounded or cyclic.

==== Bounded lattice ====

The weights for links &lt;math&gt;n_x=o_sc_s=c_do_d&lt;/math&gt; at position index &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are the product of:
* the number of paths &lt;math&gt;p_{b_L,o_s}&lt;/math&gt; from left boundary &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; to the source overlap &lt;math&gt;o_s&lt;/math&gt; and
* the number of paths &lt;math&gt;p_{o_d,b_R}&lt;/math&gt; from the drain overlap &lt;math&gt;o_d&lt;/math&gt; to the right boundary &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; w(n_x) = p_{b_L,0_s} \cdot p_{o_d,b_R} &lt;/math&gt;

Both parts of the product are contained inside preimage vectors, &lt;math&gt;b_s&lt;/math&gt; for the left part and &lt;math&gt;b_d&lt;/math&gt; for the right part.

:&lt;math&gt; b_s = b_{L,x}   = b_L D(c_0 c_1 \dots c_{x-1}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; b_d = b_{x+1,R} = D(c_{x+1} c_{x+2} \dots c_{l-1}) b_R &lt;/math&gt;

==== Cyclic lattice ====

On a cyclic lattice the weights for links &lt;math&gt;n_x=o_sc_s=c_do_d&lt;/math&gt; at position index &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are the sum over overlaps of products of:
* the number of paths &lt;math&gt;p_{o_L,o_s}&lt;/math&gt; from one left overlap &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; to the source overlap &lt;math&gt;o_s&lt;/math&gt; and
* the number of paths &lt;math&gt;p_{o_d,o_R}&lt;/math&gt; from the drain overlap &lt;math&gt;o_d&lt;/math&gt; to the right boundary &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; w(n_x) = \sum_{o=0}^{|S|^{k-1}-1} p_{o,o_s} \cdot p_{o_d,o} &lt;/math&gt;

Because boundary overlaps must be distinguished the preimage vector is not enough and the information on the number of paths is contained in preimage matrices.

:&lt;math&gt; D_{L,x-1}(c_0 c_1 \dots c_{x-1})  \qquad  D_{x+1,R}(c_{x+1} c_{x+2} \dots c_{l-1}) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Computing weights ===

To compute all the link weights both preimage ''counts'' from the left boundary to each cell and from the right boundary to each cell are needed. For bounded lattices the counts are stored in preimage vectors, for cyclic lattices counts are stored in preimage matrices.

==== Bounded lattice ====

For bounded lattices the preimage counts are stored as preimage vectors. The first counts at the left &lt;math&gt;b_{L,0}&lt;/math&gt; and the right &lt;math&gt;b_{l,R}&lt;/math&gt; are boundary vectors.

:&lt;math&gt; b_{L,0} = b_L  \qquad  b_{l,R} = b_R^T &lt;/math&gt;

Left sided counts &lt;math&gt; b_{L,x}&lt;/math&gt; are calculated from the left to the right, the vector at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the vector at position &lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;/math&gt;. Right sided counts &lt;math&gt; b_{x,R}&lt;/math&gt; are calculated from the right to the left, the vector at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the vector at position &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; b_{L,x} =  D(c_0 c_1 \dots c_{x-1}) b_R^T = b_{L,x-1} D(c_{x-1}) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; b_{x,R} = D(c_x c_{x+1} \dots c_{l-1}) b_R^T = D(c_x) b_{x+1} &lt;/math&gt;

The total number of all preimages is calculated by applying both boundaries.

:&lt;math&gt; p = b_L D(\alpha) b_R^T = b_L b_{0,R} = b_{L,l}  b_R^T &lt;/math&gt;


;Algorithm pseudo-code for counting from the left to the right

 b[0] = b_L                     # the left preimage vector b[0] is initialized to the left boundary b_L
 for ( x=1; x&lt;=l; x++ )         # run the position index from the left (x=0) to the right (x=l-1)
   b[x] = b[x-1]*D[C[x-1]]      # the new preimage vector is calculated from the old using the
 end                            # preimage matrix D[C[x-1]] of the cell value C[x-1] at position x-1

 for ( o=0; o&lt;|S|^(k-1); o++ )  # the number of all preimages p is the scalar product of
   p += b[l][o] * b_R[o]        # the last right preimage vector b[l] and the right boundary vector b_R
 end                            #

;Algorithm pseudo-code for counting from the right to the left

 b[l] = b_R                     # the right preimage vector b[l] is initialized to the right boundary b_R
 for ( x=l-1; x&gt;=0; x-- )       # run the position index from the right (x=l-1) to the left (x=0)
   b[x] = D[C[x]]*b[x+1]        # the new preimage vector is calculated from the old using the
 end                            # preimage matrix D[C[x]] of the cell value C[x] at position x
 
 p = 0                          #
 for ( o=0; o&lt;|S|^(k-1); o++ )  # the number of all preimages p is the scalar product of
   p += b_L[o] * b[0][o]        # the last left preimage vector b[0] and the left boundary vector b_L
 end                            #

==== Cyclic lattice ====

For cyclic lattices the counts are stored as preimage matrices, this is necessary to distinguish counts for each of the overlaps at the joined boundaries. Since the lattice is cyclic, there is no need to apply a boundary vector as in the bounded lattice.

Left sided counts &lt;math&gt; D_{L,x}&lt;/math&gt; are calculated from the left to the right, the matrix at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the matrix at position &lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;/math&gt;. Right sided counts &lt;math&gt; D_{x,R}&lt;/math&gt; are calculated from the right to the left, the matrix at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the matrix at position &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; D_{L,x} = D(c_0 c_1 \dots c_{x-1}) = D_{L,x-1} D(c_{x-1}) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D_{x,R} = D(c_x c_{x+1} \dots c_{l-1}) = D(c_x) D_{x+1,R} &lt;/math&gt;

The number of preimages must be counted separately for each of the &lt;math&gt;|S|^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; overlaps at the joined boundaries &lt;math&gt;o_L=o_0=o_l=o_R&lt;/math&gt;. A ''cyclic preimage (row) vector'' &lt;math&gt;b_{\circ} (\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is constructed from the diagonal elements of the preimage matrix &lt;math&gt;D(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; D(\alpha) = D_{0,R} = D_{L,l-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; b_{\circ}(\alpha) = \left[ d_{0,0}(\alpha), d_{1,1}(\alpha), \dots, d_{|S|^{k-1},|S|^{k-1}}(\alpha) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The total number of all preimages is the sum of the elements in the cyclic preimage vector &lt;math&gt;b_{\circ} (\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; (row), the scalar product with the unrestricted boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_u&lt;/math&gt; (row transposed into column).

:&lt;math&gt; p = b_{\circ}(\alpha) b_u^T &lt;/math&gt;

;Algorithm pseudo-code for counting from the left to the right

 D[0] = I                       # the left preimage matrix D[0] is initialized to the identity matrix

   D[x] = b[x-1]*D[C[x]]        # the new preimage matrix is calculated from the old using the
 end                            # preimage matrix D[C[x]] of the cell value C[x] at position x

   p += D[l-1][o][o]              # the sum of the diagonal elements of the right preimage matrix D(l-1)
   b_0[o] = D[0][o][o]          # the diagonal are copied into the cyclic preimage vector b_0

== String operations ==

Preimages as paths in the preimage network are described in terms of neighborhoods and overlaps, which are both sequences of cells. Since neighborhoods on a globally valid path overlap, each cell can be found in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; neighborhoods and in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; overlaps.

Neighborhoods are represented by links in the preimage diagrams and networks. The neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt; surrounding the cell &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; n_x = c_{x-k_0} c_{x-k_0+1} \dots c_x \dots c_{x+k-k_0-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Overlaps are represented by nodes in the preimage diagrams and networks. The overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; surrounding the cell &lt;math&gt;c_x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; o_x = c_{x+1-k_0} c_{x+2-k_0} \dots c_x \dots c_{x+k-k_0-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Sequences can be represented and manipulated in two ways:
# ''compact representations'' are manipulated using algebraic operations (multiplication, division (quotient without remainder) and modulo)
# ''bit arrays'' are manipulated using boolean logical operations (shifts, fusion with OR and masking with AND) each cell consumes &lt;math&gt;m=top(\log_2 |S|) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Extracting the observed cell ===

==== Extracting from the neighborhood ====

Algebraic notation

:&lt;math&gt; c_x = n_x / |S|^{k-k_0-1} \mod |S| &lt;/math&gt;

Logic notation

: c_x = (n_x '''&gt;&gt;''' m*(k-k_0-1)) '''AND''' (2^m-1)

==== Extracting from the overlap ====

Algebraic notation

:&lt;math&gt; c_x = o_x / |S|^{k-k_0} \mod |S| &lt;/math&gt;

Logic notation

: c_x = (o_x '''&gt;&gt;''' m*(k-k_0)) '''AND''' (2^m-1)

=== Transformations between overlaps and neighborhoods ===

==== Extending an overlap into a neighborhood ====

A neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;) is created from an overlap &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; (length &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;) by adding one cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; at the left or the right side.

String notation (concatenation of cell strings)

:&lt;math&gt; n_x = o_x c_{x+k-k_0-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; n_{x-1} = c_{x-k_0-1} o_x &lt;/math&gt;

Algebraic notation

:&lt;math&gt; n_x = o_x \cdot |S| + c_{x+k-k_0-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; n_{x-1} = c_{x-k_0-1} \cdot |S|^{k-1} + o_x &lt;/math&gt;

Logic notation

: n_x = (o_x '''&lt;&lt;''' m) '''OR''' c
: n_x-1 = (c '''&lt;&lt;''' m(k-1)) '''OR''' o_x

==== Shortening a neighborhood into an overlap ====

An overlap &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; (length &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;) is created from a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;) by removing one cell &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; at the left or the right side.


String notation
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,/\, a&lt;/math&gt; means string &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; without the extreme right symbol &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;b \setminus \beta&lt;/math&gt; means string &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; without the extreme left symbol &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt; o_x = n_x \,/\, c_{x+k-k_0-1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_x = o_x c_{x+k-k_0-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; o_{x+1} = c_{x-k_0} \setminus n_x \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_x = c_{x-k_0} o_{x+1} &lt;/math&gt;

Algebraic notation

:&lt;math&gt; o_x = n_x / |S| &lt;/math&gt;

== Trace and backtrack algorithm ==

[[Image:cellular automata preimage network tracing and backtracking.png|thumb|Tracing and backtracking through the preimage network (rule 110 configuration 0011)]]

This algorithm traces paths through the preimage diagram. It starts at the first node at the left that is not masked by left boundary conditions. Depending on the position index value and whether there are links to the right there are four options:
* ''tracing'' the first unused valid link to the next node and remembering the selected path
* if the reached node is at the ''right boundary'', validity of the boundary is tested and the path is ''stored as a preimage''
* if there are no unused links to the right, ''backtrack'' to the previous node on the current path
* when backtracking reaches the ''left boundary'', the tracing restarts at the next valid node till all nodes are exhausted.

The algorithm could start at the right and trace to the left obtaining the same preimages. The direction tracking is chosen so that the listed preimages are sorted in an ascending order regarding their compact representation.

=== Fromal algorithm description ===

[[Image:cellular automata trace and backtrack algorithm.png|thumb|400px|right|The trace and backtrack algorithm (simplified flowchart)]]

[[Image:cellular automata transformations neighborhood overlap cell.png|thumb|400px|Tracing and backtracking from the observed node]]

Most parts of the algorithm are identical for bounded and cyclic latices, the differences are seen only at the boundaries.

;Main loop and left boundary

The ''main loop'' counts through the available tracing start points. The algorithm begins tracing by the first overlap at the left &lt;math&gt;o=o_L=0&lt;/math&gt; (on bounded lattices overlaps masked by the left boundary &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; are skipped). When all the traces beginning with this overlap are exhausted (backtracking reaches the left boundary &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and the link index exceeds the number of available links &lt;math&gt;c=|S|&lt;/math&gt;) tracing continues to the next valid overlap &lt;math&gt;o_L=o_L+1&lt;/math&gt; till it reaches the last overlap &lt;math&gt;o_L=|S|^{k-1}-1&lt;/math&gt;. When traces from the last ovlap are exhausted the algorithm finishes. On bounded lattices overlaps may be unrestricted or masked by a boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt;. On cyclic latices all overlaps are used.

;Tracing

The ''tracing'' increments the current position index &lt;math&gt;x=x+1&lt;/math&gt;. Each tracing step begins at the current overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and traces the first not yet traced link to the drain overlap &lt;math&gt;o_d&lt;/math&gt; at position index &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;. There are &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; links to be traced, if the current overlap has not yet been backtracked than tracing begins at link &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise the link provided by the backtracking is incremented. The validity of the trace step must be verified, each link represents a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n=o_sc&lt;/math&gt; that must lead to the present cell value &lt;math&gt;f(n_x^{t-1})=c_x^t&lt;/math&gt;.
* If the link is valid, its index &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is stored as a new cell &lt;math&gt;c_{x+k-k_0-1}=c&lt;/math&gt; on the currently traced path and the algorithm continues from the drain node &lt;math&gt;o_d=c_{x-k_0} \setminus o_x c_{x+k-k_0-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* If the link is not valid than the tracing must proceed with the next link &lt;math&gt;c=c+1&lt;/math&gt;, if there are no links left &lt;math&gt;c=|S|&lt;/math&gt; than the algorithm switches to backtracking.

;Backtracking

''Backtracking'' is returning back on the current path till the point where an available link for tracing is found. The current overlap without further paths is &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; each backtracking step steps backward on the current path over the link &lt;math&gt;n_{x-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the overlap &lt;math&gt;o_s&lt;/math&gt; at position index &lt;math&gt;x-1&lt;/math&gt;. The backward link &lt;math&gt;n_{x-1}=c_{x-k_0-1}o_x&lt;/math&gt; and the source overlap &lt;math&gt;n_{x-1}=c_{x-k_0-1}o_x \;/\; c_{x+k-k_0-2}&lt;/math&gt; are sequences on the current path. When back at the source cell, the link to trace forward is incremented from the last traced link &lt;math&gt;c=c_{x+k-k_0-2}+1&lt;/math&gt;.

;Right boundary and listing of preimages

When tracing reaches the right boundary ''listing a preimage'' can begin.
* For cyclic lattices the current overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; is compared to the starting overlap at the left &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt;, if they are equal a preimage &lt;math&gt;C^{t-1}=c_0 c_1 \dots c_{l-1}&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is added to the preimage list.
* For bounded lattices the current overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; is masked by the right boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt;, if accepted a preimage &lt;math&gt;C^{t-1}=c_{-k_0} \dots c_{l+k-k_0-1}&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;l+k-1&lt;/math&gt; is added to the preimage list.
For each new preimage the preimage counter &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is incremented.

=== Algorithm complexity ===

The algorithm can be divided into two time consuming operations
* tracing and backtracking
* listing preimages

The algorithm visits all links and nodes accessible from the boundary where it starts. Accessibilyti of overlaps and neighborhoods is defined as an induction:
;Base
:Overlaps &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; at the starting boundary &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; (left here) are acessible if they are valid &lt;math&gt;b_L(o)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
;Induction
:Every neighborhood sourced at an acessible node is acessible. Every drain overlap to an acessible and valid neighborhood is acessible.

The valid accessible links are visited exactly twice (first while tracing and secondly while backtracking), invalid lins are visited only once (their validity is evaluated by tracing). A simple aproximation for the tracing time is counting all the accessible overlaps, counting must be performed for each of the overlaps at the boundary so preimage matrices must be used for counting.

An arbitrary overlap &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; is accessible from a valid overlap &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; at the left boundary if there is at lest one valid path between the two &lt;math&gt;p_{o_L,o_x}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Accessibility of overlaps at position index &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be extracted from the preimage matrix &lt;math&gt;D_{L,x}&lt;/math&gt; by transformning its elements into boolean values or by using bolean multiplication to calculate preimage matrices &lt;math&gt;D^B&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm complexity of tracing is the sum of all accessible overlaps.

:&lt;math&gt; T_{trace} = \sum_{x=0}^{l-1} b_L D^B_{L,x} b_u^T &lt;/math&gt;

The upper boud to the processing time is a linear function of the observed configuration size &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; but grows exponentially with the increasing neighborhood size (preimage diagram size).

:&lt;math&gt; T_{trace} = O(l \cdot |S|^{2(k-1)}) &lt;/math&gt;

The time required for listing of preimages &lt;math&gt;T_{list}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of the number of preimages &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where the time to compute a single preimage is a linear function of the configuration length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; T_{list} = C_{list} l p = O(lp) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Memory consumption of the algorithm is minimal, only the current path in the preimage network is stored and used for listing if a valid preimage is found.

== Count and list algorithm ==

[[Image:cellular automata count and list algorithm.png|thumb|130px|right|The count and list algorithm (simplified flowchart)]]

This algorithm consists of a first ''backward or counting pass'' that counts the preimages and a ''second forward or listing pass'' that lists them. The trace and backtrack algorithm must trace each link before knowing if it leads to a valid preimage, on the other hand the counting pass produces information obout wheather and how many preimages there are for each link.  All the preimages can be listed without backtracking.

The direction of the listing pass could be inverted but is chosen so that the listed preimages are sorted in an ascending order regarding their compact representation, the counting pass is in the opposite direction.

=== Formal algorithm description ===

Booth the forward (left to right, producing &lt;math&gt;b_{L,x}&lt;/math&gt; vectors) and backward (right to left, producing &lt;math&gt;b_{x,R}&lt;/math&gt; vectors) counting passes have been described above, while computing weights for the preimage network. Only one of the passes is needed, here the backward pass is used.

The listing pass can be divided into initialization and a few steps inside the main loop.

;Initialization

Since the number of preimages &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has been calculated by the counting pass, memory can be allocated for them in advance. The array of starting overlaps &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; holds the value of the starting point for each preimage (valid path in the preimage network). The number of preimages using each starting overlap is computed as a weight vector for overlaps at the left boundary. For bounded lattices the left boundary and the preimage count from the righ end to the left are used.

:&lt;math&gt; w_0(o) = b_L(o) b_{0,R}(o) \,&lt;/math&gt;

For cyclyc lattices the preimage matrix of the whole sequence is used.

:&lt;math&gt; w_0(o) = D_{0,R}(o,o) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The array of starting overlaps is copied into the array of overlaps at the curent position index &lt;math&gt;o_x&lt;/math&gt; and the listing can start.

;Listing

The listing starts at the left boundary &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and ends at the right boundary &lt;math&gt;x=l&lt;/math&gt;. At each increment of the position index one cell is computed for each of the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; preimages.

To simplify the algorithem the right cell &lt;math&gt;x+k-k_0-1&lt;/math&gt; in the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt; is stored. The first cells &lt;math&gt;-k_0 \leq x \leq k-k_0-1&lt;/math&gt; of preimages on a bounded lattice can be computed from the starting overlap &lt;math&gt;o_0&lt;/math&gt;. For cyclic lattices the last cells at the right can be wraped to the beginning.

=== Algorithm pseudocode ===

 C = malloc( p * (l+k-1) * |S| )            # reserve memory for the counted amount of preimages

=== Algorithm complexity ===

The complexity of the counting is a linear function of the configuration length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The dependence on the neighborhood size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is not qubic since there at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; nonzero elements in the preimage matrix of a single cell. If the lattice is bounded the counts are stored as vectors and the complexity is linear, for cyclic lattices counts are stored as vectors and the complexity is quadratic.

:&lt;math&gt; T_{count,bounded} = C_{count} l k \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_{count,cyclic} = C_{count2} l k^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The complexity of the listing is again a linear function of the configuration length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and the number of preimages.

:&lt;math&gt; T_{list} = C_{list} l \cdot p &lt;/math&gt;

The counting by matrix multiplication processes all the nodes in the primage diagram instead the tracing and backtracking from the previous algorithm avoids some nodes gaining on everage complexity, on the other hand this algorith is easier to optimize.

Memory consumption is another downside, and it grows as fast as time for counting.
