      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Up until 1982, the previous section covered just about all of Canadian constitutional law. In just over two decades, the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' has had a predictably enormous impact on constitutional law. The most important section of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', both for the legal community and for the general population, has been the &lt;i&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;''Charter''&quot;). The Supreme Court of Canada has spent most of the past twenty years interpreting the ''Charter'', an in so doing, has caused governments and lawyers to rewrite the basic rules of almost every area of public law.

Before the ''Charter'' came into effect, Canadian law had a melange of legal human rights protections. For the average person, they worked very well, although what most people now consider enormous injustices were legally inflicted on some. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Unwritten Constitution protected some human rights. In [http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/en/browseSubjects/roncarelli.asp ''Roncarelli'' v. ''Duplessis'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[1959]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 121.], the Court ruled that the Constitution protected the people from arbitrary action by government officials. The federal government enacted the [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-12.3/ ''Canadian Bill of Rights''] in 1960, although it is now remembered mainly for the occasions that courts refused to apply it. In addition, some provinces had human rights legislation which forbade people from exercising their civil rights in discriminatory ways. However, as a general rule, no instrument permitted courts to strike down laws which violated human rights. This changed in 1982 by virtue of s. 52 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', which stated that any law that violated the Constitution, including the new part of the Constitution containing the ''Charter'', was of no force or effect.

In order to give full effect to the ''Charter'', the Supreme Court of Canada decided to give the ''Charter'' a &quot;broad and liberal interpretation.&quot; ([http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1985/vol1/html/1985scr1_0295.html R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., &lt;nowiki&gt;[1985]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 295]). The Court adopted a &quot;purposive&quot; approach, asking what the purpose of protecting the rights in question are, and giving effect to those purposes through the Court's interpretations of their meanings. This contrasts with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the ''Canadian Bill of Rights'', in which the meaning of the words of the Bill were interpreted so narrowly that the Bill protected virtually no rights in practice.

==Applicability of the Charter==
According to s.32, the ''Charter'' applies to &quot;the Parliament and government of Canada&quot; and the &quot;legislature and government of each province&quot;. It does not apply to private individuals or corporations. If Mr. Smith discriminates against Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones cannot go to court and sue Mr. Smith for violating his ''Charter'' rights (although Mr. Jones would probably be protected against discrimination by other legislation). Of course, the &quot;legislature and government&quot; is a broad term. How far does it apply? To organizations that receive government grants? To people who bring a private dispute to a court created by the government?

In [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/cgi-bin/disp.pl/en/pub/1986/vol2/html/1986scr2_0573.html ''RWDSU'' v. ''Dolphin Delivery'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[1986]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2 S.C.R. 573], the Supreme Court of Canada decided that the ''Charter'' did not apply to a dispute between two private parties before the courts. More controversially, it also decided that the ''Charter'' did not apply to the common law, unless the common law was the basis for government action. So, even if the common law restrictions against picketing violated the picketer's freedom of expression, the ''Charter'' would not protect him from being sued by the target of the picketing.

The &quot;effective control test&quot; determines whether an organization is part of the government or not for the purposes of ''Charter'' s.32. In [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/cgi-bin/disp.pl/en/pub/1990/vol3/html/1990scr3_0229.html ''Mckinney'' v. ''University of Guelph,'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[1990]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 S.C.R. 229], the Court decided that Universities are not part of the Government, even though they receive most of their money from the government. The main question to ask is how much control the government has over the institution: Is there a law that directs how the institution will operate? Does the government appoint the majority of the institution's board of directors? Does the institution have any history or guarantees of independent action from government? The greater the government control over the operation of the institution, the more likely it is to be a part of the government, although different Supreme Court decisions have required different amounts of control.

==Limits on Rights==
The first section of the ''Charter,'' somewhat surprisingly, is the main section placing limits on the rights and freedoms contained in the ''Charter''. Section 1 states: &quot;'''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.'''&quot;

For ''Charter'' rights to be limited, the limits must meet three requirements:
# They must be ''reasonable'' in a free and democratic society
# They must be ''prescribed by law''
# They must be ''demonstrably justified''

The second and third requirements are relatively clear. &quot;Prescribed by law&quot; means that the limits must be written either in legislation or regulation. A governmental limit on ''Charter'' rights cannot be arbitrarily decided by an official. Nor can it be contained in rules which do not amount to &quot;law&quot;, such as administrative manuals. &quot;Demonstrably justified&quot; means that the burden of proof is on the government to prove that the limits it has imposed are reasonable. In court, this means that once the plaintiff proves on a balance of probabilities that his or her rights have been violated, the government must prove on a balance of probabilities that it is reasonable.

On the other hand, the question of what constitutes a &quot;reasonable limit&quot; in a &quot;free and democratic society&quot; is perhaps the most important question of modern constitutional law. Most major ''Charter'' cases in Canada do not turn on the question of whether a right has been violated (the courts often find that it has been), but whether the law constituted a reasonable limit on that right.

The test for deciding whether the violation of a ''Charter'' right is a reasonable limit on a right or freedom was created by the Supreme Court in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/cgi-bin/disp.pl/en/pub/1986/vol1/html/1986scr1_0103.html R. v. Oakes, &lt;nowiki&gt;[1986]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 103]. Known simply as the Oakes test, it asks the following questions:

* Is the purpose of the legislation to limit the charter right or freedom? If so, it is not a reasonable limit.
* Is the limit proportional to the objective? It is if it meets all of the three following criteria:
** The limit has a &quot;pressing and substantial objective&quot;
** The limit infringes on the ''Charter'' right as little as possible to meet its objective (aka the &quot;minimal impairment test&quot;)
** The benefit of the limit is greater than the harm caused by limiting the right or freedom

The Oakes test is still used by the Supreme Court, although it has nuanced the second part of the proportionality test. The Supreme Court found that a limit on a right should infringe at right &quot;as little as possible&quot; when the objective of the law is to set relations between the government and the individual (for instance, in criminal law, where it is the government against the individual). However, the government should have more flexibility when trying to strike a balance between different groups of people. This latter case would come up most often in areas of social welfare. Where the government cannot afford to give everyone equal benefits, it will almost always have to create a somewhat arbitrary dividing line, such that some people have their right to be treated equally violated. The Court must give some flexibility to the government in deciding whom to give benefits and whom to deny. In such a case, the Supreme Court reasoned in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/cgi-bin/disp.pl/en/pub/1990/vol3/html/1990scr3_0229.html ''McKinney''], the &quot;minimal impairment test&quot; is whether the government had a ''reasonable basis'' for believing that the right to equality has been violated as little as possible to achieve the government objective.

==Freedom of Expression==
Perhaps other than the Equality provisions, freedom of expression (''Charter'' s. 2(b)) has created the most important litigation and had the biggest impact on Canadian society.

One of the most important questions to be litigated was what was protected as &quot;expression&quot;. In [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1989/vol1/html/1989scr1_0927.html Irwin Toy ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney general), &lt;no wiki&gt;[1989]&lt;/no wiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 927], the Supreme Court ruled that anything that &quot;conveyed meaning&quot; was expression. This meant virtually any way that someone chose to express themselves, whether through words, acts, or depictions. Anything that conveyed meaning and was not in &quot;an unacceptable form&quot; (i.e., violence or threats of violence), was protected by the ''Charter''.

The second question the Supreme Court answered in ''Irwin Toy'' was what constituted a violation of the right to free expression. If the purpose of the government restriction on expression was to restrict certain content, then that restriction violates the ''Charter''. This includes restricting certain methods of conveying meaning that are tied to the content itself (e.g., instead of banning rock music, the content, banning FM radio, the method of conveying the music).

If the purpose of the limit is not to restrict content but to prevent certain harmful effects from the way the content is physically expressed, then the court must examine the effects of the restriction. If the restriction has the effect of frustrating &quot;the pursuit of truth, participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing&quot;, then the restriction violates the ''Charter''. The burden of proof is then on the government to show that the restriction is reasonable under the Oakes test. If it is not reasonable, then the restriction on expression is unconstitutional.

In cases after Irwin Toy, the Supreme Court has found that political expression promotes &quot;the pursuit of truth, participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing&quot; more than other types of expression, such as commercial advertising or pornography. Therefore, almost all restrictions on political expression have been found to be violations of the right to free expression.

Another important finding in ''Irwin Toy'' was that corporation has the right to free expression (although much of its expression will be commercial advertising, the restriction of which is not always a violation of free expression).

==Search and Seizure==
Section Eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides everyone in Canada with protection against unreasonable search and seizure. This Charter right provides Canadians with their primary source of constitutionally enforced privacy rights. Typically, this protects personal information that can be obtained through searching someone in pat-down, entering someone's property or surveillance.

Under the heading of legal rights, section 8 states:
:''8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.''

===Reasonable expectation of privacy===
Generally speaking, this right does not protect against normal searches or seizures. Rather, the right focuses on the action being unreasonable on the basis that it violates an indivdual's reasonable expectation of privacy.

==Equality==
According to s. 15 of the ''Charter'', everyone is equal before and under the law and has equal protection and equal benefit of the law, without discrimination. Section 15 further lists some prohibited grounds of discrimination: race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, mental ability, and physical disability.

[http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1989/vol1/html/1989scr1_0143.html Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, &lt;nowiki&gt;[1989]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 143]defined discrimination. Discrimination is a distinction which imposes disadvantages or withholds advantages based on the characteristics of an individual or group. A mere distinction is not enough. It must be a distinction based on characteristics that a person has because he or she belongs to a certain group.

That group must either be distinguished by one of the prohibited grounds above, or &quot;analogous&quot; grounds. A ground is analogous if it has some of the following similarities to the grounds listed, such as:
* having that characteristic is not in the control of the individual
* that characteristic cannot be altered or can only be altered at unacceptable cost
* the groups defined by that characteristic have relatively little power in society

''Andrews'' decided that being a non-citizen was an analogous ground of discrimination. The Supreme Court has also ruled in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1998/vol1/html/1998scr1_0493.html Vriend v. Alberta, &lt;nowiki&gt;[1998]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 493] that sexual orientation is an analogous ground. Vriend is also important as being the first case in which the Surpeme Court required the provinces to add a new prohibited ground of discrimination in their human rights legislation. Provincial human rights legislation, unlike the ''Charter'', apply to private disputes.

==Exclusion of Evidence==
Practices regarding what evidence may be brought against an individual in trials are addressed by section 24(2). This subsection is said to make Canadian practices regarding this matter more like those in the United States; however, the Canadian standards are still not as strict as the US standards. Whereas in the US, any evidence will not be used against the individual if it was acquired in an illegal way, for evidence to be excluded in Canadian trials, it must not only have been acquired illegally but must also threaten to bring the Canadian court system into &quot;disrepute.&quot;[4] The 1987 case R. v. Collins attempted to define this. It was ruled that evidence should be excluded if it would render the trial unfair, and furthermore, the more Charter rights are violated, the more courts should have an obligation to exclude the evidence that violated the rights. Often, it is the right to have counsel and the security from unreasonable search and seizure that, when infringed, lead to evidence being excluded.

==&quot;Notwithstanding&quot; Clause==
The addition of the ''Charter'' to the Constitution was a radical change in Canadian constitutional law. To assuage concerns that the courts were being given too much power to rewrite and reinterpret legislation, s.33 was included in the ''Charter.'' Under this provision, legislation can be made immune from being challenged as a violation of certain Charter rights. These include freedom of expression, religion, assembly, association, and freedom from discrimination, as well as criminal rights. Legislation can operate &quot;notwithstanding&quot; these rights for renewable terms of five years. This clause has rarely been used in practice.

We have two versions of '''pumpkin scones''', one savory and one sweet.

==Savory Pumpkin Scones==
===Ingredients===
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|self-raising flour]], sifted 
*¼ cup skim [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] powder 
*2 [[Cookbook:Green onion|spring onions]], chopped (a.k.a. shallots, green onions)
*¼ tsp. ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] 
*¾ cup cold cooked [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]] 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] 
*½ cup natural mineral water 
*[[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|Cottage cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], for serving (optional)

===Procedure===
# Preheat oven to 220°C (430°F). 
# Combine the flour, milk powder, onion and nutmeg. 
# Fold through the pumpkin, buttermilk and mineral water to make the dough. 
# Pat out the mixture onto a lightly floured board and roll out to a thickness of about ⅝&quot;. 
# Using a 2&quot; scone cutter, press out 12 rounds. 
# Place these on a lightly floured baking tray and bake at 220°C for 12&amp;ndash;15 minutes or until golden. 
# Serve with dollops of cottage cheese or butter.

==Sweet Pumpkin Scones==
===Ingredients===
*¼ cup butter or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], softened slightly
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]] 
*1 cup cooked, mashed [[Cookbook:Butternut Squash|butternut squash]], pumpkin, or other squash
*2⅔ cups all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*pinch of salt
*½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
*pinch of ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*⅓ cup milk (or less)

===Procedure===
#Stir together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, ground nutmeg and ground ginger.  
#In a separate bowl, beat butter and sugar together with an electric mixer.  Add in the egg and corn syrup (mix the rest with a spoon so it won't be over-mixed).
#Stir in the squash and half of the sifted dry ingredients.
#Add the rest of the dry ingredients with just enough of the milk to make a soft dough.  If it is too sticky to work, add a sprinkle (or two) of flour.
#Knead only a little, gently, until you can pat it out into a big flat rectangle about ¾&quot; thick (just under an inch).
#Cut into 12 pieces with a floured knife. Transfer to a lightly greased oven tray (I used my large pizza pan, which only just accommodated them).
#Bake at 230°C (450°F) for 18 minutes.

==The do while loop==

The do while loop is similar in syntax and purpose to the [[Programming:PHP:while loop|while loop]]. The do/while loop construct moves the test that continues the loop to the end of the code block. The code is executed at least once, and then the condition is tested. For example: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$c = 6;
do {
  echo 'Hi';
} while ($c &lt; 5);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Even though $c is greater than 5, the script will echo &quot;Hi&quot; to the page one time.

PHP's do/while loop is not commonly used.

===Example===
{{Code:PHPHTML
|This example will output the [[Applicable_Mathematics/Counting_Techniques#Factorials|factorial]] of &lt;code&gt;$number&lt;/code&gt; (product of all the numbers from 1 to it).
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$number = 5;
$factorial = 1;
do {
  $factorial *= $number;
  $number = $number - 1;
} while ($number &gt; 0);
echo $factorial;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;120&lt;/pre&gt;
|120|

The continue statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end, and continues execution where the condition is checked - if this condition is true, it starts the loop again. For example, in the loop statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$number = 6;
for ($i = 3; $i &gt;= -3; $i--) {
  if ($i == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  echo $number . &quot; / &quot; . $i . &quot; = &quot; . ($number/$i) . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

the statement is not executed when the condition i = 0 is true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eww. Cottage cheese is NOT an adequate substitution for riccota. Nor is a prepared sauce an evenly remotely appropriate replacement for a real lasagne suace. It shouldn't even be legal. I'll add my recipe as soon as I can find the card its on. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

I moved this to &quot;Ricotta Lasagne&quot; to create a general lasagne page under [[Cookbook:Lasagne]]. I'm not sure if Ricotta is really the defining ingredient here, maybe it should be &quot;Beef Lasagne&quot; or &quot;Beef and Ricotta Lasagne&quot;. Feel free to move it again it another name seems more suitable. [[User:Risk|risk]]


this recipe is also called pastitsio or pasticcio. i dont know which section to include this info under, if someone else could, that'd be great.

also, isnt the variant that uses eggplant instead of pasta, the definition of moussaka? (that might be wrong) - nick

and...the discussion page for lasagna is redirecting to ricotta lasagna. someone should fix that.
: Fixed. (I guess I missed that one). [[User:Risk|risk]]

: You were right about the Moussaka, I put that under the tips and variations. A Pastitsio is slightly different from a lasagna, so it should get it's own page. I put a refrence under tips and variations. (If anyone's confused, this is all about the lasagne page, not the Ricotta Lzsagne). [[User:Risk|risk]]</text>

I'm glad to see that someone has started working on a topology textbook.  I would like to start making a few additions, and I have a few ideas for the direction I would like to see the book take.  I would like to chat / collaborate with anyone else interested in contributing, and I hope that no one takes personal offense to my edits.

* I've made a few clarifications and additions.  I'm also interested in discussing how to structure the book, if anyone else interested in editing it is still around, but if not I'll probably go ahead and change things.  In particular, I note that the page naming convention seems inadwquate, and I'd like to move a lot of the pages, to a &quot;Topology:&quot; prefix. [[User:J Bytheway|J Bytheway]] 20:29, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

* You do know about Allen Hatcher's Algebraic Topology book, no?  It's a free book, available on his website.

http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html

== Zorn's Lemma, AoC in the prereqs? ==

Is it really a good idea to put these in the prereqs without qualification? I mean, you can get through a fair part of basic topology without ever needing to invoke ZL or AoC. In the two books I have handy, they introduce AoC and prove Zorn's Lemma and then get to using it. I think it is a similar problem to the use of the word &quot;Monad&quot; in Haskell, it sounds scary, and so people may be offput from _using_ this (lovely) wikibook if they see these things, even though the subjects are not (IMO) super-difficult to grasp. Any thoughts, perhaps just qualifying them with a &quot;For Section Foo, will need Zorn's Lemma and the AoC&quot; or even just shoving them into the text as an Aside?

== Format ==

Much has been discussed about content, but not about formatting, what should the format of each chapter be? I, given my experience, can deal with a simple, linear &quot;(Theorem-Proof)*&quot; format, others will likely prefer different. As it stands, there seems to be no standard format, some pages (such as the Completeness page) are the TP* style, some are more structured (like the page on the Fundamental Group. I'm happy to do the grunt work of rearranging the material, I just want to know if there is a standard format being used. Perhaps it would be wise to create a &quot;Writing Standards&quot; page somewhere with the format and organization rules organized there?

== Work to be done ==
Hello, i just saw this book. and it seems to have lots of potential.
I think we should list the subjects we would like to see in it,
and evaluate them:
* How important they are?
* How diffecult to understanding ?
** This will mean more examples. I personaly thing that you can never have to many examples.

Here is an initial list of subjects as i see it (ordered as the should appear. ):
# Metric spaces (the reason in the iterm below), importantcy: high
## suequences and convergence importantcy: high
## open and closed sets ( For this i think it is perferable to explain about metric spaces first, when it is more intuitive to undersanded and motivated.) importantcy: high
## continueity importantcy: high
## sub spaces importantcy: low
# Topological Space. importantcy: high
## closed and open sets importantcy: high
## The metric induced topology importantcy: medium
## Co-finite topology. importantcy: medium
## sub spaces importantcy: low
## continueity importantcy: high
## homermorphism. importantcy: high
### definition of a topological proprety, and basic examples.
# Speration axioms.
# continueity
# compactness
# connectedness
# ... to be continued (by you ?)

write them (according to importance).
Only after covering one subject completly, we will move to the next.

You are invited to contibue to this list. I think that by this way we can consentrate efforts, to make this book more usable, quickly. 

If you think this idea is '''bad''', i would like to hear it too. 

If no one will object in the next month, i shall consider it as agreeing, and redesign the book to suit this proposed structure.

== Proposal for further improvements ==

Hello everyone!

I've seen the book and I would like to discuss further improvements to it.

I think that before adding any new materials to it, we should discuss the organization of the book in parts, chapters and sections.


&lt;big&gt;'''Division of the book in parts'''&lt;/big&gt;

In my opinion the present divison of the book in 5 parts should be kept for now, namely

'''1. Introduction'''

'''2. Point-set topology'''

'''3. Algebraic topology'''

'''4. Differential topology'''

'''5. Help'''


&lt;big&gt;'''Contents of each part'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''1. Introduction'''

This part should contain introductory material on set theory, basic algebraic structures (group, ring, module), and a survey on real numbers and real functions of a real variable. Everything that we need before starting.

'''2. Point-set topology'''

Here I express what I know to be a controversial direction in teaching topology: I believe the general topological space should be presented before the metric space. Reasons for that: 

- Abstract distance is not easier to understand than general topology. Take for example the euclidean straight, plane or space with the metric which, given two points in it, associates 0 or 1, whether the points are the same or different. And now explain to a freshman that this distance is so much a distance in each of its particulars as the usual distance and wait for his comments.

- To a certain degree one can present metric independently of topology: definition of metric, sub-space, balls, limited set, Cauchy sequence - none of this concepts needs topology.

- But when one comes to the matters of closeness, convergence, adherence, continuity, there's nothing why one should present it firstly on a metric space, they are just topological aspects which metric spaces possess among others.


Now, I believe one should gather in different bags what is hard to comprehend and what is a piece of cake though necessary (an unecessary piece of cake shouldn't even be mentioned). The concept of topology is necessary but a piece of cake. Such are all the basics one can say about it: sub-space, closure, neighbourhood, interior and so on.

I believe that compactness and connectedness are hard bones in topology. That, and their applications in other mathematical branches, demand they should be gathered in a single chapter for mind-order's sake as for easing the work of analists, geometers and so on, who know topology well but just need a quick view of the bone. On the other hand all the basic topological constructions such as cartesian product, quotient space, space summing and glueing are nothing but technical instruments, constantly being used in every branch of mathematics needing topology, but uninteresting for itself (unless one's in a cathegory theory discussion).

I also believe one should take a short look to &quot;general countability&quot; and &quot;general uniformity&quot; before realizing that metric has all these propierties.

Thus I propose that part 2 should be organized in chapters and sections as follows

1. Topology

&lt;small&gt;1.1. topology (including definition, open and closed sets, sub-space, base and generated topology, neighbourhood, interior, exterior, border, closure, density)

1.2. separation properties (including Hausdorff topology and other separation axioms)

1.3. limit and continuity (including concepts of convergence, adherence, continuity in a point and in a set, homeomorphism)

1.4. topological constructions (including quotient, product, sum, wedge-sum, glueing and others) &lt;/small&gt;

2. Compactness and connectedness

&lt;small&gt;2.1. compactness (including definition, results on compactness and closeness, Thychonoff's Theorem, local compactness, Alexandroff's compactification, normal space)

2.2. connectedness (including connectedess, path-connectedness and local connectedness)&lt;/small&gt;

3. Countability, uniformity and metric

&lt;small&gt;3.1. countability (including the first and second axioms of countability, sequential closure)

3.2. uniformity (including Cauchy property, uniform continuity, completness)

3.3. metric (including definition, ball, limitated set, uniform structure of metric, topology of metric)

3.4. countability and uniformity of metric (how sequences suffice in metric to describe limit and continuity, completness in metric spaces Lipschitz property, Banach's fixed point theorem)

3.5. Compactness in a metric space (how in a metric space behaves compactness)&lt;/small&gt;

4. Topology and metric of the euclidean space (including inner product, norm, compactness and connectedness in euclidean space)

5. Sequences of functions (What can one say about sequences of functions between topological or metric spaces, pointwise convergence versus uniform convergence)

'''3. Algebraic topology, 4. Differential topology, 5. Help'''

The contens of these chapters isn't so important until chapter 1 be in an advanced state.

== TOPOLOGY EXPERT ==

Dear all,

I am intending to vastly improve this book. I have so far created three sections on the comb space, linear continua, and on locally connected spaces. I have noticed that some people have added exercises to some chapters in this book which is great! However, some of the exercies are far too easy or far to boring. If you are going to include an exercise such as, 'check whether the following collection of subsets of X is a base', it would be appropriate to include one question on this but not anymore. Such exercises are far too repetitive and are not generally challenging for the more interested reader. Therefore, I recommend that you try to add more interesting exercises. Of course, adding any sort of exercise is great! In future, I am looking to completely improve the two chapters on general topology to make it readable.

:I think that what needs work is the differential topology section, and more on manifolds, and so on.--[[Special:Contributions/131.243.31.197|131.243.31.197]] ([[User talk:131.243.31.197|talk]]) 02:13, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

:In addition, I have found that I may have added some stuff that was in the realm of '''functional analysis'''. For example, I have added the '''Arzela-Ascoli Theorem''' to the completeness page. I see that on the functional analysis book, then mention this theorem, but don't prove it. I think that some of this functional analysis stuff may be moved to the functional analysis book, but I find it troubling about the manner in which this should be done. After all, this would have to either assume that one has already read this topology book, or some topology material would have to be copied over to the Functional Analysis book. Regards, [[Special:Contributions/131.243.31.197|131.243.31.197]] ([[User talk:131.243.31.197|talk]]) 23:33, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

You are right that there is this basic question: whether or not a background in general topology (not algebraic topology or differential topology) is prerequisite for functional analysis, a background that is little more than passing acquaintance. The current [[Functional Analysis]] is written based on the assumption that the answer to the question is affirmative. Since the weak topology play an important role in functional analysis, I don't think anyone can go far without experience with non-first-countable spaces. This could change, of course, in the future. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 14:14, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

== Development stages ==

I would suggest that someone more authoritative on topology (I'm haven't had any formal education in the subject yet) should go over the chapters and add [[Help:Development_stages | development stages]] to each chapter, so as to get an overview of the content and quality of each chapter.

This would help identify areas that need improvement and completion and would turn the attention to those areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Statistics/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Quartiles===
The quartiles of a data set are formed by the two boundaries on either side of the median, which divide the set into four equal sections. The lowest 25% of the data being found below the first quartile value, also called the lower quartile (Q1). The median, or second quartile divides the set into two equal sections. The lowest 75% of the data set should be found below the third quartile, also called the upper quartile (Q3). These three numbers are measures of the dispersion of the data, while the mean, median and mode are measures of central tendency. 

====Examples====
Given the set {1,3,5,8,9,12,24,25,28,30,41,50} we would find the first and third quartiles as follows:

There are 12 elements in the set, so 12/4 gives us three elements in each quarter of the set. 

So the first or lowest quartile is: '''5''', the second quartile is the median''' 12''', and the third or upper quartile is '''28.'''

However some people when faced with a set with an even number of elements (values) still want the true median (or middle value), with an equal number of data values on each side of the median (rather than 12 which has 5 values less than and 6 values greater than.  This value is then the average of 12 and 24 resulting in 18 as the true median (which is closer to the mean of 19 2/3.  The same process is then applied to the lower and upper quartiles, giving '''6.5''', '''18''', and '''29'''.  This is only an issue if the data contains an even number of elements with an even number of equally divided sections, or an odd number of elements with an odd number of equally divided sections.

====Inter-Quartile Range====
The inter quartile range is a statistic which provides information about the spread of a data set, and is calculated by subtracting the first quartile from the third quartile)&lt;!-- originally said from the 2'nd quartile --&gt;, giving the range of the middle half of the data set, trimming off the lowest and highest quarters.  Since the IQR is not affected at all by [[w:Outlier |outliers]] in the data, it is a more robust measure of dispersion than the [[Statistics:Summary/Range |range]]&lt;!-- clarified for me [[User:Remi Arntzen|Remi Arntzen]] 23:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC) --&gt;

'''IQR = Q3 - Q1'''

Another useful quantile is the '''quintiles''' which subdivide the data into five equal sections. The advantage of quintiles is that there is a central one with boundaries on either side of the median which can serve as an average group. In a Normal distribution the boundaries of the quintiles have boundaries &amp;plusmn;0.253*s and &amp;plusmn;0.842*s on either side of the mean (or median),where s is the sample standard deviation. Note that in a Normal distribution the mean, median and mode coincide.

Other frequently used quantiles are the '''deciles''' (10 equal sections) and the '''percentiles''' (100 equal sections)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Summation notation allows an expression that contains a sum to be expressed in a simple, compact manner. The uppercase Greek letter sigma, &amp;Sigma;, is used to denote the sum of a set of numbers. 

;Example
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=3}^7 i^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2+7^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Let ''f'' be a function and ''N,M'' are integers with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=N}^M f(i) = f(N) + f(N+1) + f(N+2) + \cdots + f(M).&lt;/math&gt;
We say ''N'' is the lower limit and ''M'' is the upper limit of the sum.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We can replace the letter ''i'' with any other variable.  For this reason ''i'' is referred to as a ''dummy variable''.  So
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^4 i = \sum_{j=1}^4 j = \sum_{\alpha=1}^4 \alpha = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
&lt;/math&gt;
Conventionally we use the letters ''i'', ''j'', ''k'', ''m'' for dummy variables.

;Example
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^5 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the ''dummy variable'' is ''i'', the ''lower limit'' of summation is 1, and the ''upper limit'' is 5.

;Example

Sometimes, you will see summation signs with no dummy variable specified, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_1^4 i^3 =100&lt;/math&gt;

In such cases the correct dummy variable should be clear from the context.

You may also see cases where the limits are unspecified. Here too, they must be deduced from the context.

===Common summations===
{{Wikipedia|Summation#Capital-sigma notation}}

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n c = c + c + ... + c = nc , c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = {n(n+1)\over 2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = {n(n+1)(2n+1)\over 6}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3 = {n^2(n+1)^2 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Input and Variables ===
Now I feel it is time for a really complicated program. Here it is:

 '''print &quot;Halt!&quot;'''
 '''s = raw_input(&quot;Who goes there? &quot;)'''
 '''print &quot;You may pass,&quot;, s'''

When '''I''' ran it here is what '''my''' screen showed: 

 Halt!
 Who goes there? '''Josh'''
 You may pass, Josh

Of course when you run the program your screen will look different depending on what you enter after &quot;Who goes there?&quot;. When you ran the program you probably noticed (you did run the program, right?) how you had to type in your name and then press '''Enter'''. Then the program printed out some more text and also your name. This is an example of ''input''. The program reaches a certain point (in this case, the command '''raw_input''') and then waits for the user to input some data that the program can use later. 

Of course, getting information from the user would be useless if we didn't have anywhere to put that information and this is where ''variables'' come in. In the previous program '''s''' is a ''variable''. Variables are like a box that can store some piece of data. Here is a program to show examples of variables: 

 '''a = 123.4'''
 '''b23 = 'Spam''''
 '''first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;'''
 '''b = 432'''
 '''c = a + b'''
 '''print &quot;a + b is&quot;, c'''
 '''print &quot;first_name is&quot;, first_name'''
 '''print &quot;Sorted Parts, After Midnight or&quot;,b23'''

And here is the output: 

 a + b is 555.4
 first_name is Bill
 Sorted Parts, After Midnight or Spam

Variables store data. The variables in the above program are '''a''', '''b23''', '''first_name''', '''b''', and '''c'''. The two basic types of variables are ''strings'' and ''numbers''.

''Strings'' are a sequence of letters, numbers and other characters.  &quot;Spam&quot;, &quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;a + b is&quot;, and &quot;first_name is&quot; are strings that are used in this program. The characters are surrounded by single or double quotes (&quot; or ').  In this example '''b23''' and '''first_name''' are variables that are storing strings. 

'Numbers' are any sort of number, whether integers (whole numbers) or reals (numbers with fractional parts).  The variables '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''' are variables containing numbers. 

----

Okay, so we have these boxes called variables and also data that can go into the variables. The computer will see a line like '''first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;''' and it reads it as ''Put the string Bill into the box (or variable) first_name''. Later on it sees the statement '''c = a + b''' and it reads it as ''Put a + b into c''.  It then replaces the variabls '''a''' and '''b''' with their values, so this becomes ''Put 123.4 + 432 into c''.  It then performs the addition, so the end result of ''c = a + b'' is ''Put 555.4 into c''. 

Here is another example of variable usage: 

 '''a = 1'''
 '''print a'''
 '''a = a + 1'''
 '''print a'''
 '''a = a * 2'''
 '''print a'''

And here is the output: 

 1
 2
 4

Note something interesting - even if it is the same variable on both sides the computer still reads it as: First find out the data to store and than find out where the data goes.  So the equals sign (=) is a bit different to what you might expect.  In programming terminology, = is known as ''assignment'', because in the statement '''a = a + 1''' the variable '''a''' is '''assigned''' the value of '''a''' plus 1.

----

How about we go back to the program at the start of this chapter:

 '''print &quot;Halt!&quot;'''
 '''s = raw_input(&quot;Who goes there? &quot;)'''
 '''print &quot;You may pass,&quot;, s'''

With the output: 

 Halt!
 Who goes there? '''Josh'''
 You may pass, Josh

Now when you look at it, you may notice that the variable '''s''' is assigned the ''output'' of the command '''raw_input'''.  So '''s''' equals what was typed after the prompt &quot;Who goes there?&quot; (in this example, the string &quot;Josh&quot;).  Secondly, take a look at the print command.  Note that it has two ''arguments'', separated by a comma, but what is interesting is that the second argument is a variable.  The print command is actually quite an interesting command, because not only can it take a variable number of arguments, but those arguments, in any order, could be a string, a number, an expression or a variable, and that an expression can include variables as well as numbers.

----

One more program before I end this chapter: 

 '''num = input(&quot;Type in a Number: &quot;)'''
 '''str = raw_input(&quot;Type in a String: &quot;)'''
 '''print &quot;num =&quot;, num'''
 '''print &quot;num is a &quot;,type(num)'''
 '''print &quot;num * 2 =&quot;,num*2'''
 '''print &quot;str =&quot;, str'''
 '''print &quot;str is a &quot;,type(str)'''
 '''print &quot;str * 2 =&quot;,str*2'''

The output I got was: 

 Type in a Number: '''12.34'''
 Type in a String: '''Hello'''
 num = 12.34
 num is a  &lt;type 'float'&gt;
 num * 2 = 24.68
 str = Hello
 str is a  &lt;type 'string'&gt;
 str * 2 = HelloHello

Notice that the variable '''num''' was gotten with '''input''' while '''str''' was gotten with '''raw_input'''.  '''raw_input''' returns a ''string'' while '''input''' returns a ''number''. When you want the user to type in a number use '''input''' but if you want the user to type in a string use '''raw_input'''.

The second half of the program uses the '''type''' command, which tells what a variable is.  Numbers are of type ''int'' or ''float'' (which are short for 'integer' and 'floating point' respectively).  (In case you are wondering, a 'floating point' number is a number with a decimal point).  Strings are of type string.  Integers and floats can be worked on by mathematical functions, strings cannot.  Notice how when python multiples a number by a integer the expected thing happens.  However when a string is multiplied by a integer the string has that many copies of it added i.e. ''str * 2 = HelloHello''. 

The operations with strings do slightly different things than operations with numbers. Here are some interactive mode examples to show that some more.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;This&quot;+&quot; &quot;+&quot;is&quot;+&quot; joined.&quot;'''
 'This is joined.'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;Ha, &quot;*5'''
 'Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, '
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;Ha, &quot;*5+&quot;ha!&quot;'''
 'Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha!'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

Note how in interactive mode ''only'', an expression is directly evaluated, and the result is printed to the screen (no need for the print command).

Here is the list of some string operations:

{|
! Operation 
! Symbol 
! Example
|-
|Repetition
| &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;&quot;i&quot;*5 == &quot;iiiii&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|Concatenation
| &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;World!&quot; == &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

=== Examples ===
Rate_times.py 

 '''#This programs calculates rate and distance problems'''
 '''print &quot;Input a rate and a distance&quot;'''
 '''rate = input(&quot;Rate:&quot;)'''
 '''distance = input(&quot;Distance:&quot;)'''
 '''print &quot;Time:&quot;,distance/rate'''

Sample runs: 

 &gt; '''python rate_times.py'''
 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate:'''5'''
 Distance:'''10'''
 Time: 2
 &gt; '''python rate_times.py'''
 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate:'''3.52'''
 Distance:'''45.6'''
 Time: 12.9545454545

Area.py 

 '''#This program calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle'''
 '''print &quot;Calculate information about a rectangle&quot;'''
 '''length = input(&quot;Length:&quot;)'''
 '''width = input(&quot;Width:&quot;)'''
 '''print &quot;Area&quot;,length*width'''
 '''print &quot;Perimeter&quot;,2*length+2*width'''

Sample runs: 

 &gt; '''python area.py'''

 37.0

=== Exercises ===

Write a program that gets 2 string variables and 2 integer variables from the user, concatenates (joins them together with no spaces) and displays the strings, then multiplies the two numbers on a new line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, Alain.  Welcome to Wikibooks.  Nice work on adding explainations to the python tutorial.  I am curious why you are replacing pre tags with the space  syntax? I was using the pre syntax since it is easier to copy in programs (and copy them out again for that matter).  Anyway, thanks for adding the explanatory text.  It looks good.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Alain. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Alain~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

== Legal Systems ==

Every country has its own legal system.  

Many countries follow in a common legal tradition with other countries.  Some populations within a country may also have their own legal traditions separate from those of the country they inhabit.
The Common law and the Civil law traditions are generally thought of as the two traditions that operate in Canada.   However, many aboriginal law traditions exist in various forms, and religious legal traditions, such as Islamic and Jewish law, have a great influence on the lives of many Canadians.

At the risk of over-generalization, the Common law is a system whereby judges have a large influence in making law, by referring to past judicial decisions where legislation does not provide an answer to the legal question at hand.  By expanding upon and reinterpreting old decisions, judges develop the Common law, while at the same time consciously making only incremental reinterpretations, so that the law develops gradually.

The Civil law is a system whereby the legislature adopts a Code which has many general legal principles.  Judges refer to these general principle to solve specific legal problems; they need not refer back to how previous judges resolved similar specific issues, or even how they themselves resolved decided similar specific issues in the past.  At the same time, judges have  a high regard for experts in particular fields of law, whose publications are influential on judges.  It is not uncommon for a Civil Code to last one or more centuries before a major reform.

== The Hierarchy of Authority/ Sources of Law ==

In Canada, this is the generally-recognized hierarchy of authority:

* The Constitution
* Human rights legislation
* Other legislation
* Regulations
* Caselaw from higher courts
* Other caselaw
* Treaties/ International law
* Doctrine

In the Quebec tradition, the hierarchy looks more like the following:

* The Constitution
* Human rights legislation
* The Civil Code
* Other legislation
* Regulations
* Doctrine
* Caselaw from higher courts
* Other caselaw
* Treaties/ International law

Generally, a judge will give more weight to the top of the hierarchy.

== Useful Basic Concepts ==

Justice: Justice is a term in philosophy and law, but also in the popular imagination. People bring cases to court or write letters to their government because they wish for a just result. Justice is often seen as a moral concept which is broader than law as defined by courts and the government.

Law:  This concept has many different meanings.  The average person thinks of law as &quot;legislation&quot;, i.e., the written document approved by a legislature describing what may or may not be done legally.  However, lawyers tend to use the word &quot;law&quot; in a broader context: the ensemble of the constitution, legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, agreements, and any number of other types of enforced rules that have an official status. Some people also extend the meaning of &quot;law&quot; to cover everyday rules that people create as they interact. For example, many legal anthropologists study law in this way.

Statute: This is what most people call a &quot;law&quot;: a written document, passed according to the rules of a legislature, which the government is to enforce.  Also called an Enactment, an Act, legislation.  It usually deals with a specific topic, which will be used in identifying and distinguishing it from  other statutes i.e. the Immigration Act or the Income Tax Act.

== Legal Theory ==

=== Natural law ===

=== Positivism ===
This is really what you would think seeing that word.  The idea here is that law is a &quot;posited&quot; thing.
In other words: law is law because it has been made in a certain way. Nothing else is law.  As long as people agree on the way law is made, it is easy to know what is law and what is not. This view of law is most famously explained in the work of H.L.A. Hart, who wrote &quot;The Concept of Law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H.L.A., The Concept of Law, New York : Oxford University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Hart says that there are primary and secondary rules in a society. The primary rules tell us how new (secondary) rules can be made. For example, in Canada any new federal law has to be approved by the House of Commons. Any new rule that doesn't respect this &quot;primary rule&quot; cannot be a law because it wasn't passed the right way. 

Legal positivism says that only laws that are passed according to the primary rules count as real law. This leads to a very formal outlook on law that emphasizes correct structure. It is a powerful analytical tool because it allows us to focus on one kind of rule while excluding others which can be distracting.

However, for the positivist, the content of a rule is less important. Morals or any of the other fuzzy stuff don't come into play. This idea of &quot;positive law&quot; has been criticized by scholars including Ronald Dworkin &lt;ref&gt; Dworkin, Ronald, Law's Empire, Cambridge, Mass. : Belknap Press, c1986.&lt;/ref&gt; because it sometimes fails to deal effectively with morally complex issues. For example, imagine that a government passes a new law, in the correct form, and this law makes it illegal to feed your children. It sounds absurd, but a strict positivist will hold that this is valid law because it was passed in the right way.

=== Realism ===

=== Critical Legal Studies ===
Critical Legal Studies (CLS) is a movement in legal theory which originated in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. A group of legal scholars began to study law from a left critical perspective. Among them was Duncan Kennedy, a professor who wrote the short book &quot;Legal education and the reproduction of hierarchy : a polemic against the system&quot; &lt;ref&gt;New York ; London : New York University Press, c2004.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

People are often encouraged to see law and the courts as neutral and fair institutions. As the title of Kennedy's work indicates, critical legal scholars contest this view of law. Their goal is to expose the biases and prejudices which underlie much legal reasoning. Instead of talking about neutral legal rules and technicalities, critical legal studies focuses on relationships of power. While a positivist asks &quot;is this a real law?&quot;, the critical scholar asks, &quot;who benefits from this law?&quot; and &quot;how much justice can you afford, if you can't pay a lawyer?&quot;

Critical legal studies remains a popular movement among law students and left practitioners. As its name implies, however, the movement focuses more on negative criticism of legal institutions than on building social change in a progressive way. For this reason, the movement has itself been criticized by some legal academics who accuse CLS scholars of &quot;trashing&quot; institutions without offering a constructive alternative. Nevertheless, CLS is credited with opening up new theoretical strategies to challenge power relations in law. Other movements in legal theory such as feminist and critical race approaches are said to have grown out of the CLS movement.



=== Feminist Legal Theory ===

=== Critical Race Theory ===
Critical race theory is a legal perspective which focuses on issues of race and ethnicity as reflected in law. This includes, but is not limited to, inquiry on systemic discrimination in legal institutions (courts, tribunals, bar associations). Issues like racial profiling, access to legal services and law school admissions of people of colour are other examples. Canada has fewer academic resources on critical race theory than the United States, but there are some works which are of note. 

Carol A. Aylward's book, ''Canadian critical race theory : racism and the law''&lt;ref&gt;Halifax, N.S. : Fernwood, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a clear introduction to the topic. Questions discussed include when to raise the question of racial discrimination in the courtroom and why Canada might lack the diverse critical race scholarship of the U.S.

Another work of interest is Constance Backhouse's book, ''Colour Coded: A Legal History of Racism in Canada 1900-1950''&lt;ref&gt;Toronto : Published for the Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History by University of Toronto Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;. In it, Backhouse offers detailed, well-researched information on some little-known facts about race and law in Canada. These include the activities of the Ku Klux Klan in Ontario in the 1930's, the &quot;White Women's Labour Law&quot; which prevented Chinese businesspeople from hiring caucasian women in the 1920's, and the banning of dancing and potlatch ceremonies by Aboriginal peoples in Canadian history.

I didn't understand the last part about input AT ALL! :( [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) 14:16, 9 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

This is a simple way to serve [[Cookbook:Fiddlehead|fiddleheads]]. If fiddleheads are unavailable or out of season, [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] or [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke hearts]] could be substituted with good results.

It goes well with a simple [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]], crusty [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] and a nice dry [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]].

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450 g) [[Cookbook:Fiddlehead|fiddleheads]], cleaned and trimmed
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 large portobello [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]] cap
*170g (6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]]) oil-packed sun-dried [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] (approx)
*half a box of [[Cookbook:Linguine|linguine]]
*1 tablespoon toasted [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Slice the mushrooms, onions, and sun-dried tomatoes into long strips and set aside.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] the ferns and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 to 10 minutes.
#Add the onions and sauté until they start to wilt.
#Add the mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. Continue to sauté for another 5 minutes or so.
#Season with salt and pepper, toss in the pine nuts, add a splash of water, reduce heat and cover. Let sweat for about 10 minutes (or so).
#During this have the linguine begin to cook so that it is ready when the topping is ready.
#In a pasta bowl, add the veggies to the linguine, sprinkle on the cheese, and toss.
#Serve immediately.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Includes==
There are two methods of including a file in PHP: &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
include &quot;file.php&quot;;
require &quot;file.php&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

They both perform essentially the same function, but have one major difference: &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; will only throw a warning if there is a problem during the include process; &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;, however, will halt execution in this scenario. Therefore, a script's dependencies will often be called with &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;.

Prior to version 4.0.2, &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; also attempted to read a file, regardless of whether the code in that file was executed or not. This means that if a file did not exist, an error would be thrown even if it would never be interpreted. The following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php

if (false)
{
   require &quot;some_nonexistent_file.php&quot;;
}

require &quot;another_nonexistent_file.php&quot;;

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

would therefore fail on the first &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; in versions before 4.0.2, and the second in all other versions.

===Include Once===
Additionally, there exist many code libraries, class definitions, and variable declarations that you will want to separate into an include file, but that should only be called into the current script once. To ensure that these libraries are only included once, php includes the &lt;code&gt;include_once()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;require_once()&lt;/code&gt;functions.

Each time one of these functions is called, the php parser remembers which file it has called. If another &lt;code&gt;include_once()&lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;require_once&lt;/code&gt; attempts to load the same file, the parser will simply skip the command. It will produce no error or warning, it will simply act as though the command had executed successfully. This is because, in fact, it has.

IMPORTANT: If you include a file once with &lt;code&gt;include_once()&lt;/code&gt; and then later using &lt;code&gt;include()&lt;/code&gt;, the file will be included a second time. If a file is included using &lt;code&gt;include_once()&lt;/code&gt; and a call to the same file is made by &lt;code&gt;require_once()&lt;/code&gt;, it will not be included again. Include_once() and require_once() have the same 'memory,' as it were.

'''[http://zope.org/ Zope]''' is an open source Web server built on top of [[Python Programming|Python]]. It is most commonly used for the content management systems Plone and CPS and the enterprise resource planning system ERP5. This textbook will help you install and operate a Zope server.

==Installation==

Zope Win32 binaries and source code can be downloaded at the [http://www.zope.org/Products/ Zope Web site].

===Windows===

From the above page, download the file Zope-x.x.x-x-win32-x86.exe, where &quot;x.x.x-x&quot; is the version of Zope you want, such as 2.7.2-0. When the file is finished downloading, execute it. An installer should begin running.

A welcome screen should pop up. Click &quot;Next&quot;, and after reading the Zope Public License, click &quot;Next&quot; again. This brings you to a prompt asking you for a Zope site name. You can select any alphanumeric name you wish, although &quot;Zope&quot; is a reasonable default.

You will then be asked to confirm the installation directory (by default C:\Program Files\Zope), and select an administrator username and password. '''For security reasons, it is highly recommended that you change these from the initial settings, as the Zope administration interface can be accessed over the Internet!'''

After clicking &quot;Next&quot; on this final screen, Zope will install itself into the specified directory and ask whether you want it to run as a service or if you would like to start it manually. If the system is not Windows NT&amp;ndash;based (this includes Windows 2000 and XP), the only choice will be to run it manually.

===Unix and Linux===

==== Debian/Ubuntu using Debian packages ====

Get the &lt;tt&gt;zopex.x&lt;/tt&gt; package, where &quot;x.x&quot; is the version of Zope.

After downloading and installing, there is no instance of Zope running or runnable yet; the Debian package provides a tool for configuring instances, &lt;tt&gt;dzhandle&lt;/tt&gt;, which can be run from the shell. &lt;tt&gt;dzhandle&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to make and remove Zope instances and to configure existing instances. ''To run it, you might need to be root.''

To create a new instance, this syntax is used:

 dzhandle -z &lt;zope-version&gt; make-instance -m &lt;mode&gt; -t &lt;technique&gt; -r &lt;restartmode&gt; -u &lt;initialusername:password&gt; [--service-user &lt;system user&gt; --service-port &lt;port&gt;] &lt;instance name&gt;

For further information, consult the &lt;tt&gt;dzhandle&lt;/tt&gt; manpage.

This can be used to start an instance:

 dzhandle zopectl &lt;instance name&gt; start

==== Building from source ====

After downloading the Zope source code, switch users to root using the &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; command. Change directories to the location in which you saved the archive, and untar the archive:

 $ tar zxf Zope-x.x.x-x.tgz

where &quot;x.x.x-x&quot; is the version of Zope you downloaded, such as 2.7.2-0.

Change into the directory created by the archive extraction (usually Zope-x.x.x-x) and run the &lt;tt&gt;./configure&lt;/tt&gt; script. Assuming that you have the Python interpreter, the installation will be configured and the script will then ask you to run &lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt;. Execute the command,

:''does make ask questions during install?''

and then &lt;tt&gt;make install&lt;/tt&gt;.

By default, the Zope binary directory will be /opt/Zope-x.x, and the Zope data directory will be /usr/local/zope.

==Getting Started==

:''start Zope''

Zope initially runs on port 8080 (9673 on Debian systems due to a port conflict). Therefore, you can test your server by opening your favorite Web browser and typing &quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot; into its location box. A Zope introductory page should load. If you get a &quot;connection refused&quot; error, make sure that Zope is actually started (a simple Ctrl-Alt-Del on Windows or &lt;tt&gt;ps aux&lt;/tt&gt; on Unix and Linux should be enough for you to determine whether or not it is running).

The first thing you will want to do is log on to the Zope Management Interface, which is linked to near the bottom of the page. You will be asked for your administrative username and password, and then given access.

==Using Zope with Apache==

There are two methods of forwarding Zope information through Apache: mod_proxy and mod_rewrite.
Some more notes are [http://zopewiki.org/ZopeAndApache here].

==Coaster Brakes==
Coaster brakes don't need adjusting but they may need lubricating to
reduce wear.  They are supposed to be greased with a special high
viscosity lubricant such as Sachs: &quot;fett fur stahlbremsmantel&quot; which
is likely no longer available.  So instead use a cheap, high friction
grease.  To take the hub apart, Torpedo and Sturmey Archer say to
start on the brake lever side, but I've seen the opposite proposed.

However, you need to take apart the hub to apply grease so it's a lot
easier to lubricate the brakes with heavy oil that doesn't contain
anti-friction additives.  Apply it via an oil filler hole in the hub
(if it exists).  Don't use oil with anti-friction additives such as
teflon or graphite that will result in slippery brakes.

On a long downgrade of over 1000 feet (300 M) the coaster brake may
overheat and the any oil in it may boil and smoke.  One may try
filling the hub with water to keep the brakes cool by generating
steam.  Make sure that all the water has boiled off by the end of your
trip. Do not expect a coaster brake to perform reliably or safely in hilly terrain. It's even possible to melt metal inside the hub. Also realize that if your chain derails or breaks, your coaster brake will no longer function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Aldehydes ([[Image:Aldehyde2.png|50px]]) and ketones ([[Image:Ketone-general.svg|50px]]) are both carbonyl compounds. They are organic compounds in which the carbonyl carbon is connected to C or H atoms on either side.
An aldehyde has one or both vacancies of the carbonyl carbon satisfied by a H atom, while a ketone has both its vacancies satisfied by carbon.

== Naming Aldehydes and Ketones ==

'''Ketones''' are named by replacing the''' -e''' in the alkane name with '''-one'''.  The '''carbon chain''' is numbered so that the ketone carbon, called '''the carbonyl group''', gets the lowest number.  For example, [[Image:Butanone-structure-skeletal.png|50px]] would be named 2-butanone because the root structure is butane and the ketone group is on the number two carbon. 

Alternatively, functional class nomenclature of ketones is also recognized by IUPAC, which is done by naming the substituents attached to the carbonyl group in alphabetical order, ending with the word ketone. The above example of 2-butanone can also be named ethyl methyl ketone using this method.

If two ketone groups are on the same structure, the ending '''-dione''' would be added to the alkane name, such as heptane-2,5-dione.  

'''Aldehydes''' replace the''' -e''' ending of an alkane with '''-al''' for an aldehyde.  Since an aldehyde is always at the carbon that is numbered one, a number designation is not needed.  For example, the aldehyde of pentane would simply be pentanal.

The '''-CH=O group of aldehydes''' is known as a formyl group. When a formyl group is attached to a ring, the ring name is followed by the suffix '''&quot;carbaldehyde&quot;'''. For example, a hexane ring with a formyl group is named cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

== Boiling Points and Bond Angles ==

'''Aldehyde and ketone''' polarity is characterized by the high dipole moments of their carbonyl group, which makes them rather polar molecules. They are more polar than alkenes and ethers, though because they lack hydrogen, they cannot participate in hydrogen bonding like alcohols, thus making their relative boiling points higher than alkenes and ethers, yet lower than alcohols.

Typical bond angles between the carbonyl group and its substituents show minor deviations from the trigonal planar angles of 120 degrees, with a slightly higher bond angle between the O=C-R bond than the R-C-R bond on the carbonyl carbon (with R being any substituent).

== Preparing Aldehydes and Ketones ==

=== Preparing Aldehydes ===

====Partial oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes====  
This reaction uses pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) in the absence of water (if water is present the alcohol will be oxidized further to a carboxylic acid).
[[Image:alcohol-aldehyde.PNG]]

====From fatty acids====
(HCOO)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Ca + HEAT ----&gt; HCHO + CaCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;
(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COO)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Ca + HEAT ----&gt; acetone + CaCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;
(CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COO)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Ca + (HCOO)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Ca ----&gt;ethanaldehyde

====Stephen reduction====
RCN + SnCl&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;+ HCL ----&gt; RCH=NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ----&gt; on hydrolysis gives RCHO

Here sulfur is used as a poisoner so that aldehyde formed doesn't get oxidised to the carboxylic acid.  
See [[w:Stephen aldehyde synthesis|the Wikipedia article]] for more detail.

====Rosenmund reaction====
RCOCl + Pd + BaSO&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt; + S ----&gt;RCHO
for solvent xylene is used

=== Preparing Ketones ===

====From Grignard reagents====
RCOOR' + R'MgX ----&gt;RCOR + R'OH

                     R'            R'      OH  
                     |             |       |
RC=O + R'-MgX ----&gt;R-C-OMgX-----&gt;R-C-OH + Mg-X
 |                   |             |  
 O-R'                OR'           OR'

====From nitriles====
RCN + R'MgX ----&gt; RCOR'(after hydrolysis)
HCN does not react with RMgX as HCN has acidic hydrogen which results in RH being formed.

====From gem dihalides====
RCCl&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;R + strong base ----&gt; RCOR

====Oppenaur oxidation====
Reagent is Aluminium tert. butoxide
solvent is acetone

ROH + ACETONE ----&gt; Ketone + isopropyl alcohol
this oxidation does not affect double bonds
in this oxidation ketone act as a oxidizing agent
this is exact opposite to merrwine pondroff reduction

====Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic compounds====
An aromatic ring reacts with a carboxylic acid chlorine (RCOCl) in the presence of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form an aryl ketone of the form ArCOR.

====Oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones====
A secondary alcohol can be oxidised into a ketone using acidified potassium dichromate(VI) and heating under reflux.

The orange dichromate(VI) ion, Cr2O72-, is reduced to the green Cr3+(aq) ion.

===Ozonolysis of alkenes===
It is a reaction in which the double bond is completely broken and the alkene molecule converted into two smaller molecules.&lt;p&gt; 
[[File:Ozonolysis Scheme.png|350px|center|A generalized scheme of ozonolysis]]
Ozonolysis (cleavage &quot;by ozone) is carried out in two stages: first, addition of ozone to the double bond to form an ozonide ; and second, hydrolysis of the ozonide to yield the cleavage products.&lt;p&gt;
Ozone gas is passed into a solution of the alkene in some inert solvent like carbon tetrachloride; evaporation of the solvent leaves the ozonide as a viscous oil. This unstable, explosive compound is not purified, but is treated directly with water, generally in the presence of a reducing agent. If oxidsing reagent is used, aldehyde or ketone if oxidisable can further oxidise into carboxylic acid which is not the case with reducing agents &lt;p&gt;
In the cleavage products a doubly-bonded oxygen is found attached to each of the originally doubly-bonded carbons.&lt;p&gt;
The function of the reducing agent, which is frequently zinc dust, is to prevent formation of hydrogen peroxide, which would otherwise react with the aldehydes and ketones. (Aldehydes, RCHO, are often converted into acids, RCOOH, for ease of isolation.)
=====Mechanism=====
The alkene and ozone form an intermediate molozonide in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Next, the molozonide reverts to its corresponding carbonyl oxide (also called the Criegee intermediate or Criegee zwitterion) and aldehyde or ketone in a retro-1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The oxide and aldehyde or ketone react again in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition or produce a relatively stable ozonide intermediate (a trioxolane)
[[File:Ozonolysis-2.png|600px|center|The reaction mechanism of ozonolysis.]]

===Hydration of alkynes===
Water is added to an alkyne in a strong acid. The strong acid used is 
sulfuric acid and mercuric acid.

==Keto-enol tautomerism==
In the presence of an acid (H+) or a base (OH-), the aldehyde or ketone will form an equilibrium with enols, in which the double bond of the carbonyl group migrates to form double bond between the carbonyl and the alpha (α) carbon.

In the presence of an acid, protonation of the oxygen group will occur, and water will abstract an alpha (α) hydrogen. 

In the presence of a base, deprotonation of the alpha hydrogen will occur, and a hydrogen from water will be abstracted by the carbonyl oxygen.

This is an important feature of ketone and aldehydes, and is known as the ''keto-enolic tautomery'' or ''keto-enol tautomerism'', i.e. the equilibrium of carbonyl compounds between two forms.

It must be stressed that the ''keto'' and the ''enol'' forms are '''two distinct compounds''', not isomers. They are known as tautomers of each other.
The presence of α-hydrogen is necessary for this equilibrium: those compounds not possessing it are called ''non-enolizable'' ketones.

== Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones ==

===Reactions with the carbonyl carbon===

Since aldehydes and ketones contain a polar carbonyl group, the partially positive carbon atom can act as an electrophile. Strong and weak nucleophiles are able to attack this carbonyl carbon, resulting in a net addition to the molecule.

====Nucleophilic addition====

With cyanide, nucleophilic addition occur to give a hydroxynitrile:

RR'C=O + CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; RR'COHCN

e.g. propanone &amp;rarr; 2-hydroxymethylpropanonitrile

===Reactions with the carbonyl oxygen===

The partially negative oxygen can act as a nucleophile, or be attacked by electrophiles.

===Oxidation===

Using a strong oxidizing agent such as the Tollens' Reagent (Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in aqueous ammonia) acidified dichromate, Benedict's/Fehling's reagent (essentially alkaline Cu&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;); aldehydes but not ketones may be oxidized into carboxylic acids.  This is one way to test for the presence of an aldehyde in a sample compound: an aldehyde will become a carboxylic acid when reacted with Tollens' reagent, but a ketone will not react.
when aldehydes react with fehling solution a red precipitate is obtained (due to formation of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) .

== Inductive Effect and Greek letter assignment ==

The carbonyl group is very electron withdrawing, and adjacent carbons are effected by induction. Using the carbonyl group as a reference, adjacent carbons are named using Greek letters in order of closeness to the carbonyl group. Alpha (α) carbons are directly attached to the carbonyl group, beta (β) carbons are connected to alpha carbons, gamma (γ) to beta (β), and so on.

Due to the inductive effect of the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon of a ketone or aldehyde, as well as the stabilizing resonance of the double bond between the hydroxyl group and conjugated carbons to the carbonyl group, the alpha (α) hydrogens are especially acidic, meaning they are especially prone to removal.

A [[geodesic]] is the generalization of a straight line for curved space.  They deal largely with [[calculus of variations]]


&lt;h2&gt;Metric Geodesics&lt;/h2&gt;
A metric geodesic is defined as a curve along the shortest or longest possible distance between two points.  Mathematically, it is defined as a curve whose length does not change with small variations that vanish at the endpoints.  This stability could be a minimum distance, a maximum distance, or a point of inflection.

Mathematically, a metric geodesic is defined by the curve

&lt;h2&gt;Affine Geodesics&lt;h2&gt;


For instance on the surface of a sphere the shortest possible distance between two points is always the circumference of the sphere that runs through those two points. Those points on the sphere define exactly one &quot;line&quot; that runs through them. This line can't be said to be straight in the Euclidean sense of the word. However, for the curved surface of the sphere it represents the shortest possible distance and is therefore a metric geodesic of that space and represents a straight path for that space.  Another possible geodesic for those two points is the other part of the circumference, which would be the longest path possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note that this information is presented in very simplistic form
for clarity. Atomic theory is much more complicated than most 
radio amateurs need to know but those that wish to know more should
explore the other wiki books or wikipedia entries on the subject.

=Atoms=

The smallest building block of all matter is the atom (from the Greek Atomos). An atom is the smallest little bit that retains all the characteristics of the element it represents. For instance, if you had an atom of copper, and you cut it further, it would no longer retain the characteristics of copper.

Atoms consist of smaller particles. In the nucleus, or centre of the atom, are neutrons and protons. Protons have a positive charge. Orbiting the nucleus of the atom are electrons that have a negative charge. [See [[w:Atom|Bohr atom]]. In simplest terms, electrons orbit the nucleus in orbits or shells. Each shell represents an energy state. The further from the nucleus, the more energetic the electron is. Each shell wants to contain a certain number of electrons to remain electrically stable. Neutral atoms have the same number of electrons and protons. This equal number is the atomic number of the element. 

Note that the terms positive and negative do not mean more and less in quantity but refer to the type of charge. 

What is interesting is that particles that have the same charge repel each other and particles that have opposite charges attract each other. If a proton meets an electron they join up to become a hydrogen atom, the simplest element.

If you add electrons and protons (and a scattering of neutrons which are neutral) you create the various elements of the world around us. 

Now, lets look at the copper atom, because it is one of the best known conductors of electricity. Silver and platinum are better conductors, but cost too much for general use, unless you are building a satellite.

Copper has an atomic number of 29. This tells us that there are 29 protons in the nucleus and 29 electrons arranges in shells or orbits around the nucleus. The first shell contains 2 ... leaving us 27 electrons, the next shell wants 8 ... leaving us 19 electrons .... the 3rd shell contains eighteen ... leaving us 1 electron for the 4th shell. Whoops.. the fourth shell wants 32 electrons. Electrons in an outer unfilled shell are known as valence electrons. It is possible to supply enough energy to the atom to overcome the electron's attraction to the nucleus and break it free from the atom. Most metals fall into this category. Because it only takes a little energy to break the electrons free, most metals are considered to be conductors. Elements that require a great deal of energy to break their electrons free are considered to be insulators.

What is the Wrong Way to Learn Spanish? There are many ways to learn a language, such as:
* Total immersion - the way very young children become native or bilingual speakers able to enjoy the natural pleasure that is chatting, joking and knowing about the things our friends share with us.
* Partial Immersion - the way migrants and traders communicate - not very elegant, but practical and functional. Quite fun, because mistakes are often quite surprising and can help us develop new ideas, and make new friends.
* Academic study - learning lots of vocabulary and grammar rules. Good for passing exams, but unlikely to be much fun
* The wrong way - (at least according to the professionals) probably the best for most of us, because it is a method of learning Spanish through amusing ourselves with informal but rewarding language activities outside of the rigid formal structure of school or academic study. 

In the Wrong Way to Learn Spanish, we focus on learning by doing. It is there to be used as a guide rather than the main structured teaching of school-books. Most learning in The Wrong Way to Learn Spanish method takes the form of games and entertainment : trivia, live gameshows played by the student, role-playing, jokes, and stories. Because it's made based on fun-filled [[wikipedia:Mnemonic|mnemonics]], learning Spanish in this way would be the same as a kid who is just having a good time, while building up one's knowledge on the Spanish vocabulary.

==Lesson 1: How to Learn New Vocabulary==
===Technique 1: Form Personal Mnemonics===
Spanish words often bear little resemblance to their English counterparts.  New Spanish students can overcome this by connecting the sound or spelling of a Spanish word to its meaning.  Review the examples of one Spanish student below.  

'''Zorro''' (ZOHR-roh) means fox. 

* Imagine a '''fox''' in  a '''zorro''' mask.

'''Gato''' (GAH-toh) means cat. 

* Imagine a '''cat''' with big '''ga'''ps between his '''toe'''s.

'''Perro''' (PEH-roh) means dog. 

* Imagine a '''dog''' jumping over a '''pair''' of '''row'''boats.

'''Oso''' (OH-soh) means bear. 

* Imagine spotting a huge bear looking at you, and running away because it is ''''oh-so''' big.'

'''Camarera''' (kah-mah-REH-rah) means waitress. 

* Imagine a waitress at a restaurant offering to take a picture with your '''came'''ra as you hang out with your friends.

'''Chico''' (CHEE-koh) means boy. 

* Think &quot;It would be a '''Chic'''k (i.e. female), but it isn't, because it has an '''o''' on the end, which makes it masculine, ergo, a guy, or boy.&quot;

===Exercise 1.===
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{ What is the English word for these Spanish words?
|type=&quot;{}&quot;}
&lt;ol&gt;
chico: { guy (i) }

oso: { bear (i) }

gato: { cat (i) }

zorro: { fox (i) }

camarera: { waitress (i) }

perro: { dog (i) }
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/quiz&gt;
==Lesson 2. Five More Words==

===Vocabulary===

'''Mesa''' (MAY-sah) means table. 

* Imagine a '''table''' '''ma'''de of '''sa'''lt licks.
* Imagine the [[wikipedia:mesa|geological structure]], with its flat, table-like surface.

'''Falda''' (FAlL-dah)means skirt. 

* Imagine a '''skirt''' worn in the '''fall''' by your '''da'''.
* Imagine a '''skirt''' with pleats or '''folds'''.
Most countries in South America use the term &quot;pollera&quot; (poh-YAY-rah), which is less formal

'''Agua''' (AH-gwaw) means water. 

* Imagine some '''water''' crying out &quot;'''Agh!'''&quot; and &quot;'''Wah!'''&quot; as it's poured into a bottle of Aguafina.
* Imagine some '''water''' in '''a''' cup contaminated with '''gua'''no.
* For those with literary and linguistic knowledge, Water = Aqua = the Spanish word '''Agua'''

'''Cabeza''' (kah-BAY-sah)means head. 

* Imagine a '''head''' sitting in a '''cab''' at the '''base''' of the passenger's side, crying out &quot;'''Ah!'''&quot; when the driver makes a sharp turn. (For the Castilian version, say the same thing with a lisp, so &quot;base&quot; sounds like &quot;bayth&quot;.)

'''Chica''' means girl. (cheeh-ka)

* Imagine kissing a '''girl''' on the '''cheek'''.

===Exercise 1.===
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{ What is the English word for these Spanish words?
|type=&quot;{}&quot;}
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cabeza: { head (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agua: { water (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mesa: { table (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zorro: { fox (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oso: { bear (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;falda: { skirt (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chico: { guy (i) }&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/quiz&gt;

==Lesson 3. The Gender of Words==

Words in Spanish have gender, which is the attribute of being masculine or feminine. In this sense, you can think about words being either boys or girls.

Words that are masculine generally end in '''o''' and words that are female generally end in '''a'''. Two important exceptions are '''el día''' (day) and '''la mano''' (hand).

Another way a teacher taught it was this: guys are LONERS and girls like DIJON mustard. Words ending in '''l''', '''o''', '''n''', '''e''', '''r''' and '''s''' are masculine. Words ending in '''d''', '''i''', '''a''' and '''sión''' are feminine. NOTE: It is true that there are exceptions to this, but if you have to guess at the gender of a word, it's a good method to try. Some important exceptions that are female are ''mujer'' means woman, ''flor'' means flower, ''actriz'' means actress, ''emperatriz'' means empress. Words ''macho'' and ''hembra'' don't have gender, it is used from gender of the noun. 

===Exercise 1.===
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{Are these words masculine(M) or feminine(F)?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
| M | F 
+- chico
-+ chica 
+- oso
-+ falda 
-+ mesa
+- zorro
-+ camarera 
+- gato 
+- agua (for singular)
-+ agua (for plurial)
+- perro 
-+ cabeza 
-+ mosquito hembra 
+- mosquito macho 
-+ flora 
-+ emperatriz
-+ vaca

Note that words like ''lobo'' can be either masculine or feminine.
&lt;/quiz&gt;
==Lesson 4. Your First Five Adjectives==

Adjectives that don't change with the gender of the noun:

* '''Grande'''- big

* '''Feroz'''- fierce

* '''Caliente'''- physically hot ''object'' (NOT the Air or Outside-Inside temperature, NOR the attractiveness of a specific person, usually. Hot in the spicy food sense is also not represented here.  That word is '''picante''')

* '''Inteligente'''- intelligent

* '''Interesante'''- interesting

==Lesson 5. Masculine and Feminine &quot;the&quot;==

In English, we have one word for &quot;the.&quot; In Spanish, there are four. Ah, but don't let this discourage you. After all, you already know three of them, and we are only going to be discussing two of them in this lesson.

Continuing with the theme of words having gender, the word &quot;the&quot; in Spanish also has gender, depending on what the noun it is used with. Think of this like clothing. Boy words wear tuxedoes and girl words wear dresses.

The tuxedo for boy words is &quot;el&quot;.

The dress for girl words is &quot;la.&quot; (Yes, very feminine sounding.)

&quot;The&quot; also has plurals (numbers three and four) which are &quot;los&quot; and &quot;las&quot;. But we'll get to that later.

==Lesson 6. &quot;Es&quot; and Your First Complete Sentences==

The word &quot;es&quot; is used as &quot;is,&quot; for description of what something or someone is, looks like, or belongs to. Do not use it for location.

e.g. '''La casa es grande.'''
The house is big.

e.g. '''El gato es feroz.'''
The cat is fierce.

The structure is article + noun + es + adjective.

Remember to make the adjective agree with the noun!

== Tildes (Create of the original Espanol) ==

The Tildes.

Modes:

*Aguda: -n , -s or vocal
*Llano: Consonant Different of -n , -s or vocal
*Esdrújula: Complete

=== Test 1 ===

* Prestamo (Tilde Off)- &lt;s&gt;omatsérP&lt;/s&gt;
* Gijon (Tilde Off) - &lt;s&gt;ónjiG&lt;/s&gt;
* Educacion (Tilde Off) - nóicacudE

* [[User:Fernandez|Gina]]: Hey, I'm one of the anal retentives who speaks Spanish and corrects discrepencies with definitions every now and then. Just remember that words may not mean the same thing with every spanish speaking person, depending on where they come from. There is Mexican Spanish, Cuban Spanish, Puerto Rican Spanish, Castillian Spanish, Spanish from the same country but different areas/regions that have dialectic changes, and please remember that Not everyone from South America speaks spanish, in some countries French and Portuguese are the languages spoken. Always ask first.

'''Of Mice and Men''' is a [[w:John Steinbeck|John Steinbeck]] novel set in the 1930s telling the story of migrant ranch workers and their dreams. The story focuses on two main characters, Lennie and George, who travel together. Lennie is a large, strong, mentally challenged man, while his friend, George, is small-framed, quick and intelligent. The name of the novel comes from a line contained in the second-to-last stanza of a famous poem written by Robert Burns called &quot;[[w:To a Mouse|To a Mouse]]&quot; which summarizes very well what happens in the story.

''The best laid schemes o' mice an' men''&lt;br /&gt;
''Gang aft agley,''&lt;br /&gt;
''An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain''&lt;br /&gt;
''For promis'd joy.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Swedes like to know to whom they are speaking, and this means that when speaking to a Swede, introductions are in order. While Swedish used to be more formal and included a strict use of titles indicating social, and marital status, this is completely abolished. Even very old people expect to be addressed as ''du'' &quot;you&quot;  and only occasionally is ''Ni'' &quot;you (plural)&quot; used by sales clerks to address customers.

The simplest way to greet a Swede is to establish eye-contact, followed by a simple ''hej'' &quot;hi&quot;. It should not be confused with the English &quot;hey&quot;, the use of which is more to attract attention, a meaning the Swedish greeting does not contain. A variation and more informal variant of this word is ''hejsan''. To show enthusiasm, you can repeat words; ''hej hej''. Shaking hands is the most common way of greeting a stranger in Sweden. More informal and friendly forms of greeting are the words ''tja'', ''tjena'' or ''tjenare''. Though more common among younger people, they are often used by considerably older speakers to establish familiarity or intimacy with the listener.

''God dag'' &quot;good day&quot; has a formal tone to it, but is very seldom used in everyday life, and is mostly seen in formal speeches and likewise. In the morning, ''god morgon'' &quot;good morning&quot;, is commonly used and is not perceived as particularly formal, if polite. In the evening ''god kväll'' &quot;good evening&quot; can be used, but like ''god dag'' it's quite uncommon either with strangers or friends, but is entirely appropriate for a TV host to say in the introduction of a show.

==Dialogue==

Two students are meeting in a university cafeteria in Sweden. One of them is Sven - a Swedish student - and the other one is Peter - an American exchange student.

'''Sven:''' Hej. Hur mår du? &lt;br&gt;
''English: Hi. How are you?'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Peter:''' Bara bra, tack. Förlåt, jag har glömt, varifrån kommer du nu igen? &lt;br&gt;
''English: Just fine, thanks. Sorry, I have forgotten, where are you from now again?'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Sven:''' Jag kommer från Sverige. Varifrån kommer du? &lt;br&gt;
''English: I'm from Sweden. Where do you come from?'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Peter:''' Jag är amerikansk, jag kommer från USA. &lt;br&gt; 
''English: I am American, I'm from the USA.'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Sven:''' Ja, just det! Förlåt, vad heter du igen? &lt;br&gt;
''English: Oh, that's right! Sorry, what's your name again?'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Peter:''' Jag heter Peter och du heter Sven. &lt;br&gt;
''English: My name is Peter and your name is Sven.'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Sven:''' Tack. Vi ses! &lt;br&gt;
''English: Thank you. See you later!'' &lt;br&gt;

==Long and short vowels==
Not unlike many other Scandinavian languages, Swedish distinguishes quite clearly between ''long'' and ''short'' vowels. English doesn't have the same clear distinction, but the phonetic sound differences are in the language. Compare for example the A in &quot;haha&quot; with the A in &quot;heart,&quot; the former being short and the latter being long. The short A in &quot;haha&quot; matches the short Swedish A pretty well, as does the A in &quot;heart&quot; but with the long A.

To defer long or short vowels in written language, the consonants is repeated immediately after the vowel to hint for a short vowel, and only one to hint for a long. &quot;Kommer&quot; (coming) has a short O, because there are two M's, but it also has a short E, because more often than not, a word ends in a short vowel to aid in language flow when spoken. K is an exception to this rule, as you write &quot;CK&quot; when you want to hint for a short vowel.

There are traces of a similar system in English, for example &quot;rock&quot; has a short O, compared to &quot;rookie&quot; which has a long O, but instead of letting the single consonant hint for a long O, &quot;rookie&quot; has two O's, unlike Swedish, where something along the lines of &quot;rokie&quot; would have been enough to say that the O is probably a long O.

==Phrases==
*Hur är det? -- How is it?
*Hur mår du? -- How are you?
*Var bor du? -- Where do you live? 
*Jag bor i ___ -- I live in ___
*Vad heter du? -- What's your name?
*Jag heter ___ -- My name is ___
*Varifrån kommer du? -- Where are you from?
*Jag kommer ifrån ___ -- I'm from ___
*Och du [själv]? -- And you?
*Ha det bra! -- Have a nice day!
*Vi ses! -- See you (later)!*
*Vi hörs! -- We'll keep in touch!*
*Tack! -- Thanks!
*Jag har glömt -- I've forgotten

Note that &quot;hörs&quot; and &quot;ses&quot; use a verb form that English does not have, a reciprocal form. It expresses a reciprocal action, signifying that people will hear from or see each other.

==Vocabulary==
*Bra -- Good.
*Förlåt -- Sorry. Literally &quot;pardon (me)&quot;.
*Igen -- Again.
*Och -- And.

*Amerika -- America*
*Chile -- Chile
*England -- England
*Kina -- China
*Italien -- Italy
*Nederländerna -- Netherlands
*Peru -- Peru
*Polen -- Poland
*Somalien -- Somalia
*Sverige -- Sweden
*Tyskland -- Germany
*Tjeckien -- Czech Republic
*Turkiet -- Turkey
*Ungern -- Hungary
*Vietnam -- Vietnam
*Japan -- Japan
*Sydkorea -- South Korea
*Nordkorea -- North Korea
*Spanien -- Spain

U.S. is USA (never US) in Swedish. It can also be called Amerikas Förenta Stater; and (very frequently) just Amerika.

==Exercise==
Write a short dialogue, or practice with a friend. In the dialogue, use the phrases for greeting someone, telling them your name and where you're from. Finish it by using one of the phrases for telling the other person goodbye.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Actually you *can* do that (in C99 at least)

You use a linked list (instead of a memory allocated array) when you need fast element deletions and insertions at any
place in the data sequence, but do not require fast random access. You could use a different data structure, like a heap
to do the same thing. But a list is simpler to program. A heap only is significantly better when your data is ordered and
you need quicker random access.

:Good point. Perhaps the emphasis should be placed on being able to insert items in the middle versus just the end, or as a way of chaining already allocated objects together. I have to say, with automatic realloc features being common in languages, as with pointers (instead of the field values themselves) it makes more sense to use vectors than the linked lists we all used in the C days. [[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]]

== LINKED LIST ==

LINKED LIST:-linked is a chain of object.it is dynamic data structure.there are three types of data structure 
1.singly linked list:-
each node contain the next node and last node contain NULL value and the address of the first node held start pointer.   
2.doubly linked list:-
each node contains the address of next node as well as the address previous node and address of the next field of the last node contain NULL
and address of the previous field of the first node also contain NULL.
3.circular linked list:-
each node containing the address of next node but last node contain the first node.
*OPERATION IN SINGLE LINKED LIST*
(1)insertion:
-beg
-between
-last
(2)traversing
(3)searching
(4)deletion:
-beg
-between
-last
##ALGORITHM OF TRAVERSING##
[1]. make current node point to the first node in the list.
[2]. repeat the step 3 and 4 until current node become NULL.
[3]. display the information contained in the node MARKED as current node.
[4]. make current node to the next in the sequence.
@@PROGRAM OF TRAVERSING@@
Node currentNode=Start
      while(currentNode!=NULL)
         {
          console.WriteLine(currentNode.Marked)
          currentNode=currentNode.next;

The article once said:

Similiar to the outputs of a microcontroller, the inputs cannot &quot;sink&quot; a lot of current.  However, this is somewhat irrelavant because the [[sensors]] that allow the microcontroller to &quot;see&quot; the world do not use very much power.  Therefore, an appropriate, low power [[resistor]] connected as a [[series circuit]] to the [[sensor]] is all that is needed to attach it to the microcontroller [[input]].

''This seems misleading. Most inputs (because they are connected only to CMOS gates) do not sink *any* (DC) current.''

== [[Embedded Systems]] ==

I'm going to start merging the [[Microcontroller]] book into the [[Embedded Systems]] book. I also think that it doesnt make sense to merge this page into that book: the robotics book does deserve to have at least some coverage of microcontrollers. However, it would probably be a good idea to link to the [[Embedded Systems]] book for this, for further reading on this topic. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

IMO much of the content of the microcontrollers page is going to be pretty much the same as the content for a microcontrollers page in the embedded systems book. I suggest you go ahead with the merge and I'll link to the embedded systems book and cover on this page robotics-specific microcontroller topics. Although this probably isn't going to be very much, as most of the things that apply for embedded hardware is going to apply in the same way for robotics. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 07:19, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

This guide assumes you have previous knowledge about C programming and will present you '''Message-Passing Interface''' (MPI) by several examples.

== What is MPI ? ==

MPI is a standardized and portable message-passing system. Message-passing systems are used especially on distributed machines with separate memory for executing parallel applications. With this system, each executing process will communicate and share its data with others by sending and receiving messages. MPI is the specification resulting from the MPI-Forum which involved several organizations designing a portable system (that can allow programs to work on a heterogeneous network).

Since the data can only be shared by exchanging messages, this standard is not intended for use on shared-memory systems, like a multiprocessor computer (although it will work, it is not the primary goal and there are more powerful alternatives, for instance, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmp OpenMP]). Basically, MPI includes point-to-point communication, collective communication (over a network of processes), process groups, bindings for Fortran and C and other advanced functions. On the other hand, the standard does not specify explicit shared-memory operations, debugging facilities, explicit support for threads, I/O functions.

The current version is 2.0, although 1.1 is still used.

=== Documentation ===

The volume Using MPI: Portable Parallel Programming with the Message-Passing Interface by William Gropp, Ewing Lusk and Anthony Skjellum is recommended as an introduction to MPI. For more complete information, read [http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/mpi-book/mpi-book.html MPI: The Complete Reference] by Snir, Otto, Huss-Lederman, Walker and Dongarra. Also, the standard itself can be found at [http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/docs.html] or [http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/standard.html]. For other Internet references, such as tutorials, see the [http://dmoz.org/Computers/Parallel_Computing/Programming/Libraries/MPI/ Open Directory Project] or the [http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/tutorial/ List of Tutorials] at the Argonne National Laboratory.

=== Implementation ===

Currently, there are two principal implementations: MPICH and LAM. The official web-site of the latter ([http://www.lam-mpi.org/]) contains much information about LAM and also about MPI.

=== Supplementary library ===

Additionally libraries exist for solving numerical problem or for using I/O functions on a distributed machine. We can mention: the ScaLAPACK library, FFTW (a portable C FFT library), the PETSc Scientific Computing Libraries. A more complete list can be found on the site [http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/]

=== Developing tools ===

==== Compilers ====

Each implementation provides a compiler or at least a front-end to an existing compiler.

==== Debugging ====

As MPI doesn't specify debugging facilities, some program can be used to this purpose: XMPI is a run/debug GUI for LAM/MPI; MPI-CHECK is a debugger for Fortran; Etnus, Inc. offers a version of the Totalview debugger that supports MPICH (as well as some other MPI implementations); and, Streamline Computing's Distributed Debugging Tool works with several MPI implementations, include MPICH and LAM/MPI.

==== Benchmarks ====

Mpptest, SKaMPI and MPBench measure the performance of MPI implementations. They can be used to decide what implementation to use, how to implement portable and efficient MPI programs and also for predicting the performance of MPI programs.

Famous and popular MPI benchmark includes NASA Parallel Benchmark, SpecMPI 2007 and HPCC benchmark suite.

=== Applications ===

It can be used on large heterogeneous parc.

== Examples ==

=== Sum of an array ===

The point of this first simple example is to calculate the sum of all the value stored in an array. In C programming, the sequential version will be as below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 
 /* Sum of an array - Sequential version */
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #define N 100000
 
 int main (void) {
   float array[N];
   double mysum = 0;
   unsigned long long i;
   //Initialization of the array
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
     array[i] = i + 1;
   //Calculation of the sum
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
     mysum += array[i];
   printf (&quot;%lf\n&quot;, mysum);
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== First version - Basic point-to-point communications ====

MPI implementations allow a user to launch several processes which will each have a defined numerical identifier, its ''rank''. Conventionally, we will consider that the master is the process which has the rank '0'.  All other processes are slaves. In this program, the master divides the array into sub-arrays and sends these to each slave. Each slave will then calculate the sum of its sub-array. In the case where the size of the array is not an even multiple of the number of slaves, the master will finish the remaining work by calculating the sum of the last values of the array (see figure below).

[[Image:Distribution_array_to_processes.png|thumbnail|Distribution of data from an array to processes]]

For each process, the source code of the program is identical and thus the executable code is, also. The code therefore must contain both the slave and the master parts.  The part that will be executed depends on the rank of the process.

In this first version, the work is divided into just two parts:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Sum of an array - First parallel version */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
 
 #define N 100000
 #define MSG_DATA 100
 #define MSG_RESULT 101
 
 void master (void);
 void slave (void);
 
 int main (int argc, char **argv) {
   int myrank;
   //Initialization of MPI
   MPI_Init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
   //myrank will contain the rank of the process
   MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;myrank);
   //The part of the program which will be executed is decided
   if (myrank == 0)
     master ();
   else
     slave ();
   MPI_Finalize ();
   return 0;
 }
 
 void master (void) {
   float array[N];
   double mysum = 0, tmpsum;
   unsigned long long i;
   MPI_Status status;
   //Initialization of the array
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
     array[i] = i + 1;
   //The array is divided by two and each part is sent to the slaves
   MPI_Send (array, N / 2, MPI_FLOAT, 1, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   MPI_Send (array + N / 2, N / 2, MPI_FLOAT, 2, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   //The master receive the result from the slaves
   MPI_Recv (&amp;tmpsum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 1, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   mysum += tmpsum;
   MPI_Recv (&amp;tmpsum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 2, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   mysum += tmpsum;
   printf (&quot;%lf\n&quot;, mysum);
 }
 
 void slave (void) {
   float array[N];
   double sum;
   unsigned long long i;
   MPI_Status status;
   //The slave receives the array from the master
   MPI_Recv (array, N / 2, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   for (i = 0, sum = 0; i &lt; N / 2; i++)
     sum += array[i];
   //The result is send to the master
   MPI_Send (&amp;sum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 }

&lt;/source&gt;

This program will be explained step by step.

First, for using MPI functions, we must include the file &lt;tt&gt;mpi.h&lt;/tt&gt; which contains the prototypes of the required functions. The size of the array is next defined by &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;MSG_DATA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MSG_RESULT&lt;/code&gt; will be used by the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Send&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;MPI_RECV&lt;/code&gt; functions. Two prototypes of functions are declared. These functions contain the code for the master process and for the slave processes, respectively.

The main function chooses whether it should execute the master part (if the process rank is 0) or the slave part (for any other process rank.) The function begins with the &lt;code&gt;MPI_INIT&lt;/code&gt; routine that must be called before any other MPI functions.  This routine performs various initialization functions.  Next, the rank of the process is obtained by calling the &lt;code&gt;MPI_COMM_RANK&lt;/code&gt; function and, depending on the result, the master part or the slave part is executed. At the end of the computation, the final routine &lt;code&gt;MPI_FINALIZE&lt;/code&gt; is called.  It performs various administrative tasks associated with ending the use of MPI.

Two declarations not found in the sequential version of the program are included in the master: the &lt;code&gt;tmpsum &lt;/code&gt;variable, which will store the result in each of the two slaves, and the &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt; variable (whose type is defined by MPI), which is needed by the &lt;code&gt;MPI_RECV&lt;/code&gt; function.

The computation part is now replaced by two calls to &lt;code&gt;MPI_SEND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MPI_RECV&lt;/code&gt;.  The arguments of the &lt;code&gt;MPI_SEND&lt;/code&gt; function are the address of the first element to send, the number of elements to send, their type (the more common MPI types are &lt;code&gt;MPI_INT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MPI_CHAR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MPI_FLOAT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MPI_DOUBLE&lt;/code&gt;, ...), the rank of the receiver, the tag of the message, and the communicator.  In the simplest usage, the communicator would be &lt;code&gt;MPI_COMM_WORLD&lt;/code&gt;, which includes all the processes sharing in the execution of the program.  The arguments of the &lt;code&gt;MPI_RECV&lt;/code&gt; function are the address of the receive buffer, the maximum number of elements to receive, their type, the rank of the sender, the tag of the message, communicator, and the status. For a common message, the type, the tag and the communicator must be the same (see figure below).

[[Image:Arguments_MPI_SEND_RECV.png|thumbnail|Arguments of the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Send&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MPI_RECV&lt;/code&gt; functions for a same message]]

The first half of the array is sent to the first slave and the second half of the array is sent to the second.  In each case, the size of the sub-array is &lt;code&gt;N/2&lt;/code&gt;. Next, the result is received from the slaves, stored, and added to the final sum.

Before it can receive the computed sums from the slaves, however, each slave must first sum the elements of the sub-array it has received from the master.  The slave then sends the result back to the master.

When several messages are sent to the same process in an arbitrary order, the tag argument allow this process to distinguish between these messages and to receive them.

For execute this program with a lam implementation, the lam daemon must be started:

 $ lamboot

Next, mpicc and mpirun are used for the compilation and the execution:

 $ mpicc ./source.c
 $ mpirun -np 3 ./a.out

The option -np specifies the number of processes to launch. In this example, it must be three (one master, two slaves). The program &lt;code&gt;mpirun&lt;/code&gt; creates an MPI environment, coppying &lt;tt&gt;a.out&lt;/tt&gt; to all three processors and running each one with the appropriate processor number set.

==== Second version - Adaptiveness to the number of processes ====

This basic program has two problems:
* The program needs two slaves for running correctly and cannot adapt it-self to the number of processes available
* The master receives the data in a predefined order (the first slave and then the second). However the second slave can finish before the first

This leads to this second version:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Sum of an array - Second parallel version */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
 
 #define N 100000
 #define MSG_DATA 100
 #define MSG_RESULT 101
 
 void master (void);
 void slave (void);
 
 int main (int argc, char **argv) {
   int myrank;
   MPI_Init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
   MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;myrank);
   if (!myrank)
     master ();
   else
     slave ();
   MPI_Finalize ();
   return 0;
 }
 
 void master (void) {
   float array[N];
   double mysum, tmpsum;
   unsigned long long step, i;
   int size;
   MPI_Status status;
   //Initialization of the array
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
     array[i] = i + 1;
   MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;size);
   if (size != 1)
     step = N / (size - 1);
   //The array is divided by the number of slaves
   for (i = 0; i &lt; size - 1; i++)
     MPI_Send (array + i * step, step, MPI_FLOAT, i + 1, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   //The master completes the work if necessary
   for (i = (size - 1) * step, mysum = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
     mysum += array[i];
   //The master receives the results in any order
   for (i = 1; i &lt; size; mysum += tmpsum, i++)
     MPI_Recv (&amp;tmpsum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   printf (&quot;%lf\n&quot;, mysum);
 }
 
 void slave (void) {
   float array[N];
   double sum;
   unsigned long long i;
   int count;
   MPI_Status status;
   MPI_Recv (array, N, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   //The slave finds the size of the array
   MPI_Get_count (&amp;status, MPI_FLOAT, &amp;count);
   for (i = 0, sum = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
     sum += array[i];
   MPI_Send (&amp;sum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

For the first issue, the master needs the number of processes to determinate the size of the sub-array (which will be stored in the step variable). The &lt;code&gt;MPI_COMM_SIZE&lt;/code&gt; function gives this indication in the size variable, so &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; is divided by the number of slaves, namely  &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;−1 . The array is next sent to slave and while the slave will compute, the master will finish the work if it is necessary. It will then receive the result and add these to the final sum. For solving the second issue, the master will receive result from any source. This leads to the use of MPI_ANY_SOURCE in the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Recv&lt;/code&gt; function in place of the rank of the process.

The slave does not need to know the number of processes but does the size of the sub-array that it has received. For this we will use the status argument. Actually, status is a structure that contains three data: the source of the message (useful if &lt;code&gt;MPI_ANY_SOURCE&lt;/code&gt; is used), the tag of the message (if &lt;code&gt;MPI_ANY_TAG&lt;/code&gt; is used), and the error code. Additionally, we can access to the real length of the received data by using the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Get_count&lt;/code&gt; function and the status argument. The count variable is the length of the sub-array.

This version of the program can be used with any number of processes, even 1. In this special case, the master will do all the calculations.

Unfortunately, this program is not adapted to MPI because, there is a lot of data transfer and a little computation. While MPI is designed for non-shared memory operation, there must be more computation than data transferring for losing the less possible time in message. We could improve this program by sending only the first number and the last to sum (and to add all integer between these), but in this case only geometric sum can be calculated.

=== Integration by the [[WikiPedia:Simpson's rule|Simpson method]] ===

The purpose of this program is to calculate the integral of a given function by the [[WikiPedia:Simpson's rule|Simpson method]]. This example is more adapting to MPI, because it requires more computation and less data-transferring than previously. The mathematical equation is:

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{a}^{b}f\left(x\right)dx=\frac{b-a}{3n}\left[f\left(x_{0}\right)+4f\left(x_{n-1}\right)+f\left(x_{n}\right)+2\sum_{k=1}^{\frac{n}{2}-1}\left[2f\left(x_{2k-1}\right)+f\left(x_{2k}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt; 

In C programming, the sequential version is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Integration - Simpson method - Sequential version */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 #define n 10000 //Must be even
 
 double f (double x);
 
 int main (void) {
   double integration,step;
   int i;
   printf (&quot;Enter the domain of integration: &quot;);
   scanf (&quot;%lf %lf&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b);
   step = (b - a) / n;
   for (i = 1, integration = 0; i &lt; n / 2; i++)
     integration += 2*f(a+(2*i-1)*step) + f(a+2*i*step);
   integration *= 2;
   integration += f(a) + f(b) + 4*f(b - step);
   integration *= step / 3;
   printf (&quot;%.15lf\n&quot;, integration);
   return 0;
 }
 
 double f (double x) {
   return exp(-1*pow(x,2));
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== First version - User-defined type ====

The work to be done is a sum like in the precedent example (an array with different coefficient to each boxes). The work will be divided as shown in the figure below.

[[Image:Distribution_sum_to_processes.png|thumbnail|Distribution of the data from a sum to processes.]]

The sum is divided and calculated by the slave and the master calculate the other values and complete the work if necessary as before.

The domain of the sum will be sent to each slave and they will evaluate several return values of the function and sum these. The information that will be sent are the beginning of the sum (begin), the difference between each value (step) and the number of value for which the function must be evaluated (two double and one integer). However, the data send by the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Send&lt;/code&gt; routine must have the same type. Then, for minimizing the number of message to send and so for optimizing the program, a MPI type will be created and used for sending these data.

Generally, the data to send must be grouped and minimized for reducing the time wasted in communication (sending the minimum of message and with the minimum of data). So, two integer must be stored in a array and sent in a unique message rather than sent in two different messages.

Since the division of the work is faster than the work it-self, when a few processes are used, the master will wait a relatively long time for the result of the slaves. In this program, when there is less than a defined number of processes (LIMIT_PROC), the master will participate to the computation (namely, the work will be divided by the number of processes rather than the number of slave).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

   MPI_Aint disp[3] = { 0, ext, 2 * ext };

   scanf (&quot;%lf %lf&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b);
   mydomain.step = (b - a) / n; //step of the integration
   //The work is divided
   if (size &gt; 1) {
     if (size &gt; LIMIT_PROC)
       mydomain.number = (n / 2 - 1) / (size - 1);

   }

   //The master receive the result
   for (i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {
     MPI_Recv (&amp;sum, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, MSG_RESULT,
     MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
     integration += sum;
   }
   integration *= 2;
   integration += f (a) + f (b) + 4 * f (b - mydomain.step);
   integration *= mydomain.step / 3;
   printf (&quot;%.15lf\n&quot;, integration);
 }
 
 void slave (void) {
   double sum;
   int i;
   struct domain_of_sum mydomain;
   MPI_Status status;
   MPI_Datatype Domain = Init_Type_Domain (); //Creation of the MPI type 
   MPI_Type_commit (&amp;Domain);
   MPI_Recv (&amp;mydomain, 1, Domain, 0, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   for (i = 0, sum = 0; i &lt; mydomain.number; i++)
     sum += 2*f(mydomain.begin+(2*i)*mydomain.step) + f(mydomain.begin+(2*i+1)*mydomain.step);
   MPI_Send (&amp;sum, 1, MPI_LONG_LONG_INT, 0, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 }

&lt;/source&gt;

All the routine used for creating the MPI type are regrouped in the function Init_Type_Domain for simplifying the code. The function &lt;code&gt;MPI_TYPE_STRUCT&lt;/code&gt; is used for creating the new type and store it in Domain. This function need 5 arguments: the number of blocks that the new type will contain (in this case two doubles and one integer); the number of each elements of these blocks in an array (one double, another double and one integer); an array of the displacement of each block in the message; an array of these types; and, the address of the variable which will contain the structure. The displacement of each blocks is obtained by the use of the &lt;code&gt;MPI_TYPE_EXTENT&lt;/code&gt; function which give the length of a &lt;code&gt;MPI_DOUBLE&lt;/code&gt;. It is the equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;sizeof()&lt;/code&gt; function in C. The length of a MPI type is store in a &lt;code&gt;MPI_Aint&lt;/code&gt; variable.

An other possibility would be to declare a structure that contains a array of two doubles and a integer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 struct domain_of_sum {
   double array[2]; //Contains begin and step
   int number;
 };
 
 //The new MPI type
 MPI_Datatype Init_Type_Domain (void) {
   MPI_Datatype Domain;
   MPI_Datatype type[2] = { MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_INT };
   int blocklen[2] = { 2, 1 };
   MPI_Aint ext;
   MPI_Type_extent (MPI_DOUBLE, &amp;ext);
   MPI_Aint disp[2] = { 0, 2 * ext };
   MPI_Type_struct (2, blocklen, disp, type, &amp;Domain);
   return Domain;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Second version ====

Two different methods have been used for determining the number of operations that the slave must realize. In the first example, the slave use the status argument of the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Recv&lt;/code&gt; function. In the second, this number was directly sent with the data. An other way is to obtain this by the same way that the master fixed this data, namely with the number of processes. For minimizing the quantity of data-transfer, we will use this last method (this version is just a optimization):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

   }
   //The master complete the work

     integration += sum;
   }
   integration *= 2;
   integration += f (a) + f (b) + 4 * f (b - mydomain[1]);
   integration *= mydomain[1] / 3;
   printf (&quot;%.15lf\n&quot;, integration);
 }
 
 void slave (void) {
   double sum;
   int i, size, number;

 }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Product of a vector and a matrix ===

The point of this program is to calculate the product of a vector and a matrix. In C programming, the sequential version is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Product of a vector by a matrix - Sequential version */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
 #define N 10000
 
 void writecolumn (float *A);
 
 int main (int argc, char **argv) {
   float *A = (float *) malloc (N * N * sizeof (float)), B[N], C[N];
   unsigned int i, j, step;
   int size;
   //Initialization
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
     for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
       *(A + i * N + j) = i + j;
     B[i] = 1;
   }
   //Product of the matrix and the vector
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
     for (j = 0, C[i] = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
       C[i] += *(A + i * N + j) * B[j];
   writecolumn(C);
   free (A);
   return 0;
 }
 
 void writecolumn (float *A) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
   printf (&quot;%f\n&quot;, *(A + i));
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== First version - Broadcast ====

For parallelizing this program, the matrix will be divide by groups of lines and each part will be sent to a different slave while the vector will be sent to every slave (see figure below).

[[Image:Distribution_matrix_to_processes.png|thumbnail|Distribution of the data from a matrix to processes]]

Sending the same data to each slave can be done by broadcasting these data with the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Bcast&lt;/code&gt; function which must be called by all the processes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Product of a vector by a matrix - First parallel version */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 }
 
 int Get_the_number (int size) {
   int number;
   if (size &gt; 1) {
     if (size &gt; LIMIT_PROC)
       number = N / (size - 1);
     else
       number = N / size;
   }
   return number;
 }
 
 void master (void) {

   unsigned int i, j, step;
   int size;

   //Initialization
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
     for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
       *(A + i * N + j) = i + j;
     B[i] = 1;
   }
   //Division of work
   MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;size);
   step = Get_the_number (size);
   //Broadcast of the vector
   MPI_Bcast (B, N, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   for (i = 1; i &lt; size; i++)
     MPI_Send (A + (i - 1) * step * N, N * step, MPI_FLOAT, i, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   //Finishing the work
   for (i = (size - 1) * step; i &lt; N; ++i)
     for (j = 0, C[i] = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
       C[i] += *(A + i * N + j) * B[j];
   buff = (float *) malloc (step * sizeof (float));
   //Receive and reorder
   for (i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {
     MPI_Recv (buff, step, MPI_FLOAT, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, MSG_RESULT,
     MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
     for (j = 0; j &lt; step; j++)
       C[j + (status.MPI_SOURCE - 1) * step] = buff[j];
   }
   writecolumn(C);
   free (A);
   free (buff);
 }
 
 void slave (void) {
   float Vect[N];
   unsigned int i, j, step;
   int size;
   MPI_Status status;
   MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;size);
   step = Get_the_number (size);
   float *result = (float *) malloc (step * sizeof (float));
   float *partmat = (float *) malloc (step * N * sizeof (float));
   MPI_Bcast (Vect, N, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   MPI_Recv (partmat, N * step, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MSG_DATA, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;status);
   for (i = 0; i &lt; step; ++i)
     for (j = 0, result[i] = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
       result[i] += Vect[j] ** (partmat + i * N + j);
   MPI_Send (result, step, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MSG_RESULT, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   free (partmat);
   free (result);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;MPI_Bcast&lt;/code&gt; function requires fewer arguments than the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Send&lt;/code&gt; and the MPI_Recv&lt;/code&gt; functions.
The &lt;code&gt;MPI_Bcast&lt;/code&gt; function requires the address of the buffer that contains or will contain the broadcasting data, the number of entries in the buffer, these type, the rank of the broadcast root (the process that will send the data) and the communicator. There are neither tag nor status arguments because they serve to differentiate messages and to give informations about the receiving data and in this case, all processes are involved in the broadcast message (so, there is no need to differentiate message) and the information stored in status are known (the source is the broadcast root, the length is the number of entries and there is no tag).

When the master receive the data, it must reorder it because the order of receiving is not specified (&lt;code&gt;MPI_ANY_SOURCE&lt;/code&gt;). For this purpose, the status structure contains the source of the message which is used for reordering and composing the vector.

In this example, the matrix is stored in a one-dimensional array in place of a conventional two-dimensinal array. It is possible to send a multi-dimensional array with MPI, but it must be carefully allocated. Namely, the array must be stored contiguously because the first argument of sent functions is the address of the starting buffer, and the second argument specifies the number of the following values that will be sent. Then the static and dynamic allocation are:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Static allocation */
 int array[rows][columns];

 /* Dynamic allocation */
 int **array;
 array = (int**) malloc (rows * sizeof(int*));
 if (array == NULL) exit (-1);
 
 array[0] = (int*) malloc (rows * columns * sizeof(int));
 if (array[0] == NULL) exit (-1);
 
 for (i=1; i&lt;rows; i++)
   array[i] = array[0] + i * columns;
 
 /* Send either kind of array */
 MPI_Send (array[0],rows*columns,MPI_INT,0,0,MPI_COMM_WORLD);
&lt;/source&gt;
==== Second version - Scatter and gather ====

The MPI specification provides collective communication functions, and the &lt;code&gt;MPI_Bcast&lt;/code&gt; function is one of these. The next version of this program will use the &quot;scatter&quot; and &quot;gather&quot; functions which, respectively, send different data to everyone and  receive different data from everyone (see figure below).

[[Image:scatter_gather.png|thumbnail|Principle of the scatter and gather functions]]

Thus, the work will be divided a little differently, namely, the master will also participate in the computation.

   //The master make its part (the same code is used for the slaves)

Note that in the first case, the master sends data to itself and in the second, it receives data from itself. In this example, the matrix is divided by the number of processes and the master sends the first part to itself, the second part to the first slave, etc.  Afterwards the master receives the first part of the resulting vector from itself, the second from the first slave, etc.

=== Cellular automata ===

In this example, we will code a cellular automata. A cellular automata is the evolution of a matrix on which we execute a defined function until there is convergence or cyclic phenomena. The function return a value for each point of the matrix depending of the value of his four neighbors. The border of the matrix will have the same value than the border of there opposite side. The resulting matrix will be a torus. In C programming, the sequential version is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

   //Each border of the matrix will have the same value than the border of his opposite side

     *(A+i*length)=*(A+i*length+length-2);
     *(A+i*length+length-1)=*(A+i*length+1);
   }
 }
 
 void writemat (int *A) {
   int i,j;
   for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
     for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
       printf (&quot;%d &quot;, *(A + i*N +j));
     printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
   }

 int f (int x1,int x2,int x3,int x4) {
   return x1+x2+x3+x4&gt;2;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== First version - Deadlock ====

The matrix will be divided by group of lines like in the figure [fig:vect]. For calculating the new part of the matrix, the functions applied need the values of points that belong to other parts of the matrix and then, each process will calculate the new matrix and exchange the first line and the last line with its two neighbors (see figure below).

[[Image:Partitioning_communications.png|thumbnail|Partitioning of the matrix and communication between processes]]

While the processes share their data, a dead-lock can occur. A deadlock is a blocking state of a program due to the fact that one process is waiting for a specific action to be taken by another process, but the latter process is waiting for a specific action to be taken by the former process. This phenomena leads to a permanent waiting state (see figure below).

[[Image:Deadlock.png|thumbnail|Example of deadlock]]

A deadlock can occur in this code because the MPI_SEND and MPI_RECV functions block the program until they are completed, namely, until the receiver receives the message sent or the sender sends the message to be received. If all the processes perform the same code (excluding the master), process one will send data to process two, process two will send data to process three, etc.  Process one will wait until process two receives its data, but this will never happen because process two is also waiting until process three receives its data. Because the communication is cyclic, the program is blocked. As a first solution, we can change the order of sending and receiving on each even process.

     }
     writemat(result,N);
   }
   MPI_Finalize ();
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the master and the slave have almost the same code, so it is not necessary to divide the code in two functions (the code specific to the master is simply be preceded by a condition on the rank).

While the master wait for data from the process 1, the process 1 send data to the master. Then it wait for data from the master while this one send data to its. The code will have the same behavior for all processes and thus is safe.

==== Second version - Non-blocking send and receive ====

A second solution is to use non-blocking send and receive: these functions are called and give immediately the hand to the process. Then, the process can make some computation and when the data of the message need to be accessed, it can completed it by calling some appropriate functions. Program using non-blocking communication functions can be faster. In this second version, all the functions will be completed just after that all send and all receive are begun.

In the previous example, the dimension of the matrix should be a multiple of the number of processes because the remaining lines were not send to any process. In this version, the master send these lines to the last process and receive the resulting line separately.

&lt;/source&gt;

The MPI_Isend and the MPI_Irecv (I means immediate) functions need a supplementary argument: the address of a MPI_Request variable which will identify the request for a later completion. The status argument will be given to the completion functions. MPI_WAIT is used for complete the call to the previous functions (identified by the first argument) and will wait until the functions are effectively completed.

==== Third version - Sendrecv ====

The next version use a send-receive function: it is equivalent to call a send and a receive function in parallel. Only the while loop differ:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 while(k++&lt;MAX_ITERATION) {
   //The transfers are simultaneous
   MPI_Sendrecv(A+N,N,MPI_INT,left,MSG_DATA,A+(step+1)*N,N,MPI_INT,right,MSG_DATA,MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;status);
   MPI_Sendrecv(A+(step)*N,N,MPI_INT,right,MSG_DATA,A,N,MPI_INT,left,MSG_DATA,MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;status);
   for (i=1;i&lt;step-1;i++) {
     *(A+i*N)=*(A+i*N+N-2);
     *(A+i*N+N-1)=*(A+i*N+1);
   }
   for (i=0;i&lt;step;i++)
     for (j=0;j&lt;N-2;j++)
       *(tmp+i*N+j)=f(*(A+(i+1)*N+j),*(A+(i+1)*N+j+2),*(A+i*N+j+1),*(A+(i+2)*N+j+1));
   for (i=1;i&lt;step+1;i++)
     for (j=1;j&lt;N-1;j++)
       *(A+i*N+j)=*(tmp+(i-1)*N+j-1);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The MPI_SENDRECV function need arguments which are essentially the same that are required by the MPI_SEND and MPI_RECV functions.

==== Fourth version - Ring topology ====

This last version is radically different, in which that the topology used is a ring topology. A new matrix is calculated on the process 0 and then is sent to the process 1. After one iteration, this process send it to the process 2, which calculate the new matrix and send it again to the next process. The last process will return the matrix to the master and the cycle will continue until the number of iteration reach a defined constant (see figure below).

[[Image:MPI Ring_topology.png|thumbnail|Interaction in a ring topology]]

With this topology, several different data can be computed in the same time. Although in this example the operation applied on the data are the same, the processes can carry out different kinds of operation. Only one matrix will be sent in the ring. It is however possible (and it is the advantage of this structure) to send a second matrix just after.

     }

 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The number of iterations is stored with the matrix, in an additional element. It will serve to determine when to stop the loop. When one process will reach the maximum number of iterations, the matrix will then be transferred on all the other processes. It is indeed necessary for stopping these properly because else, they will continue their loop and never stop.

The MPI_SENDRECV_REPLACE function is similar to the MPI_SENDRECV function, though it use the same buffer for sending and receiving the data.

=== Differentiation ===

This program will calculate the numerical value of the derivate of a functions in multiple points by using the finite elements method. The equation is:
&lt;math&gt;f''\left(x\right)=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x-h\right)}{2h}&lt;/math&gt;

However, it is numerically difficult to divide by 0 and h must not be chosen arbitrary (see figure below).

[[Image:evolution_precision.png|thumbnail|Schematic evolution of the precision of the finite element methods in function of h]]

The optimal value of h is unknown and thus, the algorithm will decrease a started value of h until that the precision began to decrease (the difference between two derivate calculated with different h must decrease). In C programming, the sequential version is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Derivate - Sequential version */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 #define H 1 //first h
 #define DEC 1.4 //decrease
 #define N 500
 
 double f (double x);
 
 int main (int argc, char **argv) {
   double x,deriv,diffnew,diffold,h;
   double result;
   int i;
   for (i=0,x=i;i&lt;N;x=++i) {
     h=H;
     deriv=(f(x+h)-f(x-h))/(2*h);
     diffnew=100;
     diffold=2*diffnew;
     while (fabs(diffnew)&lt;fabs(diffold)) {
       h/=DEC;
       result=deriv;
       diffold=diffnew;
       deriv=(f(x+h)-f(x-h))/(2*h);
       diffnew=deriv-result;
     }
   printf (&quot;%lf: %.15lf\n&quot;,x,result);
   }
   return 0;
 }
 
 double f (double x) {
   return x*x*x+x*x;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== First version - Farming topology ====

Since the number of loop is variable, the time of execution cannot be predicted. This program send a derivate to calculate to each processes and when one have finish (not necessarily the first), he resend immediately data to this one. These data and the result are gathered into two arrays (deriv[] and result[]).

 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Second version - Completion of send and receive ====

The second topology illustrated looks like to a ring topology and introduce a new routine: MPI_REQUEST_FREE. The master will always send data to the process 1 and receive the result from any others processes (see figure below).

[[Image:Example_of_topology.png|thumbnail|Schema of the used topology]]

Since the code of the slave is similar to that of the cellular automata (in the version using a ring topology), only the master function will be described. For avoiding deadlock, only non-blocking send will be used (the non-blocking receive is used here for improving performance).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 void master(void) {
   double deriv[5],result[2]; //x,deriv,diffnew,diffold,h
   int i;
   int size;
   MPI_Status status;
   MPI_Request request[N],req;
   MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;size);
   //The master fill the ring by sending enough data
   for (i=1;i&lt;size;i++) {
     init_deriv(deriv,i);
     MPI_Isend(deriv,5,MPI_DOUBLE,1,MSG_DATA,MPI_COMM_WORLD,request+i);
   }
   //When a result is received, another data is sent in the ring
   for (;i&lt;N;++i) {
     MPI_Irecv(result,2,MPI_DOUBLE,MPI_ANY_SOURCE,MSG_RESULT,MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;req);
     init_deriv(deriv,i);
     MPI_Wait (&amp;req,&amp;status);
     MPI_Request_free (request+(int)result[0]);
     MPI_Isend(deriv,5,MPI_DOUBLE,1,MSG_DATA,MPI_COMM_WORLD,request+i);
     printf (&quot;%lf: %.15lf\n&quot;,result[0],result[1]);
   }
   //The current task are completed
   for (i=1;i&lt;size;i++) {
     MPI_Recv(result,2,MPI_DOUBLE,MPI_ANY_SOURCE,MSG_RESULT,MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;status);
     MPI_Request_free (request+(int)result[0]);
     printf (&quot;%lf: %.15lf\n&quot;,result[0],result[1]);
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

When the master finish to send enough data (for all processes), it execute a new loop. It receive a result and initialize a new data simultaneously and next, it complete the send of the data that lead to the result that it just receive and he resend in the ring a new data. Actually, if the master receive the result of a data, this means that the send of this data is completed and there is no need to complete the send. The MPI_REQUEST_FREE function allow to free a buffered request without checking when this request is logically completed.

=== Communicators and groups ===

The collective communications (like MPI_BCAST, MPI_SCATTER and MPI_GATHER) send data on the processes that belong to a same group. MPI provide functions for managing groups and communicators. This allows to use collective communications on specified processes and thus to divide a network into groups which can execute different task.

For example, different operations can occurred on a matrix (trace, transpose, inversion, diagonalizing). For each operations, a group will be defined and each processes will communicate with the other processes of its groups by using collective communication without disturbing other groups.

A communicator is a object which specifies a communication domain. It is associated to a group. A group is created from existing groups and the initial group is the group of the communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD which contains all processes.

==== First version - Creation of communicator from a group ====

The first method for creating new communicators is to create groups from this first group and then to create the communicators of these groups.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Example of use of group */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
 
 int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
   int rank[50],size,i,myrank;
   char data[10]=&quot;&quot;;
   MPI_Group group,newgroup;
   MPI_Comm newcomm;
   MPI_Init (&amp;argc,&amp;argv);
   //group of MPI_COMM_WORLD which contains all the processes
   MPI_Comm_group (MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;group);
   MPI_Group_size (group,&amp;size);
   //Creation of the communicator containing even-ranked processes
   for (i=0;i&lt;size/2;i++)
     rank[i]=2*i; if (size%2) rank[size/2]=size-1;
   MPI_Group_incl (group,(size+1)/2,rank,&amp;newgroup);
   MPI_Comm_create (MPI_COMM_WORLD,newgroup,&amp;newcomm);
   //Only the processes belonging to the group of newcomm will participate to the broadcast on this communicator
   MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;myrank);
   if (!(myrank%2)) MPI_Bcast (data,10,MPI_INT,0,newcomm);
   MPI_Group_free (&amp;group);
   MPI_Finalize ();
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In this program, data are broadcast only on the even-ranked processes. This is achieved by creating a communicator which will contain the group of the even-ranked processes. First, the initial group of MPI_COMM_WORLD is given by the MPI_COMM_GROUP routine. The new created group contains the &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left(size+1\right)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; processes that have a even rank in the initial group. The MPI_GROUP_INCL function required an array of the ranks of the processes of the first group that will belong to the new group. Then, MPI_COMM_CREATE create the communicator of the new group and if the process have a odd rank, it participates to the broadcast. The group is free by MPI_GROUP_FREE.

The MPI_GROUP_SIZE and the MPI_COMM_RANK functions are similar to MPI_COMM_SIZE and MPI_GROUP_RANK. These last are just shortcut:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!MPI_Comm_size (comm, &amp;size);
!MPI_Comm_rank (comm, &amp;rank);
|-
|MPI_Comm_group(comm, &amp;group);
|MPI_Comm_group(comm, &amp;group);
|-
|MPI_Group_size(group, &amp;size);
|MPI_Group_rank(group, &amp;rank);
|-
|MPI_Group_free(&amp;group);
|MPI_Group_free(&amp;group);
|}

However, if the process that call MPI_GROUP_RANK don't belong to the group specified in argument to the function, the value return in rank will be MPI_UNDEFINED whereas a call to MPI_COMM_RANK will not work and will stop the program.

==== Second version - Creation of communicator from a communicator ====

One communicator can also be creating without using group, directly by splitting a existing communicator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
   int color,i,myrank;
   char data[10]=&quot;&quot;;
   MPI_Comm newcomm;
   MPI_Init (&amp;argc,&amp;argv);
   MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD,&amp;myrank);
   //Creation of the communicator containing even-ranked processes
   if (!(myrank%2)) color=0;
   else color=1;
   MPI_Comm_split (MPI_COMM_WORLD,color,1,&amp;newcomm);
   //Only the processes having even rank will participate to the broadcast on this communicator
   if (!(myrank%2)) MPI_Bcast (data,10,MPI_INT,0,newcomm);
   MPI_Finalize ();
   return 0;
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

All the processes will be classified in a new communicator, depending of his color. Namely, if two processes have a color equal to 1 and one process have a color equal to 2, two communicators will be created, one for each groups. The third argument required by MPI_COMM_SPLIT is used for ordering the processes in the new communicator (this will change the rank of the new processes). Here, the same value is given for all processes.

=== Divers ===

==== Environmental management ====

Finally, environmental management functions exist for getting the name of the node on which a process run or for measuring the time taken by a part of a program (for example).

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Example of use of environmental function */
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
 
 int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
   double starttime,endtime;
   int namelen;
   char processor_name[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];
 
   MPI_Init(&amp;argc,&amp;argv);
   MPI_Get_processor_name(processor_name,&amp;namelen);
   printf (&quot;Process %s\n&quot;, processor_name);
 
   starttime = MPI_Wtime();
   //Here some computation or communication
   endtime = MPI_Wtime();
   printf (&quot;Time: %lf\n&quot;,endtime-starttime);
 
   MPI_Finalize ();
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Other possibilities ====

There is many other functions that are not mentioned: there is different kinds of point-to-point communication functions; MPI allow user to define datatype by a lot of different functions; there is also other collective communication and reduction functions; and, more functions for using communicators and groups.

MPI defines many useful constant, among those &lt;code&gt;MPI_ANY_SOURCE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MPI_INT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MPI_UNDEFINED&lt;/code&gt;, ...

MPI can also be used in an advanced way for managing process topologies. Namely, the MPI implementation can exploit the specificity of a physical network (for heterogeneous network) by privileging for example the transfer of message on the fastest connection.

==Introduction to the topic==
The design and organization of your company's data center has a direct impact on its day-to-day operations.  The following are just some of the considerations involved:

*''Capacity''.  Your data center's capacity needs to be optimized in order to ensure that it can handle its workload.  In this regard, there are three common approaches to capacity planning{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}:
**Start with the most economical size then expand it, careful not to increase capacity beyond actual need.
**Start with the size that best will be able to handle the projected initial capacity, then expand it as need increases.
**Start the data center with a size that will handle the highest possible load that could conceivably be initially placed on it, and expand vigorously to keep ahead of load.

*''Expandability''.  The data center should be scaleable so that if you choose to increase capacity, you will be able to do so without having to redesign the entire data center.

*''Uptime''.  You will need to determine what level availability you will need.  A data center that is designed for 99.99999% availability(3 seconds of outage per year), for example, will require extremely careful planning, as well as a commitment of resources that would not be necessary if you only are aiming for 99.99% availability(52 minutes of outage per year), and yet even a 99.99999% available system may not be adequate for a life safety application, where a fraction of a second of outage could cause a severe risk of harm.  It is important to keep the availability requirement in mind during the planning and design of your data center.

*''Length of outages''.  Closely related to uptime, you will need to determine the maximum acceptable length of outages.  For an [[Wikipedia:9-1-1|E911]] service, for example, 1 second of outage would be 1 second too many; for a business-critical service, you typically will perform a cost-benefit analysis.  Length of outages is ''typically'' quantified as [[Wikipedia:mean time to repair|mean time to repair]].

*''Investment''.  How is the data center financed?  How much money is available?  How is it best spent?

*''Location''.  Will the data center be located at your corporate headquarters, or off-site?  Will you rent or own the location?  Will the data center be [[Wikipedia:colocation|co-located]], for example, in a telephone-company [[Wikipedia:telephone exchange|central office]] or a [[Wikipedia:carrier hotel|carrier hotel]]?  You will need to think about considerations as diverse as the cost of communications network connections, the cost of providing benefits to any employees that may work in the data center, and the [[Wikipedia:municipal law|legal]] environment.

===The need to deliberately design and organize===

To maximize uptime, minimize length of outages, and optimize capacity subject to resource constraints, one should deliberately design and organize the data center.  The following considerations merely highlight the importance of careful planning:

*''Large investment''.  When you consider the costs of network connections, power and utilities, and rented or purchased space--to name only a few things--you can see the cost of starting a data center is more than the cost of computers and network equipment alone.  After you start the data center, there are still the costs of operating it:  the ''annual'' operating costs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid80_gci1204203,00.html|title=Data center locations ranked by operating cost|publisher=techtarget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a data center can easily reach into the tens of millions of dollars.  It is important to optimize the allocation of resources to get the maximum &quot;bang for the buck.&quot;

*''Hard to change''.  Once a data center is up and running, it is very hard to change its design without bringing the entire data center down.

*''Hard to fix''.  Generally, design problems are expensive to fix after the design has already been implemented.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Thus, if your customers experience a problem that is inherent to the design of your data center, the cost of repair may be prohibitive.

==Uninteruptable Power Supplies==

Absolutely necessary

===Types===

===Central UPS===

All equipment stays up for same length of time.

===Rack-mounted UPS===

Put batteries where they are needed most.  Easy redundancy with dual power supply computers.

=== Server-mounted battery ===

Google servers are connected directly to the AC feed with no UPS in the middle.
Instead, each server has its own 12 VDC battery, which is used to power the server during power outages.&lt;ref&gt;

April 02, 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brick UPS===

Good for smaller installations.  Easy redundancy with dual power supply computers.

===Sizing===

Loads that cannot tolerate any outage shall be placed on UPS power.  Critical systems, such as the air conditioning cannot tolerate a brief outage, so they should be supported from generator power.  Battery run time for UPS loads are dependent upon the budget and level of reliability required.  With a well designed backup generation system, UPS runtime may be minimized since the gensets will be online in 8 to 20 seconds.

===Power Interruption===

Plan for unattended shutdown and restart whenever possible.

Consider remote alert of power interruption.

Make sure the KVM is also on UPS.

Make sure you have emergency lights and flashlights for working in the dark.

Estimating remaining run time

Restart of UPS after full drain

===Redundant UPS systems===

Rack-mounted - side to side redundancy.

Central UPS - need two of them with separate breaker boxes/PDUs and color coded system.

==Generators==

Determine your local outage characteristics for your power supplier.  Do they tend to be infrequent, but long?  Common, but short?

On-site vs delivery contract

On site minimizes need for large UPSes

Environmental issues and permit requirements for fuel storage

==Layout and Redundancy==

Look for computers with dual power supplies, or, less preferably, make sure you have redundant boxes per function.  This allows for rearranging power cables and moving a box from one area to another without turning it off.

Maintain side-to-side redundancy by placing power strips on separate breakers or UPSes.

==Remote Power Control==

Remote power on and off

Resetting stuck machines and routers

Power on sequencing

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sizing==

Air conditioners are rated by tonnage. One ton equals 12,000 BTU per hour.

Equipment heat output is rated in BTUs.

Conversion rates and guides can be found in the appendix.

Use this to size the cooling load!

==Redundancy issues==

Your air conditioner will fail.  It is only a matter of when
and whether you have one to back it up.

===Emergency Fan ventilation===

Can you ventilate into the building or the outside?  What is the outside summer temperature?

===Multiple air conditioners===

Spare

Over-sized

Mov-n-cools

Alarm fail over

Thermostatic fail over

Differential temperature settings

Layout your air conditioners to minimize temperature
variation across the room.

==Humidity Control==

Found in larger systems

Eliminates static problems

Requires addition of plumbing

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fire alarms systems are designed to detect and notify building occupants of a possible fire condition, so that proper reactive steps can be taken.  

Some examples of fire alarm equipment include the following:
* Smoke Detectors
* Heat Detectors
* Beam Detectors
* Pull Stations
* Sprinkler System Monitoring Equipment
* Audible and/or Visual Notification Appliances

==Sprinkler systems==

Water and computers don't mix.  A damaged sprinkler head will spray water regardless of a fire, and smoke detectors can be set off by dust.

Avoid sprinkler systems that hold water, instead use a pre-action sprinkler system, preferably a double-interlocked pre-action system. With a double-interlocking pre-action valve, water is prevented from entering the sprinkler piping until two different kinds of heat/smoke detecting devices trigger the valve to open.  The typical devices used are pneumatic actuation by a sprinkler head activating and releasing pressurized air stored in the piping and an electric actuation from heat or smoke detectors.

==Gas Suppression==

===Halon===

Not used any more

===FM200===

===Energen===

More expensive, but free refills, non-toxic

May require separate under-floor nozzles, and ceiling tiles
restrained with clips.

==Fire Extinguishers==

Special fire extinguishers

Low residue

Expensive


==Power and Air conditioning issues==

Emergency shut off for power and air conditioning

Very Important stuff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Reasoning==

More difficult entry

Selective access

Entry evident

Traceable access

==Design==

Determine who should have access to what

How many layers of access will there be

Consider using locking cabinets but not using computer locks

Consider locks on interior doors and fire cabinets.

Physical keys vs. card pass system

==Key Management==

Centralized key box for computer keys

Room keys may need to be given to CEO, landlord, and fire department
for placement in Knox box.

==Pass Card Systems==

For card pass system, make sure entries are logged.

Avoid double-door magnet systems for passcard entry.

Proximity or RFID cards are harder to forge and easier to use


==Security Systems==

Use a combination of motion detectors and door sensors.  This does several things:

* Door sensors are good to minimize air movement alarms.

* Reminds personnel to shut off the alarm system upon entry.

* The door chime announces entry when there is no line of sight to the door.

Security systems are cheap compared to your other expenses.
Splurge on the goodies, such as alarm pads with full English
displays.

Also consider having security system monitor the power,
temperature, and fire with remote callout alerts.

==Visitors and Contractors==

Use sign-in book for contractors and record name, company, identification number, date of entry,
phone number, and purpose of visit so that problems can be
traced.

I question the usefulness of having all visitors in a tour sign in.

Make sure all visitors are escorted by qualified personnel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Space for wiring==

Determine use of raised floor and/or overhead cable trays.

Some rack-to-rack cable organization will be necessary.

==Rack Layout==

It is crucial to lay out your racks, shelving, and stand-alone
systems with accuracy of a few inches when considering location
over raised floor access ports.

You should have a minimum of three feet between rack front and
back to allow for opening of doors.

A 6' rack spacing interval is recommended as floor tiles come
in 2'x2'.

The location of the wheels and/or feet at the bottom of a rack
are critical to being able to lift floor panels.

==Space for other necessities==

You will absolutely have to have space for at least one desk
with monitor and storage units for copious documentation and
spare parts.

==Phones and switches==

Place light, power, and fire switches in an easy to reach place

Make sure phone is in easy reach of fire suppression cut off
switch, NOT the other way around.

==Mechanicals==

Consider putting &quot;non-computer&quot; assets in separate rooms.  You
can contain leaks easier, as well as keep service technicians
away from servers, increasing security, and reducing the need
for supervision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finding possible contractors==

Landlord may do some physical work.  Remember to deal with
lease issues.

Look for contractors experienced in data center construction.

Get references, check them using a reference call checklist

==Getting quality quotes==

Get a minimum of three quotes.Some will completely ignore what
you say is important.

Write up quote specifications in detail.  This allows you to
send the same information to multiple vendors, and compare the
quotes fairly, as well as hold vendors to what you want done in
the future.

Suggested quote requirements and specifications:

* Break down costs into line items which allows for easier
cost analysis and comparison between quotes.

* Three similar project references.

* Completion dates based on date of signed PO.

* Level of documentation to be delivered.

* A thorough cleaning.  You don't want dust in your computers and causing false fire alarms.

* Commentary and explanation on why their solution is the
best solution.



==Common problems==

Watch out for bait and switch. Find out if the contractor or
project manager that comes in and does the quoting will be the
one actually working on the job.

For town permits, use one and only one point of contact, as this
can get quite confusing and is critical in the final stages.

Always get quotes for jobs over a certain level, say, $10,000.
This can save money and keep your favorite contractors quotes
low.

Coordinate between your contractors.  When installing a drop-ceiling in combination with a gas fire
suppression system, make sure that the tile retaining clips are put
into place AFTER any wiring has been done in the ceiling, as
security and phone wires may be run up there.

Contractors won't do all your work.  Consider having an assistant to do
gopher and grunt work such as building furniture.

Remember, time used to get the quote adds on to the final completion
date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rack-mount systems in general==

The quality and layout of your racks and cabinets can save
you hours in frustration, keep your equipment organized, and reduce the
length of downtime by speeding repairs.

When comparing racks and cabinets, examine the items in person.  Ask to
see some in a data center near you.  Buyer beware.

Vertical columns with holes for mounting equipment

Over the years several different rack mounting scemes have come out,
varying from 16&quot; to 49&quot;.  These widths are measured horizontally from centre 
of hole to center of hole.
 
The 2 surviving standards are the 19&quot; and the 23&quot;.  The 23&quot; standard is
used by the telecommunications industry and virtually everyone else uses
the 19&quot; standard.

Equipment intended for rackmount is sized vertically by &quot;U&quot; units, which equals 1.75
inches.

Compliant hardware is built in multiples of this 1.75&quot; unit.

There were tape measures made that were calibrated in rack units, they are difficult to find.

Note that the holes are unevenly spaced. Narrow gap, wide gap, wide gap and back to narrow.
Your equipment should always line up at the top and bottom with narrow gaps.
Doing otherwise will leave you with a sloppy unprofessional installation.

Recently, 1-U high computer servers have become available.

==Open racks vs. closed cabinets==

Open rack systems are more useful for short equipment with many
wires, like hubs, switches, and routers.

Closed cabinets are more useful for deep things like servers, and when
you want to lock down physical access.

==Mounting column style==

===Round threaded===

10-32 or 10-24

===Round unthreaded===

Requires clip-nuts

===Square punched===

Square-punched is often referred to as Compaq-style.

Square-punched requires the use of clip or cage nuts and
can be inconvenient unless sliding rails are designed
specifically for that style.

When using square-hole racks, quality nuts are very
important.  There are at least two styles:  clip nuts have a
thin metal clip that clips over the edge of the column and are easily dislodged; cage nuts clips into the square.

==Mounting methods==

===Front bracket only===

Used for lighter equipment, such as network devices and KVMs.

===Four post===

Used for larger equipment.

===Shelf===

Great for monitors, keyboards, and oddly shaped equipment.

===Sliding rail===

Mounts on front and rear rails.

Sliding rails are mounted individually to the side columns and
then the computer is slid into place.

Some rail mounts will interfere with center-side columns and
the center columns must be removed.

Use sliding rails for mounting computers, whenever possible,
as it makes mounting the hardware easier and allows you to slide
the machine out for maintenance.

When using sliding rails, ALWAYS lock the computer in place with
front-mounted screws or risk catastrophic tipping.

Whenever possible, when ordering equipment, specify rail mount.

==Rack Features To Look For==

Always make sure shelves are available for any rack system you
buy, and buy a few extra; they come in handy.

Front-column to mid- and rear-column spacing should be adjustable
and is critical to easing the mounting of computers.

Always order deep cabinets, as many servers are quite deep, and
you will need space for routing the wires.  Cabinets should be
about 32-36&quot; deep, on the external dimension.

Some racks are connectible with a kit that removes the sides and
ties the cabinets together to make an extra wide cabinet making
it easier to run wires between sets of 19&quot; racks.

Fit and finish count.  Look for dangerous undeburred edges.

Determine if you can specify keyed-alike doors

==Installation Suggestions==

Whenever equipment uses the rear or mid-rails, try to keep the
same type of equipment in the same rack.

When mounting many odd-sized units in one rack, consider using
shelves instead of rail-mounts.

Always mount equipment in such a way that the side of the box
that
needs access to the cables is on the same side.  This means most
hubs and switches and some routers should actually be mounted
on the rear rail.  This means you don't have to pass cables from
front to back of the cabinet.

Use large-head Phillips-head screws, called truss head in
catalogs.  Better yet are rack specific screws.  These are truss head screws that have a unthreaded portion to help align the screw.  Do not use thread-cutting screws with little teeth on
the tip of the screw, as sold by some network equipment
companies.  You can cross thread these and ruin your threads.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Keeping your wiring organized is a never-ending struggle.  Make sure to
make it as easy as possible.

==fire safety considerations==
{{sectstub}}
types of cable:
*riser
*CM, CMG, CMx&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.l-com.com/multimedia/video_clips/video.aspx?ID=13100|title=Video: Flammability Tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*plenum
*[[Wikipedia:LS0H|low-smoke zero halogen]]

==Under Floor Organization==

Place your major power lines in metal conduit.

Put all under-floor fiber connections in plenum-certified
conduit,
such as the orange crinkle tube.

If using electrical whips underneath floors, make sure the socket
boxes are physically restrained in place and marked with the
location on both ends.

Run all conduits and wires square to the floor panels to allow
for easier under-floor organization.

When placing electrical power whips underneath the floor, take
the time to make sure they are cut very close to length, as extra
loops of this cable can take up a lot of space under the floor.

==Rack to Rack Connections==

Consider whether you want to use network switches and hubs in
each rack and connect those to a central location, or use patch
panels that go from rack to rack.

Use patch panels and other techniques to minimize how often you
have to go into the floor.  You should not need to lift floor
panels to install a new computer.


==Keyboard Video Mouse Switches==

Consider using your KVM connections sparingly, using only one
or two per rack and moving them when necessary for maintenance.

Buy a high-quality KVM, as quality counts, and go with an
on-screen menu that allows you to label the computers.

Make sure your KVM allows for keyboard switching.

Compare against serial terminal servers if you have Unix boxes.

Use true KVM cables.  Cables that you zip-tie
together are harder to remove later.  Also, the video
connection that uses screws is shorter than the PS/2 connections, to reduce cable pull out.


==Cable Management==

Many products for rack cable management.

Velcro zipties are reusable.

Use Ethernet cables of many color and lengths.
Consider color coding by length.  Use only booted
cables as they won't get caught up when being moved around.

Consider putting a unique serial number on both ends of every single cable going
into your data center.

Use the shortest power cables possible.  Put serial numbers
on the power cables and consider using black and beige colored
cables to show side-to-side redundancy.

Pre-plan location of power outlets on rack systems.

==Planning for Expansion==

Plan for extra analog phone jacks during construction, as they
are often used for modems on equipment.  Consider making them
56K leased-line capable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Labeling==

Neatness begets neatness.

Use a label maker.  It means your labels look neat, uniform, and are easy to read.

Label front and back of machine with name, IP address, &amp; MAC Address.  This means you are less likely to pull the wrong cable or shut down the wrong machine.

Label multiple NICS on a single machine.

Document VLANs on switches to allow installation without a network engineer.


==Organizing your documentation==

Keep documentation where it is needed.

Make sure it is easy to update.

Self adhesive vinyl pockets - great for walls and cabinets

Folder pockets - great for three ring binders

Consider a wiki or FAQ-o-matic, but have paper backups printed regularly.

Understanding of a problem leads to quicker resolution.  Documentation can be part of that.


==List of documentation to have==

* Phone lists - near phones
** Company phone list
** Tech support phone list with contact numbers
** Loading dock height/ doorway dimensions

* Computer and network documents
** Network Diagram
** Start up/Shut down directions
** machine instructions

* Mechanical
** buttons/switches labeled by contractor
** Equipment maintenance schedules - air conditioning
** Start up/Shut down directions
** Permits posted securely

== Chiller calcs ==
Assuming that all wattage consumed will end up as dissipated heat (servers do very little mechanical work or yield very little light);

Wattage times 3.41 = BTU/hr

Example:

Server draws 10 amps at 120vac
 10 amps X 120 vac = 1200 voltamps (aprox 1200 watts)
 1200 VA X 3.41 = 4092 BTU/hr

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the main intentional torts against the person are:

* Assault
* Battery
* False imprisonment


== Assault ==
Assault is intentionally causing the victim to believe that he or she will be imminently, physically contacted against his or her will.  No contact actually has to occur; swinging a clenched fist at a victim is assault, even if the fist misses the victim, as long as the victim believed it would make contact.  Physical harm need not occur; the harm is in the apprehension.  

The apprehended contact can come either from a gesture of the defendant, or by the defendant intentionally causing an object to threaten imminent contact.  Pointing a pistol in the direction of a defendant and pulling the trigger is assault, even if it was not loaded.

The belief of imminent contact must be reasonable.  If the defendant showed the plaintiff that the gun was not loaded, then the plaintiff cannot sue for assault if the defendant then points the gun at him.

A threat of force, such as &quot;I am going to shoot you&quot;, can be an assault, if the threat is imminent.  &quot;I am going to shoot you in four years&quot; is not an assault.  A conditional threat of force can be an assault, such as an armed mugging (&quot;Give me your wallet or I will shoot you&quot;).  On the other hand, a conditional threat of force that makes it clear that force would not actually be used is not assault.  For instance, a threat such as &quot;I would punch you, if the police weren't standing right there&quot;, is not an assault.  Although it seems to be a threat of violence, it is implied that violence would not actually be carried out.

One of the most common defences to assault is consent.  The contact must be unwanted.  (One might say, then, that lack of consent is an element of assault, rather than consent is a defence.)  If someone were to say, &quot;point the gun at me&quot;, then one cannot subsequently sue for assault.  Consent can be express (specifically written or spoken), or it can be implied (by actions or words that lead to the logical conclusion that contact is wanted).  For instance, if one joins a hockey game, one cannot normally sue for assault after receiving a body-check.  Implied consent extends only to reasonable apprehensions of contact.  Joining in a hockey game does not give all of the other players a license to commit any act of violence that they think of.  

Another defence to assault is self-defence.  One is allowed to threaten an imminent contact against somebody else to prevent an assault that they reasonably believed was going to happen to them.  The force used in self-defence must be proportional to the threat; however, judges often give some leeway to people who use violence in self-defence.  The use of force must be the only option; if the defendant could have avoided the threatened assault in another way, such as running away, then the use of force in self-defence is not justified.

== Battery ==
Battery is an unwanted physical contact.  Unlike assault, where an apprehended threat is necessary while actual contact is not, battery requires actual physical contact and does not require imminent threat.  For instance, if someone is kicked while asleep, the victim never apprehended the contact before it happened.  Therefore, the victim was battered but not assaulted.  In practice, of course, assault and battery often happen in the same incident.

Consent is a major defence to battery.  When using this defence, the defendant must show that the consent was &quot;informed&quot;, i.e., the plaintiff knew of the nature and consequences of consenting.  This often arises in medical malpractice cases.  If the patient agrees to heart surgery, but the surgeon performs other types of surgery not discussed with the patient while the patient is under anaesthetic, then that is battery.

In medical malpractice cases, the distinction between battery and negligence can get quite blurry.  If the surgeon does not tell the patient all of the possible major side-effects of the surgery, then does it constitute battery, as the patient did not give informed consent?  Judges have tended to classify most cases of medical malpractice as negligence, reserving battery for the most clear cases of lack of consent.

Consent that is coerced or incorrectly obtained through an unlawful use of power or influence is &quot;vitiated&quot;, meaning that it is not really consent.  For instance, a doctor using his ability to prescribe drugs to coerce a patient into consenting to battery vitiates the consent. [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1992/vol2/html/1992scr2_0226.html ''Norberg'' v. ''Wynrib'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[1992]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2 S.C.R. 226.]

== False Imprisonment ==
False imprisonment is the intentional, unlawful confinement of a person to a space.  The person's imprisonment need not last a long time.  Nor does the confinement have to be physical; it could be applied by psychological pressure (e.g., &quot;If you leave now, I will tell everyone that you came here to buy drugs...&quot;)  False imprisonment is, not surprisingly, used mostly against police officers for arresting someone unlawfully.  The Criminal Code gives police officers some protection against lawsuits for false imprisonment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there.
If you want I can put them on a seperate page, but I put the solution in this hidden textbox, so the users don't have to watch it if they don't want to. I will put them on a seperate page soon. --[[User:Benjamin Meinl|Benjamin Meinl]] 21:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
:Okay.  I think the hidden textbox is good enough.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 15:21, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

Hi Josh

I changed the pre tags to space syntax so that I could use bold on text that the user typed in and plain on the text returned by the server.  I did that because sometimes it wasn't clear what was to be typed and what came up on the screen - my wife is currently learning to program via this tutorial and she once had trouble with that.  I didn't seem to be able to do that with the pre tags - but if you know how, let me know and I'll change it back.

I plan to gradually work through the tutorial so you should see some more things added over the next couple of months.

:Okay.  That makes sense.  I will not have an internet connection for the next week or so.  Keep up the good work.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 14:00, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Thanks for the great tutorial! It cleared up some major problems I was having with python.

Excuse me, but what do the percent symbols do?  They have been put in an early part of the tut, and there is no explanation. I am avaliable at hb4477 [at] hotmail.com
thanks. [[User:DOTANDCOM|DOTANDCOM]] 21:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:If the % is between two integers, it returns the remainder (more or less) of the division.  If it is between a string and a list it does printf style formating.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 15:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

Haha I'm glad to help.  That tripped me up when I first started playing around with booleans and so I wanted prevent other newbies from making the same mistake.  I'm in the process of learning how to program, and so I want to thank you for the python tutorial and the time that you spent making it.  It's been really valuable.

== It's getting better and better... ==

...and I am going to use the tutorial for my beginner's programming course (university) next week again - for the third time now, and with very good results and positive feedback from the students the last two times. Nevertheless, there are some small things which turned out to be a little unclear in the past, and I will try to further improve these passages during the coming week. --[[User:Siebengang|Siebengang]] ([[User talk:Siebengang|talk]]) 09:41, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

== Advanced Functions Example ==

[[Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_2.6/Advanced_Functions_Example]]

Run 1 does not do the line ''rest = mult(a, b - 1)''?

I am dividing the first example into Run 1, Run 2 etc. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 20:02, 11 April 2010 (UTC)
:Correct.  &quot;Run 1&quot; as you labeled it does not do the line &quot;rest = mult ...&quot; since Run 1 is the initial call of the function.  [[Special:Contributions/71.220.128.88|71.220.128.88]] ([[User talk:71.220.128.88|talk]]) 03:07, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

== To-Do list for Python book ==

Is there a To-Do list for the non-programmers introduction to Python 3? I'd like to contribute but I'm not sure where to jump in. I'm making Python video tutorials for a college course at the moment and I'm coming up with miniature assignments for each topic, programs that take less than 10 lines to solve. Would it be ok to put them in the exercises section at the end of chapters?

== Translation into Malay ==

Hi. I know you've put this tutorial under GFDL but as a matter of courtesy I should like to inform you that I intend to translate it into Malay (ms) at Wikibooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Perhaps no development in common law has had quite as great an impact as the case of[http://www.lawrence.edu/fac/boardmaw/DONOGH_Pt1.html ''Donoghue '' v. ''Stevenson'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[1932]&lt;/nowiki&gt; A.C. 562].  In this, a woman from Glasgow became ill after drinking an opaque bottle of ginger beer.  She claimed that the remains of a decomposed snail were found in the bottle.  She sued the bottling company.  

Before this case, the idea that a plaintiff could sue someone with whom one had no contract and who had not directly committed the harm to the victim was not recognized in common law.  However, in this decision of the House of Lords, Lord Atkin set out the principle, known as the &quot;Neighbour Principle&quot; or the &quot;Duty of Care&quot;: 


:'''At present I content myself with pointing out that in English law there must be, and is, some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances. The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of culpa, is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour ? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour ? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.'''  
:''Donoghue v. Stevenson'', [1932] A.C. 562 at 580.

== Duty of care ==

There can be no legal accountability of a person's actions without a duty being imposed upon them. As first established in ''Donoghue v. Stevenson'', an obligation can be imposed upon people whose actions can foreseeably harm others.


=== Established Duties ===

==== Creation of danger ====

==== Reliance ====

==== Statute ====

==== Supervision and Control ====

==== Professionals ====

=== Exemptions ===

==== Unborn Children ====

==== Public entities ====

==Standard of care==
All negligent tort actions focus on the issue what the standard of care was and whether the defendant fell below that standard. The standard is judged in relation to the &quot;reasonable person&quot; and whether the defendant acted in the same manner as any rational person in society would.

This standard is very ephemeral and does not provide a clear or objective criteria for judging. The standard changes depending on the assumed knowledge and experience of the defendant; for example, a professional will be held to a higher level than a normal person.

Moreover the level of risk involved plays a major role in establishing the standard of care. The likelihood of harm resulting from the actions as well as the level of forseeability of harm are taken into account. In ''Bolton v. Stone'' H.L. [1951] the defendant was playing cricket and hit to ball out into the stands where it hit the plaintiff. The judge ruled that since the ball had only been hit that far about six times in 30 years there was very little likelihood of it happening, meaning the risk was very low, thus could not attribute negligence.

=== Disabled ===

=== Children ===

=== Public entities ===

=== Professionals ===

==Causation==
As with each other element of a tort, causation must be shown for a successful action. The Supreme Court in ''Snell v. Farrell'' (1990) described causation as &quot;an expression of the relationship that must be found to exist between the tortious act of the wrongdoer and the injury to the victim in order to justify compensation of the latter out of the pocket of the former.&quot;

=== Multiple Parties ===

==Remoteness - Limits to Liability ==
The remoteness factor - sometimes called proximate cause - in a tort action is said to be the most confusing and inconsistent of all. The case law has a very spotty history and is known for not always being consistently applied.


=== Type of injury ===

=== Thin Skull rule ===

=== Intervening act ===

==Defenses==

===Contributory negligence===

===Voluntary assumption of risk===

=== Illegality ===

== Further Readings ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Family Values==
===Immediate Family===
====Parents:====
Collectively, parents are known as &quot;föräldrar&quot;.

Just like in English, the Swedish language has several words for ''mother'' and ''father'', ranging from formal to casual. Starting with the words for ''mother'', we have:
*Moder (arch. mother)
*Mor (mother)
*Mamma (mom)
*Morsa (mom, casual)
The most common words for ''father'' are:
*Fader (arch. father)
*Far (father)
*Pappa (dad)
*Farsa (dad, casual)
*Farsgubben (old man)
Note that when ''addressing'' your folks with the casual terms, you use the definite forms ''farsan'' and ''morsan''.

====Siblings====
The words for ''syskon'' (siblings) are for ''brother'':
*Broder (arch. brother)
*Bror (brother)
*Brorsa (bro)
and for ''sister'':
*Syster (sister)
*Syrra (sis)
The same goes here. You address them ''brorsan'' and ''syrran''.

The word ''syskon'' itself is more commonly used (for people) in Swedish than the English word ''siblings''. You would always translate &quot;My brothers and sisters&quot; with &quot;Mina syskon&quot;, never with &quot;Mina bröder och systrar&quot;, unless possibly if you want to make a special point about the differenses between them.

====Children====
Children in general are referred to as &quot;barn&quot;, in both singular and plural.

A male child is called
*Son (son)
*Pojke (boy)
*Gosse (young boy)
*Kille (casual form of boy; also guy for adults)
A female child is
*Dotter (daughter)
*Flicka (girl)
*Tjej (casual form of girl; also girl/chick for adults)

===&quot;Grandfamily&quot;===
====Maternal Grandparents====
Collectively, your maternal grandparents are &quot;morföräldrar&quot;
*Mormor (maternal grandmother)
*Morfar (maternal grandfather)

====Paternal Grandparents====
Collectively, your paternal grandparents are &quot;farföräldrar&quot;.

*Farmor (paternal grandmother)
*Farfar (paternal grandfather)

====Great Grandparents====
*Mormors mor (maternal grandmother's mother - mother's mother's mother)
*Farfars far (paternal grandfather's father - father's father's father)
*Farmors farfars mor (paternal grandmothers paternal grandfathers mother - father's mother's father's father's mother)

To build further, just add an s after every other generation
====Grandchildren====
The formation of words for grandchildren follows the same pattern as for grandparents:
*Dotterson (daughter's son)
*Dotterdotter (daughter's daughter)
*Sondotter (son's daughter)
*Sonson (son's son)
To generically describe ''grandchildren'', use:
*Barnbarn (children's children)

      <comment>/* Copula */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Copula==
One of the simplest constructions in any language is the ability to express a relation of equality between nouns or nouns and adjectives.  This construction is often called ''copula'', the Latin word for 'link', 'bond'.  For example, consider the following statements:

: ''John is tall.''
: ''Mary is a dentist.''
: ''Robert is happy.''

These sentences link together the nouns (in these cases, 'John,' 'Mary' and 'Robert') with an adjective or noun (respectively, 'tall,' 'dentist' and 'happy').  In English, this is achieved by using the helper verb 'to be'.

In Portuguese, as in Spanish, we have actually ''two'' verbs which serve that role.  Let's examine them, each in turn:

The first verb is ''ser'', which comes from the old Latin verb ''esse'', which meant 'to be'.  It's conjugated (in the Present Indicative tense) as follows:
 eu              sou
 tu              és
 ele/ela/você    é
 nós             somos
 vos*            sois
 eles/elas/vocês são

The second verb is ''estar'', which comes from the old Latin verb ''stare'', which meant 'to stand'.  It's conjugated (again, in the Present Indicative tense) as follows:

 eu              estou
 tu              estás
 ele/ela/você    está
 nós             estamos
 vós*            estais
 eles/elas/vocês estão
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Not commonly used

==Using ''ser'' and ''estar''- Usando Ser e Estar==
Ok, now that we know the verbs, when do we know how to use them?  What is the difference between ''ser'' and ''estar''?  The answer is actually quite simple, but it requires attention, '''especially for speakers of Spanish''':  the instances in which we use ''ser'' and which we use ''estar'' in Portuguese and Spanish are almost, '''but not always''', the same.

Remember when I said that the verb ''ser'' comes from ''esse'' and the verb ''estar'' comes from ''stare''?  Well, there are two words in English which also come from these two Latin verbs.  From ''esse'' we have English ''essence'', and from ''stare'' we have English ''status''.  So we use ''ser'' when we want to describe the essence of something, or how a thing is always; and we use ''estar'' when we want to describe something's status, or how a thing is at the moment.

Let's see some examples, then, to fixate:

: O sol é amarelo.
: ''The sun is yellow''.

: Meu nome é Jim.
: ''My name is Jim''.

: Nós somos Brasileiros.
: ''We are Brazilian''.

In each of these cases, the speaker attributes to the subjects of the sentence characteristics that are intrinsic to them.  People don't change names that often, or nationality.  It is part of their identity.  Also, things are generally only one color, with a few notable exceptions like chameleons or traffic lights.  All these cases use the verb ''ser''.

: A cerveja está gelada.
: ''The beer is cold''.

: Eu estou doente.
: ''I am sick''.

: O livro está sobre a mesa.
: ''The book is on the table''.

In these cases, the phrases describe temporary situations: beer can get warm, sick people get well, and books can be picked up and carried around.  Therefore, these are cases where we use ''estar''.

Notice that there are some cases where one could use ''ser'' or ''estar'' equally well; but in these cases, as expected, the meaning changes when we use one or the other case.  Watch:

: A moça é bonita.
: A moça está bonita.

Both sentences above translate to 'the young woman is pretty'; however, in the first case, we mean that the young woman is ''naturally'' pretty, like Anna Kournikova.  In the second case, we mean that she is prettier than usual -- typically because she put on some nice clothes, got a haircut, or otherwise accessorized herself.  She may or may not be pretty normally, but we want to call attention to the fact that she is prettier due to some temporary condition.

: Tony está doente.
: Tony é doente.

Again, both cases translate to 'Tony is sick'.  However, the first one explicitly says that Tony isn't usually sick, but is right now.  The second one means that Tony is sick now, was in the past and will be in the future -- generally, this has connotations that Tony is ''mentally'' sick.

==The location of things==
When we want to describe the location of things, naturally we use the copula.  In this case, we use ''ser'' when something generally can't move around, and ''estar'' otherwise.  Spanish speakers should be aware that this is different from Spanish, where ''estar'' is used everywhere.  Some examples:

: O carro está na garagem.
: ''The car is in the garage''.

: Os bilhetes estão sobre a cama.
: ''The tickets are on the bed''.

: Eu estou na estação.
: ''I am in the station''.

: O hotel é na praia.
: ''The hotel is on the beach''.

: A casa é mais adiante.
: ''The house is further ahead''.

: O castelo é em Portugal.
: ''The castle is in Portugal''.

In the first three examples, we have items which are expected to be able to be in a wide variety of places over time, so their location is not intrinsic to them: ''estar'' is used.  In the last three examples, we have subjects which are generally immobile, and therefore have an intrinsic location; ''ser'' is the correct option then.

'''Gazpacho''' is a hearty soup that is served cold, making it a perfect way to cool down and replenish the body on a hot, summer day in Andalucía.  This is the classic gazpacho recipe, but there are many other variations.  Gazpacho is typically served along with the main course, or afterward.  Some Spaniards serve it in a glass, as a beverage to accompany the meal.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb /450 g [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* ½ lb / 225 g [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|green peppers]] (bell pepper, capsicum)
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]
* clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 oz / 50 g white bread, 2-3 days old (also optional, leave out for a thinner soup)
* ½ mild [[Cookbook:Onion|Spanish onion]]
* 1 tbsp white or red [[Cookbook:Wine vinegar|wine vinegar]]
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* ⅓ pt / 2.4 dl iced water
* [[Cookbook:Salt|sea salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]]
* ice cubes

Optional
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli pepper]], seeds removed
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|Cilantro]]

===Garnish===
* 1 tomato, skinned
* ½ green pepper
* ¼ peeled cucumber
* bread

==Procedure==
Skin the tomatoes and cut into quarters. Remove seeds and stalks from peppers. Peel the cucumber and cut into chunks. Tear up the bread and soak it in water for 30 minutes and then squeeze it dry. Cut up the onion.

Blend all the ingredients until roughly chopped, not too fine, because the soup should have texture and discernible vegetable bits. Pour into large bowl with some ice, add salt and pepper. Then prepare the garnishes. Dice the bread and fry it in a little olive oil until brown. Chop the other vegetables finely. Serve in separate little bowls on the table, so that guests can sprinkle on their own toppings.

Serve chilled.

It is best to go to the webpage of your fork's manufacturer and look there for specific information regarding your model and type of suspension fork.  If you don't want too much hassle, rather take your bicycle to qualified bicycle mechanic.

Knowable and Unspeakable

&quot;Everything must have a natural cause.&quot;                  
&quot;Everything must have a supernatural cause.&quot;
Let these two asses be set to grind corn.

                  - Malaclypse the Elder, The Honest Book of Truth

Krishnamurti, in the tradition of the Eastern mystics, taught that language functioned as a mediation of the real.  It's not surprising, actually. Wittgenstein said that philosophy existed only because language is imperfect.  But language is not a static thing, its powers are not complete; the world we describe today - on the edge of an Eschaton - is not the same world we spoke of ten millennia ago.  Except in one very important way...which I will come to presently.

Perception and consciousness can not effectively be separated from our innate linguistic capabilities; what the mystics teach is abandonment of the practice of language.  What arrives, in the silence, is still spoken, but is perhaps the voice of the world, rather than the voice-in-your-head. The Zen Abbot takes the students to a place beyond words so that they can listen to the reality of the moment.  It is not the abandonment of language that is sought after, it is the abandonment of our own language.

Why?  Because words do make up the world.  Everything that we know - and everything that we can know - must be linguistically mediated; even the revelatory states of mind - which are necessarily indescribable - have their own internal language; we can not speak of these experiences because we do not have the words for them.  But these words do exist.

Our project, in part, is to uncover these words, bring them out into manfest being, and let them work out their memetic infections of mind to produce a new understanding in all who encounter them.

This project, in fact, happens to be isomorphic with the Great Work of Western magic, a tradition at least as old as John Dee (and, quite probably, goes back to Pythagoras, who got it from the Medes, who may have scooped the Egyptians, etc.).  The angelic encounters described by Dee in &quot;A True Relation&quot; gave us an entirely new language - Enochian - which, to all appearances, has a comprehensible syntax, regular &amp; irregular in all of the ways a human language ought to be.  The angels Dee contacted sought to instruct him in a new language, with new words; this would necessarily lead to a new opening of possibilites for the Elizabethian mystic, and gave him curious new powers which eventually got him into a bit of trouble.

Enochian has, in the four hundred years following &quot;Relation&quot;, been studied extensively by such Western mystics as Eliphas Levi, Macgregor Mathers, Aliester Crowley, etc.  It's considered one of the principle touchstones of the tradition of Magick as taught in the principal Western schools.

***

The trick of the game, or so it seems to me, is to go from human language into hyperlanguage, where every object is itself and simultaneously conflated with the universal, a place where words do not divide, but rather, implicitly reflect consciousness back toward an underlying unity of being.  It may be that Enochian has this capability; I know that poets reach toward this Eschaton in their own use of their confined words, and - occasionally - strike their mark.

A few of the words from this century have had a particularly magical effect, words like &quot;Noosphere&quot; and &quot;Gaia&quot; and &quot;Global Village&quot; in actuality announced and pronounced something into being.  Each may have existed before these words had been articulated, but none could be seen, even though they might be completely self-evident.  Language shapes perception completely.

Words do make the world.  This is the basic teaching of all the magical traditions I've encountered; each takes a different approach to broadening the lexicon of the postulant.  The koan uses words to tie knots in reason and frees the being for a greater revelation than common sense will allow; the mage meditates on the names of his allies, and invokes them into form; the kabbalist contemplates the Tetragrammaton and sees the godhead as the vowels behind the prison walls of the consonants YHVH.  The Eschatologist searches for the word which sums everything and integrates the cosmos into a singularity. 

That we can even contemplate such a thing means it likely does exist.  So we wait, mouths open, babbling a nonsense stream of glossalia, listening for angels' tongues.

PROLEGOMENA TO ANY FUTURE PHILOSOPHY 

Mark  Alan Walker

Research Associate, Trinity College, University of Toronto

www.markalanwalker.com

Abstract

Since its inception, philosophy has struggled to reconcile the apparent finitude of humans with the traditional telos of philosophy—the attempt to unite thought and Being, to arrive at absolute knowledge, at a final theory of everything. In response, some pragmatists, positivists, and philosophical naturalists have offered a deflationary account of philosophy: the ambitions of philosophy ought to be scaled back to something much more modest. Inflationism is offered as an alternative: it is conjectured that philosophy might make more progress towards the traditional telos if we attempt to create beings (through the application of technology) who are as far removed from us in intelligence as we are from apes. Rather than deflating the ambitions of philosophy we ought to consider inflating the abilities of philosophers. 

  

 


1.   Introductory 

The turn of the millennium provides a natural opportunity to reflect on the future of philosophy. For the last hundred years or so we have heard the call for the end or “death” of traditional philosophy—what might be thought of as the “Plato to Hegel” cannon. This call has been issued by some of the most important thinkers and movements in this period: from James to Rorty, Nietzsche to Derrida, from logical positivism to naturalized epistemology. If there is a common thread here, it is that there is a gap between the ambitions of philosophy, and the abilities of human philosophers. On one side looms the seemingly transcendent telos of philosophy, namely: what has been described as the attempt to unify thought and Being, to obtain the absolute conception, to realize absolute knowledge, to discover a final theory of everything. On the other side of the gap stand humans; human, all too human humans. The trouble is how to square this vaulting ambition with a modern understanding of the etiology of humanity. If we believe, for example, that Homo sapiens are the result of natural selection of random mutations, then how plausible is it to believe that we might pursue the transcendent conception of wisdom embodied in the telos of traditional philosophy? Certainly such an aspiration would seem less formidable if we believed that we had a divine element within us—if, for instance, we believed that a divine artificer had created our souls out of some divine stuff, or at least if humanity turned out to be the embodiment of Geist. What are we to say about the ambition of philosophy given that our ancestry can be traced not to the divine, but to slime? 

          There are, I believe, three answers currently in the offering. One is to deny that there is ultimately any teleological gap as described. Perhaps the mistake is to believe that we require a divine phylogeny to realize this ambition. As we will see below, Davidson’s reflections on the notions of ‘truth’, ‘belief’, and ‘meaning’, seem to place him firmly in this category of “denial”. A second alternative is what is sometimes described as a ‘deflationary response’: we ought to adjust the teleology of philosophy to make it more “human”, i.e., to abandon the attempt to unify thought and Being. There have been various proposals by pragmatists, naturalists, and others as to how to scale down the ambition of philosophy. How to provide philosophy with a “human face”. Philosophy, in other words, is to be given an easier more realistic—as it were—task like “breaking the crust of convention” (Dewey) or figuring out how “things hang together” (Sellars). A third riposte is what might be termed ‘stoic resolve’. The idea is that we can acknowledge that there may well be a chasm between our abilities and the ambitions of philosophy; nevertheless, we ought to keep a stiff upper lip and soldier on.  Nagel, for instance, bravely inveighs against the self-image of the age by adopting exactly this sort of view: 

  

…if truth is our aim, we must be resigned to achieving it to a very limited extent, and without certainty. To redefine the aim so that its achievement is largely guaranteed, through various forms of reductionism, relativism, or historicism, is a form of cognitive wish-fulfillment. Philosophy cannot take refuge in reduced ambitions. It is after eternal and nonlocal truth, even though we know that is not what we are going to get. 

  

  

While we may never adequately realize the ambitions of philosophy, the activity of philosophizing, says Nagel, is ennobling and important for the human spirit: “Philosophy is the childhood of the intellect, and a culture that tries to skip over it will never grow up.”[1]  

These are the three familiar responses. There is actually a fourth response, one that has yet to make itself heard. The idea, in a slogan, is that it is not we who ought to abandon philosophy, but that philosophy ought to abandon us. Consider that as a mere point of logic, if there is a gap between the telos of philosophy and humanity then there are at least two means to close this gap: either philosophy can be scaled down into something more human, or philosophers can be scaled up into something more than human. The idea would be to create better philosophers, ones more naturally suited to realizing the ambitions of philosophy. This view then is diametrically opposed to deflationary accounts which would alter philosophy to provide it with a more “human face”. The “inflationary’ experiment proposes to create philosophers with a more “god-like face”. 

          Inflationism offers the most profound challenge to philosophy and indeed humanity in its entirety.[2]  In order to make this case I argue as follows. As a purely practical point, I believe that it may be that soon—very soon—we will have the technological means to attempt to create beings who may usurp our position as the most intelligent on earth. These creatures, with their superior intellect, may well turn out to be better philosophers—the philosophers of the future. On the theoretical plane I hope to show that reflection on the possibility of creating such creatures provides a compelling challenge to the three competing metaphilosophical views outlined above. Finally, I argue that philosophy is uniquely endowed among the academic disciplines to reflect on the potential impact of such a technological revolution. As such, philosophy has a particular responsibility to take up the sorts of questions addressed here, and, to do so with some urgency. 

2.   Some Questions Concerning Technology 

It may seem strange (to put it mildly) to suggest that technology will have such profound implications for the metaphilosophical positions outlined above. The link here is provided by the Darwinian revolution in biology. Two points are salient for our discussion: One is that we may think of biological organisms as exhibiting design without having to postulate a divine artificer, the other is that species are not fixed but have evolved and are evolving. Applying these insights to the topic of human intelligence we may conclude that our intelligence is not the product of the benevolent activities of some divine artificer but the result of the natural selection of random mutations. The history of our intelligence lies in a secular phylogeny, that is, with our apelike ancestors and indeed even more “primitive” organisms. Since some grand architect has not fixed our intelligence, we may also ask where it might evolve. Of course, if we are concerned exclusively with the course that natural selection might take we are engaged in some serious long-range forecasting. Natural evolution typically takes tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years.[3]  However, there are other means that will allow us to alter Homo sapiens in ways in which it would take natural selection hundreds of thousands if not millions of years to duplicate. Let us consider three. 

One is that which would result from applying the techniques of genetic engineering to the task of creating a more intelligent species. Consider as some very preliminary evidence the familiar correlation between intelligence and brain size, that is, other things being equal, a larger brain correlates with greater intelligence.[4]  For example, our brain is larger than that of an orangutan, and an orangutan’s brain is larger than a Great Dane’s. The level of intelligence among these three species follows this same progression, i.e., we are more intelligent than orangutans, and they are more intelligent than Great Danes. It seems plausible to hypothesize that a creature who had a brain size of 2200 cc ought to be more intelligent and have greater conceptual abilities than Homo sapiens with their measly 1300 cc.  Certainly this is the sort of reasoning that is used to explain the vast difference in intelligence between humans and apes, i.e., apes (although similar in body weight) have much smaller brains. 

Technologically speaking, there does not seem to be any principled reason why we could not genetically engineer the aforementioned creature with a 2200 cc brain. If the correlation between brain size and intelligence cited above holds, then it would seem that this creature has a good probability of being more intelligent than humans. In other words, it seems a perfectly valid piece of naturalized speculation to investigate the following scientific hypotheses:

  

Hypothesis 1: A primate with a brain volume of 2200 cc will exceed humans in intelligence by the same margin as humans exceed that of chimpanzees. 

  

As a corollary to hypothesis 1 the following hypothesis might be entertained. 

  

Hypothesis 2: A primate as described in hypothesis 1 will be capable of gleaning information and thinking about aspects of the universe that will exceed human ability in this regard by the same order of magnitude that human ability exceeds that of chimpanzees.[5] 

  

To put this in some perspective consider that adjusting for body size a great ape with the same body size as a human we would expect to have a brain about 400 cc in size. Australopithecines of similar body size we would project a brain of approximately 600 cc. Homo sapiens of course enjoy a brain of approximately 1300 cc. If we engineer a creature, let us call it ‘Homo bigheadus’, with a brain of 2200 cc how intelligent might we expect it to be, given that the same relationship between intelligence and brain size versus the log of body weight? It is difficult to say in part because we have no interval measure for interspecies comparisons of intelligence. That is, we do not have some recognized scale which would allow us to state that humans are say 15 times as intelligent as an Orang but only 5 times as smart as Australopithecus robustus. At best we have some rough and ready ordinal rankings of intelligence. As noted, we may say that Orangs are more intelligent than a Great Dane, and Homo sapiens more intelligent than Orangs, with Australopithecus robustus falling somewhere in between.  Nevertheless, even with mere ordinal rankings of intelligence we might guess that Homo bigheadus might eclipse us in intelligence in a very dramatic fashion, e.g., we might properly expect that the difference between our intelligence and theirs would be more like the difference between human and Australopithecine intelligence, than say human and intelligence with that of Homo erectus. Again, since we have a grasp only on the ordinal intervals between intelligence it is hard to be much more precise than this. We might even suppose that this is some sort of iterative process, Homo Bigheadus creates the Homo Biggerheadus, creatures with brains 4000 cc in size, and Homo Biggerheadus creates Homo Evenbiggerheadus, etc. 

          No doubt many will find the thought of such an experiment “fantastic” (to put it mildly). Yet incredible as it may seem, it is not a question of whether we will have the technological ability to perform an experiment along the lines suggested by these hypotheses. The only question is when will we have the ability. Consider that the basic information and techniques necessary for such an experiment are already available; it is really a matter of working through the myriad of details. There are, for instance, several methods for genetic engineering. One such technique is the microinjection procedure. Basically, DNA is injected into the developing egg of an organism; this DNA attaches itself to the chromosome and then can be passed on genetically to succeeding generations in the usual fashion. Over fifteen years ago, researchers were able to partially correct a genetic defect in mice employing this method. The strain of mice in question suffers from reduced levels of a growth hormone that results in dwarfism. By inserting the DNA that contains information for a rat’s growth hormone, the researchers were able to reverse this condition.[6] 

Since the technology necessary for genetic engineering is already available to us, the real trick is finding the appropriate genes that control the growth of the brain. This may not be that difficult. The crude map of the human genome we now possess certainly could be of some assistance in this regard. There is also evidence from our phylogenetic cousin the common chimpanzee. As is well known, there is an incredible genetic similarity between our species, e.g., King and Wilson have found that “…the average [human] polypeptide is more than 99 percent identical to its chimpanzee counterpart.”[7]  The idea would be to discover the genes that have altered the allometric curve of the brain in humans as compared with chimps. From there it would be a relatively simple matter to manipulate them in the genome of a human zygote, and the recipe should be complete.[8] The ease in which we might create a larger brain through genetic engineering is underscored by the fairly recent discovery in developmental genetics of homeobox genes: genes that control the development of the body plans of a larger number of organisms.  For our purposes what is of interest is that there are a number of homeobox genes that that control the growth of various brain regions.[9] For example, if you want to make a larger brain in a frog embryo simply insert some RNA from the gene X-Otx2 and voilà—you have a frog embryo with a larger brain, specifically, the mid and forebrain mass is increased.[10] Homeobox genes also come in various forms of generality. Otx2 is obviously very general in its scope; in contrast, for example, Emx1 controls the growth of the isocortex (one of the two regions of the neocortex). Thus, if we believe that intelligence and philosophical wisdom might be aided by tweaking one area of the brain or another there may be just the right homeobox gene for this task. 

          Of course this simplifies many, many problems. It is much like as if one had said back in 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, that landing men on the moon was merely a question of working through a myriad of details. This was of course true, but it is not to belittle all the problems and technical innovations that were required to achieve this end, e.g., problems of miniaturization.  Remember vacuum tubes were still in use back in 1957! Similarly there are a host of difficulties that would have to be solved in creating such creatures, let me just mention a couple in passing. First, there are general considerations of physiology e.g., a larger brain might require increase blood flow, which might mean increasing the size or strength of the heart. Would we have to adjust the allometric curve of the heart and other vital organs? Perhaps the skeletal structure would have to be altered in order to support the additional cranium weight. We might have to look at extending the life span of these creatures in order to allow them enough time to develop to their full potential.[11] Second, one may wonder about the sufficiency (or perhaps even necessity) of creating greater intelligence by dramatically increasing the gross brain size. It has been speculated, for example, that it is the greater development of our neocortex, as compared with other primates, that is primarily responsible for our greater intelligence, or that due consideration ought to be given to the fact that we exhibit much more hemispheric specialization of cognitive tasks. It may be that the task of attempting to create more intelligent beings ought to focus on the quality as opposed to the quantity of the brain.[12] Thus, it should be clear from what has just been said that there is really nothing so simple as “the crucial genetic engineering test”. There are a number of tests that we might perform depending on the relative weight we assign to these variables. For instance, one group of researchers might suppose that doubling the mass of the neocortex ought to be sufficient for testing whether we can make more intelligent creatures, while another might focus on increasing the total mass of the brain by 50%. What could reasonably be expected from such tests would probably require input from a number of diverse academic fields. Whether increasing the gross size of the brain to 2200 cc would be necessary or sufficient for a radical increase in intelligence is thus an open question. The general principle—that we might be capable of experimentally manipulating the intelligence of various creatures including humans—does seem scientifically respectable. Certainly it seems scientifically respectable to suggest that we might be able to experimentally increase the intelligence of any non-human animal. It is difficult to see why humans might be exempt from this inductive thinking. 

            How long would it take to prepare this recipe? As a conservative estimate, it would be safe to say that sometime in the twenty-first century we should possess the relevant knowledge and technology. If nothing else, it seems, that we could in fairly short order have some idea of the efficacy of such procedures by studying other species such as rats. We might, for instance, today attempt to genetically engineer a rat with a brain twice the normal size and observe how this affects its level of intelligence. Such procedures would be achievable in the short term and provide some evidence as to what might be feasible in our own case. Ethics aside, genetically engineering the human zygote in this way is technically feasible today. 

          Another possibility for creating greater intelligences is based on extrapolations from computer science. The possibility that computers might be able to out-think us has been put forward by a number of researchers, one of the most prominent is Professor Hans Moravec at Carnegie Mellon University.[13] Moravec’s conjecture has two essential components: (1) an estimate of how long it will take to develop (affordable) computers with the requisite amount of computing power, and (2), an estimate of how much computing power will be necessary to simulate human intelligence. The key unit of measurement here is MIPS, a million machine instructions per second. Moravec predicts that robots capable of executing 100 million MIPS will be commercially available around 2040 and these should equal or surpass human intelligence. He claims that “…mass-produced, fully educated robot scientists working diligently, cheaply, rapidly and increasingly effectively will ensure that most of what science knows in 2050 will have been discovered by our artificial progeny!”[14] Presumably, the artists and philosophers etc., in 2050 will also be our artificial progeny. Moravec basis his estimate of how much computer power is necessary to simulate the power of the human brain on two quantities that have a fair degree of empirical support. One quantity is the 0.2-gram of neural processing circuitry at the back of the human retina. This tissue is devoted to detecting edges and motion in the visual field. Moravec notes that these tissues perform about 10 million detections per second, that is, there are approximately a million image regions performing 10 detections per second. Data from experiments in robot vision suggest that 1,000 MIPS would be necessary to simulate the .02-gram of neural tissue at the back of the retina. Moravec then reasons that, since the entire human brain is 75,000 times heavier than the .02 gram of neural tissue, a computer with 75,000 times the computing power is necessary to model human intelligence. In round numbers then a computer with 100 million MIPS should be equal to humans in intelligence. It perhaps goes with out saying that Moravec’s claims are contentious.[15] I do not propose to defend his estimates here, rather, I think the important point to observe is that his inductive reasoning is grounded in empirical data and as such is naturalistically respectable. Moravec may be wrong (as he himself admits) that robots will usurp humans as the scientists and (presumably) philosophers of the future, but it seems a conjecture that is at least worthy of our attention. 

          Another means to attempt to continue the vector of the natural selection of intelligence with directed selection. The idea then would be to selectively breed humans on the basis of intelligence. Estimates for how many generations it would take to make a statistically significant difference in intelligence, based on studies from other species such as rats and dogs, range from three to ten generations.[16] As is well known, Plato advocated selective breeding of the best humans; it is interesting to think what might have happened if we had taken up the master’s suggestion.[17] If we conservatively allow 3 generations per century then this would mean that under Plato’s program there would have been sufficient time for 75 generations. Probably more than ample time to reap tremendous leaps in intelligence. Indeed, this may have been a sufficient interval for speciation to have occurred given than it can happen in 10 generations with fruitflies, and as little as thirteen generations with salmon. 

          Clearly there are a number of ways of combining these technologies and procedures: one could, for instance, opt for selectively breed genetically engineered cyborgs.  And there other procedures that I have not mentioned, for example, in vivo augmentation of our brains with neurons created with stem cells. However, the primary aim of this paper is not to review the technical aspects of this project. On the other hand, I have covered some of the empirical details here at some length with the hope of convincing the reader that the expertise required by the project is imminent—or at least worthy of considering whether it is indeed imminent. Even if one assigns a very low probability to the likelihood of any of these coming to fruition, the enormity of the consequences ought to be cause for reflection. For ease of reference, in what follows we may think of super-intelligent beings (SIBs) as any creature—genetically enhanced or non-naturally selected humans or future supercomputer—whose intelligence transcends our own by the same magnitude as ours eclipses that of the apes. 

  

3.0 Implications for Philosophy 

  

(Fragment 83) The wisest man will appear an ape in relation to God, both in wisdom and beauty and everything else. 

(Fragment 79) Man is called childish compared with divinity, just as a boy compared with man.[18] 

  

This is Heraclitus’ description of the human epistemic situation. These analogies suggest just how the idea of a higher intelligence might be directly relevant to philosophy.[19] The “phylogenetic analogy” proposes that we simply imagine adult humans as standing at some midpoint between less developed forms of intelligence, such as an apes’, and the higher form of intelligence often attributed to divine forms of understanding or knowledge. The “ontogenetic analogy” makes the same point, but with reference to a human child as opposed to an ape. The connection with philosophy is straightforward if we think of ‘philosophy’ in its etymological sense as “the love of wisdom.” If Heraclitus is correct, we may never fully grasp wisdom. We may not in principle be capable of passing, as Hegel quipped, from the love of wisdom to wisdom itself.[20] 

          Perhaps the greatest challenge the SIBs present to philosophy concerns the idea of “epistemic superiority”. Yet it might be remarked that as suggestive as Heraclitus’ analogies are, they lack the articulation that one might expect in a philosophical theory on the subject. The hope, in other words, is that these analogies might be elucidated in more detail, but an immediate and obvious problem presents itself. We are able to describe certain ways in which the perspective of a child or a chimp’s is more limited, e.g., we might cite the fact that no chimpanzee will be capable of understanding the Critique of Pure Reason, Gödel’s Incompleteness Proof, Munch’s “Scream&quot;, Baudelaire’s  “Spleen”, or Dostoevsky’s “Notes from Underground”. The trouble lies in the fact that it is difficult to say how our understanding is limited, without presupposing access to a higher understanding. Just as only we can appreciate exactly what it is that a child fails to know or understand, so too, it seems, only creatures who transcended our understanding should be able to detail our limitations. Perhaps a full philosophical account of our epistemic limitations is not something we are in a position to formulate or even appreciate. It is perhaps conceivable that only creatures like the SIBs can provide the appropriate sort of philosophical theory on this subject—at least as it concerns humans. 

          This seems to leave us in a philosophical quandary. On the one hand, these analogies are, well, merely analogies. They are insinuative of how our perspective might be circumscribed, but they do not provide a philosophical theory of this limitation. On the other hand, if we try to articulate a philosophical theory about these limitations, it seems we are in danger of begging the question: we cannot know too much about that which we do not know. Is there a means to further articulate these analogies in a manner that does not beg the question? 

One proposal for further explication of the idea of the (conjectured) epistemic superiority of the SIBs is via the notion of conceptual schemes. The basic idea is that the SIBs might said to be epistemically superior in that they possess a conceptual scheme that is more encompassing than our own. Whether this proposal is itself an improvement on Heraclitus’ analogies is open to question, since the coherence of the notion of conceptual schemes has been disputed. This is precisely the line Davidson takes in “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Schemes”—perhaps the best-known recent discussion of the question. A brief look at what Davidson has to say in this regard is in order. 

One of Davidson’s most important recommendations is to connect the idea of conceptual schemes with that of language translation: 

  

  

where conceptual schemes differ, so do languages. But speakers of different languages may share a conceptual scheme provided there is a way of translating one language into the other. Studying the criteria of translation is therefore a way of focusing on criteria of identity for conceptual schemes.[21] 

  

  

Davidson’s conclusion, that no solid meaning can be attached to the idea of a conceptual scheme, turns on his argument for the claim that all languages are essentially intertranslatable. In other words, the idea is that if we are to make sense of the idea of conceptual schemes, then there must be a failure of translation between languages; but since all languages are intertranslatable, the idea of a conceptual scheme is a mere philosophical fiction. 

          An interesting, and I believe important, omission in Davidson’s argument is the possibility of asymmetrical failure of translation. This is not an oversight on his part, for Davidson remarks parenthetically that “…(I shall neglect possible asymmetries).”[22] Given that the idea of asymmetrical failure of translation seems such an obvious maneuver for the conceptual scheme proponent to adopt, it is curious Davidson does not inform us as to why he neglects these asymmetries. In any event, it is perhaps worth considering for a moment what the conceptual scheme proponent might say in favor of the idea of asymmetrical failure of translation. 

          If we limit the field to two languages, our home (H) language and the target (T) language to be translated, then the following translation possibilities present themselves: 

1. H  &lt;— &gt; T

2. H    —&gt;  T 

3. H  &lt;—    T 

4. H    —    T 

The arrows in the schema represent the direction of full translatability. Thus, the first case represents the idea that our home language is fully translatable into the target language, and the target language is fully translatable into our home language. The second case expresses the idea that our language is fully translatable into the target language, but our language lacks the expressive powers necessary to fully translate the target language. If we allow the idea of giving some sort of numerical indices to languages to represent their expressive powers, then we might think of the second case as that where the home language has less expressive power than the target language. The third case represents the idea that the home language is greater than the target language, thus the target language is not able to fully translate the home language. The fourth case represents the idea of symmetrical failure. We cannot translate the target language with our language, and the target language cannot translate our home language. It might be plausible to maintain in this case that the languages differ in their expressive resources, although one is not necessarily richer than the other. 

          Of these four, prima facie at least, logical possibilities, Davidson considers only two, the first and the fourth case. Thus, Davidson’s argument amounts to attempting to demonstrate that the fourth case is a conceptual impossibility, that is, we cannot make sense of mutually untranslatable languages. The conclusion of Davidson’s argument is that all languages must conform to the first case, i.e., all natural languages are essentially intertranslatable. The second and third possibilities are precisely the sorts of cases that, as we have seen, Davidson says he shall neglect. 

Heraclitus’ analogies, however, indicate just how such asymmetries might occur. If we take the language of an adult human as the home language, and compare it with the language that a five year old speaks, the target language, then the third translation possibility best describes this situation. We are able to fully translate what five year old children say, but there are aspects of adult speech that transcend their understanding and linguistic resources. The situation, it seems, might be reversed if we were to apply this translation framework to the speech of the SIBs. We might imagine that the SIBs are able to fully translate what we say into their language, but we might not be able to translate all their utterances into our language. Obviously, this is the sort of scenario that the second translation possibility describes. 

          The intention here is not to argue that Davidson is wrong to dismiss the idea of conceptual schemes. The limited ambition here is merely to indicate that Davidson’s argument is incomplete precisely along the vector that it would be most plausible to describe our conceptual resources compared with that of how we might envision the SIBs.[23] But this is critical for Davidson’s project since he wants to show that the idea is incoherent—this would mean that he has to analyze every permutation. 

          Leaving aside for the moment the question of conceptual schemes, let us attend again to the original question about ‘epistemic superiority’.  A slightly less direct means to criticize this notion would be to question it by attending to its implications. One thing that seems certain is that the idea of epistemic superiority implies some sort of skepticism; for we are conjecturing that the SIBs might know things that we are incapable of comprehending. One way to criticize the idea of epistemic superiority, then, would be to reject the sort of skepticism that it implies.  But what sort of skepticism is at stake here? 

Consider the contrast between ‘justificatory’ and ‘noetic’ skepticism. The former concerns the limits of our ability to justify claims, the later concerns the limits of our thoughts. Although these limits are not always clearly distinguished, both, it seems, are relevant to the skeptical doctrine.[24] A preliminary way to get a handle on this distinction is to think of it in terms of attributions of error and ignorance. Typically, although not invariably, justificatory skeptics present their case via the possibility of error, while noetic skepticism is explicated in terms of ignorance. It might be useful to think of such attributions in terms of a (quasi) scientific example. For simplicity sake let us suppose that there are just two contested hypotheses about the nature of the universe. The standard model, or big-bang theory, H1, describes the universe as evolving from some primordial singularity. The steady state hypothesis, H2, proposes that the universe has always been more or less as it is now. The justificatory skeptic might be seen as arguing that we do not know that H1 is true because there is at least a conceptual possibility that we are in error. While our best available empirical evidence supports H1, it is logically possible that H2 is true. We might be asked by a skeptic to imagine an evil demon has arranged all sorts of false clues; e.g., the “alleged” background radiation of the universe leftover from the big bang was simply planted there by the epistemic fiend in an attempt to mislead us. The justificatory skeptic does not suggest that we are ignorant of the conceptual alternatives, for they allow that we might entertain the possibility that H2 is true. 

Noetic skepticism, in contrast, does not challenge the justification for any particular hypothesis, but questions whether we are capable of formulating the correct hypothesis in the first place. Noetic skepticism claims that the hypothesis that correctly describes the truth might be beyond the “reach of our minds”—to use Nagel’s formulation. We cannot even entertain the true hypothesis as a possible object of belief, according to this line of skepticism, never mind the subsidiary question of whether such a hypothesis can be justified. To extend the example above, the noetic skeptic might agree that H1 and H2 describe the only two hypotheses about the universe that are worthy of human scientific scrutiny. However, suppose the “complexity” hypothesis H3 is true. It suggests that the theory that best describes the universe must posit a billion billion billion billion billion billion initial conditions, and each of these initial conditions requires at least the same number of bits of information to describe it. Such a hypothesis, let us suppose, is far too complex for any human to conceive. The noetic skeptic then argues that the possibility of H3 demonstrates that we might forever be ignorant about the truth of the universe. 

          Noetic skepticism is not without its critics. Of the a priori strategies to reject such doubts, perhaps the most famous is Hegel’s attempt to vanquish noetic skepticism. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, we are told that humans have reached the point of absolute knowledge. In the Logic we are provided with (Hegel’s version of) a complete description of (at least the main features of) reality. Davidson also falls in the a priori camp. As we have seen, the argument in “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme” is that the idea of conceptual schemes turns on the idea of a failure of translation between languages. Davidson then provides us with a transcendental argument to demonstrate that intertranslatability is a condition sine qua non of languagehood in general.[25] Having ruled out the possibility of (massive) ignorance, i.e., noetic skepticism, Davidson also rules out the possibility of (massive) error[26], i.e., justificatory skepticism, with his “Omniscient Interpreter” argument.[27] Davidson thus is epistemically “optimistic” in much the same way as Hegel. 

It is possible to conceive of an empirically based epistemic optimism as well. Such optimism seems to be wide spread (although certainly not ubiquitous) in the sciences. In physics, for example, the question of how close theoretical science is to finding a “final theory,” or what is sometimes known as a “theory of everything,” is often mooted. Perhaps the most prominent recent contribution to this debate is Stephen Hawking’s lecture “Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?”, where he argued that the goal of theoretical physics might be achieved by the end of this century. Realizing this goal would mean that we “have a complete, consistent, and unified theory of the physical interactions which would describe all possible observations.”[28] Hawking is not alone among physicists in making such prophetic statements—although most extend the time frame beyond the end of this century. 

On the other hand, there are thinkers who are firmly planted in the naturalistic tradition who seem to make a compelling case for taking skepticism seriously. Fodor, for instance, raises exactly this sort of point: 

…so long as the class of accessible concepts is endogenously constrained, there will be thoughts that we are unequipped to think. And, so far, nobody has been able to devise an account of the ontogeny of concepts which does not imply such endogenous constraints. This conclusion may seem less unbearably depressing if one considers that it is one which we unhesitatingly accept for every other species. One would presumably not be impressed by a priori arguments intended to prove (e.g.) that the true science must be accessible to spiders.[29] 

Fodor and Chomsky seem to endorse noetic skepticism, as they entertain the possibility that human reason might be limited with respect to the sorts of thoughts and truth that we might be capable of entertaining. Furthermore, they do so according to what seems to be naturalistic precepts, i.e., they see noetic skepticism as a consequence of considering Homo sapiens as a biological product formed by the process of natural selection. In effect, then, their views are theoretical analogues to the experiment described above. 

          The line of thought we are considering, then, is that the notion of epistemic superiority ought to be rejected because it implies a false or absurd consequence, namely, noetic skepticism. It is beyond the domain of the present work to explore the rejection of noetic skepticism on empirical grounds, other than it is difficult to see how the physicists could be confident in their epistemic optimism in advance of the experimental outcome described above.[30] 

But what of Davidson's a priori argument? I believe that there is room to speculate whether Davidson’s argument against noetic skepticism (even if correct) is sufficient to squash the notion of epistemic superiority. For let us assume that Davidson is correct that all languages are intertranslatable. What follows? It would seem that the idea that the SIBs might possess a view of the universe that transcends our own would have to be abandoned. For if such a view is to be expressed in a language, then Davidson’s argument shows that this idea must be rejected. But must the (conjectured) transcendent view of the SIBs be couched in a language? 

          Consider first the relation of the idea of language to what seems to be the more general concept of communication. In other words, language may be used as a form of communication, but all communication is not in the form of language. [31] If all natural languages are intertranslatable, then, it follows that creatures that are “lower” on the phylogenetic scale, such as chimpanzee and honey bees, do not possess languages. Nevertheless, such creatures are able to glean information about the world and communicate it to conspecifics. The fact that such creatures possess these abilities indicates that their means of communicating might be thought of as ‘protolanguages’. By analogical reasoning, then, it seems that, for all we know, it is possible that there are other forms of communicating and gleaning information about the world that stand to languages, as languages stand to protolanguages. Imagine that beings that stand to us in intelligence, as we do to chimpanzees, communicate by means of a ‘hyperlanguage’. Hyperlanguages transcend human languages in the same manner which human languages transcend the protolanguages of chimpanzees. If this case can be made, then it is possible to maintain the skeptical position that thought and language might not be able to comprehend reality in all its complexity, even though all languages are essentially intertranslatable. 

To fill in the details of this argument reflect on why chimpanzees and monkeys might be thought of as having a “protolanguage”. To what extent the other primates possess a language, if at all, is a much-contested issue. For the present purposes it is sufficient to make the somewhat banal observation that at least some of the other primates possess a form of communication that enables them to announce information about their environment. It has been know for some time, for example, that the East African vervet monkeys make different-sounding calls in response to three different predators: leopards, eagles and snakes. Commenting on the observation, Seyfarth and Cheney write: 

  

  

Each call elicited a distinct apparently adaptive, escape response from nearby vervets. Alarm calls given about leopards caused monkeys to run into trees, where monkeys seemed safe from feline attack. Eagle alarms caused them to look up in the air or run into brushes. Snake alarms caused the animals to stand on their hind legs and look into the grass.[32] 

  

  

Yet on the Davidsonian view, the information gleaned and communicated by the nonhominid primates does not merit the appellation of a ‘language’, since even the chimpanzee is not capable of understanding all the information that might be communicated by means of a language. No chimpanzee, for example, is going to be able to translate the terms necessary to express quantum physics. Thus, according to Davidson’s criteria of languagehood, chimpanzees do not have a language. 

But at this point it may be wondered whether Davidson has the argumentative resources to deny the “hyperlanguages” since the argument in “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme” does not seem to speak to this possibility. The fact that languages are said to be intertranslatable is of no concern since hyperlanguages, by definition, are not intertranslatable with languages. For hyperlanguages stand in the same relation to languages which languages stand to protolanguages, i.e., hyperlanguages, languages, and protolanguages all share the feature of being employed by creatures in gleaning information about the world, and communicating it with conspecifics. Where they differ is in the complexity of the information that might be represented. Thus, languages are capable of representing information of greater complexity than that of protolanguages, and hyperlanguages are capable of representing information of greater complexity than languages.[33] 

It might be thought that this line of argument begs the question against Davidson’s original association of languages and conceptual schemes. However, the same motivation that underlies the distinction between languages, hyperlanguages and protolanguages, can be employed for distinguishing between concepts, hyperconcepts, and protoconcepts. Clearly the stacks of papers on concept mastery in animals and human infants that fill our libraries are mistaken if Davidson is correct. For such creatures cannot employ concepts since they do not possess a language. At best what such creatures might be said to possess, on the Davidsonian view at least, are protoconcepts and a protoconceptual scheme. If this is the case, then it would seem that we ought to say that hyperconcepts and a hyperconceptual scheme, stands in the same relation to concepts and a conceptual scheme, as the latter stands to protoconcepts and a protoconceptual scheme. 

 If this line of argument can be made out, then Davidson’s transcendental argument, which concludes that all natural languages are intertranslatable, is less significant that might first appear. This argument “defines” language in a manner such that there is little reason to suppose that languages are the only means of communicating information, or that they are the most sophisticated means of communication. Natural languages might be just that: a natural kind in the order of communication. Other forms of communication are more primitive, and hence, are termed ‘protolanguages’, and some are more sophisticated, they are ‘hyperlanguages’. [34] 

The skeptical upshot turns on the question of whether the final philosophical and scientific theory of everything might ultimately be expressed in a language? Are languages just too primitive to express the true theory of everything? Does the final philosophical and scientific account of everything require a hyperlanguage for its expression? Is it possible that the epistemic superiority of the SIBs might lie precisely in the fact that they have evolved beyond the need to express their views in a language? What shall we term this—‘logos skepticism’? 

A similar line of thought leads one to wonder whether truth itself is an adequate “vehicle” for the final philosophical theory of everything. One “modern” way to understand truth is that it is a property that is properly applied only to (declarative) sentences. If we accept this modern view in conjunction with the Davidsonian position on language intertranslatability, then this implies that chimpanzees are never in possession of the truth. Since chimpanzees are not language users (according to Davidson), a fortiori, truth does not even come into play. If not truth, then, it seems that there still has to be some neutral description of chimpanzees by which we may describe them as communicating correct or incorrect information about their environment. Some primates, for example, have been observed “intentionally” attempting to mislead their comrades by evincing “false” cries of “food over in this direction”. The “ploy” is to misdirect the troop while the signaler doubles back to the real food source. We might say that, while chimps do not communicate truth or falsehoods, they do communicate both information and misinformation or “prototruths” and “protofalsehoods”. If the SIBs communicate with a hyperlanguage, then they too are not in possession of the truth. Perhaps they seek the Hypertruth. Truth (even if it is a woman) may be human, all too human.[35] Have philosophers hitherto set their sights too low? Should philosophy seek Hypertruth? What shall we term this sort of skepticism? Aletheia skepticism?[36] That is, the doctrine that philosophical wisdom might require a standard higher than truth itself. 

What has been said thus far tell mostly against those—like Davidson or Hegel—who are inclined to think that there is no gap between human abilities and the telos of (traditional) philosophy. It would be rash to believe that these remarks constitute a “refutation” of Davidson’s position. Rather, I think they are best seen as providing an inflationist’s perspective on his position. A more considered treatment is beyond the scope of this paper.[37] 

I want to turn now very briefly to the other two contending metaphilosophical positions mentioned above, namely, “deflationism” and Nagel’s stoic resolve. Since these positions acknowledge the teleological gap there is no reason to think that they might be adverse to the critique of Davidson. James, one of the founding members of modern deflationism, for instance, writes: 

  

 I firmly disbelieve, myself, that our human experience is the highest form of experience extant in the universe. I believe rather that we stand in much the same relation to the whole of the universe as our canine and feline pets do to the whole of human life. They inhabit our drawing rooms and libraries. They take part in scenes whose significance they have no inkling. They are merely tangent to curves of history, the beginnings and ends and forms of which pass wholly beyond their ken. So we are tangent to the wider life of things.[38] 

  

The critique of Davidson offered above is obviously in the same spirit as the dose of humility that James offers. This is of course not surprising since James’ deflationism and inflationism are agreed that there is a potential teleological gap. What would it take to close this gap?  Concerning this question Putnam, a contemporary heir to the deflationary tradition, writes: 

  

…I can sympathize with the urge to know, to have a totalistic explanation which includes the thinker in the act of discovering the totalistic explanation in the totality of what it explains. I am not saying that this urge is “optional,” or that it is the product of events in the sixteenth century, or that it rests on a false presupposition because there aren’t really such things as truth, warrant, or value. But I am saying that the project of providing such an explanation has failed. 

It has failed not because it was an illegitimate urge—what human pressure could be more worthy of respect than the pressure to know—but because it goes beyond the bounds of any explanation that we have. Saying this is not, perhaps, putting the grand projects of Metaphysics and Epistemology away for good—what another millennium, or another turn in human history as proud as the Renaissance, may bring forth is not for us today to guess—but it is saying that the time has come for a moratorium on Ontology and a moratorium on Epistemology. Or rather, the time has come for a moratorium on the kind of ontological speculation that seeks to describe the Furniture of the Universe and to tell us what is Really There and what is Only a Human Projections, and for a moratorium on the kind of epistemological speculation that seeks to tell us the One Method by which all our beliefs can be appraised.[39] 

  

  

What is interesting is Putnam’s conditional rejection of the grand questions of philosophy. For Putnam does not say that these questions ought never to be asked by humanity again, only that at present we ought not to ask them. He allows that in another historical epoch these questions might be worth pursuing. As Putnam correctly observes, we cannot guess today what “another millennium, or another turn in history as profound as the Renaissance, may bring forth.” Rorty, it seems, would have us smash the “mirror of nature”. Putnam, with a keener historical sense in this instance, would have us merely put the mirror of nature in the closet to wait for happier times. 

          What Putnam says in this quote would seem to apply, a fortiori, to a change in our biology as well. It would seem that we could not today guess what a change in our biology of the same magnitude as that of the development of the hominid line from australopithecines would bring. If we genetically alter the human zygote in such a way as to create larger brained creatures, they may well possess the sort of godlike perspective presupposed by traditional philosophy. At the very least, I do not think we can discount such a possibility a priori. Sometime in the next 5 to 25 years we will in all likelihood possess the expertise to genetically engineer the human zygote in the aforementioned manner. 

Thus, deflationists are flat-out wrong to say that the ambition of philosophy cannot be pursued. What is required—at least by the traditional telos of philosophy—is that we radically improve ourselves. Obviously there is no guarantee that we will be successful in this endeavor, nor is likely to be easy.  But this is not exactly late breaking news. Plato, the greatest inflationist of them all, in the Republic instructed us that the philosopher’s ascent from the cave would be difficult; and results in a radical transformation of those individuals who could complete this arduous task. Specifically, they will become godlike—a point on which Aristotle agrees.[40] For those who want to remain shackled to the cave wall we might gladly donate our copies of Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, as manuals for self-help. Qua footnotes to Plato, it is clear where our duty lies. 

          Obviously it is still open to the deflationist to say that we ought not to pursue the telos of philosophy. They might argue, for example, that the procedure outlined—genetically altering the human zygote, selective breeding or the construction of transcendent computers—is unethical. But this would be to argue for deflationism on totally new grounds For traditionally deflationists have argued that we cannot realize the telos of traditional philosophy, i.e., the unity of thought and Being—not that we ought not.[41] 

          Of the positions delimited, inflationism agrees most with stoic perseverance both with the difficulties facing philosophy and the viability of the alternatives. We saw, for instance, how Nagel, one of its leading exponents, criticized Davidson’s view that we cannot make sense of a transcendent conceptual scheme.[42] 

We saw as well, in the initial survey of the four options, that Nagel rejects deflationism in the strongest terms. The residual question is whether we ought to become something more or wallow in stoicism. Nagel at times seems to point the way to inflationism itself: 

  

          There is a persistent temptation to turn philosophy into something less difficult and more shallow than it is. It is an extremely difficult subject…I do not feel equal to the problems treated in this book. They seem to me to require an order of intelligence wholly different from mine.[43] 

  

For if philosophical questions require an order of intelligence wholly different from that of Homo sapiens, as Nagel seems to suggest, then the obvious move is to attempt to create a different intelligence. But like deflationism, it is open to those that opt for stoic perseverance to argue that inflationism is not a “live” option since it requires us to perform unethical acts. As noted above, I do not propose to respond to this charge. 

          Yet clearly this ethical question looms large, i.e., ought we to attempt to create transcendent thinkers? A negative answer would obviously foreclose the possibility of exploring inflationism—at least for those that hold and heed such norms. As noted in the introduction, the ambition here is merely to point out the theoretical possibility of inflationism. The practical question of which of these four positions we ought to adopt is beyond the scope of the diminutive ambitions of this paper. 

          There is one further obstacle, in addition to any potential ethical barriers, that might stand in the way of inflationism, namely, that pesky thing known as ‘reality’. As noted above, it is an empirical question whether we can in fact create higher intelligences. If it proves impossible then, as I see it, inflationism is done. It is hard to see how, for instance, a deflationist might be moved (other than to laughter) if one insists that there is a possible world where the telos of philosophy is realized. The cash value of inflationism lies in the fact that it is an empirically testable means to further the ambitions of philosophy. 

  

  

4.0 Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophizing. 

  

  

          In section 2 I argued that there is a technological revolution afoot that may radically alter human history and indeed humanity itself. In section 3 I indicated how such a revolution might affect our understanding of philosophy. In this section I want to indicate how philosophy might affect our understanding of the nature of this technological revolution. To focus this discussion let us take three questions as central and which we might suspect (following Kant) that philosophy exhibits some acumen: What can we know? What should we do? What should we hope? 

4.1 What can we know? 

Let us suppose that technology raises the prospect of transcendent intelligences.  Who better than philosophers to cogitate this prospect? The debate between Davidson and Nagel on the viability of transcendent intelligences is merely the latest incarnation of a controversy that extends back to the dawn of western philosophy itself. For instance, epistemologically, this is perhaps the divisive issue between Hegel and Kant.  That is, Kant allows the possibility of transcendent intelligences; such creatures may know things in themselves, while such knowledge is inaccessible to humans. Hegel of course had little patience for the notion of things in themselves, at least at the end of history. [44] While philosophy has all but forgotten the question of its relation to human and higher intelligence, prior to this century, the topic was of central concern. Indeed, philosophy has over twenty-five hundred years of experience to bring to bear on this question. [45]  I think it is incumbent upon philosophers to draw on this history in order to help frame the terms of this debate. 

          Here is but one example. A recent article has us imagine what sort of constraints might operate on creatures with brains the size of Jupiter. The author’s fundamental premise is that “The laws of physics impose constraints on the activities of intelligent beings regardless of their motivations, culture or technology.”[46] The author then proceeds to investigate the sort of information processing ability that such a brain might enjoy, e.g., the author supposes that the speed of light imposes a constraint on the processing speed of a Jupiter sized brain. Let us grant the author’s fundamental premise. It certainly does not follow that the Jupiter-sized brains are bound by the speed of light unless it turns out that we happened to get this physical law correct with our puny 1300 ccs of brain matter. In other words, even if physical laws constrain the activities of intelligent beings we need some independent support for the claim that our view of these laws is even close to the mark. The author does not seem to take serious the possibility that there might be intelligences that radically transcend our own. Perhaps such creatures might smile at our claim that the speed of light is a fundamental physical law in the same way we smile at Lord Kelvin’s claim that heavier than air flying machines are impossible. To think of the Jupiter-sized brains in such human terms is to seriously underestimate what might be at stake in implementing the technologies noted above. Philosophy ought to bring its expertise on the question of transcendence to this debate. 

4.2 What should we do? 

If the assessment here is correct, then it may be that we are on the verge of a technological and cultural revolution of unparalleled proportion. At present there seems to be two clear options. We might embrace this technology and attempt to create beings who are better equipped to complete philosophy (and science). The other option is that we find that the wisest course of action is to not employ this technology. Either course presents us with huge moral and ethical challenges. Obviously the former option raises the possibility of the extinction of the human species. What if our transcendent children turn on us? If the latter course is chosen we have the difficult moral challenge of justifying this course of action, and the moral challenge of policing this policy. To effect a worldwide moratorium on such research would require international cooperation on a scaled not yet realized. Our success with stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology—which is by its very nature much more tractable, since it requires a much larger industrial base—ought not to encourage us. The genetic research outlined above could be carried out in any number of labs throughout the entire world. If philosophy has primary justification over any domain of discourse then morality is as good a candidate as any. Given the enormity of these moral questions philosophers, I believe, have a duty to take them up in conversation. 

4.3 What May We Hope For? 

How we answer this question (as Kant clearly saw) is intimately intertwined with how we answer the previous two. The upper bound on what we may hope for might be that our transcendent children will fulfill the prophecy of the second coming with only a small inversion of the etiology: It is not God that creates a man-god but we humans create god-like beings. The lower bound on what we may hope for is that in repressing the proliferation of these technologies we do not have to institute such a repressive regime of social control that George Orwell’s 1984 looks like complete anarchy in comparison. 

4.4 A Call to Arms 

          Our battle is with the future. Thus far the battle has been engaged by those most closely linked with technology—engineers, scientists and science-fiction writers. A case in point is a recent article by Bill Joy; co-founder of sun Microsystems, which has a caused a stir in certain circles.[47] Joy brings his computer background to bear in assessing the prospects for technology in the twenty-first century. Joy’s version of the future is bleak in the extreme, in contrast to the mostly upbeat or utopian vision offered by other technologists such as Moravec and Kurzweil. Wherein lies the truth? The answer to this will depend on how we answer the questions of ‘What can we know?’, ‘What should we do?’ and ‘What might we hope for?’ Even if there is a remote possibility that I am correct about the imminent nature of this technology, and the potentially radical implications for humanity, I believe that philosophers are duty bound to cogitate these questions with some urgency. This is the call to arms.

[2] It has been suggested to me that 'inflationism' has a number of negative connotations to it and that 'amplificatory' might work better here. While I agree with the sentiment I think 'inflationism' tends to make more perspicuous the contrast with 'deflationism'. 

[3] Although on occasion a single genetic mutation may be sufficient for speciation. It has even been argued (controversially) that Homo sapiens speciated on a single genetic change involving the lateralization and hemispheric specialization of the brain. See, T. Crow (1999) Did Homo Sapiens Speciate on the Y Chromosome?” available on line (http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?11.001) 

[4] The locus classicus on this subject is H. Jerison’s Evolution of the Brain and Intelligence, New York: Academic Press, 1973. The correlation is actually between intelligence and brain volume versus the log of body weight. A direct comparison between humans and chimps is a little unfair, since the chimps’ body weight is less, on average, than a human’s. This does not affect the main point, which is that the chimpanzee has a proportionately smaller brain than Homo sapiens. The point about comparing body weight is that the intelligence of a creature is thought to be a function of its “surplus” brain mass: a larger body requires more brain mass to control and motor its operations. Thus, although a whale has a larger brain than Homo sapiens it also has a much larger body. The correlation is by no means perfect. Dolphins have a higher brain versus body weight ratio; if we are to believe this correlation has no exceptions then we ought to accept the conclusion that dolphins are more intelligent than humans. Jerison provides much illumination on these issues.

[22] Ibid. p. 185. 

[23] Nagel, op. cit., makes a similar argument against Davidson, pp. 93-99. 

[24] This distinction seems to be operating at some level in Descartes and Kant’s work. Thus Descartes: “I would dare not even dare to say that God cannot arrange that a mountain should exist without a valley, or that one and two should not make three; but I only say that He has given me a mind of such a nature that I cannot conceive a mountain without a valley or a sum of one and two which would not be three, and so on, and that such things imply contradictions in my conception.” (Letter to Arnauld, 29 July 1648). Quoted in H. Frankfurt, “The Logic of Omnipotence” reprinted in Readings in the Philosophy of Religion, ed. By B. A. Brody, Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, 1974, p. 343, note 3. Kant too clearly thought our understanding was limited in comparison to God. Kant contends that we labor under the misfortune of not having an intellectual intuition like god, but merely a sensuous intuition, hence, we may only know objects as phenomena not noumena, The Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Kemp Smith, Toronto: Macmillan, 1965, B308-310. Sometimes the problem is put that we have to think rather than using pure intuition: “…all his [God’s] knowledge must be intuition, and not thought, which always involves limitation,” ibid., B 71.  Of course Descartes and Kant both tended to concentrate on what I am calling ‘justificatory skepticism’ to the neglect of noetic skepticism. Much of the tradition, unfortunately, in my view, has had a similar focus. A closely allied distinction is made by Nagel in his The View From Nowhere, op. cit., p. 90: “In the last chapter we discussed skepticism with regard to knowledge. Here I want to introduce another form of skepticism—not about what we know but about how far our thoughts can reach. I shall defend a form of realism according to which our grasp on the world is limited not only in respect of what we can know but also in respect o what we can conceive. In a very strong sense, the world extends beyond the reach of our minds.” His distinction is not exactly the same as the one discussed here. The difference lies in the fact that Nagel seems to suggest at certain points that the world does in fact transcend our ability to conceptualize it, whereas, the skepticism here asserts merely that we leave open the possibility of such a transcendence. I discuss these various types of skepticism in my unpublished &quot;On the Fourfold Root of Philosophical Skepticism&quot;. 

[25] Davidson acknowledges the transcendental nature of his argument in “In Defence of Convention T”, in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation, op. cit. p.72. Carol Rovane argues in “The Metaphysics of Interpretation”, in Truth and Interpretation, ed. Ernest Lepore, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986, 417-29; that there is a strain of transcendental argumentation in Davidson. Rorty argues that Davidson’s conceptual scheme argument is a transcendental argument to end all transcendental arguments, “Transcendental Arguments, Self-reference, and Pragmatism”, in Transcendental Arguments and Science, ed. by P. Bieri, R. P. Horstmann, and L. Kruger, Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing co., pp. 95-103. 

[26] Although Davidson does not directly speak to the possibility of higher intelligences in his discussion of conceptual schemes, this is clearly an implication of his argument as Rorty, “The World Well Lost”, reprinted in Consequences of Pragmatism, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982, and Nagel, The View from Nowhere, op. cit., have clearly seen. 

[27] Davidson appeals to the notion of an omniscient interpreter as a means to guarantee the veracity of our belies in his “The Method of Truth in Metaphysics”, reprinted in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretations, op. cit., pp. 199-214. The omniscient interpreter has a return engagement in “A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge”, reprinted in Truth and Interpretation, op. cit., p. 307.

[33] Cf., Plato, Cratylus, 392. 

[34] An alternate means to reflect on the import of Davidson’s position is the a priori aspect of his transcendental argument. We know a priori that if we encounter any language user then their language is translatable into our own. Now suppose we create or happen on beings with brains the size of a football stadium, (where ever would they find a good fitting hat)? Wheeling out our favorite Davidsonian transcendental argument, we announce to them that if they think or employ a language, then we can translate their language. They respond (in our language) that if that is the way we want to define ‘language’ so be it. When they (the stadium brain creatures) communicate with one another they employ a hyperlanguage and think in hyperthought. It is only when they communicate with us puny brained creatures that they must resort to using a language. Just as when we communicate with apes we do not employ a language but only a protolanguage. It is difficult to see how the argument could prove anything more than this about creatures with such large brains—in an a priori fashion—unless one thought of language as analogous to the transcendental ego or Hegel’s Geist, as opposed to an evolutionary adaptation. In other words, at best what Davidson has shown is that it is inconsistent to speak about languages failing to be mutually intertranslatable. To show that our view of the universe dovetails with an omniscient view would require showing that an omniscient interpreter must speak only in a language. That is, Davidson seems to require is some sort of “completeness” theorem to show that language exhausts the possibility of “higher” forms of communication.

[36] Re Heidegger: Is there a poet’s irony in the idea that the question of Being had to be successively submerged in the Greek trinity of metaphysics, science, and technology, only to be reborn by technology itself. Perhaps the famous Der Spiegel remark—Only a god can save us now—does not look so hopeless. 

[37] Some of these issues are discussed in my unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, &quot;Becoming Gods&quot;. I discuss Davidson's views in more detail in my &quot;On the Intertranslatability of all Natural Languages.&quot;

[40] See note 45 for references for Plato and Aristotle’s view on this matter.

[41] Some popular discussions of this issue suggest that the implementing of these technologies cannot be stopped. My own view is not nearly so fatalistic. But there certainly is a problem here. The more these various technologies advance the easier it will be for fewer and fewer individuals to perform the relevant sorts of experiments to attempt to create higher intelligences. For example, Moravec estimates that 100 million MIPS are sufficient for this sort of experiment. We might legislate then that no computer should be above say 10 million MIPS in size. But then how do we stop 10 graduate students from linking 10 of these computers together after a night at the pub? (Graduate student supervision could take on a whole new meaning). Many biological laboratories, particularly ones funded from private sources, operate in a certain amount of secrecy for “proprietary” reasons. Even one such small laboratory may be able in the coming century to genetically engineer Homo bigheadus. 

[42] We are perhaps in a position to add a few other names to this list: Fodor and Chomsky, op. cit., and Colin McGinn,  (Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry, Oxford: Blackwell, 1993).

Westphal, History and Truth in Hegel’s Phenomenology, third edition, Indiana: Indiana University Press, p. 37: “I have argued in another place that Kant’s dualism and finitism are the expression of a religious world-view, since the thing-in-itself is so clearly defined as the thing-for-God. If this is true, we will have to conclude that as the problem of the Phenomenology developed and took on dimensions transcending the narrowly epistemological, Hegel moved closer to the spirit of Kant and to real engagement with his thought. For both of them the question of knowledge becomes the question of man in relation to God.” To which we might add that this makes Kant and Hegel very Greek.

I had missed Ray's [Kurzweil] talk and the subsequent panel that Ray and John [Searle] had been on, and they now picked right up where they'd left off, with Ray saying that the rate of improvement of technology was going to accelerate and that we were going to become robots or fuse with robots or something like that, and John countering that this couldn't happen, because the robots couldn't be conscious. 

While I had heard such talk before, I had always felt sentient robots were in the realm of science fiction. But now, from someone I respected, I was hearing a strong argument that they were a near-term possibility. I was taken a back, especially given Ray's proven ability to imagine and create the future. I already knew that new technologies like genetic engineering and nanotechnology were giving us the power to remake the world, but a realistic and imminent scenario for intelligent robots surprised me.”</text>

An Angelic Alphabet

The Hebrew ‘aleph-beit’ is a ‘cognitive entheogen’, and is divine in nature. It accurately represents ways of knowing which conserve their not-entirely-human origins, and is a living artifact from a vast Epic of adventures with celestial presence on Earth. If we look at this from the perspective of spirituality, this language is a gift to the people of Earth from our spiritual progenitors. It is also a lot like a science-fiction toy from the future — it has trans-temporal connectivities and thus comprises something of a ‘prophecy device’. Hebrew is a living doorway to the ‘outside’ of what we understand as Time. I state this not as theory or philosophy but as easily demonstrated fact. 

Theopoetic in function and purpose, the whole of creation is experienced by initiates as encoded in a magical way in the archetypal identities, shapes, histories, and relations of the letters. These relations are commonly non-linear, and so potentially diverse as to defy any single system of exploration. Each entity in a letter, word or phrase is reflectively redefined by systems of context, position and a magically-founded numerism which is most likely the source of modern ‘numerology’.

The 613 thousand letters of the Torah are said to comprise a single name of God, and a remembrance of the number of the souls who departed Egypt during Exodus. But hidden within the relational symmetries of the letters are profound doorways to ecstatic communion with their source. For thousands of years the ‘hidden’ aspects of Hebrew have escaped secular understanding almost entirely — a common goal of any sacred tongue. Yet these matters and ways are not meant to remain forever hidden, and in truth we live in a new Aeon where what was long hidden is now to be revealed and magnified in our lives and experience — not merely in books.

Whether or not Hebrew is ‘the chosen language’ is a question for those children who prefer division to unity, so too are questions relating to authorization to know, use or learn it. Hebrew is an amazing archeocognitive enlightenment-game. It is meant to be ‘played’ by children, not experts — and its purpose is liberation, not admonition and wrathful judgment as we are too often convinced by those who know too little of these matters to have any reasonable credentials for ‘teaching us’ of them.

The Numbers in the Letters in the Names...

In ancient cultures numeric entities were ‘something else’ before they were abstract. To know the ‘number 1’ was akin to having a special teaching angel for a best friend — it was a relationship with a being, not a token. Each of the cardinals (first 9 or ten numbers) was contemplated in similar fashion. In our time we are taught to denigrate such knowledge as spurious or superstition. The bald fact of reality is that in comparison it is our stance which is absurd, not theirs. The whole domain of mathematics and all of the sciences have their source in the precursors of the religions and informal metaphysics they labor so feverishly to denigrate, vilify or deny.

Back around the time of Pythagoras, and probably for a long long time before him, the fundamental numeric entities were experientially known to be living transports to impossible understanding. Their use in counting as abstract ‘values’ was seen as a denigrated and pragmatic reduction of their real natures and functions — akin to making idols to represent gods. Each of the first nine (ten to initiates) numbers is of peculiar and of profound formative significance, and each uniquely reflects the other members of the primordial set. These entities are not quantities, but are akin to transports in the body of the unityBeing — ‘angels’ (or angles) who exist as accessible teachers and ‘measurers’. To activate this transport, one cultivates a playfully non-human model of numerism in general, not entirely unalike with something we might expect from ‘an insane person’ in modern times.

‘Counting’ and ‘math’ are merely falsified pragmatic reductions of this ancient understanding, useful only for matters of enumerating and ‘building things’. These ‘abstract’ faces of numeric entities are terrifying in their ability to rob us of unity and comprehension, for they ‘shave away’ all that is true and real in preference to ‘images of empty structure’. As a denigrated toy, these forms of knowing are useful, but if we credential them as gods the result is a direct and crippling attack upon our anciently conserved organismal and human intelligence. When this attack ceases, our intelligence naturally expands to inhabit the re - membered spaciousness of the universe itself, and many universes beyond those we’ve named.

The hebrew arts of sacred writing comprise the elements of a formative hyperlanguage, extremely different from our own, and the letters of their aleph-beit share these qualities — existing as ‘many dimensional’ spiritual archetypes arranged in scalarly self-referential lexicon. Hebrew is a living doorway which conserves these relations, and it offers us precious access into not only what is possible, but the opportunities which lie far beyond what was accomplished thousands of years ago. It is an inexhaustible vehicle of literal enlightenment, not merely the language of a given people on Earth.

It is our birthright to have access to learning-modes and knowledge far in excess of the sum of what human science and religion can offer. We will never claim this right in isolation, for it is in every case the sacred fruit of human unity in mutual uplift, rescue, learning and celebration. 


Notarikon,Temura and Gematria:

To understand a single letter, is to become ‘more alike with’ all that it relates to and is reflected with(in). Each is a living koan, a riddle-friend with whom one will always live and travel. Each letter also has a variety of numeric associates, which are ‘computed’ according to the rules of a variety of formal and informal systems. Each letter has at least 4 ‘intrinsic values’ in Gematria. Rather than being merely numbers, these values correspond to poetic and spiritual archetypes which represent primordial principles in multiple dimensions of metafication. Hebrew words have this same quality, which is a ‘sum’ of these angelic-lingual ‘archetypes’.. Each word may be numerically indexed to other term-archetypes in its ‘intimate family’ via a discipline known as gematria. These ‘games’ form a whole other dimension of semantic literacy, and provide a mode of recombinantly active metaphoric connectivity unknown in English. 

Two words with the same gematric indices are clearly and usually poetically related. The potentials for relational gematria are probably infinite, but a few standard forms of the discipline have come down to us from their sources in history. One must suspect that the most profoundly adept incarnations of these games remain largely the guarded secret of the highest initiates, and may well be impossible to transmit in ‘system’ being founded instead in achieving and sustaining direct contact with God as co-interpreter

In gematria, each letter has various values, but one of these, the spelling value, is of particular import. Each letter in Hebrew is also a ‘word’ and thus has ‘a spelling’, usually comprised of 2 or 3 letters, beginning with the letter being spelled. Other values have to do with an arithmetic matrix and positional denominations [see 'aleph']. Thus a letter’s constituents can be ‘summed’ to produce an expansion of its elemental nature. 

These values correlate with mystical and poetic principles related to the precedence-ladder of powers and events traversed in Creation, and particularly in Genesis. Essentially this is a door to an ever-more profound relationship with the sources of the Hebrew language, which turns out in every case to lead directly to contact with the living source of language itself.

Notarikon is the ‘noticing’ of the compressed terms which emerge when one takes the first letter each word in a specific block of text in order, discarding the rest. Many modes exist, such as last letter of a given statement, etc. Acrostics are a form of Notarikon, where the first letter of each line is taken, and these are added together to produce an encoded phrase. Notarikons can be gematrially correlated, and Temura may be applied as well, leading to further gematria.

Temura is a substitution-game, and the temura of a word can be gematrially reduced and thus correlated with indexes in memory or tome. The common forms of temura are listed below:

Note: Read English Left to Right : Read Hebrew Right to Left

Atbash: First letter is traded for the last, 2nd for 2nd to last, &amp;c.

i.e: YHVH (or YHWH) = MTzPTz



Albam: Add 11 letter positions to the letter in question.
A = L [1 (the letter)+11 = 12]

i.e: YHVH = ShAiPAi



Avgad: Add 1 letter-position. A = B

ie: YHVH = KZVZ

In early Hebrew, some letters were understood to act as guides or ‘matris lecionis’ (mothers of reading) because these letters held sway over the meaning-shape and sound-shape of the word. These protovowels formed the decoding premise of nearly every ‘word-form’ and thus acted as lexical ‘keys’ to the language itself. Aleph, Hey and Yud and Vahv most commonly used in this way.

Hebrew is suspected by most scholars to be a Canaanite dialect which began to establish itself as distinct sometime around 1000 B. C. E. The most likely symbolic sources are Phoenician— Proto-Hebraic is functionally indistinguishable from this lineage-precursor.

The square lettering form in modern use is thought to have arisen after the jewish captivity in Babylon. In Greek, the weakened guttural sounds of specific Phoenician letters, (nearly identical to old hebrew) were translated into the primordial vowels as follows:

Aleph - Alpha

Hey - Epsilon

Chait - Eta

Yod - Iota

Aiyin - Omicron

Vahv - Upsilon

In order to preserve traditional pronunciation Masoretic (a term possibly equivalent to ‘traditionalist’) scribes established and perfected a system which was distinct from the texts but could be overlaid upon them without changing the original document’s symbolic identity. Thus a modern ‘marked’ text should in theory be identical to an unmarked precursor, and markings may be systematically applied to any unmarked text without disturbing the symmetries and symbols of the text itself. The simple-seeming question: why have a complex system of markings when you can just put vowel-characters in is defeated by the timeline: these languages are from the genesis-period of vowels, and the Greeks gave and integrated the answer we ourselves still employ. The other night whilst viewing russian text in a film I recognized that their I character corresponds to our O...

&quot;The language which must be learned to understand it&quot; is a formative hyperlanguage constructed from semantically-accurate self-signifying signs -- the inner, structural/energetic meanings of the Hebrew alphabet. 

The basic postulate: there is a hidden text written in this hyperlanguage concealed in Bereshit/Genesis and other Books of the Hebrew Bible, which can be de-coded letter by letter and word by word to yield a completely new text. Not numerology or gematria, not &quot;bible codes,&quot; not an interpretive or hermeneutical approach, not even a translation: an unseen, coherent, self-verifying, transcendent, text. Testing this postulate, learning the language and decoding and reading the text is the revelation.

1. What is a hyperlanguage? 
2. What is a formative hyperlanguage? 
3. How can an alphabet have/be a language?
4. What is an alphabet of creation?  The Hebrew alphabet, considered as recursive, self-signifying formative functions or patterns, represents the smallest set of structural-semantic primes or fundamental powers necessary to generate a multiverse.  
 
   
  We usually think of alphabets as the building blocks of language, not as languages in themselves. We know many languages that are made from essentially the same alphabet, and after all, what would &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; mean? Which is exactly the point to consider. 

What if &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; had a meaning in addition to phonetic value? Then each letter of a word would contain its own significance, as well as contributing meaning to the whole. What if &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; had spellings themselves, with recursive hyperlinks to the meanings of those letters, and the letters of those letters? And what if were necessary to read a word from both directions, or in different permutations of letters? 

The best description for such a language might be &quot;hyperlanguage&quot; since all its components are hyperlinked to other components in nested recursions. Formal definition of the word &quot;hyperlanguage&quot; may not exist. Google's sole general description may suggest why:  
Hyperlanguages transcend human languages in the same manner which human languages transcend the protolanguages of chimpanzees.

What is a formative hyperlanguage? 

The search for a perfect, or universal, &quot;adamic&quot; language, or Characteristica Universalis , has been a part of human history since the Tower of Babel and Cratylus.

6.1.4. Precursors and successors of the CU 
Leibniz was by no means the first nor the only one to have worked on a universal language (UL) or character system (CS). Indeed, it could be said that the project of a UL was the craze of the day in 17th century proto-scientist circles (K88, 96). This quest can (somewhat arbitrarily, ANM:ADAM[107]) be originated with Jacob B鰄me (1575-1624) who had called for the re-discovery of the Adamic Language (or AL), the original language humans were supposed to have spoken before the events that were expressed in the biblical myth of the building of the Tower of Babel. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) proposed a set of universal characters in &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot; and &quot;De Augmentis Scientiarum&quot; in 1623. The development was carried on. The list includes: Marin Mersenne 1636, John Wilkins 1641, Francis Lodwick 1647, Thomas Urquaart 1653, Cave Beck 1657, George Dalgarno 1661, Johann Joachim Becher 1661, Isaak Newton 1661, Athanasius Kircher 1663, Johann Amos Comenius 1668, Johann Sturm 1676, De Vienne Plancy 1681. (K91, p. 242; K88, 95-97). Leibniz was well aware of the approaches at UL and AL of his forerunners. Considerable influence in his thoughts had the combinatorical scheme of the Ars Magna of Raimundus Lullus (1233-1315) which he cites in &quot;De Arte Combinatoria&quot; of 1660. Lullus' system was not a language system but it played considerable importance in Leibniz' logical work on the CU.  
  6.2.6. Cabbala as Ars Characteristica 
The interpretation of the cabbala as given by Suar鑣 follows a thought pattern that we will find again in the chapter on &quot;Symbolic Machines&quot; or &quot;Formal Character Systems&quot;. (See: -&gt;:SYM-MACH, -&gt;:ARS-CHAR ) On page 38 to 40, Suar鑣 describes the cabbala of the SY in terms recognizable as an approximation to the Ars Characteristica aspect of Leibniz' Characteristica Universalis.  
  The language of the Sepher Yetsira... treats objects - water, fire, human bodies, planets, the zodiac - only in terms of their situation and of their r鬺e within an infinitely multiple, hierarchical, systematisation of the one energising life force. The equations indicating these objects consequently designate, on all planes, all the structures which exist, or could exist, in the innumerable, known or unknown, conjugations of this hierarchical system, form the most material to the most rarefied, from the least to the highest state of consciousness. 
    SUARES-SEPHER, p. 39  
  The terms used by Suar鑣 are somewhat on the poetic side, but we can recognize the universal, combinatoric structure of a formal CS as Leibniz also had intended. Whether this interpretation can be worked through, or operated, cannot be determined here since that would require a thorough understanding of hebrew. 

The cabbala is in this view an Ars Characteristica that has only been confused and confounded with (mostly theological) meanings by mystics first and later by rational theologists like Gerson Scholem.  
  Mr. Scholem provoked the exaggerations to which this way of thinking gave rise, classifying everything under the false category of &quot;mysticism.&quot;           SUARES-SEPHER, p. 20  
 
   
Universal languages have generally been approached from the Ars Characteristica side, as a language of essences present in all things. The formative aspect, which is why the &quot;True Names&quot; are true, is less considered.  
     In the Sefer Yetzira system, grammar rules the world without its being used in any semantic manner ... This is a system in which the semantic level of language has been completely marginalized, viewed as a secondary, relatively insignificant use of a universal scientific set of laws. 

The system is not semantic; can it be regarded as a semiotic one? ... is the alphabet of creation a rejection of a system of signifiers expressing a semantic message and the adoption of an alternative system of signs, signifying processes in the divine worlds and the actions of the divine powers in the created universe? ... 

     When a question is raised whether a scientific term is a sign or not, there will be no doubt that the word representing the term is one. Whatever a quasar or quark really is, the words &quot;quasar&quot; and &quot;quark&quot; are undoubtedly signs, created artificially to designate esotermic phenomena. But what happens if someone postulates that the enormous energy emitted from a quasar erupts from the word &quot;quasar&quot; itself? What if a scientific system arrives at the conclusion that the mountain emerges from the word &quot;volcano&quot;? In such a case, it will be possible to surmise that the word is the signified, while the material representation is the sign. This is actually the system presented by the Sepher Yetsira: The letter of the alphabet is the source of the planet, and not a sign by which it is designated. 

The Language of Creation and Its Grammar 
Joseph Dan, Jewish Mysticism, Vol I, Aronson, 1998, p.151  

 
Joseph Dan is rare in taking the Sepher Yetsira on its own terms, but without an understanding of the rich semantic system of the Yetsira, he is forced to look for an &quot;alternative system of signs&quot; in the divine world, which are non-semantic in nature. This raises the problem of a boundary between meaning and non-meaning.  
     The Sefer Yetzira appears to base its statements and conclusions on observation and analysis, rather than on homiletical interpretation of biblical verses and the traditions of ancients sages. Its statements are ones that can be analysed, criticized, and interpreted on their own merits, rather than in comparison to a proof-text or the truth revealed to previous generations of sages. 

The basic concepts of the Sefer Yetzira are so radically different than those of ancient Judaism that the attraction they exerted on Jewish Medieval scientists is obvious, once we successfully detach ourselves from the images introduced by eight centuries of &quot;mythical,&quot; &quot;mystical, and &quot;magical&quot; exegesis on the book.

The Sepher Yetsira is a scientific, cosmological work, not a mystical, homilectic (a la Zohar) commentary. Eight centuries of mythological, anthropomorphizing, theosophizing images must be discarded to approach the Sepher Yetsira on its own completely rational and scientific terms.  
   
   
  6.2.7. Structural Properties of the Cabbala 

A further discussion of the cabbala requires a thorough understanding of Hebrew, which we cannot supply here. What we can do, is look at the formal aspects of the cabbalistic system. An important observation is the tree structure of the autiot characters. Since the name of each character can be expanded in a manner of context free grammars, each character or aut gives rise to an endlessly repeating tree structure. 

ALEPH is constructed of 
ALEPH LAMMED PHAY 
LAMMED is constructed of 
LAMMED MEM DALLET 
MEM--MEM--MEM 
DALLET is constructed of 
DALLET LAMMED TAV 

and so on. 

Now this in itself may be nice but there is nothing new to it. We can do the same with the Greek Alpha-Beta system and form a tree, or in whatever language where the letters have full names. But we have a start that we will come back to. In the chapter on fractal character systems we will show a way to make good use of a nested character structure. Its system is somewhat different but it is following the same line of thought. 

-&gt;:FRACTAL 

A very interesting possibility should ensue when we can find a systematic means of changing the tree hidden under a character as influenced by its neighbor characters. This has not been envisioned by the cabbalists who had nothing but their unaided brains to do their symbol processing for them. (ANM:LIFE[108]) Such exploits are better done with the symbolator.  
 
What's new is the meaning: understanding each recursive letter as an abstract, generalized, biologically-structured formative pattern/process (or structural/energetic or semantic/semiotic) &quot;fundamental power of all being.&quot;   [ * ]. 

It's not the tree under the letter that changes (their recursive sturctures are unaffected). Instead, they all contribute their nested semantic structures to the whole, whose integration is the work of the formator, who stands in the center and makes the links on the appropriate levels of structuration and signification.  
Ten Sephirot Belimah. Ten and not nine. Ten and not eleven. Understand with Hhokmah. Meditate with Binah. Examine them. Delve into them and experiment with them. And the one who is there (standing) speaks to his creator and puts the maker of form in his rightful place (or, his foundation).         Suares, SY, 1:4  
The formative/symbolic meanings and recursive structures of the Hypertext Hebrew Alphabet can be explored in depth. As an introduction to qualities of our theoretical hyperlanguage, we can examine the structures of the first six letters of the alphabet.      

Recursive Expansions of the First Six Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet  

Aleph  
              
Bayt  
         
Ghimel  
            
Dalet  

Hay  
                                              
Waw  

The first six letters of the Hebrew alphabet contain three different kinds of structures, or semantic automata: two infinite repeating series, one complex (Aleph, Bayt, Ghimel, Dalet), one simple (Waw) and one non-recursive, terminating character, Hay. It is important to remember that we are dealing with biologically structured energies in different states of organization. The first four letters, while very different in meaning and action, share a common biological process in their roots: the Dalet-Lamed-Mem rhythm of controlled response (Lamed) in a resistant (Dalet) biological pattern (Mem). 

We have learned from recent research that complex structures may be produced by simple rules. Whether or not a meaningful principle of computational equivilance exists, it is interesting to contemplate the results from complex rules.  
   
With this brief introduction to the deep structure of individual letters, we can now put a few of them together and examine the consequences. The first three letters of Genesis/Bereshit,        bring thirteen into creation, including           itself. When examined in their deep structure and interrelatedness, we immediately recognize the fundamental theme of the qabala: creation is the result of the structuration of the one dual energy.  

Bara  


The central Raysh endogenously produces in existence the cosmic Sheen, breath of God. The first, exterior, Yod of outer existence supports the Bayt process, providing material containers for cosmic energy. The second, interior, Yod provided by the inner Yod of Raysh-Yod-Sheen-Yod-Noun supports the Aleph process, bringing the Intemporal into existence. This double structuration of energy, immediately evident in the expansion of the first three letters of Bereshit/Genesis, can be found in every word and verse of the first four chapters of the Bible.</text>

Mark Walker, June 29, 2002

Research Associate, Trinity College, University of Toronto

There is a specter that ought to be haunting the world, the specter of Transhumanism.
Transhumanism, I will argue, is the philosophical thesis that that we ought to employ technology in the near-term for the purpose of attempting to perfect ourselves. Even those not friendly to Transhumanism ought to pay heed, for within the lifetime of most of those alive today humanity will, in all likelihood, possess the technology to radically reengineer humans, to create new and better persons. Clearly, the philosophical, political and social ramifications of Transhumanism are staggering indeed; arguably, they are unprecedented in human history. Moreover, the fact that the technologies necessary for such experiments are imminent - most expert opinion clusters around the years 2020 to 2050 [1] means that Transhumanism ought to be on everyone's lips. It is no exaggeration to say that Transhumanism ought to be the headline news every evening on television and front page on every morning newspaper. We stand at the crucial juncture in human history. 
My aim here is to outline what I consider to be the essential core of Transhumanism, specifically; the definition I offered above contains three theses: 
1. The Technology Thesis: Within a hundred years humanity will possess the technology to reengineer Homo sapiens.
2. The Ideal Thesis: The goal in the reengineering task is to perfect ourselves.
3. The Ethical Thesis: We ought to employ technology to realize this ideal.

I will discuss each of these in turn. The exposition of Transhumanism will also reveal why one ought to be a Transhumanist.

1. Person Engineering Technologies

In this section I shall discuss the three of the more radical person engineering technologies (PETs) of relevance to Transhumanism: genetic engineering, artificial intelligence research and nanotechnology. I will concentrate on the case of using PETs to improve on human level of intelligence; although we should bear in mind that, to the extent that Transhumanists may want to perfect other properties of a person, the discussion will perforce be limited. 
Let us take as our point of departure the view of humanity from a scientific and naturalistic perspective [2]. Darwin's great conceptual innovation was to lend plausibility to the idea that we may think of biological organisms as exhibiting design without having to postulate a divine artificer. Part of Darwin's argument turned on the observation that species are not fixed types, but are evolved and evolving. Applying these insights to the topic of human wisdom or intelligence [3] we may conclude that our intelligence is not the product of the benevolent activities of some divine artificer but the result of the natural selection of random mutations. The history of our intelligence lies in a secular phylogeny, that is, with our apelike ancestors, and indeed, with even more &quot;primitive&quot; organisms. Of course this insight speaks only to the question of &quot;where have we come from?&quot; not to the question of &quot;where are we going?&quot; 
Of course, if we are concerned exclusively with the course that natural selection might take we are engaged in some serious long-range forecasting. Natural evolution typically [4] takes tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years [5]. This is not what Transhumanism is about; it is about the near-term. Let us consider first how genetic engineering will allow us to alter Homo sapiens in ways in which it would take natural selection hundreds of thousands if not millions of years to duplicate. Take as our first observation the familiar correlation between intelligence and brain size, that is, other things being equal, a larger brain correlates with greater intelligence [6]. For example, our brain is larger than that of an orangutan, and an orangutan's brain is larger than a Great Dane's. The level of intelligence among these three species follows this same progression, i.e., we are more intelligent than orangutans, and they are more intelligent than Great Danes. It seems plausible to hypothesize that the hypothetical species Homo bigheadus, with a brain volume of 2600 cc, ought to be more intelligent and have greater conceptual abilities than Homo sapiens with their measly 1300 cc. Certainly this is the sort of reasoning that is used to explain the vast difference in intelligence between humans and apes, i.e., apes (although similar in body weight) have much smaller brains. 
Technologically speaking, there does not seem to be any principled reason why we could not genetically engineer a primate with a 2600 cc brain. Thus, if the correlation between brain size and intelligence cited above holds, then it seems that there is a good probability that Homo bigheadus will be much more intelligent than humans. In other words, it seems a perfectly valid piece of naturalized speculation to investigate the following scientific hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: A primate with a brain volume of 2600 cc will exceed humans in intelligence by the same margin as humans exceed that of chimpanzees.

To put this in some perspective, a great ape with the same body size as a human would have a brain of about 400 cc in size, while an Australopithecines of human body weight projects to a brain of approximately 600 cc.
Homo sapiens of course enjoy a brain of approximately 1300 cc. If we create Homo bigheadus how intelligent might we expect them to be, given the relationship between intelligence and brain size versus the log of body weight? It is difficult to say in part because we have no interval measure for interspecies comparisons of intelligence. That is, we do not have some (recognized) scale which would allow us to state that humans are say 15 times as intelligent as an Orang but only 5 times as smart as Australopithecus robustus. At best we have some rough and ready ordinal rankings of intelligence. As noted, we may say that Orangs are more intelligent than a Great Dane, and Homo sapiens more intelligent than Orangs, with Australopithecus robustus falling somewhere in between. Nevertheless, even with mere ordinal rankings of intelligence we might guess that Homo bigheadus might eclipse us in intelligence in a very dramatic fashion indeed, e.g., we might properly expect that the difference between our intelligence and theirs would be more like the difference between human and Australopithecine intelligence, than say human and intelligence with that of Homo erectus. Again, since we have a grasp only on the ordinal intervals between intelligence it is hard to be much more precise than this. We might even suppose that this is some sort of iterative process, Homo Bigheadus creates the Homo Biggerheadus, creatures with brains 4000 cc in size, and Homo Biggerheadus creates Homo Evenbiggerheadus, and so on.
No doubt many will find the thought of such an experiment &quot;fantastic&quot; (to put it mildly). Yet incredible as it may seem, it is not a question of whether we will have the technological ability to perform an experiment along the lines suggested by this hypothesis. The only question is when will we have the ability. Consider that the basic information and techniques necessary for such an experiment are already available; it is really a matter of working through the myriad of details. There are, for instance, several methods for genetic engineering. One such technique is the microinjection procedure. Basically, DNA is injected into the developing egg of an organism; this DNA attaches itself to the chromosomes and then can be passed on genetically to succeeding generations in the usual fashion. Over fifteen years ago, researchers were able to partially correct a genetic defect in mice employing this method. The strain of mice in question suffers from reduced levels of a growth hormone that results in dwarfism. By inserting the DNA that contains information for a rat's growth hormone, the researchers were able to reverse this condition [7]. 
Since the technology necessary for genetic engineering is already available to us, the real trick is finding the appropriate genes that control the growth of the brain. This may not be that difficult. The crude map of the human genome we now possess certainly could be of some assistance. There is also evidence from our phylogenetic cousin the common chimpanzee. As is well known, there is an incredible genetic similarity between the species, e.g., King and Wilson have found that &quot;…the average [human] polypeptide is more than 99 percent identical to its chimpanzee counterpart.&quot; [8] The idea would be to discover the genes that have altered the allometric curve of the brain in humans as compared with chimps. From there it would be a relatively simple matter to manipulate them in the genome of a human zygote, and the recipe should be complete [9]. The ease in which we might create a larger brain through genetic engineering is underscored by the fairly recent discovery of homeobox genes: genes that control the development of the body plans of a larger number of organisms. For our purposes what is of interest is that there are a number of homeobox genes that that control the growth of various brain regions [10]. For example, if you want to make a larger brain in a frog embryo simply insert some RNA from the gene X-Otx2 and voilà - you have a frog embryo with a larger brain, specifically, the mid and forebrain mass is increased [11]. Homeobox genes also come in various forms of generality. Otx2 is obviously very general in its scope; in contrast, for example, Emx1 controls the growth of the isocortex (one of the two regions of the neocortex). Thus, if we believe that intelligence and wisdom might be aided by tweaking one area of the brain or another there may be just the right homeobox gene for this task. 
Of course this simplifies many, many problems. It is much like as if one had said back in 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, that landing men on the moon was merely a question of working through a myriad of details. This was of course true, but it is not to belittle all the problems and technical innovations that were required to achieve this end, e.g., problems of miniaturization. Remember vacuum tubes were still in use back in 1957! Similarly, there are a host of difficulties that would have to be solved in creating such creatures, let me just mention a couple in passing. First, there are general considerations of physiology e.g., a larger brain might require increase blood flow, which might mean increasing the size or strength of the heart. Would we have to adjust the allometric curve of the heart and other vital organs? Perhaps the skeletal structure would have to be altered in order to support the additional cranium weight. We might have to look at extending the life span of these creatures in order to allow them enough time to develop to their full potential [12]. Second, one may wonder about the sufficiency (or perhaps even necessity) of creating greater intelligence by dramatically increasing the gross brain size. It has been speculated, for example, that it is the greater development of our neocortex, as compared with other primates, that is primarily responsible for our greater intelligence, or that due consideration ought to be given to the fact that we exhibit much more hemispheric specialization of cognitive tasks. It may be that the task of attempting to create more intelligent beings ought to focus on the quality as opposed to the quantity of the brain [13]. Thus, it should be clear from what has just been said that there is really nothing so simple as &quot;the crucial genetic engineering test&quot;. There are a number of tests that we might perform depending on the relative weight we assign to these variables. For instance, one group of researchers might suppose that doubling the mass of the neocortex ought to be sufficient for testing whether we can make more intelligent creatures, while another might focus on increasing the total mass of the brain by 50%. What could reasonably be expected from such tests would probably require input from a number of diverse academic fields. Whether increasing the gross size of the brain to 2600 cc would be necessary or sufficient for a radical increase in intelligence is thus an open question. The general principle - that we might be capable of experimentally manipulating the intelligence of various creatures including humans - does seem scientifically respectable. Certainly it seems scientifically respectable to suggest that we might be able to experimentally increase the intelligence of any non-human animal. It is difficult to see why humans might be exempt from this inductive line of inductive reasoning.
How long would it take to prepare this recipe? As a conservative estimate, it would be safe to say that sometime in the twenty-first century we should posses the relevant knowledge and technology. If nothing else, it seems, that we could in fairly short order have some idea of the efficacy of such procedures by studying other species such as rats. We might, for instance, today attempt to genetically engineer a rat with a brain twice the normal size and observe how this affects its level of intelligence. Such procedures would be achievable in the short-term and provide some evidence as to what might be feasible in our own case.
Another PET is based on extrapolations from computer science. The possibility that computers might be able to out-think us has been put forward by a number of researchers; one of the most prominent is Professor Hans Moravec at Carnegie Mellon University [14]. Moravec's conjecture has two essential components: (1) an estimate of how long it will take to develop (affordable) computers with the requisite amount of computing power, and (2), an estimate of how much computing power will be necessary to simulate human intelligence. The key unit of measurement here is MIPS, a million machine instructions per second. Moravec predicts that robots capable of executing 100 million MIPS will be commercially available around 2040 and these should equal or surpass human intelligence. He claims that &quot;…mass-produced, fully educated robot scientists working diligently, cheaply, rapidly and increasingly effectively will ensure that most of what science knows in 2050 will have been discovered by our artificial progeny!&quot; [15] Presumably, the artists and philosophers etc., in 2050 will also be our artificial progeny. Moravec's estimate of how much computer power is necessary to simulate the power of the human brain relies on two quantities that have a fair degree of empirical support. One is the 0.2-gram of neural processing circuitry at the back of the human retina. This tissue is devoted to detecting edges and motion in the visual field. Moravec notes that these tissues perform about 10 million detections per second, that is, there are approximately a million image regions performing 10 detections per second. Data from experiments in robot vision suggest that 1,000 MIPS would be necessary to simulate the .02-gram of neural tissue at the back of the retina. Moravec then reasons that, since the entire human brain is 75,000 times heavier than the .02 gram of neural tissue, a computer with 75,000 times the computing power is necessary to model human intelligence. In round numbers then a computer with 100 million MIPS should be equal to humans in intelligence. It perhaps goes with out saying that Moravec's claims are contentious [16]. I do not propose to defend his estimates here, rather, I think the important point to observe is that his inductive reasoning is grounded in empirical data and as such is scientifically respectable. Moravec may be wrong (as he himself admits) that robots will usurp humans as the scientists and (presumably) philosophers and artist of the future, but it seems a conjecture that is at least worthy of our attention. 
The third PET we need to discuss is nanotechnology. Nanotechnology works from a very simple idea: we can build anything we want to if we have the right building blocks, a design schematic, and a device to put the building blocks together. Nanotechnologists argue that we can use some of the building blocks of our universe itself: atoms and molecules [17]. The schematic in this case would be the complete atomic structure of the item we would like to create. The means to assemble the atoms as specified by the schematic are miniature robots (nanobots). To see how this works, let us take a simple example. Suppose you are thirsty so you type into your computer 'water'. The computer looks up the schematic for water and of course finds H2O, at which point the computer directs the nanobots begin assembling water molecules based on this formula. The nanobots would trundle off to your atom warehouse and beginning taking out hydrogen and oxygen molecules from storage containers. When enough of these are procured and placed in your glass you will have a glass of water. This example simplifies a number of problems [18] but it does serve to illustrate the most important moral of nanotechnology: anything can be made so long as we have a supply of atoms or molecules and the right schematic. 
In terms of perfecting our intelligence there are at least a couple of ways in which nanotechnology could be utilized. One of which is to simply augment the existing human brain. Suppose we obtain the schematic for making neurons and then we instruct the nanobots to add several million neurons to your brain every day until you have a brain the same size as Homo bigheadus (obviously the nanobots would need to do something about expanding your skull) [19]. A second way is to have the nanobots reverse engineer a brain and use this information to upload a person's mind to a computer. It is generally believed, for example, that some complex but ultimately physical process in the brain stores a person's memories. By having the nanobots provide us with a detailed neural schematic of a brain we should be able to recreate these memories when we use a computer to model this atomic structure. The logical conclusion of this line of thought is that once the nanobots have completely analyzed the atomic structure of your brain and uploaded this information to a computer your essence will thereby be transferred to a computer environment [20]. 
Obviously there are a number of ways of combining these technologies and procedures: one could, for instance, imagine a genetically engineered cyborg with an AI implant which works with an interface manufactured by nanotechnology. Clearly, much more needs to be said about the feasibility of these technologies, however, the primary aim of this paper is not to review the technical aspects of this project. It is to be hoped that enough has been said to indicate that the technical expertise required by the project is imminent - or at least worthy of considering whether it is indeed imminent.
To round out our discussion of technology thesis we need to discuss its status within the overall Transhumanism theory. The first point to make in this connection is that Transhumanists consider PETs, for all practical purposes, as necessary and sufficient as the means for achieving the ideal of Transhumanism. Obviously there are other logically possible ways that the ideal endorsed by Transhumanism might be realized. Various religions have suggested that some form of prayer or worship will allow humans to move to higher cognitive levels, but this is not part of the Transhumanist thesis. Also, historically philosophers like Plato maintained that it was possible for some humans to move beyond a merely human understanding of the universe to a godlike understanding of the universe via philosophical reflection [21]. Plato's theory, in other words, is that philosophical reflection was both necessary and sufficient for moving beyond a merely human cognitive level. So while there are other logically possible means to achieve the ideal, they are not of particular relevance to Transhumanists. Why? Not to put too fine a point on it, religion [22] and the a priori conception of philosophy [23] have failed, and failed miserably, in this connection. 
The second point follows naturally from the first: the technological thesis of Transhumanism is open to empirical confirmation or refutation in a number of ways. The most straightforward way would be if it turns out that it is technologically impossible to reengineer persons. This seems exceedingly implausible given what we know about the nature of persons; but it cannot be ruled out a priori. Imagine, for example, that it turns out that the essence of a person is an immaterial soul that is beyond the reach of any technological manipulation. If this is the case then I believe that we will have to concede that Transhumanism is not viable as one of its central tenets is false. (And who knows? Perhaps in this case, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, a priori philosophy or religious practice are more viable means to pursue the ideal of perfection). 
The third point is simply to underscore the fact that the discussion here has concentrated on intelligence enhancing PETs, but similar remarks apply to other Transhumanists technologies. Human Cryogenics, for example, is the freezing the dead in the hope that future technology will allow them to be resuscitate and repaired. In this way, some Transhumanists hope to obtain immortality. Other less radical technologies are of interest to Transhumanists as well, e.g., wearable computers, artificial organs, designer drugs, etc. Ultimately, these technologies are part of the transitory stage for humans as they redevelop their very natures.
Finally, technology for Transhumanists is a means to an end; it is not the end in itself. Thus, the criticism that Transhumanists are mere technology worshippers is misplaced. As a sociological observation, it is probably true that most Transhumanists find technology intrinsically appealing and fascinating, but this does not form part of the theory of Transhumanism. Thus, for example, encouraging space exploration is sometimes mentioned as being part of the Transhumanist project and on occasion even works its way into definitions of Transhumanism [24] . Unless it can be shown that exploration of space is somehow directly connected with the project of reengineering persons, this seems to me to be a mistake [25]. The insistence that one have a certain protechnology attitude beyond achieving the ideals of Transhumanism would, in my view, be an unnecessary accretion to the theory. 

2. The Ideal of Transhumanism: Perfection

The second thesis of Transhumanism, as I have defined it, is that the telos or goal of Transhumanism is to perfect ourselves. This certainly does not agree with all suggested uses of the term. Robin Hanson, for example, defines 'Transhumanism' in a way that does not mention this point at all: &quot;Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely to change the world so much in the next century or two that our descendants will in many ways no longer be &quot;human&quot;.&quot; [26] There is no suggestion here that our ancestors will in any way be better than ourselves, only different. It is consistent with Hanson definition, for example, that our ancestors no longer resemble us because they are bacteria-like. Similarly, attempts to define Transhumanism in terms of becoming posthuman suffer the same sort of difficulty [27]. A posthuman, at least in one sense of the term, is a creature that has evolved (using technology) from humans. But unless we specify that the posthuman is an improvement in some manner then it does not help us understand the importance or viability of Transhumanism. Again, a posthuman might be a bacteria-like organism that has evolved from humans. On the other hand, if 'posthuman' means something like a being that is an improvement on human beings, then, this does not differ significantly from the present definition, since the meaning of 'posthuman', in this case, will imply the ideal thesis. 
Mitch Porter's definition seems to come closer to articulating something like the ideal thesis. &quot;Transhumanism&quot; he writes, &quot;is the doctrine that we can and should become more than human.&quot; [28] Of course if we use genetic engineering to become a chimerical creature with a human head and an elephant body then will have become &quot;more than human&quot;, at least in terms of weight. Presumably Porter means that whatever we become ought to be considered an improvement or an attempt to move towards perfection. A definition that comes closest to explicitly announcing the ideal thesis is Anders Sandberg's, he writes: &quot;Transhumanism is the philosophy that we can and should develop to higher levels, both physically, mentally and socially using rational methods.&quot; Sandberg's definition seems to indicate the idea of improving or perfecting ourselves with the suggestion that we should develop to &quot;higher levels&quot;. 
So what is it to perfect ourselves? To approach this question we must distinguish between 'type-perfection' and 'property-perfection'.

Type-Perfection: The thesis that those individuals who best realize the essential properties of the individual's type or species best exemplify the ideal of perfection. [29]

Property-Perfection: The thesis that those individuals who best realize some property or properties best exemplify the ideal of perfection.

An example may help to clarify this distinction. Let us suppose we are in charge of perfecting the intelligence of a monkey. If we do this according to the type conception of perfection then there is only so much we can do for our simian friend. We might use technology to make him better able to problem solve tasks like procuring food and mates, and how to avoid predators; but we would have to be careful not to go too far. If we perfect his intelligence too much then we are in danger of making him something other than a monkey. If we opt for the property conception of perfection then this is not a worry. Suppose we reengineer the monkey's brain to give him the linguistic capacities on par with the best of humanity, and the mathematical abilities of our best mathematicians, and the scientific abilities of our best human scientists and so on. Suppose too that we reengineer our friend to walk upright; so he can get around libraries and laboratories easier, and provide him with reengineered hands with the same dexterity of that of a human, and finally (so he can attend grad school) we remove his tail. Our efforts here, arguably, will not result in a smart monkey but a postmonkey. 
Property-perfection is the key concept for Transhumanists. Transhumanists seek not to perfect (say) intelligence within the parameters of what is possible for species Homo sapiens, but rather, they seek to perfect the property of intelligence as far as possible. Pursuing a course of property-perfection will, in all likelihood, lead to the speciation of Homo sapiens, i.e., our descendents (and perhaps even some of us) will become posthuman. As is perhaps obvious, a type-perfection of humans could never in itself lead to a speciation event, i.e., humans becoming posthumans, for by definition type perfection means perfection of an entity qua its type or species. Thus, type-perfection is logically incompatible with Transhumanism since the goal is to develop beyond the limitations of our human form. 
One consequence of this is that in general the idea of a perfect human or human perfectibility - which plays such a pivotal role historically in the perfectionist intellectual tradition [30] - is of little interest to Transhumanists for precisely the same sort of reasons that the idea of the perfect monkey is not of interest either. In both cases there is little one can do without exceeding the bounds of the species. True, most of us would be pleased to have the intellectual abilities of Plato, Mozart, and Einstein, and jump at the chance to take a pill that gave us such great (but human) abilities; but, in the grand scheme of things, this may be a very modest ambition. The intellectual abilities of a posthuman philosopher, musician or scientist may make even the celebrated geniuses of our species look apelike in comparison.
Which properties ought we to develop and attempt to perfect and in what manner? Type-perfectionists have at their disposal a natural answer to the question of which properties to perfect and to what degree, namely, those properties that are essential to a thing's nature should be perfected to the extent that they are consistent with and realize the nature of that species or type. For humans, of course, these are the properties that constitute our human nature; and these properties should be developed only in so far as they fall within the scope of being human [31]. Since, as we have said, type-perfection is logically incompatible with Transhumanism, we do not have this &quot;natural&quot; answer to fall back on.
So what should Transhumanists say to the question of which properties to develop and in what manner? I don't propose to answer this important and difficult question here in detail, rather, let me lay out somewhat schematically the sorts of considerations that might be involved. One step, and seemingly the first, would be to decide which properties of ourselves we would like to develop, which we would like to see remain unchanged, and which we might hope to eliminate. Let us take the case of intelligence again. Presumably this is a property we would wish to perfect, while selfish-drives or murderous impulses are perhaps examples of properties we may wish to eliminate altogether [32]. This then is what we might think of as the 'inventory step': deciding which properties we would like to enhance, which we would like to eliminate, and which we would like to see remain unchanged. As part of this process there is what we may think of as the 'analytic step', which asks us to consider whether the property is itself a composite of simpler properties. Thus, with our present example, we must ask whether intelligence itself is a univocal property. Some psychologists believe in something called 'general intelligence' while other see intelligence as composed of distinct faculties, e.g., Howard Garner, argues that there are eight types of intelligence, so if Garner is correct then we might have to ask which of these types of intelligence we would like to develop [33]. Then there is what we might think of as the 'vector analysis' step: in what direction do we want to develop the property, e.g., do we want to increase the mathematical computation speed, to be more efficient, or perhaps slow it down so we might savor the creative process? The 'means step&quot; requires us to cogitate question of the technological means to achieve the proposed development, for example, are we to use genetic engineering, the science of AI, or some other technology? Then there is the 'synthetic step': how is the property in question to be combined with the other properties? As we noted previously, increasing the intelligence of a Hominid by increasing its brain mass might require increasing the efficiency of the circulatory and respiratory system. The steps just listed constitute the theoretical aspect of articulating the ideal of property-perfection. Understanding the ideal will also require an experimental step. We might think, for example, that a perfect memory means never forgetting anything but then realize that it is sometimes desirable to forget. Finally, the process of perfection will require a reevaluation step as we assess the desirability of attempts at property-perfection. Specifically, this will be the form of a dialectical interplay between theory and experimentation: experiments may cause us to revise our theories about perfection, and our revised theories may lead to new experiments in perfection. 
Property-perfection, then, encourages, or at least is consistent with, any number of different experiments in obtaining the good life, or indeed the perfect life. It may be that, ultimately, one unique set of properties instantiated in one particular way proves superior to all others. (God was often said to be the paragon of such a being). In which case, it might be that all posthumans after a certain amount of experimentation tend to freely gravitate towards this one superior form. On the other hand, it may that different combinations of properties make for equally good lives and it is simply a matter of personal preference which to adopt. Obviously, from our present intellectual vantage point we do not know which is the case. Property-perfection, to its credit, is consistent with either scenario.
One final reason to prefer property-perfection is that it may be that the most desirable sorts of properties are not in our possession, even in a protean form. Think again of our simian friend. Let us suppose, as many in fact believe, that monkeys do not possess a language. Obviously, one property that they do not possess then is the capacity for language. Yet, millions of years of &quot;experimentation&quot; in our evolutionary history have developed the property of language capacity in humans. The evolutionary precedent provides some hope that if there are other desirable properties which we do not possess-suppose for example it is possible for creatures of a certain intelligence to possess a hyperlanguage [34], which is as sophisticated in comparison to languages as languages are to simian protolanguages - our experiments may lead to such fortuitous discoveries. The connection with type and property-perfection is fairly straightforward: if we were concerned exclusively with type-perfection then we could not seek to develop properties that do not belong to our type; just as if we were to type-perfect a monkey it would be in appropriate to add the capacity for language (of the complexity of humans) for then our monkey would no longer be a monkey but a postmonkey. On the other hand, if we were in the process of property-perfecting the intelligence of a monkey, then, adding something like linguistic capacity is much to the point. We may discover that the ideal of perfection, properly understood, is not so much about becoming more of what we are, but becoming what we are not. 
No doubt the mere mention of 'perfection' will raise the hackles of some. I believe that I have removed one of the most offensive applications of this term: that we should attempt to become perfect human types. This view is sometimes associated with political ideologies that do not even merit mentioning. By appealing to property-perfection we move well beyond the unpleasantness of this association. However, it still may be wondered why our theory should appeal to something as &quot;rigid&quot; and &quot;puritanical&quot; sounding as 'perfection'. Perhaps, it might be thought, we should be content with simply stating that the goal is to improve ourselves. Admittedly there is not a lot of difference between these different ways of stating the goal of transhumanism, at least in the short-term. For it looks as though if our goal is to perfect ourselves, this will be a long and iterative process. The first iteration of this process may lead us to improving ourselves, but it is not likely to terminate in anything like perfection. Take again the case of intelligence: I believe that we have the technology to attempt to improve upon the level of human intelligence but I don't think we are close to being able to perfect intelligence - for any number of reasons - although perhaps our descendents will realize this task. One reason to use the term 'perfection' rather than merely 'improvement' is that it clarifies the axiological structure: 'perfection' is an end in itself. To say that our goal is merely to 'improve humans' is to invite the questions of 'how far?' and 'to what end?' I believe when we spell-out our answers to these questions we will be lead back to property-perfectionism. For the answer to the question how far we should improve ourselves is that we should develop properties of ourselves in the manner described above, i.e., to the extent that they contribute to the type of beings that we would like to be. We are forced to answer the second question for to leave this it unanswered could potentially land transhumanists in the company of those who want to improve humans to (say) make them better servants of some evil regime. Obviously this is not what Transhumanism is about. Any improvement in ourselves is intended for its own sake, i.e., self-improvement is taken as an end in itself. Of course when we combine these answers - that improvement is directed to the task of developing ourselves as far as we can towards being the type of beings that we would like to be, and that this improvement is not intended to serve some other purpose but is an end in itself - we are landed right back into property-perfectionism. 
It might be wondered whether property-perfection, thus construed, is too weak to provide any constraint on the application of PETs. After all, to say that we ought to experiment with any number of combinations and permutations of properties seems to be saying, &quot;Anything goes&quot;. To respond to this let me close this section by considering some non-Transhumanist application of PETs. Take the example of 'Devolutionists' (pace the great band Devo) who argue as follows: &quot;Creatures with human (or better) intelligence pose too great a risk to their own survival and the survival of other life forms. Therefore, what humanity should do is use genetic engineering to remake ourselves, as more like our apelike ancestors, i.e., we ought to refashion ourselves along the lines of Homo erectus or one of the Australopithecines.&quot; According to the devolutionist's manifesto no more humans will be born. Parents who want offspring will raise genetically modified apelike children. The hope is that, in the end, as the last of humanity dies off, there will be no creatures intelligent enough to use the dangerous technology that we have created. Our apelike descendents will return to foraging on the plains and in the forests. Our cities will be abandoned and eventually be overgrown as nature reclaims her dominion. 
The Devolutionist's position looks, prima facie, like a Transhumanist position, albeit a nonstandard one. The Devolutionists, after all, advocate the use of PETs and the creation of posthumans (specifically, apelike posthumans). One might think that it is the (ultimate) anti-technological stance that prohibits them from joining the ranks of Transhumanists. However, as we noted in section 2, Transhumanists do not necessarily think that technology is an end in itself. In any event, I think that concentrating on the technology aspect of the Devolutionist's program does not get to the heart of the matter, namely: they have a fundamentally different goal from that of Transhumanists: Devolutionists are concerned to promote merely the continued existence of life on this planet whereas Transhumanists are concerned with the process of the perfection of posthuman life forms (and thus a fortiori, with the continued existence of at least some life). It is the absence of concern for the improvement or perfection that prohibits the Devolutionists from joining the ranks of Transhumanists. Similar remarks apply to say those - let us call them the 'Heracliteans' - who might advocate using PETs simply because they want to promote change itself. The Heracliteans' do not specify, however, that change be towards perfection. As we noted above, Transhumanists also sharply diverge from those who might seek to use PETs to improve humans with the view to subordinating of one group of people by another. Such ambitions are logically incompatible with the goal of Transhumanism. 
To summarize, defining Transhumanism in terms of the goal of perfection provides a clear and comprehensible formulation of the goal of Transhumanism. It articulates the somewhat vague proposals that we ought to become &quot;more than human&quot; or &quot;move to higher levels&quot;. It assists in distinguishing Transhumanism from other proposals for the use of PETs and it helps to explain what it is that Transhumanists are struggling for. 

3. The Imperative to Perfect Ourselves

The third and final thesis of Transhumanism is the claim that we ought to attempt to perfect ourselves. This idea is captured in two of the definitions cited above. Porter, recall, says, &quot;Transhumanism is the doctrine that we can and should become more than human&quot;. Sandberg says that we &quot;can and should develop higher levels, both physically, mentally, and socially.&quot; The use of 'should' in these definitions is, I believe, intended to have moral force. Robin Hanson's definition, &quot;Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely to change the world so much in the next century or two that our descendants will in many ways no longer be &quot;human&quot;&quot;, does not contain any normative elements, rather it is entirely descriptive, (or more precisely, predictive). How plausible is this as a definition? Suppose one believed that it is true that there is a strong probability (but not a certainty) that in the next century or two technologies will likely change the world so many of our descendents will in many ways no longer be &quot;human&quot;; but that one thinks this will be a disaster; and strains every nerve (as Aristotle says) of one's being to work against this future, even while acknowledging that the probabilities are not favorable. It seems that on Hanson's definition this person ought to be considered a Transhumanist. In contrast, reflect on someone who thinks that the probability of a future where technology is used to perfect our ancestors (or ourselves) is extremely unlikely, but nevertheless believes that this is the best possible future and strains every nerve to bring this future about. This person would seem not to be a Transhumanist according to Hanson's definition. This result seems strange. When we think of other 'isms' like 'socialism' or 'capitalism' it is not agreement upon the likelihood that these projects will succeed that binds their adherents, but the fact that they believe that the project is of positive value and seek to promote the project. The lesson to be drawn here is that it is not the claim that humans will succeed in applying PETS, but that they ought to, which best characterizes Transhumanism. 
One of the issues Transhumanists must consider as they develop accounts of their ethical commitments is the scope to which the ethical imperative applies. One of the weakest forms of the imperative is to say that one ought to attempt to attempt to employ technology for the purpose of attempting to perfection only if one chooses to adopt the ideal thesis. This is much like the circumstance of a violinist whose snooze alarm has gone off for the third time and says to herself, &quot;I ought to get up and practice the violin&quot;. Given her choice to pursue perfection in violin playing we can make sense of her claim. She is not saying that this is in some sense a duty that all of humanity shares, but only those like herself who have chosen to pursue a certain goal in a certain way. For practical purposes this is much the same as that individuals have the right to opt for a Transhumanist future for themselves. The parallel follows from the fact that rights may be invoke or waived at the discretion of the individual and that rights define in part the domain of ethical conduct, e.g., the right to an abortion does not mean that one must have an abortion, one may waive this right; and it would not make sense to say that one has the right to some immoral activity like murder. Thus, to say that individuals have the right to a Transhumanist future means that they may, at their discretion, invoke or waive the claim to this future for themselves and that this future is not in itself an immoral activity. 
One of the broadest forms of the ethical imperative that might be of interest is to the position that asserts that it applies to all of humanity, i.e., the 'we' of &quot;we ought to use technology to perfect ourselves&quot; is an imperative that enjoins all of humanity to strive to for self-perfection [35]. This might strike some as parochial at best, and verging on totalitarian at worst. This may be so, but it may not be quite so obvious as it first appears. It certainly does not follow from the broad scope of the imperative that any political or moral sanctions ought to be invoked against those individuals that do not strive for a Transhumanist future - just as presently we might feel that it is an ethical failure on the part of individuals who do not develop or perfect their talents, but we do not invoke political or moral sanctions against individuals. Imagine some brilliant young mathematician decides to give up mathematics for a life of drinking and generally carousing. Here we might be inclined to say that she ought not to waste her life in this way, i.e., we may feel that this choice marks an ethical failure on her part, even though we would not be inclined to incarcerate her for her slothful ways. Obviously, the scope of ethical imperative is something that Transhumanists must investigate. This much seems at least certain: Transhumanism is committed to at least to the weaker thesis that it is not immoral for some individuals to use PETs to pursue their own perfection.
We have examined some possible answers to the question of to whom the ethical imperative is intended to apply to; we should consider two sorts of objections to the Transhumanist's imperative: principled objections and specific objections. By 'specific objections' I mean considerations that say that we ought not to employ PETs in the near-term but leave open the possibility that we might be ethically justified in doing so in the distant future. By 'principled objection' I intend the thesis that it is wrong always and everywhere to employ PETs. An example might help us differentiate these two. Suppose in five hundred years our sun unexpectedly starts to cool down and it is determined that life on earth will be extinct unless something drastic - like moving the earth closer to the sun - can be done. However, any proposed technological fix is beyond the capabilities of humans. The most promising course of action is to use PETs to attempt to create beings smarter than humans to see if they can fathom some means to save the planet from certain destruction. Would it be wrong in this instance to apply PETs? Someone who had raised principled objections to Transhumanism would have to say yes. On the other hand, it is quite consistent with the position of those who raise merely specific objections to say that circumstances dictate that we ought to use PETs now. Given that one accepts the claim of the 'earth is near death' (END) scenario, it is hard to see what the objection to Transhumanism could be in this circumstance. Not only is the survival of humanity at stake, but of all life on earth. Perhaps the most plausible position would be one that attempted to demonstrate the unethicalness of Transhumanism follows from consideration of some basic moral principles of an ethical system. What I propose to do then is consider this thought in light of two well-known ethical systems: Utilitarianism and Deontology. I shall argue that rather than demonstrating the unethicalness of Transhumanism, they may in fact imply (other things being equal) the ethical imperative of Transhumanism. My argument is based on a simple point: PETs may allow us to create more ethical persons, which seems a clear case of moral progress. In any event, let us consider the principled objection in light of the two ethical theories mentioned.
Utilitarianism says to always act so as to promote the greatest happiness or pleasure for all. Can Utilitarianism serve as the foundation for a principled ethical objection to Transhumanism? If we are considering principled objections Transhumanism the question for Utilitarianism resolves to the question of whether pursuing Transhumanism will always and everywhere fail to increase the total happiness or pleasure of the relevant class of individuals [36]. However, in at least some circumstances, such as the END scenario, Transhumanism looks like the most promising means to increase the total happiness. Since we know that the long-term consequence of the END state of affairs is that there will be no happiness or pleasure, the only sort of objection a Utilitarian could raise to Transhumanism under these circumstances is that Transhumanism could only bring about great suffering and little happiness. But of course we have no reason to suppose that this is the case. Indeed, we have reason to suppose that PETs could lead to much greater total happiness. Even with essentially unaltered humans the application of technology might allow for an increase in the total happiness or pleasure of humanity, e.g., pharmaceuticals, or electrical stimulation of the pleasure centers of the brain. PETs offer the potential of a much larger reward. Consider that the range and depths of pleasure or happiness that a human can experience as compared with say a mouse is enormous. Both humans and mice take pleasure in some eating and mating experiences, but there is a whole world of pleasures beyond the experience of mice: reading a good book, creating a work of art, playing chess, etc., etc., PETs introduce the possibility that there may be whole worlds of pleasure that our beyond our cognitive purview, just as there are many pleasure we experience that our beyond that of mice. One way in which we might perfect ourselves, then, is to make able to better experience deeper pleasures and sources of happiness. Far from constituting a principled objection to Transhumanism, then, it may be that Utilitarianism actually constitutes a promising means to support the ethical imperative of Transhumanism. 
Deontology might look like a natural place to resist Transhumanism for it does not evaluate all moral actions in terms of their consequences. Perhaps the easiest way to think of this theory is negatively: it says that judgments of moral right or wrong are (at least partly) independent of our evaluation of the consequences of those actions. Take a crude example. What should you say when Aunt Martha asks how you like her new green hat? A Utilitarian perhaps might say that you ought to tell a little &quot;white lie&quot; and tell her that the hat is beautiful. The little lie does no appreciable harm and makes Aunt Martha happy, thus, in keeping with Utilitarianism; your action increases the total happiness of the universe. A Deontologist might argue that even though telling her the truth - that the hat is an affront to all good taste - will hurt her feelings (i.e., lead to a bad consequence) this cannot over ride our obligation not to lie. Similarly, a Deontologist might argue that despite all the good consequences that might ensue from implementing PETs, we have a duty not to use PETs. Thus, given that the Deontologists accept the claim that we ought not to use PETs, they can quite consistently admit the points made against the Utilitarian, i.e., Deontologists can admit that by employing PETs we might avoid the fate suggested by the END scenario, and that it may well be that PETs may allow us to explore entire realms of pleasure or happiness unavailable to unaltered humans. For, as we have said, the Deontologist can claim that such positive consequences cannot override our duty not to employ PETs. 
We have said that this seems to be a consistent position for a Deontologist to hold, but this is (obviously) not to say that it is justified or justifiable. So we must ask what is the basis for the judgment that we have a duty not to use PETs? Certainly there might be a good prima facie case for this if the idea was to apply this technology to people against their will. Let us then restrict the idea of using PETs only on rational, fully informed, consenting adults. What considerations could a Deontologist then raise against this proposal? Such a procedures do not seem to violate the strictures laid out by Immanuel Kant, the most famous deontologist. The application of PETs does not seem to violate his famous categorical imperative: treat others as ends rather than means [37]. For again we are not imagining that these procedures are being applied against an individual's will, so it is not that Transhumanists are urging that we treat people as mere means. In fact, there is an argument that says that not only is Deontology compatible with Transhumanism but that Deontology actually implies Transhumanism. This argument starts with the premise that we have a duty to increase the scope of where we might ethically act, i.e., it is our duty to increase the realm of our duties. Think for example of a drunk who says that he was not under any obligation to save the drowning child because he was too inebriated. In a sense he is of course right. If we say that he ought to have saved the child this implies that he can save the child. His defense is that he could not save the child; hence, it could not be the case that he ought to save the child. Of course we might not be so willing to let him off the ethical hook. We may think that he has a duty not to be so incapacitated in the first place. Similarly, one might think that as individuals we are not under any obligation to help all the starving children of the world, since we cannot help all of them it is false to say that we ought to help all of them. But what if the application of PETs meant that one could help all of them or at least a lot more of them? Would we have a duty to then to use PETs on ourselves? Some Transhumanists may think so. If this is the case then the claim, that we are not being obligated to reduce a lot of the suffering of this world because we cannot, will ring hallow, just as the drunk's claim to diminished obligation is true but marks a moral failure on his part. In any event, if we have a duty to increase the scope of the realm where we act morally, and PETs are the best way to realize this end, then it follows that we have a duty to pursue PETs.
Obviously a lot more needs to be said about the relation between general ethical theories and the ethical judgments of Transhumanists. My limited ambition here is simply to indicate that a principled objection based on the ethical theories of Utilitarianism or Deontology does not look particularly promising.
Let us turn now to the question of specific objections to Transhumanism. As indicated above, the basic thought is that the inherent dangers of employing PETs, at least at this stage of our understanding of these emerging technologies, means that we should postpone their application for the foreseeable future. Let us call those who advocate this position the 'Moratoriumists'. The Moratoriumists do not say that we should use PETs in the future; rather, they are agnostic on this question. Their position, then, is that humanity simply does not possess sufficient wisdom presently to use PETs. Whether humanity will enjoy sufficient wisdom in a 100, or a 1000 or 10,000 years is not for us to say today. 
On first inspection, the Moratoriumists' position seems to have prudence and ethics on its side. They can quite consistently admit that much good might come from the application of PETs, but so too might enormous amounts of evil. Prudence and ethics seem to advise us to postpone the use of this technology so that we have time to study it. To do otherwise would seem reckless and, indeed, immoral.
The plausibility of the Moratoriumists' thinking, I believe, stems from paying insufficient attention to the details of different possible future histories. Let me describe briefly three quite different developments. The 'Frozen' future scenario is where all technological progress is stopped. This point is worth underscoring: with in the Frozen future we must imagine not only basic research into PETs being banned, but all technological research is prohibited. Thus, if it were instituted today, the world would be no more technologically advanced in the year 2101 than it is in 2001. The Transhumanists' future is of course where PET is pursued and implemented. Finally, there is the 'Steady-As-She-Goes future' (SASG) that allows for a comparatively unrestricted development of nonPET but severally curtails and regulates PET. The SASG future of course describes the policy of most of the developed world. In the U.S., for example, there is almost no public awareness of the potential dangers of nanotechnology but even (merely) therapeutic PETs like those based on stem cell research cause a huge public outcry. 
Let us ask which of these possible future histories is consistent with the stated goal of the Moratoriumists, which is to avoid a technological disaster. Clearly not the Transhumanist future, for near-term deployment of PETs is what specifically defines the opposition between Transhumanists and Moratoriumists. The Frozen future looks consistent with the Moratoriumists position; after all, one way to stop the development of PET is to ban all technological research. Obviously the feasibility and desirability of the Frozen future makes this scenario quite unpalatable. A worldwide ban on technological improvement would likely need to be enforced by a tremendous amount of military force, for no doubt it would meet resistance from any number of quarters, e.g., it conflicts with the goals of any number of state, business, scientific and technological organizations. The sorts of draconian measures that would be necessary to institute this future may well be worse than the sorts of evils that it is designed to avoid. Certainly forcing the idea of a Frozen future on large parts of an unwilling humanity has the potential for triggering a world war. 
Presumably most Moratoriumists would be tempted by the SASG future. The thinking, no doubt, is that such a policy does not require the sorts of draconian measures necessitated by the Frozen future option, yet it will provide us with protection from technological disaster. By continuing the policy of banning or severally limiting the exploration of PET we avoid the risks of technology spawning uncontrollable postmonsters [38]. However, there are a number of problems with the thinking that says that the SASG policy will achieve what the Moratoriumists hope for.
First, and perhaps, foremost, the potential for technological disaster from the development of nonPETs may be greater than that of PET, e.g., the chance that all human life will be wiped-out by an accidental or purposeful deployment of nanotechnology (designed for nonPET purposes) are not negligible and may be quite high. If this is the case then it may be that the SASG policy does not fulfill its stated purpose of significantly reducing the possibility of harm, in which case it may be that Moratoriumists are forced to either adopt the Frozen future option, or renounce their position and side with Transhumanists who believe that wiser creatures than humans might have a better chance of avoiding disaster. 
Second there is the proliferation problem. Even if no more basic research in say genetic engineering were to occur throughout the entire world, there is, as I argued above, sufficient information now to attempt to genetically reengineer persons. There is every reason to suppose that this knowledge will tend to proliferate overtime. What this means is that the present state of affairs where because of their hegemony Western governments control this technology is not likely to last long. As non-Western countries gain access to this technology the same sorts of problems that the Frozen future faces must be faced by the SASG policy, how can these technologies be controlled and surveyed on a global basis? 
Third, the line between PETs and nonPETs is blurry and will continue to be eroded over time. This sort of problem is familiar enough already. One of the problems with selling nuclear energy equipment to is that the same technology will provide a basis from which to construct a nuclear weapons program. The same problem is inherent in the three PETs we discussed in section 1: AI research, genetics and nanotechnology have a number of nonPET applications, yet, these same developments may be quite easily turned to person engineering.
What these considerations show is that the SASG policy is not likely to satisfy the objectives of the Moratoriumists. The SASG policy might succee</text>

== The answers are next to the excercises ( on same line! ) ==

Hola,

Just a quick comment.

Throughout this page there are excercises.  

At the bottom of the page are the answers.  '''BUT''' also on the same line as each question is the answer.

If we are truley trying to teach, and are asking questions, should we not remove the answers that live on the line as the question?
Afterall , the user can check at the bottom of the page their answer anyway.. So having it next to the question, means they cannot answer it, as they've
already read the answer!

Just a thought..

==Hooked on Mnemonics==
I'm taking first-year Spanish, I've made up mnemonics for the chapter we're now learning. You can download it from http://www.casafuturatech.com/Personal/MnemonicsCh6.doc, feel free to add them to this Wikibook. I'll try to make up these sheets for the other chapters we've learned (those mnemonics are now scribbled in the margins of my textbook).--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 02:08, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Suggestion of merging in Spanish ==
Both books have the same topic and the same purpose. I do not find any incompatibility between them. [[User:Akhram|Akhram]] ([[User talk:Akhram|talk]]) 11:27, 25 April 2008 (UTC).
=== We should not merge these two books as both have some different style of approach to their purpose. This book has a more indivualistic and a Maverick style so it should not be merged with the other book on learning Spanish. Because it has its own charm and the other one has its own charm

== Guinea pigs/commenters ==

If you offer your opinion or make yourself a guinea pig for the method, credit yourself here.

?: �Hola! �Consider me a guinea pig! -KKS

?: Orale mi raza, I am a student as well as a teacher! Hope this page will continue to grow. Viva espana!

?: I want this page to grow. Somebody teach me spanish!!! Come on...   - Peter Pawan, Noob.

?: ¡El español es fresco! Great page! I now have an weird image of Zorro the fox taking of with some chicas stuck in my head. Good work!

?: Keep working on this, please. Thx for doing it. - trent, guinea pig

?: I think that the best way to learn Spanish is to first read the Spansh alphabet and their pronunciation. But there is no need to learn too much about how the vowels sound and what are the exceptions to the rules etc. The next step is to download a nice interesting book in english that you have already read. Copy one sentence at a time from the english book and put it in google's language translator [http://translate.google.co.in/#].(Google language translator page as retrieved on September 30, 2009) Now you can easily analyse each and every word and each and every phrase since you already know the words of that English book. This will seem to take time but it will give you solid foundation in Spanish. Because i am from India and have just started to learn Spanish a few days ago. This method seems to work for me. Earlier i tried reading the Spanish grammar books and reading elementary Spanish reading books which have stories for children or tried to copy the sentences from blogs of common Spanish people and tried to translate those sentences through google's language translator but the problem with this was that i couldnt find any blogs which were either too plain and boring or if they were interesting then they were too short and didn't form any coherent story. The elementary Spanish stories also proved to be too uninetersting. The problem with grammar books was that till the time i would learn the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; rule i would forget the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; rule in Spanish grammar. So i feel translating ineteresting English stories or blogs or news reports in google's language translator is the best method for Español newbies like me. after i have analysed one or two books i will download a grammar book from gutenberg website [http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page] (Project Gutenberg page as retrieved on September 30, 2009) and learn the Spanish grammar so as to make my foundation even stronger.

?: One method I found effective was buying the same book in English and Spanish. Compare the two version and have a translator handy for word translations. One reason I wouldn't suggest getting an e-book and translating it all to Spanish is that Google Translate tends to have too many errors with full sentences/paragraphs. If you do need to translate full sentences I'd suggest the paralink translator [http://translation2.paralink.com/] which I've noticed to be more accurate than Google at times.

?: Thanks to the contributers for a great reference. Just a note on lesson 5. It is suggested that:
&quot;The dress for girl words is &quot;la.&quot; (Yes, very feminine sounding.)&quot; 
'Dress' is a masculine word in Spanish (vestido) so could be slightly confusing!

== This is terrible ==

As little reference should be made to the learner's language unless there is some cause to call attention to something in the learner's native language. If anything I would start with Spanish nouns under pictures -- el perro a la playa under a picture of a dog at the beach explains far more than does someone trying to find a few English words to suggest ways in which to remember that &quot;el perro&quot; is a dog.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The primary reason why generation after generation of physicists keep adhering to the mystical Copenhagen interpretation is that textbooks keep parroting the same old confusing interpretations and examples! The relative state interpretation is much cleaner and tells us that it's not measurement which plays the crucial role but entanglement with the environment.

:Perhaps, but Copenhagen is the textbook standard. Advocating any of the other interpretations is liable to be contentious. (Relative state is onr option among many, and not onviously the best.) In an introductry work, such as this, it's best to stick to the standard for the main text, relegating the plethora of interpretations, and other philosophical issues, to a single chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article confuses probability, the wave function and Bayesianism. The Copenhagen interpretation lends itself to such mixups. The proper way to go about expressing our ignorance of the state is to use density states, not state vectors. But in that case, the whole line of reasoning in the article falls apart!


:But the conclusions are correct, which is what really matters Symmetry implies conservation, and vice versa.
:The argument could easily be made rigorous, in any interpretation, but the machinery needed for full rigor would be inappropriate here, and selecting a interpretation other than the Copenhagen might be a little contentious for an introductry text.
:What really matters here is making the connection between symmetry and conservation feel plausible, which this chapter does. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]</text>

Open chords tend to sound &quot;richer&quot; than corresponding barre chords due to the fact that open strings resonate freely without any hindrance. An open chord is any chord that has one or more strings sounded without being fretted. Guitarists tend to use this name to refer to the chords that contain open strings that are played in the first position (first four frets).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Certain elements, like copper in our discussion on atoms, have their valence electrons held weakly in their outer orbit. By supplying energy to the material (one way would be to heat it), we can make the electrons move randomly from one atom to the next. We could also attach a negative source of energy that repels the electrons and attach at the other end a positive source that would attract the electrons. This would force the electrons to move from the negative end to the positive end. We call that net movement of electrons 'electric current'. Substances that have this ability are known as conductors, and most metals are conductors of electrons. 

Insulators, on the other hand, have their valence electrons bound tightly to the nucleus of the atom. They will not, under normal circumstances, allow the electrons to move easily by supplying energy to the material. However, note that by supplying enough energy (like a lightning strike) we can force even tightly held electrons to move. 

Common insulators are porcelain, rubber, glass, and plastic. Be cautious with plastics however, some of them can be very good conductors and it is not easy to tell one from another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Gaussian_differences.svg|thumb|alt=Two examples of how the means of two distributions may be different, leading to two different statistical hypotheses|Equal distributions, but different means.]]

There are many different tests for the many different kinds of data. A way to get started is to understand what kind of data you have. Are the variables quantitative or qualitative? Certain tests are for certain types of data depending on the size, distribution or scale. Also, it is important to understand how samples of data can differ. The 3 primary characteristics of quantitative data are: central tendency, spread, and shape. 

When most people &quot;test&quot; quantitative data, they tend to do tests for central tendency. Why? Well, let's say you had 2 sets of data and you wanted to see if they were different from each other. One way to test this would be to test to see if their central tendency (their means for example) differ. 

Imagine two symmetric, bell shaped curves with a vertical line drawn directly in the middle of each, as shown here. If one sample was a lot different than another (a lot higher in values,etc.) then the means would be different typically. So when testing to see if two samples are different, usually two means are compared. 

Two medians (another measure of central tendency) can be compared also. Or perhaps one wishes to test two samples to see if they have the same spread or variation. Because statistics of central tendency, spread, etc. follow different distributions - different testing procedures must be followed and utilized.

In the end, most folks summarize the result of a hypothesis test into one particular value - the p-value. If the p-value is smaller than the level of significance (usually &lt;math&gt;\alpha=5%&lt;/math&gt;, but even lower in other fields of science i.e. Medicine) then you reject the null-hypothesis, but this does not mean you accept the alternative hypothesis. The p-value is essentially the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed. If the p-value is greater than the level of significance you fail to reject the null-hypothesis, but this does not mean that the null-hypothesis is correct.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creating Your Own World==
[[Image:Sample conworld.jpg|frame|right|A rendered conworld, as would be seen from space by an observer.]]
''Conworld'' is a shortened form of ''constructed world''.  Thus, &quot;conworlding&quot; is '''world constructing''', the art of creating entire fantasy worlds out of your fertile imagination.  The ideal conworld is one with depth, consistency, and beauty, which is why Tolkien's Middle-earth is often held as the best existing example of a conworld.  But conworlds are usually as beautiful as they are difficult to make.

Conworlding is a many-faceted process, and can be divided into a large number of sub-fields, each of them with its own enthusiasts. For example, con'''lang'''ers are people who like to make their own languages (known as ''conlangs'', short for constructed languages). Con'''map'''pers like to draw maps of fantasy worlds. Con'''sports''' enthusiasts dream up games that might be enjoyed in a fantasy world. In general, the prefix &quot;con-&quot; in front of any real-world field turns it into its conworlding counterpart: conmusic, conart, conpoetry, conhistory, consocieties, conreligions, conphilosophies... the list goes on. Name any area of study, and chances are that a conworlder has dabbled in it already!

Many people have had conworlding ideas before: a sketched map, a drawing of an outlandish race, or a simple secret language. At this point budding conworlders ask: &quot;Now what?&quot; So I have a map &amp;mdash; How do I decide where the mountains go? How do I make the language sound cooler and less boring? How do I make up impressive mythologies? Can I create music that doesn't sound like any sort of music on earth?

{{Wikipedia|Worldbuilding}}
It might seem that for really thorough answers to those questions &amp;mdash; if you don't care how much time or effort it takes to get them &amp;mdash; you would want to research the actual branches of science that deal with those things:  geology, linguistics, anthropology, music theory, etc.  Doing it that way could take an enormous amount of time and effort, though.  These are all huge subjects, and the things about them that are of most interest for conworlding may not be the things that are of most interest to specialists in those fields.  Details that would be of great value to you may be buried in a sea of details.  High-level insights of the sort you need for conworlding may be entirely absent from the literature of the subject, because the sorts of alternative situations that matter to a conworlder may not be what experts in the subject spend their time on.

What you need is a guidebook, not to the whole subject, but to the things about the subject that especially matter for conworlding.  That's where this series of books comes in.  We'll tell you what you need to know for conworlding, skipping over the superficial tourist traps, and including the really interesting sights that aren't on the standard tour.

So pick an area that interests you, and start creating!

'''Conlang'''ing is the art of creating languages.  People create languages — conlangs — for all sorts of reasons: practical, theoretical, and artistic.  This book will show you how.  There are three parts, each aimed at a different level of experience; they are intended to be read in order, but more proficient readers may skip earlier sections.
* The '''Beginner''' level takes you through the steps of creating a conlang, without a lot of technical details or technical terms.  With the help of this level, you can create an interesting conlang that doesn't accidentally copy the sound and feel of your native language.
* The '''Intermediate''' level takes you through the parts of a language, avoiding really esoteric technical details and terms, but providing a systematic working knowledge of the building blocks from which conlangs are made.  With the help of this level, you can create conlangs with added depth.
* The '''Advanced''' level explores language features and techniques that can give a conlang extra flair.  With the help of this level, you can create conlangs that are sophisticated, exotic, or even downright alien.{{clr}}&amp;nbsp;

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions related to conlanging.

== What's a &quot;Language&quot;? ==

There are many ways that people communicate with each other, but we don't usually call all of them &quot;language&quot;.  So presumably, any definition of the word should be somewhat selective.

When ''linguists'' talk about language, they usually refer to communication that uses very specific parts of the brain (the Broca's and Wernicke's areas), and that has, as a result, some very peculiar characteristics that may be due to the architecture of those areas.  For example:

# '''Languages can be learned &quot;natively&quot;.'''  As children, we learned '''spoken''' languages from our parents and friends, without any need for formal instruction.  You can't say this about arithmetic or even written language &amp;mdash; those had to be learned consciously, either by having someone '''teach''' you, or, at least, through some conscious, rigorous study on your own.  This is also the difference between a language you actually speak and a language you took in school &amp;mdash; the latter you had to memorize and so forth, so you probably aren't that fluent in it; the former you soaked up, so you speak it natively.
# '''Languages have rules.'''  No, we're not just talking about the rules you learned in English class, and hated.  (Trust us, we hated those too.)  Every language has intricate, complicated rules that are coded right into our brains when we learn it.  Most of the time, we don't even realize we're following them.
# '''Languages use words.'''  Yeah duh, you say.  But think about it this way &amp;mdash; when someone says &quot;bird&quot;, there's nothing in their mouth, on the &quot;b&quot;, or the &quot;ir&quot;, or the &quot;d&quot;, that's got anything to do with a bird.  But it means bird anyway.  That's the power of words in a language, since words can '''abstractly''' represent things without actually ''looking or sounding'' like those things.  (Of course there are words that break this rule, like &quot;splash&quot; and &quot;crash&quot;, but the point is, not ALL words have to be like that.)

If we follow all of the above rules, then there are just two or three basic sorts of languages in the world &amp;mdash; '''spoken languages''', like English or French or German (it doesn't matter if they're sometimes represented in writing); '''sign languages''', like American Sign Language; and, to some extent, '''written languages'''.  Encodings, like Morse code, Semaphore, etc., aren't language in themselves, although they can be used to directly ''represent'' language.

The status of written language is a bit complicated.  Writing is often treated as just a representation of spoken language, in which case it's an encoding and not language in itself.  There exist conlangs that are purely written, though, with no spoken form at all, like [http://dedalvs.conlang.org/x/main.html X]; these clearly aren't encodings of something else.  They might fail the test of being learnable natively &amp;mdash; but most conlangs are never learned natively by anyone (the biggest exception being Esperanto, with perhaps a thousand native speakers), so whether most conlangs ''could'' be learned natively is already a matter for speculation.

When a spoken language has an extensive literary tradition, the spoken form of the language tends to change faster than the written form, so that after a while the language has two different '''registers''' &amp;mdash; a formal (or &quot;literary&quot;) register and an informal (or &quot;vulgar&quot;) register.  This effect is called {{sec link auto|w|diglossia|diglossia|padlock=no}}.  The different registers aren't ''usually'' considered separate languages as such; but since, for example, written English is often the common language shared by native speakers of English and American Sign Language, some have suggested that perhaps written English should be considered distinct from both.  That would mean that if you both speak and write English, you're bilingual.

Also, when any encoding is used intensively for direct communication, rather than just as a transcription of speech, the encoding tends to develop idioms of its own that don't come from the language it supposedly represents.  In Morse code, for example, the &quot;abbreviation&quot; for laughter is HI, because of how it sounds ''in Morse code'' (not because of how the represented letters sound in spoken language):&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|dit-dit-dit-dit&amp;nbsp; dit-dit}}.  That doesn't make Morse code a language, but it's one small step in that direction.  Written languages may develop small flourishes like that as well, like {{sec link auto|w|emoticons|emoticons|padlock=no}}.

Other forms of communication, like traffic signs, hand gestures (that are not structured signing), dogs barking, bees dancing (even assuming that is communication, which is debated), etc. are not languages, in the linguists' sense.

== Are there simple and complicated languages? ==

Yes — but probably not in the way most people think.

Some languages have been written down for a long time, have lots of literature and poetry to go with them, and have thick grammars too.  These languages are &quot;richer&quot; in the sense that they may have a bigger vocabulary and a richer library of cultural links and so on.  But they are not more &quot;complicated&quot;.

Linguists have found that pretty much all languages, from those spoken by the simplest nomads to the builders of great empires, are all about similarly &quot;complicated&quot;, in the sense that they all have the complex structures necessary to convey human thought and reason. The aboriginal languages of North America, for example, have been found to have massive verb tables that put Latin and Greek to shame. And while languages like English and Chinese don't have these verb tables, they do have complicated systems of '''syntax''' (or sentence structures) that put those North American languages to shame.

What about people who say, for example, that &quot;Spanish is easier to learn than German&quot;?  Well — a lot of this depends on the way the language is taught in schools, the amount of sheer memorization demanded of beginners, and how ''similar'' the language is to your native language.  If you're a native English speaker, for example, you may find Japanese baffling, but Korean people usually find Japanese easier to learn than English!

Simple languages do exist, in two ways. '''Pidgins''' are broken, halting &quot;languages&quot; that people who can't speak each other's languages end up speaking. If these pidgins are taught to children in a community, however, they tend to become full languages within a generation — what we call '''creoles''' — so a pidgin can be seen as a new language in the process of '''birth'''. On the other hand, '''dying languages''' are languages that few people speak, and therefore aren't really being taught to children — these languages tend to get simpler and then die out.

== When did language begin? ==

It's very hard to know, since we didn't have tape recorders back then.  We are reasonably sure, however, that language has been spoken for a very very long time, tens of thousands of years at least, many centuries before agriculture or civilization began anywhere in the world.  This is because all people everywhere today, in every corner of the world, speak languages as complex as everyone else's.

By the way, languages did not begin in Egypt or Sumeria (as far as we know, anyway).  Those were just the first cultures we know of to ''write down'' languages that they already spoke.  Languages must have been spoken by all human beings many millennia before that.

== What's the difference between a language and a code? ==

A language has a unique grammar, phonology, vocabulary, and set of &quot;roots&quot; from which new words can be derived. All natural languages are descended from parent languages, as well, though for conlangs this is not strictly necessary.

A code or cipher, on the other hand, is merely a way of changing one language into something else. Codes and ciphers have no set grammar, vocabulary, or anything like that, and usually exist solely for the purpose of obscuring communication. 

Too many people will get a dictionary and create a single counterpart for every word in there and then proclaim, &quot;Look! I invented a language!&quot; No, there's more to a real language than that. And a real language is what real minds create!

== What's the &quot;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&quot;? ==

If you hang around conlangers for long, you'll hear references to &quot;Whorfianism&quot; or the &quot;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&quot;.  Those are two names for the same thing, which also goes by other names such as &quot;principle of linguistic relativity&quot;.

Simply put, the hypothesis says that how a person thinks depends on the language they use to think about it.  Modern writers usually distinguish between a &quot;strong hypothesis&quot;, that your language forces you to think one way rather than another, and a &quot;weak hypothesis&quot; that your language encourages you to think one way rather than another.  Nowadays the strong hypothesis isn't really taken seriously by mainstream linguists, but most linguists believe some version of a weak Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.  Lots of conlangs explore some version or other of the hypothesis.

The idea is most closely associated with Benjamin Lee Whorf, 1897&amp;ndash;1941, who studied native North American languages of the Uto-Aztecan family &amp;mdash; which are dramatically differently structured from European languages &amp;mdash; and suggested that speaking such profoundly different languages would give a person a different way of looking at the world.  Einstein's theory of relativity was a recent development at the time, and Whorf likened this linguistic notion to Einstein's theory because physical relativity says that how you perceive the world depends on your physical reference frame, while linguistic relativity says that how you perceive the world depends on your language.  Edward Sapir, 1884&amp;ndash;1939, is an important figure in the early history of modern linguistics, and Whorf's mentor.  Sapir too expressed ideas of this sort.  It's pretty common, though, for an idea to get named after somebody without their having every actually said it; Sapir and Whorf both said things like this at various times, but they weren't the first to do so, never coauthored a paper about it, didn't present it as a hypothesis, and dabbled in stronger and weaker forms without explicitly making the modern strong/weak distinction.

Many [[Conlang/Types#Logical languages|loglangs]] are at least partly explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; but also some [[Conlang/Types#Philosophical languages|philosophical languages]] are as well, such as [[w:Láadan|Láadan]], a well-known conlang attempting to support women's thinking, which was used in a series of feminist science fiction novels.

== Is there a conlanging community? ==

Short answer: There is now.  A central place to look, from which to work outward to all the other parts of the modern conlanging community, is the [https://conlang.org/ Language Creation Society].

Before the Internet, conlanging was mostly done privately by individuals who had no way of knowing if anyone else shared their peculiar pursuit.  In a (now classic) lecture about artlanging in 1931, called ''A Secret Vice'', J.R.R. Tolkien described an experience as a soldier in World War I:
:''We were listening to somebody lecturing on map-reading, or camp-hygeine, or the art of sticking a fellow through without (in defiance of Kipling) bothering who God sent the bill to; rather we were trying to avoid listening, though the Guards' English, and voice, is penetrating. The man next to me said suddenly in a dreamy voice: 'Yes, I think I shall express the accusative case by a prefix!'&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
J.R.R. Tolkien helped make artlanging somewhat respectable: as an academic and scholar of ancient languages, he not only came out publicly as a committed designer of artistic fictional languages, but used those languages to create a hugely successful series of fiction novels.  When the internet came along, people who had never before been able to ''find'' others with the same eccentric interests began to discover each other and form on-line communities, and one of these groups was conlangers.  The conlanging community especially formed around the [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html Conlang Mailing List], created in 1991, which was the origin of the term &quot;conlang&quot;.  The first annual Langauge Creation Conference was held in 2006, and the Language Creation Society, which amongst other things now runs the annual conference, was formed the next year.

=={{anchor|Anadew}} Is there a language with &amp;lt;feature&amp;gt;? ==

Some conlangers enjoy inventing weird features for their conlangs, but then discover some time later that there is actually a natural human language that has that feature.  A classic case is the &quot;Monster Raving Loony&quot; alignment (we'll discuss alignment [[../Advanced/Grammar/Alignment|in the Advanced level]]), which was devised by members of the Conlang Mailing List who named it ''Monster Raving Loony'' because it would create inherent ambiguity in the language &amp;mdash; making it impossible to tell which of the two arguments to a transitive verb is the subject of the sentence &amp;mdash; and therefore seemed absurd.  Only then someone noticed a language in Iran that actually has that sort of alignment.

This phenomenon is so common that conlangers have a name for it.  It's called '''anadew'''ism &amp;mdash; which is an acronym for '''a'''nother '''n'''atlang '''a'''lready '''d'''unnit, '''e'''xcept '''w'''orse.

So, when you're having fun with some really weird feature in your conlang, don't let it interfere with your enjoyment when you discover there's a natlang that does something like it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

Spoken language is much older than written language.  Many beginning conlangers try to build their first languages out of written words without paying too much attention to what they will sound like, but this approach, while usable, is really the wrong way 'round.  Before any written language existed, all the rules that govern how languages work &amp;mdash; the rules of grammar &amp;mdash; were already in place; what they determined was how language was built from patterns of sound.

==What sounds will you have?==

The first step is to decide on what sounds to use in your language.  No languages use precisely the same set of sounds; for example, the sound &quot;th&quot; in English does not occur in most other languages (although it does in some, such as Swahili, Greek, and European Spanish); conversely, many languages contain sounds that English does not use at all.

You probably already know that sounds are classed as ''consonants'' and ''vowels''.  In deciding on what sounds to use in your language, it often helps to consider these two categories separately.  [[../../Appendix/CXS#Sounds|Here]] is a chart of consonant and vowel sounds.  For now, don't worry about the symbols used; just enjoy hearing some of the exotic sounds you might want to add to your language!  But don't get too exotic; make sure that you can pronounce all the sounds you're going to use, and that you can tell them apart easily.  (There will be plenty of time for building conlangs that you can't pronounce yourself ''after'' you've built ones you can &amp;mdash; like a juggler practicing with eyes open before trying it blindfolded!)  Another guideline is: don't add more sounds than you will actually need.  If you want to use lots of non-English sounds, maybe think about deleting some sounds that English does use as well.

But regardless of what sounds you ultimately decide to use or not use, remember that it is important not to throw in every sound you come across; limit yourself to a system of sounds, rather than every sound that exists.  If you find yourself with 50 sounds without a good reason why, you have probably gone overboard.  The sounds should also be similar to one another in some way; avoid having &quot;freak&quot; sounds that have no relatives.  For example, if you have an aspirated stop (a hard consonant like &quot;t&quot;, with a puff of air after it), try to have more than one (but not ''every'' aspirated stop).

Choose a convenient way to spell out the sounds you've chosen, so that you can easily write about them, and be sure to write down a clear explanation of just what your spelling rules are.  It's a good idea to imitate standard descriptions of your sounds, rather than devising your own; that's the best way to be sure it's clear &amp;mdash; even to you, some time later &amp;mdash; just what sounds you intended.  In the Intermediate level of this wikibook, we'll cover the computer-friendly notation CXS (short for '''C'''onlang '''X'''-'''S'''AMPA), and its big brother IPA (the '''I'''nternational '''P'''honetic '''A'''lphabet), which are ways to spell out sounds without depending on the spelling rules of any particular language.

==What sounds can go where?==

When you have your sounds, you will have to work on ways of putting them together.  Languages differ greatly in this respect: for example, English usually requires every syllable to contain a vowel; even words with no vowel written, such as the mathematical term &quot;nth&quot;, are pronounced with one &amp;mdash; &quot;enth&quot;.  Not all languages follow this rule; some, on the other hand, require every syllable to ''end'' with a vowel.  If you are going to allow consonants to come after vowels at the end of syllables, you might only allow one consonant, or you might allow a cluster (as English does).  Some sounds might be prohibited from certain positions; for instance, the &quot;ng&quot; sound in English can never begin a word, but in Tagalog it can.  English allows many clusters of consonants, but prohibits many others: a word may begin ''str'', but not ''zdr''.  You can make your own decisions on what clusters to allow; Russian and Polish, for example, have no problem with clusters like ''zdr''.

==What sounds do I want?==

The types of sound used in a language (especially a themed language, such as Elvish) depends on the theme itself. For example, an Elvish language would be very liquid-heavy with many approximants while Orcish would have less gliding sounds and more gruff chokes. Keep in mind that there are two kinds of sounds: voiced and unvoiced. Feel free to pick and choose, but remember that if your people can make a voiceless sound, they can most likely make a voiced one.

== Polysynthesis ==

A polysynthetic language is characterized usually by verbal inflections to the point that word order is largely free. Natlangs that are polysynthetic include Mohawk. It is common in North American Indian languages. There are few polysynthetic conlangs, like Bp@x’àãókxá, Noyatowa and Terpish.

A polysynthetic language generally marks the verb for the number, person, and class (if there are noun classes) of the subject, and sometimes the direct object. The verb is generally marked through affixes that may be prefixes or suffixes. The language may be agglutinative or fusional. In addition, tense, aspect, and any other information about the verb are usually marked on the verb.

Here's a hypothetical example:&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| colspan=4 align=&quot;center&quot;|'''Ikatosona.'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;|i- || align=&quot;center&quot;|ka- || align=&quot;center&quot;|toso || align=&quot;center&quot;|-na
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;small&gt;3RD.ANIMATE.SING&lt;/small&gt; || align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;small&gt;3RD.INANIMATE.PLU&lt;/small&gt; || align=&quot;center&quot;|to see || align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;small&gt;PAST.PERFECT&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan=4 align=&quot;center&quot;|''He had seen them.''
|}

In addition, it is frequent for polysynthetic languages to incorporate nouns. This means that the noun forms a compound with the verb. To illustrate again:&lt;br&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| colspan=5 align=&quot;center&quot;|'''Ikamesitosona.'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;|i- || align=&quot;center&quot;|ka- || align=&quot;center&quot;|mesi || align=&quot;center&quot;|toso || align=&quot;center&quot;|-na
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;small&gt;3RD.ANIMATE.SING&lt;/small&gt; || align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;small&gt;3RD.INANIMATE.PLU&lt;/small&gt; || align=&quot;center&quot;|a rock || align=&quot;center&quot;|to see || align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;small&gt;PAST.PERFECT&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan=5 align=&quot;center&quot;|''He had seen rocks.''
|}

Jeff Burke has written this description of polysynthetic languages:


Polysynthesis is a grammatical phenomenon most famously present in many North American Indian languages; the Algonquian and Iroquoian tongues are the most well-known. These languages, instead of using case endings on nouns and conjugational endings on verbs, mark both subject and object inside the verb; further, subject and object inflections are considered the actual arguments of the verb, while any free-standing nouns associated with a verb are like dislocated topic phrases. Here is an example from Mohawk, an Iroquoian language spoken in upstate New York and southern Ontario: 

'''Teiotahià:kton wá:keke’''' 

Nominalized and rendered in normal English, this is 'I-ate a-banana'; but a more literal translation would be 'A-banana, I-ate-it'. The pronominals 'I' and 'it' (the arguments of the verb root '''-k-''' 'eat') are expressed via the prefix '''ke-''', which indicates a singular first-person subject and a singular third-person object. '''ke-''' is, then, akin to noun case and verb conjugation fused into a single marker and attached to the verb. Mohawk has some fifty-odd of these pronominal prefixes that express subject-object combinations; and a prefix is mandatory on every verb. By contrast, the noun '''teiotahià:kton''' 'banana' stands in relation to the verb '''wá:keke’''' only indirectly, as a topical phrase stands in relation to a central clause in English. 

Cheyenne, an Algonquian language spoken in southern Montana and Oklahoma, also marks subject and object on the verb, but does so differently; instead of a fusional marker, it uses a prefix for subject and a suffix for object. Witness: 

'''Hetane návóómo''' 

Literally translated, this means 'A-man, I-saw-him'. Hetane is the noun 'man' standing in relation to the verb návóómo 'I-saw-him' like a topical phrase. '''Ná-''' is the prefix for a singular first-person subject; '''-o''' is the marker for a singular third-person object. 

In addition to marking both subject and object inside the verb, polysynthetic languages often make use of noun incorporation. This is a phenomenon where a noun becomes, in essence, an inflection on a verb. Incorporated nouns can be, depending on the language and circumstances, direct objects, indirect objects, subjects, locatives, and of other kinds. Mohawk makes heavy use of incorporation, as in: 

'''Watia’tawi’tsherí:io''' 

This translates as 'It-is-a-good-shirt', where the noun root '''atia’tawi''' (a word that can be used to refer to basically any upper-body garment) is present inside the verb. Cheyenne also uses noun incorporation on a regular basis: 

'''Nátahpe’emaheona''' 

This verb, meaning 'I-have-a-big-house', contains the noun morpheme '''maheo''' 'house'. 

Noun incorporation can look bewildering, but is best understood in terms of English compounding. Babysit is an example of a word with an incorporated direct object; and words like deer-hunter and manslaughter make use of the same kind of incorporation.''

The headmarking inflections can be better understood by thinking of Romance languages like Spanish, which inflects for details about the subject. Polysynthetic languages take this concept further and inflect the verb for details about the object as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikibooks help}} {{shortcut|WB:PAGE}} {{TOC|float=left|limit=2}}

Every '''page''' on Wikibooks has a unique name (a string of characters) which appears in that page's [[w:URL|URL]] and by which it can be [[Help:Editing#Links|wikilinked]]. Various different forms of the name can be used. In particular, the name as it appears in the URL uses [[w:underscore|underscore]] characters where the name displayed in large font as the page header uses [[w:space (punctuation)|spaces]]. Details of the forms of page names and restrictions on them are given below.
[[File:Pagename explanation2 en-wikibooks.png|frame|center|Name of a Wikibooks page. The [[Help:Editing#Wikilinks|wikilink]] for that page is &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Microtechnology]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and the [[w:URL|URL]] is http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Microtechnology.]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

=={{anchor|Create}}Creating==
{{shortcut|WB:CREATE}}
The form below will allow you to easily create a new page.  The 'create page' button takes you to an [[Help:Editing|edit]] page to enter the new text. ''If you want to experiment, use the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] first.''  The following characters are not allowed in page titles: &lt;nowiki&gt;# &lt; &gt; [ ] | { }&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the forward slash (/) is reserved for [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|creating subpages]] to comply with [[WB:NP|naming conventions]].  Names are case sensitive and spaces are allowed.  If you are seeking to create a recipe for the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]] or content for children as part of [[Wikijunior]], you need to use a &quot;namespace&quot; prefix before the title (see [[#Namespaces|below]]).

&lt;inputbox&gt;
type=create
width=45
buttonlabel=create page
&lt;/inputbox&gt;

You can also start new pages by:

* Following a link to a new page which does not exist yet, which likewise launches the edit page.
* Adding a [[Help:Editing#Links|link]] to the new page on an existing page, such as the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]], and click the preview button to preview your changes. From the preview area click on the newly created link, which will switch you to editing a new page, if the page does not already exist, without updating the previous page.
* Typing the name of new page in the address field of your web browser, replacing current page name. Using this method for the new page displays the default &quot;Wikibooks does not have a page with this exact name&quot; message. The default page has the usual ''Edit'' tab replaced by a ''Create'' tab, which can be clicked to begin adding content.

Links are a convenient way to navigate books and to make [[WB:WATCH|followers]] aware of new pages. Links to new pages typically exist to encourage people to add new material and/or as part of a plan to add new material. Links to new pages typically look different from links to existing pages in that they have a red color, causing them to often be called &quot;red links&quot; or &quot;broken links&quot;. When a new page is created links typically change to a blue color, causing them to often be called &quot;blue links&quot; or &quot;working links&quot;.

{{NOTE|The [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] is emptied on a regular basis and should only be used for temporary experiments. So, remember to bookmark what you have created in order to edit it again in the future. If you are a registered user, it will also appear under &quot;''My contributions''&quot;. For persistent draft material, you can use your user account sub-pages, and move the subpage when ready. To create a user subpage, use a reference (title) like: 'User:UserName/New subpage'.}}

=={{anchor|Namespace}}Namespaces==
{{Shortcut|WB:NS}}
[[File:Pagename explanation en-wikibooks.png|frame|right|Wikibooks pages which are not part of regular books are prefixed with a &quot;namespace&quot; identifier. For books, the &quot;basename&quot; is the full page name.]]
{{namespaces}}
A Wikibooks '''namespace''' is a set of Wikibooks pages whose names begin with a particular prefix recognized by the software (followed by a colon), or in the case of the ''main namespace'' have no such prefix. For example, the ''user namespace'' consists of all pages with names beginning &quot;'''User:'''&quot;. Books appear in the main namespace, with no prefix.

Wikibooks has 26 current namespaces: twelve basic namespaces, each with a corresponding [[#Talk namespaces|talk namespace]]; and two virtual namespaces. These are all listed in the box to the right.

==={{anchor|Basic namespace}}Basic namespaces===
Wikibooks' basic namespaces and their functions are listed below.

* '''[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|Main namespace]]''' (no prefix): contains all books. Sometimes referred to as &quot;mainspace&quot;.
* '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Project namespace]]''' or '''Wikibooks namespace''' (prefix '''Wikibooks:'''): contains many types of pages connected with the Wikibooks project itself: information, policy, essays, processes, discussion, etc. The prefix can be shortened to '''WB:''' (see [[#Aliases|Aliases]] below), and there are many short redirects in the namespace written with capital letters that make pages easier to access, so for instance, [[Wikibooks:Reading room]] can be abbreviated [[WB:Reading room]] or even just [[WB:RR]] (due to [[Wikibooks:RR]] being a redirect).
* '''[[Subject:Books by subject|Subject namespace]]''' (prefix '''Subject:'''): for reader-oriented portals that help readers find books related to a specific subject.
* '''[[Wikibooks:User pages|User namespace]]''' (prefix '''User:'''): contains user pages and other pages created by individual users for their own personal use. Pages under this namespace can still be viewed and modified by others, so do not keep any of your sensitive data here.
* '''[[Cookbook:FAQ|Cookbook namespace]]''' (prefix '''Cookbook:'''): pages about cooking recipes and methods reside in this namespace.
* '''[[Wikijunior:What is Wikijunior|Wikijunior namespace]]''' (prefix '''Wikijunior:'''): books in this namespace are for infants to be read to and for young children to read to themselves.
* '''[[Help:Files|File namespace]]''' or '''Image namespace''' (prefix '''File:'''): contains file description pages for image, videos, or audio files, with links to the files themselves. See [[Special:ListFiles]]. Since many files used in Wikibooks are housed at [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], those files will not have local pages but instead mirror file pages from Commons. There are three versions of links to files:
*:: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Foobar.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will insert the image, video, or audio directly into the page, except for audio [[w:Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] files where a text link to the description page will be inserted;
*:: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:Foobar.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will make a text link to the image, video, or audio description page;
*:: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Foobar.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will make a text link directly to the image or audio or video clip.
*: The prefix '''Image:''' can be used instead of ''File:'' (see [[#Aliases|Aliases]] below).
* '''[[Special:AllMessages|MediaWiki namespace]]''' (prefix '''MediaWiki:'''): a namespace containing interface texts, such as the links and messages that appear on automatically generated pages. Pages in this namespace are permanently [[Wikibooks:Protected page|protected]]. For a list of these messages, see [[Special:AllMessages]].
* '''[[Help:Templates|Template namespace]]''' (prefix '''Template:'''): contains templates—pages that are intended primarily to be used on other pages to insert standard text or boxes such as navigation links.
* '''[[Help:Categories|Category namespace]]''' (prefix '''Category:'''): contains category pages, which display a list of pages and subcategories that have been added to a particular category, and optional additional text.
* '''[[Help:Importing|Transwiki namespace]]''' (prefix '''Transwiki:'''): &quot;transwiki&quot; is the process of moving content from one Wikimedia project to another. Content in the Transwiki namespace have been moved to Wikibooks, but not yet incorporated into a book or other page.
* '''[[Help:Contents|Help namespace]]''' (prefix '''Help:'''): contains pages which provide help in using Wikibooks and its software, both for readers of books and for editors.

The basic namespaces are sometimes referred to as &quot;''subject spaces''&quot;, especially in contrast to &quot;''talk spaces''&quot;. For instance: &quot;''File space is the subject space of the File talk space.''&quot;

==={{anchor|Talk|Talk namespace}}Talk namespaces===
Each of the above namespaces has an associated [[#Discussing|talk namespace]]. The talk namespaces are designated by adding ''talk:'' to the normal prefix. For example, the talk namespace associated with the main namespace has the prefix ''Talk:'', while the talk namespace associated with the user namespace has the prefix ''User talk:''. Most of the pages in the talk namespaces are used to discuss changes to the corresponding page in the associated namespace. Pages in the ''user talk'' namespace are used to leave messages for a particular user. The user talk namespace is special in that, whenever a user's talk page is edited, that user (if logged-in) will see a box saying &quot;You have new messages&quot; on the top every page that they view until they visit their talk page.

==={{anchor|Virtual namespace}}Virtual namespaces===
There are two virtual namespaces that are not editable: '''Special''' and '''Media'''.

There are some virtual namespaces that are not editable:

The ''[[Special:SpecialPages|Special:]]'' namespace consists of pages (called ''special pages'') that are created by the software on demand, such as [[Special:RecentChanges]]. These pages can be linked as usual, as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:RecentChanges]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The ''Media:'' namespace can be used to link directly to a file, rather than to the file description page. See information above on the [[#Basic namespaces|File:]] namespace.

==={{anchor|Module}}Modules===
{{shortcut|WB:MODULE}}

A Wikibooks '''module''' is defined as a page that has textbook-like material on it and can be used to distinguish a content page from its talk page.  A complete Wikibook is typically composed of many Wikibooks modules.  With very few exceptions, all of the printed text on the paper of a printed version of a Wikibook comes from one or another Wikibooks module of that book.

Only content found in the main namespace, ''Wikijunior'' namespace, and ''Cookbook'' namespace can be referred to as modules.

But not all pages in those namespaces are considered to be modules; some that are not are:
* the [[Main Page]]
* the [[Wikijunior]] portal
* the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]] table of contents
* many &quot;[[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]]&quot; pages which are used to re-route one page to another page

===Aliases===
There are eight aliases defined for namespaces: '''WB:''' and '''Project:''' (both for the &quot;Wikibooks&quot; namespace), '''WJ:''' (for the &quot;Wikijunior&quot; namespace), '''COOK:''' (for the &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace), '''SUB:''' (for the &quot;Subject&quot; namespace), '''CAT:''' (for the &quot;Category&quot; namespace), '''Image:''' (for the &quot;File&quot; namespace), and '''Image talk:''' (for the &quot;File talk&quot; namespace). All of these are case-insensitive.

If a link is made to a page title beginning with one of these strings, or if such a title is entered in the search box or used in a URL, the alias is automatically replaced by the true namespace prefix. Hence entering [[WB:Reading room]] or [[Project:Reading room]] is equivalent to entering [[Wikibooks:Reading room]]. It is not possible to create a page with a title beginning with one of the alias strings.  

===Case insensitivity===
Standard namespace names and aliases are case insensitive. The same applies to the first character after the colon. Hence the following all link to the same page:
* [[Wikibooks:Welcome]], [[WIKIBOOKS:Welcome]], [[wIKIbooks:Welcome]], [[wikibooks:welcome]]
* [[wB:Welcome]], [[wb:Welcome]], [[WB:welcome]]
* [[PROJECT:Welcome]], [[project:Welcome]], [[ProjecT:Welcome]], [[Project:welcome]]

===Namespace-dependent functionality===
The following software functions and configurations are dependent on namespace:
* [[WB:SEARCH|Search results]], listings of [[WB:RC|recent changes]] and other [[Special:SpecialPages|special page]] output (such as [[Special:AllPages]]) can be restricted to particular namespaces.
* The [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|subpage]] feature can be enabled or disabled per namespace. It is currently disabled for the File, MediaWiki and Category namespaces. But their talk spaces and all other namespaces have the subpage feature.
* The random book feature (in the sidebar) feature is restricted to the main namespace.
* Pages in the category and file namespaces are automatically treated as [[Help:Categories|category pages]] and [[Help:Files|file description pages]] respectively, and links to such pages behave in the corresponding non-standard ways.
* The template namespace is the default for using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; brackets (the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix can be omitted when performing these operations).  See [[Help:Templates]] for their use.

A '''discussion page''' (also known as a '''talk page''') is a page which editors can use to discuss improvements to a book or other Wikibooks page.

The discussion page associated with a content page is named &quot;Talk:Example&quot;, where &quot;Example&quot; is the name of the content page. For example, the discussion page for discussion of improvements to the book [[Learning Theories]] is named [[Talk:Learning Theories]]. The discussion page associated with a page in another namespace is named by adding &quot;talk&quot; after the namespace label; for example, the discussion page for [[Wikibooks:Welcome]] is called [[Wikibooks talk:Welcome]]. 

[[Wikibooks:User pages|User pages]] also have associated discussion pages (for example, [[User talk:Example]]). When another editor needs to contact you, they will usually do this by leaving a message on [[Special:mytalk|your discussion page]]. When someone has left you a message that way, you will see an [[#You have new messages|information notice]] the next time you log in or view a page on Wikibooks.

===Where to find discussion pages===
[[File:Wiki discussion tab en-wikibooks.png|thumb|200px|The discussion tab]]

When viewing a book (or any other non-discussion page), a link to the corresponding discussion page appears on the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the page. Click this tab to switch to the discussion page; you can then view the discussion page and its [[WB:PH|history]], and [[Help:Editing|edit]] it if you want to add a question or comment.

If the &quot;discussion&quot; link is [[Help:Glossary#red link|red]], it means no discussion page has been started yet. Click the red link to begin a discussion page for that content page. (It is also possible for a discussion page to exist while the corresponding non-discussion page is a red link; this often occurs in [[Wikibooks:User pages|User space]], when a user has received discussion page messages but has not started a user page yet.) 

To go back to the content page from its discussion page, use the leftmost tab at the top of the page, labeled &quot;book&quot;. For pages other than those in books, this tab may say something different, like &quot;user page&quot; or &quot;project page&quot;.

===Discussion page use===
====Sections====
To discuss a new topic, start a new [[WB:SECTION|section]] by going to a new line and typing a title like this: &lt;tt&gt;== Heading ==&lt;/tt&gt;, replacing &quot;Heading&quot; with a suitable title for the topic you wish to raise. Place new discussions at the ''bottom'' of the page. You can also use the tab labeled &quot;add topic&quot;, at the top of a discussion page, which performs these steps automatically.

To respond to a discussion already in progress, add your comment below the last entry in the discussion. If you want to respond to a specific comment, you can place your response directly below it. When doing this, keep in mind the advice given below about ''indentation''.

====Sign your contributions====
You should sign and date your contributions on all discussion pages. To do this easily, type four tildes &lt;nowiki&gt;(~~~~)&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end of your comment, or just click the [[File:Vector_toolbar_signature_button.png|link=|alt=signature]] button on the row of buttons above the edit box. This will be automatically converted into a user signature and the date and time. (You can change the form of your signature using your [[Help:Preferences|user preferences]].)

====Indentation====
Indentation is used to keep discussion pages readable. Comments are indented to show whether they are replies to other comments, and if so, which ones.

Comments are indented using one or more initial colons (:). Each colon represents one level of indentation. You will see these colons in the wikitext when editing a discussion page, but when viewing the page itself you will see the indents. 

The first comment in a section will have no colons before it. When you reply to a statement, you should use one more colon than the number that appear in the statement you're replying to. For example, if you're replying to a statement that has 2 colons before it, your response should have 3 colons before it. 

The following is an example of a discussion page discussion using indentation. The text typed in the edit box is shown on the left, and the resulting display on the right.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|&lt;pre&gt;
How's the soup? --[[User:John|John]]
:It's great!! --[[User:Jane|Jane]]
::I made it myself! --[[User:John|John]]
Let's move the discussion to [[Talk:Soup]]. --[[User:Jane|John]]
:I tend to disagree. --[[User:George|George]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
How's the soup? --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;
:It's great!! --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;
::I made it myself! --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;
Let's move the discussion to &lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Talk:Soup&lt;/span&gt;. --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;
:I tend to disagree. --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;George&lt;/span&gt;
|}

If you wish to reply to a comment that has already been replied to, place your response below the last response, while still only adding one colon to the number of colons preceding the statement you're replying to. In this example, note that Jane, George and Jim are each responding to ''John''&lt;span style=&quot;padding-left:0.1em;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;s comment. 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|
&lt;pre&gt;
How's the soup? --[[User:John|John]]
:It's great!! --[[User:Jane|Jane]]
:Not too bad.. --[[User:George|George]]

:Terrible. --[[User:Jim|Jim]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
How's the soup? --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;
:It's great!! --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;
:Not too bad.. --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;George&lt;/span&gt;

:Terrible. --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Note that comments are displayed closer together when indented by the same amount (see George's reply in the example above). This can cause confusion to readers glancing through a conversation thread, since several multi-line comments can be mistaken for a single comment. To produce normal paragraph spacing, add a line break first as Jim has done.

The next example shows a more complex discussion. Even though Jane has responded to John first, and Elliot responded to Jane, we can still easily see that George's comment is meant to be in response to John's original question:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|
&lt;pre&gt;
How's the soup? --[[User:John]]
:It's great!! --[[User:Jane]]
::Just ''how'' great was it? --[[User:Elliot]]
:::''Really'' great! --[[User:Jane]]
:Not too bad.. --[[User:George]]
::I thought it was a ''little'' bad... --[[User:Sam]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
How's the soup? --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;
:It's great!! --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;
::Just ''how'' great was it? --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Elliot&lt;/span&gt;
:::''Really'' great! --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;
:Not too bad.. --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;George&lt;/span&gt;
::I thought it was a ''little'' bad... --&lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Note that if your comment consists of more than one paragraph, you must repeat the colons at the start of each paragraph. An alternative is to type the line break tag &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; in the wikitext instead of starting a new line.

When a long discussion has many indents, the discussion may be awkward to read, particularly on smaller screens. Eventually, for everyone's convenience, a replying editor will &quot;start over&quot; by responding without any colons at all. The {{tl|outdent}} [[Help:Templates|template]] can be used for this purpose.

===You have new messages===
After someone else edits your user discussion page, the alert below is automatically displayed on all pages until you view your user discussion page. If you click &quot;new messages&quot; it will direct you to the bottom of your discussion page. If you click &quot;last change&quot; it will show you the last edit done to your discussion page.
&lt;div class=&quot;usermessage&quot;&gt;You have '''&lt;font color=#002CC8&gt;new messages&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=#002CC8&gt;last change&lt;/font&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;

===Guidelines===
====How to use book discussion pages====
* &lt;span id=&quot;communicate&quot; /&gt;'''Communicate''': If in doubt, make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being friendly is a great help. It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it. Explaining why you have a certain opinion helps to demonstrate its validity to others and reach consensus.
* &lt;span id=&quot;topic&quot; /&gt;'''Stay on topic''': Discussion pages are for discussing the ''page'', not for general conversation about the  page's subject (much less other subjects). Keep discussions focused on how to improve the page. Irrelevant discussions are subject to removal.
* &lt;span id=&quot;positive&quot; /&gt;'''Be positive''': Book discussion pages should be used to discuss ways to improve a book; not to criticize, pick apart, or vent about the current status of a book or its subject.  However, if you feel something is wrong, but are not sure how to fix it, then by all means feel free to draw attention to this and ask for suggestions from others.
* &lt;span id=&quot;objective&quot; /&gt;'''Stay objective''': Discussion pages are not a forum for editors to argue their ''personal point of view'' about a controversial issue.  They are a forum to discuss how the points of view of reliable sources should be included in the article, so that the end result is [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral]]. The best way to present a case is to find properly referenced material.
* &lt;span id=&quot;factual&quot; /&gt;'''Deal with facts''': The discussion page is the ideal place for issues relating to verification, such as asking for help finding sources, discussing conflicts or inconsistencies among sources, and examining the reliability of references. Asking for a verifiable reference supporting a statement is often better than arguing against it.
* &lt;span id=&quot;sharing&quot; /&gt;'''Share material''': The discussion page can be used to &quot;park&quot; material removed from the page due to verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns discussed. New material can be prepared on the discussion page until it is ready to be put into the page; this is an especially good idea if the new material (or topic as a whole) is controversial.
* &lt;span id=&quot;discussion&quot; /&gt;'''Discuss edits''': The discussion page is particularly useful to discussion about edits. If one of your edits has been reverted, and you change it back again, it is good practice to leave an explanation on the discussion page and a note in the edit summary that you have done so. The discussion page is also the place to ask about another editor's changes. If someone queries one of your edits, make sure you reply with a full, helpful rationale.
* &lt;span id=&quot;propose&quot; /&gt;'''Make proposals''': New proposals for the page can be put forward for discussion by other editors if you wish. Proposals might include changes to specific details, page moves, merges or making a section of a long page into a separate page.

====Good practices====
*Before starting a new discussion, ensure there is not already an existing section on the same topic. Duplicating the same discussion in multiple sections on a discussion page causes confusion, erodes general awareness of points being made, and disrupts the flow of conversation on the topic. 
*&lt;span id=&quot;contentnotcontrib&quot; /&gt; '''[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|Comment on content, not on the contributor]]''': Keep the discussions focused upon the topic of the discussion page, rather than on the personalities of the editors contributing to the discussion page.
*&lt;span id=&quot;signature&quot; /&gt;'''Sign your posts''': To sign a post, type four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and they will be replaced with your username and time stamp, like this: [[User:Example|Example]] 13:21, 9 May 2008 (UTC). Please note that it is impossible to leave an anonymous comment because your user name or IP address is recorded in the page history.
*&lt;span id=&quot;focussed'' /&gt;'''Keep discussions focused''': Discussions naturally should finalize by agreement, not by exhaustion.
*&lt;span id=&quot;archives&quot; /&gt;'''Read the archives''': If you are a new editor to a book, be sure to read the [[#Archiving|archives]]. Not only are content disputes valuable examples of discussion page behavior, but they contain a lot of expert knowledge surrounding the topic. You may quickly find your questions and/or objections have already been answered if you try searching all the archives for that page at once using the [[Help:Navigating#Search_engine_features|''prefix'' parameter]].
*&lt;span id=&quot;welcoming&quot; /&gt;'''Be welcoming to newcomers:''' People new to Wikibooks may be unfamiliar with policy and conventions.  [[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers|Please do not bite the newcomers]].  If someone does something against custom, [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|assume it was an unwitting mistake]].  [[Wikibooks:Be civil|Politely]] and gently point out their mistake, reference the relevant policy/guideline/help pages, and suggest a better approach.
*&lt;span id=&quot;multi&quot; /&gt;'''Avoid posting the same thread in multiple forums.''' This fragments discussion of the idea. Instead, start the discussion in one location, and, if needed, advertise that in other locations using a link. If you find a fragmented discussion, it may be desirable to move all posts to one location, and linking to it. Make sure you state clearly in edit summaries and on discussion pages what you have done and why.

====Unacceptable behavior====
*'''[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|No personal attacks]]''': A personal attack is saying something negative about another person. This mainly means:
**'''No insults''': Do not make [[w:ad hominem|ad hominem]] attacks, such as calling someone an idiot or a fascist. Instead, explain what is wrong with an edit and how to fix it.
**'''Do not threaten people''': For example, threatening people with &quot;admins you know&quot; or having them banned for disagreeing with you. Explaining to an editor the consequences of violating Wikibooks policies, like being blocked for vandalism, is permitted however.
**'''Do not make legal threats''': Threatening a lawsuit is highly disruptive to Wikibooks, for reasons given at the linked page.
**'''Never post personal details''': Users who post what they believe are the personal details of other users without their consent may be blocked for any length of time, including indefinitely.
*&lt;span id=&quot;misrepresent&quot; /&gt;'''Do not misrepresent other people:''' The record should accurately show significant exchanges that took place, and in the right context. This usually means:
** Be precise in quoting others.
** When describing other people's contributions or edits, use [[WB:DIFF|diffs]]. The advantage of diffs in referring to a comment is that it will always remain the same, even when a discussion page gets archived or a comment gets changed.
**''Generally'', do not alter others' comments, including signatures.
*'''Do not ask for another's personal details'''
*'''Do not impersonate other editors'''
*'''Do not claim to be an administrator or claim to have an access level that you do not have''', as this can be highly disruptive. User access levels can be checked at [[Special:ListUsers]] by anyone.

=={{anchor|Archive}}Archiving==
{{shortcut|WB:ARCHIVE}}
It is customary to periodically archive old discussions on a talk page when that page becomes too large. Bulky talk pages may be hard to navigate, contain obsolete discussion, or become a burden for users with slow Internet connections or computers. There may be circumstances where it would benefit discussions to keep older sections visible on the talk pages; namely, to allow newly visiting editors to see which issues have been addressed already and avoid redundant discussion. However, this situation can be better addressed by use of the {{tlx|FAQ}} template. Notices should also be placed at the beginning of the talk page to inform all editors of an archive.

Regular pages are not archived because previous versions may be seen in the ''history'' tab; the practice of archiving is particular to talk pages and the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|reading rooms]], which often swell to great length.  Archiving one's own user talk page is optional; some users simply blank the page, as the history is kept available for future reference.

When to archive, and what may be the optimal length for a talk page, are subjective decisions that should be adapted to each case.  For example, ongoing discussions and nearby sections they reference should generally be kept intact.  When archiving by creating subpages cutting and pasting the content should be used, which retains the talk page history in a single location.  It is helpful to label archives with dates and a brief summary of the main discussions.

===Procedure===
Archive pages are usually named as follows: take the name of the talk page, and add &lt;tt&gt;'/Archive #&lt;/tt&gt;', where &lt;tt&gt;'#'&lt;/tt&gt; is the number of the archive. Note that the word 'Archive' has a capital 'A', there is a space before the number, and there are no leading zeros.

For example:

* the 20th archive of [[Talk:Main Page]] would be named &lt;tt&gt;Talk:Main Page/Archive 20&lt;/tt&gt;
* the first archive of [[User talk:Example]] would be named &lt;tt&gt;User talk:Example/Archive 1&lt;/tt&gt;

Remember to use the correct namespace&amp;nbsp;– the part before the colon (&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;)&amp;nbsp;– when archiving your own user talk page. It should start with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;User talk:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, not &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Talk:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

# Click on ''Edit'' for the talk page you wish to archive.
# In the edit box, highlight all the text you want to archive, right-click (Windows/Linux) or control-click (Mac) and then select '''[[w:Cut and paste|cut]]'''. The text will then be copied to your clipboard. Note that any [[Wikibooks:WikiProject|WikiProject]] header templates should remain on the main talk page and should not be cut and pasted to an archive page.
# While still in the edit window, [[WB:LINK|make a link]] to the archive name you plan on creating&amp;nbsp;– you can link directly to a subpage by putting a slash (/) in front of it.
#* If you're making a topical archive, use the name of the topic, for example '''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Place of birth debate]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''.
#* If you're just archiving old discussion, use the next available number; so if the last archive page was Archive 3, call it '''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Archive 4]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''.
#* If there are no archives yet, call it '''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Archive 1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''.
#* Archive links can be conveniently placed in an archive template (How to do this is described in the [[#Archive box|archive box]] section below)
# '''Save''' the page. You should now have a page of recent discussion with a red link to your archive at the top.
# Open the newly created subpage by clicking the red link. Paste the old discussions from your clipboard into the edit box.
# Add {{tl|talk archive}} to the top and bottom of the page. This adds a notice explaining that the page is an archive, and links back to the main talk page.
#If this is a numbered archive, you can add a navigation template to make it easier to navigate through to other numbered archives. See the [[#Navigation templates|navigation templates]] section below.
# '''Save'''. You have now created an archive.

====Automated archival====
[[User:MiszaBot|MiszaBot]] can automatically create cut-and-paste archives for any discussion page (one that has &quot;talk&quot; in the namespace), by moving sections to a subpage when they have received no comments for a specified period of time. See [[w:User:MiszaBot/Archive HowTo|User:MiszaBot/Archive HowTo]] for instructions on setting this up.

===Navigation templates===
If the archive page is a numbered archive page (&quot;Archive #&quot; where # is the number of the archive), you can add a navigation template to make it easier to navigate through to other numbered archives.
* {{tl|archive-nav}} needs the archive number as a parameter&amp;nbsp;– for example {{tlx|archive-nav|3}} on Archive 3.
* {{tl|archive nav}} similar to the above, but a dynamic list of links,&amp;nbsp;– for example {{tlx|archive nav|33}} on Archive 33.
* {{tl|atn}} is similar, but doesn't need a parameter.

===Archive box===
On regularly archived talk pages, it is useful to have an &quot;archive box&quot; [[Help:Templates|template]]. Common usage is to place the archive box below other header templates and before the first section heading so that the box appears to the right of the table of contents.  Alternatively, the {{tl|talk header}} template will provide automatic links to archives using standard naming.

If the new archive has been created through the [[#Cut and paste procedure|cut and paste procedure]] and if the page already has an archive box, add the link to the new archive page to it if the archive box has a manual listing.

If there is no archive box yet, you may want to set one up.  Use the {{tl|archives}} template for an automatic listing of archives if using the standard naming.  If using nonstandard naming, the template will accept a manual list on a subpage of the talk page being archives.  It can also be collapsed and can be configured to include a search box for easy searching of archive pages.  See the [[Template:Archives|documentation]] for details.

=={{anchor|Move}}Moving==
{{shortcut|WB:MOVE}}

Pages may be '''moved''' to a new title if the previous name is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or for a host of different housekeeping reasons.  When a page is renamed, its page history is attached to the new name, and the previous title is automatically [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|redirected]] to the new name ([[Wikibooks:Bots|bots]] and [[Wikibooks:administrators|administrators]] have the option of suppressing the redirect). Only [[Wikibooks:autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed users]] may move pages due to persistent page move vandalism. If you are an unregistered user or newly registered user, you may request a page move at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].

The terms &quot;rename&quot; and &quot;move&quot; mean the same in this context. They just refer to different models for picturing the operation: 

*'''rename:''' keep the page but give it another name; the page history is now attached to the new name; a new page with the old name is created which redirects to the new name and whose page history records the renaming.
*'''move:''' move the contents and the page history to a new page; change the old page into a redirect; change the page history into one that only records the move.

When a page in the file [[#Namespaces|namespace]] (that is images, media) is moved, the associated file is moved as well. Only Wikibooks administrators can move these pages.  Pages in the category [[#Namespaces|namespace]] cannot be moved. 

===Reasons for moving a page===
There are many reasons why you might wish to rename a page:
* The title has been misspelled, does not contain standard capitalization or punctuation, or is misleading or inaccurate 
* The title does not follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|Wikibooks' naming conventions]]
* The name is ambiguous and renaming it in some way will avoid confusion with an existing, similarly named topic
* The scope of the page has been reduced, extended, or otherwise changed
* It is a page that has been created as a [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|subpage]] of a Wikibooks user's user or user talk space for development purposes and it is ready to be posted to the mainspace

===How to move a page===
Note that in order to be able to move pages yourself, you must be [[WB:LOGIN|logged in]] and you must be [[Wikibooks:Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed]]). Moreover the move will fail if a page already exists at the target name, unless it is simply a redirect to the present name that has never been modified (check the [[WB:PH|edit history]]).

[[File:Vector hidden move button.jpg|thumb|300px|The move option appears when you move your mouse cursor over the small drop-down menu, shown here. (Other users may not have the &quot;TW&quot;, which is an optional gadget in [[Help:preferences|preferences]])]]
[[File:Moving a draft article.jpg|thumb|300px|A common example: moving a userspace draft into place.]]

The steps for moving a page are as follows:
#With the page to be moved displayed, choose the &quot;move&quot; option near the top of the page. In the default layout, this is in a drop-down menu to the right of the screen, after &quot;History&quot; and the &quot;Watchlist&quot; star (see picture). You'll be asked for a new name for the page, and given the option to also move the page's talk page (this box should usually be left checked). Complete the &quot;Reason for move&quot; field (which is like an [[WB:ES|edit summary]]). Although filling out the &quot;Reason&quot; field isn't required, you should state a reason for the page move.
# When ready, click the move button and, if successful, the page will be renamed to the new title. 
# Once the page has been moved, this will be recorded in the [[Special:Log/move|Move Log]] and a &quot;move has succeeded&quot; message will be displayed.

The old title will become a [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect page]], so any links to the old title will still go to the new page. However, note that double redirects (pages that redirect to the original page), will not automatically follow to the new page, so you can follow the following procedure to correct this:
#Open the &quot;[[WB:WLH|What links here]]&quot; in the toolbox near the bottom of the sidebar.
#In the section of that page marked filters, click on the button labeled &quot;Hide links&quot;. This will result in the page only showing [[WB:REDIRECT|redirects]] to the prior name. Open each of the redirect pages (best to do so in new tabs), click ''[[Help:Editing|Edit]]'' for each one, and change their target to the name of the page to which you have moved the page.

You should never just move a page by cutting all the text out of one page, and pasting it into a new one; old revisions, notes, and attributions are much harder to keep track of if you do that. (But you may have to if, for instance, you're splitting a page into multiple topics. If you do, please include a note in the new page's edit summary and talk page stating where you took the text from.) Also see [[#Fixing cut and paste moves]] below.

===Moves where the target name has an existing page===
In most cases non-administrators cannot complete a move where the existing page exists. Administrators can move a page, deleting an existing page with a name equal to the new name of the moved page, in one step.

If the new title already exists and isn't just a redirect to the old title, with no [[WB:PH|history]], and you are not an administrator, the wiki will tell you that you can't rename the page. If this happens, list the move at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]], or (if the replacement of the existing page merits further discussion) nominate the existing page for deletion (typically via [[WB:RFD|Request for Deletion]]).

===Move-protected pages===
Administrators can [[Help:Editing#Page protection|protect]] pages from moves, so that only administrators can move them. Pages that are protected from editing are also protected from moves.  If a page is protected from moves, the &quot;Move&quot; link will not be available. In this case, you can ask that an administrator move it for you, but you should not manually move the page by copying the contents to the new page and redirecting the old page to the new page, as this [[#Fixing cut and paste moves|destroys the page history]].

===Undoing a move===
To undo a move from page A to page B, simply move page B back to page A. 

Note that usual &quot;undo&quot; link on [[WB:PH|history]] or [[WB:DIFF|diff]] pages does not work on moves. 

The software requires that the redirect be pointing to the page you're moving it from. Therefore, if a vandal moved Page A to Page B to Page C, you cannot simply move C to A, you have to:
# Move page C to page B
# Move page B to page A

If page A has subsequently been edited, only an admin can sort things out:
# Delete page A (make sure it has no useful history)
# Move page B to page A.
# Delete page B (should be a history-free redirect to page A)

&quot;Move wars&quot; are highly unproductive, and leave vast numbers of pointless redirects littering the place, which some poor soul will have to fix.

After undoing a move, if you do not need B as a [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]], edit the page and tag it for deletion with {{tlx|delete|unneeded redirect}}.

===Swapping two pages===
To swap pages A and B, including history:
# Move page A to page C (previously non-existing)
# Tag page A for deletion with {{tlx|delete|delete to make way for move}}.
# Move page B to page A (allowed because A is deleted)
# Tag page B as above
# Move page C to page B (allowed because B is deleted)
# Tag page C as above

Help with this task can be found at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].

===Fixing cut and paste moves===
Sometimes renamings have been performed by new users without access to the move function or by unregistered users who are not permitted to rename pages.  Such manual moves were done using [[w:Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]. As a result, the page history of a page can be split among two or more different pages.

In some circumstances, administrators are able to fix this by merging page histories.

'''Warning:''' this procedure may only be undone by an administrator, by spending quite silly amounts of time: to undo a merge, every single version has to be manually reassigned to the correct source page (by deleting the revisions that are in the correct location currently and moving the other revisions to their new correct location, then undeleting the revisions that were in the correct location). Do not do this if you are not sure what you are doing. 

Follow this procedure to merge page histories:

# Suppose we wish to merge edit history from ''Alabama/History'' (old title) into ''History of Alabama'' (new title):
# Move ''Alabama/History'' to ''History of Alabama'' with comment ''history merge''.  A warning will appear stating that the destination page exists and asks whether you want to delete the page to make way for the move.  Check the box to delete the page.
# Undelete the ''History of Alabama'' page.
# Edit ''History of Alabama'' to restore the most recent version.

Note that the page history will often look wrong until the last step here is carried out, because it doesn't update after an undeletion until the next time the page is edited.

===Automating multiple page moves===
Administrators are also given an option to move up to 500 subpages and talk subpages along with the desired page.  This is useful for [[#Discussing|talk pages]] with [[#Archiving|archives]].  Standard users can move the subpages by hand.  If an entire book with its subpages is being renamed, [[WB:AA|request assistance]] from an administrator.

=={{anchor|Merge}}Merging==
{{shortcut|WB:MERGE}}

A '''merger''' is a non-automated process by which the content of two pages is united on one page. Reasons to merge a page include: unnecessary duplication of content, significant overlap with the topic of another page, and minimal content that could be covered in or requires the context of a page on a broader topic.

Merging is a normal editing action, something any editor can do, and as such generally does not need to be proposed and processed. If the merger is controversial, however, you may find your merger reverted, and as with all other edits, [[Help:Glossary#edit war|edit wars]] should be avoided. If you are uncertain of the merger's appropriateness, or believe it might be controversial, or your merger ends up reverted, you can '''propose''' it on either or both of the affected pages.

=== Proposing a merger ===
# Create one discussion section, typically on the destination page's discussion page (also known as the talk page). This should include a list of the affected pages and a merger rationale.
# Tag each page with the appropriate merger tag. All tag ''discussion page'' links should be specified to point at the new discussion section.

To propose a merger of two or more pages, place the [[Help:Templates|template]] {{tlx|merge|OTHER PAGE|optional reason|3=Talk:THIS PAGE#Merger proposal}} at the top of each page or section.

Please use the third parameter to direct '''to the same discussion page'''. Otherwise, two separate discussions could take place in each of the respective discussion pages.  If the third parameter is not specified, the &quot;discussion page&quot; links lead to the discussion pages of ''both'' merger candidates.

If you know which page should be removed, use {{tlx|mergeto|DESTINATION PAGE|optional reason|3=Talk:DESTINATION PAGE#Merger proposal}} on that page, and {{tlx|mergefrom|SOURCE PAGE|3=Talk:DESTINATION PAGE#Merger proposal}} on the page that will remain and will receive the contents of the source page. Unless a third parameter is specified in these templates, all ''discussion page'' links to lead to the discussion page of the destination page, avoiding the two separate discussions problem that may occur with {{tl|merge}}. It may still be preferable to link to a section on the discussion page; this is useful for directing the reader to a specific section of a long discussion page, when it may not otherwise be obvious where the discussion is located.

'''After proposing the merger, place your reasons on the discussion page.'''

=== Closing instructions ===
If there is clear agreement with the proposal by consensus, or if there is silence, proceed with the merger.

To provide clarity that the merger discussion is over and that a consensus has been reached, it may be important to close and then archive the proposal discussion.  To close a merger proposal discussion, indicate the outcome at the top. If the merger is particularly controversial, one may take the optional step of requesting closure by an uninvolved administrator at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].

To archive a merger proposal discussion, a {{tl|closed}} template is generally placed between the header and the top of the discussion and a {{tl|end closed}} template will need to be placed at the bottom of the discussion.

Here is an example of how to archive a merger proposal discussion:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; ==Merger proposal==
 {{closed|1=The result was '''merge''' into DESTINATION PAGE. -- ~~~~}}
 Hi, I would like to discuss...
 {{end closed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Performing the merger===
There are two basic types of merger; which to use depends on how much content of the source page you want to keep:

*[[#Full-content paste merger|Full-content paste merger]] - most content, clean and fast
*[[#Selective paste merger|Selective paste merger]] - some content, clean but slow

Also remember that almost all pages have a [[#Discussing|discussion page]].  To avoid losing quick access to that historical discussion, a link to the source page's discussion page should be placed at the top of the destination's discussion page, such as:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Page merged: See old discussion page [[talk:PAGENAME|here]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== Full-content paste merger ====
{{Nutshell|title=Full content merger|A full merger copies ''all'' the text from the source page.}}
# Open the source and destination pages in two separate edit windows/tabs.
# Cut/paste the entire content from the source page into the destination page and remove the {{tl|mergefrom}} tag.
# Save the destination page, with an [[WB:ES|edit summary]] noting &quot;merge content from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[SOURCE PAGE]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; ('''This step is required in order to conform with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|Wikibooks' licensing requirements]].  Do not omit it nor omit the page name.''')
# Edit the destination page again and delete the redundant content, editing until it looks good and consistent.
# Save the destination page.  (Edit summary of &quot;cleanup after paste/merger&quot; is appropriate.)
# Check [[WB:WLH|&quot;What links here&quot;]] on the source page for any links to the page and correct them to point to the destination page instead.
# Ask for a [[#Fixing cut and paste moves|history merger]] between the two pages by placing {{tlx|now merged|DESTINATION PAGE}} above all content on the source page.

Performing a merger in this manner is beneficial when you want to include all the content from both pages in the final page and the source page will no longer exist.

==== Selective paste merger ====
{{Nutshell|title=Selective merger|A selective merger transfers only ''some'' of the text from the source page into the target page.}}

# Open the source and destination pages in two separate edit windows/tabs.
# Cut/paste the desired content from the source page into the destination page and remove the {{tl|mergefrom}} tag.
# Preview and edit the destination page until it looks good and consistent.
# Save the destination page, with an [[WB:ES|edit summary]] noting &quot;merge content from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[SOURCE PAGE]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; ('''This step is required in order to conform with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|Wikibooks' licensing requirements]].  Do not omit it nor omit the page name.''')
# Delete the text taken from the source page, note the merger (including the page name) in the edit summary, and save the page.
# Check [[WB:WLH|What links here&quot;]] on the source page and correct any links that should point to the merged content page.
# Add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:Copied|copied]]|from=source|to=destination|diff=permanent diff&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; onto the talk pages of both pages. This not only helps clarify attribution at the destination, but helps prevent inadvertent later deletion of the source history.
# Afterwards, &lt;u&gt;DO NOT&lt;/u&gt; ask for a history merger between the two pages.

Performing a merger in this manner is beneficial when the source page will continue to exist in a revised form and the [[WB:PH|page history]] for that content must be kept in place with the material that remains following the merge.

=={{anchor|Delete}}Deleting==
{{shortcut|WB:DEL}}
Pages can only be deleted by [[Wikibooks:administrators|administrators]] and community consensus must have been demonstrated. For certain uncontroversial circumstances, users can request a ''speedy deletion''. Any page that does not fall under the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|scope of the project]] or has no [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Meaningful content|meaningful content]] may be nominated for deletion.

Note that the editors will often have contributed the content in [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|good faith]] and may be offended by the nomination. If you have concerns about whether the content belongs at Wikibooks, '''begin by addressing it on the talk page'''. Often the content contributor will understand that it is out of scope and accept the need to move the content elsewhere. Being polite and helpful in finding the relevant portions of Wikibooks policies goes a long way.

Should you nominate a page for deletion, consider notifying major contributors (the deletion tags provide a handy code). Be respectful and detailed. In the case of a speedy deletion, distinguish between worthless content and good faith efforts, both in the speedy tag reason, as well as on contributor pages.

===Speedy deletion===
There are certain situations where consensus does not have to be demonstrated for each case. See [[WB:SPEEDY]] for the list of criteria. Essentially, if a page has no [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Meaningful content|meaningful content]], it can be deleted. You can also ask for pages where you are the only contributor of, or pages in your part of the user [[#Namespaces|namespace]] to be speedily deleted.

To nominate the page, place {{tlx|delete|''&lt;reason&gt;''}} at the top of the page, with the &lt;code&gt;''&lt;reason&gt;''&lt;/code&gt; citing the speedy deletion criteria.

When in doubt, make a formal request for deletion (see below).

===Requests for deletion===
Should talk page discussions not bear fruit, you can make a formal request for deletion which consists of three steps.

# Place {{tl|rfd}} at the top of the page in question. If you are nominating a whole book, it's enough to tag the main page.
# Notify contributors, for example with {{subst|rfd warning|''&lt;page name&gt;''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. If they may not have seen the discussion on the talk page, restate your rationale there. Should the content be deleted, the talk page goes as well and your note may be the only sign of that page once they return.
# Take your request to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]. There is a handy link titled &quot;add a new entry&quot; which pre-loads a template and lists a few tips above the text area.

Discussions are rarely closed within a month, but can go on for several times that longer if discussion continues or consensus is not reached. A page is only deleted if there is consensus. Without consensus, the page is kept. As with all consensus decisions at Wikibooks, there are no votes; only arguments.</text>

== Conworld ==

Hmm. It looks like a good start so far. Nice job!  :P

Some comment/questions though: 

Looking at the categories on the main page, I think we should fuse a few together. Conscripting should be merged with Conlanging (as I can already see you have a &quot;writing systems&quot; section in the conlanging one). 

Also, what's the difference between &quot;Concultures&quot; and &quot;Consocieties&quot;? 

And as for the &quot;Conmusic&quot;, &quot;Conart&quot;, and &quot;Consports&quot;, well, couldn't those be merged into Conculture? Or at least merge Conmusic and Conart. 

Also, what will you put in &quot;The Way of Con-&quot; and &quot;Exemplary Conworlds&quot;? 

So far so good, though :D

-- Maknas

:Ran, you really should leave ''Conart'' seperate, just so you can use it as a heading. Even it breaks the flow and structure. It's just that good.

:-- Space Dracula

''the above was moved from http://spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?p=120771 ''

::Yeah, Conscripting and Conmusic should probably be merged into Conlanging and Conart.

::As for Consocieties, I was envisioning a sort of &quot;Conpolitics/Coneconomics/Consociety&quot; kind of thing. You know, like how the government is run, social classes, etc etc. Maybe there's a better way of putting that?

::Exemplary Conworlds would be a list of well-made conworlds! Almea, for example, would be on the list. And as for the &quot;Way of Con-&quot;, I thought of it as a sort of philosophy section. You know, some people make conworlds for fun, some make it to express their views, some make conworlds that are scientifically accurate, some people are freer with magical systems and such. The &quot;Way of Con-&quot; was meant to summarize all of it, as an overview of worldbuilding styles and such. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 14:40, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::I've gone ahead and merged the Conmusic and Conscripting sections. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 16:08, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Use of Con- ==

I don't think that each of catogories should begin with ''Con-'' as this could scare of newcomers. We should explain the popular usage of the prefix in ''The way of Con-'' but limit it's use within the actual articles. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 15:01, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Duly noted... I've added a paragraph of explanation on the [[Conworld]] page. How does it look now? -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 15:24, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::The paragraph is good but, what I meant was that we should avoid the use of colloquial terms from the ZBB (such as ''con-whatever'' or ''natlang'') which would not be understood by anyone who is not from the conworld community. Although we could refer them to the Glossary when such word appear, I don't think the wikibook should require the learning of colloquial terms when ''constructed whatever'' and ''natural language'' would suffice. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 16:26, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== New ToC's ==

I've went ahead and made some starting Tables of Contents for some of the other sections off the main page. Ran, if you would, you should probably work out the base for the 'Way of Con' and 'Exemplery Conworlds', since I still don't exactly understand what you mean...
And is there a way to see all of the new discussions in the ConWorld WikiBook? It's a pain to have to look through each page's Talk Pages. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 16:48, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:The Related Changes might do that. - Circeus

::You could always add each page to your watchlist and then check that every so often. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 17:01, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::: Ooh, that works. Thanks! -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 17:17, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== conmusic ==

I am willing to write an article on conmusic to publish as a chapter of conarts [[User:Markus Miekk-oja|Markus Miekk-oja]] 18:12, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Go ahead. Do you want someone to make a ToC for the &quot;Conart&quot; section first? -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 18:14, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

That'd be preferrable, yes. [[User:Markus Miekk-oja|Markus Miekk-oja]] 19:03, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Done. I don't know much about the field, so it's still pretty simple. Just click on the &quot;Music&quot; link in it to start editing. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 19:11, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Editing ==

Just a little suggestion. Please, when you make an edit to a page (excluding Talk pages), please describe the edit you made in the &quot;Summary&quot; box next to the &quot;Save Page&quot; button. This makes it a lot easier to track changes. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 20:50, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== &quot;Conscripting&quot; considered infelicitous ==

The trouble is that English already has a word &quot;conscript&quot;; as a noun it means a person pressed into service (often against their will), and as a verb it means to press a person into service.

I'd just edit the page except that I don't have a ready substitute.  Conorthography?  Conwriting?  I dunno.

:We could say Con-script as the introductory title, and then use conscript everywhere else? I'm fairly sure there won't be much problems--[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 22:18, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::I don't see any problem. English already has many such homophones that are easially determined by context (not vs. knot or poor vs. pour). I doubt the average English speaker would be able to confuse con-script and conscript to such an extent (especially as the naming priciples are explained on the front page) -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 12:58, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Conhistory, Fiction and the Lexicon RPG ==

I am not sure I see a great distinction between 'conhistory' and 'writing fiction set in your conworld'.  Perhaps the latter topic would be better incorporated into the former.  Seems to me the Lexicon RPG (Google it if it means nothing to you) would be an interesting topic to cover as it provides a tool for creating conhistory in a usable form and is a game activity in its own right.

: I'm afraid I don't quite see your point. For me, conhistory and writing fiction are distinct subjects. The major difference between the two is the time; Conhistory takes place during the past and Fiction is set in the present.

: I googled for &quot;the Lexicon RPG&quot; but I'm afraid I don't quite understand what this has to do with conhistory - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 14:37, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Anybody there? ==

Hey there, I just found this wikibook and it's awesome, but I noticed that there hasn't been any discussion here since '04. Are people still writing? --[[User:Ajallan|Ajallan]] 17:12, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

My thoughts exactly. [[Special:Contributions/195.189.142.115|195.189.142.115]] ([[User talk:195.189.142.115|talk]]) 15:23, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

Where is everyone? Everything you've made so far is perfect. Does anyone still work on this? -- [[Special:Contributions/78.0.230.128|78.0.230.128]] ([[User talk:78.0.230.128|talk]]) 18:25, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

== Interwiki Link to wikia:Conworld and wikia:Conlang ==

Hello there,

perhaps it would be great to interlink Wikipedia articles and Wikia sites like these with this project:
* [[wikiasite:Conworld]]
* [[wikiasite:Conlang]]
* [[w:Conworld|Conworld]]
* [[w:Conlang|Conlang]]
Are there Templates for beautified interwiki Links for the above (WP and Wikia) on en.wikibooks? -- [[Special:Contributions/80.136.66.147|80.136.66.147]] ([[User talk:80.136.66.147|talk]]) 09:16, 25 April 2008 (UTC)

== What about even more ambitious conworlding projects? ==

So far this set of wikibooks are pretty good in covering more common con-world projects (e.g., creating a language, a culture, maps, or even planets), but what about even more complex or ambitious projects?

For example, I know of a project involving a universe where there aren't stars and galaxies and planets, but spherical worlds formed by the emanation of something called 'ley'.

One of my past personal projects also involved the creation of an entire universe complete with its own version of the Big Bang, its own physics and elementary particles (if it can be called that; those &quot;elements&quot; are completely unlike particles in the real world), resulting in a complex structure only a small part of which is inhabited. It was much fun to start with completely different premises than the real universe and discover the consequences of your choices as you go. (The resulting world was also extremely foreign, completely unlike &quot;our&quot; universe in almost every respect.)

And what about fantasy worlds where there aren't planets and galaxies as such, but planes (astral planes?) and other large-scale structures? It would be nice to discuss these different approaches to con-universe structure.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:208.181.115.4|208.181.115.4]] ([[User talk:208.181.115.4|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/208.181.115.4|contribs]]) 00:32, 8 July 2008.&lt;/small&gt;

== Objectives of this series ==

I've rewritten the paragraph of the main page about what this series of books is for.  It seemed too easy to infer, from the old paragraph, that each of these books is just a short summary of a subject for people too lazy to read an actual book on that subject &amp;mdash; which would be a slap in the face to both the books and the readers.  Poor form, to suggest either that the readers are lazy, or that if they aren't lazy they shouldn't bother with these books.  Poor policy, to tell prospective authors of these books that they should aim low.  I realize I'm setting the bar for these books almost impossibly high, but some of these proposed books should be able to reach that high &amp;mdash; and in the long run, IMO, the ones that can't probably shouldn't be kept.  Although it might not actually be practical to ask that the entire series eventually become Featured Books, it still seems that a book with no hope of ever achieving that status is underjustified.

The question I set out to answer was, what would make it worthwhile to read these books as something other than scaled-down versions of good introductory books on their subjects?  Otherwise, the thing to do would be to make sure wikibooks has good introductory books on all these subjects.  Before tackling the paragraph here I honed my thoughts on the subproblem of objectives for the [[Conlang]] wikibook, which is after all a particularly separable part of the series.  (Conlanging is often logically, as well as historically, prior to conworlding:  building languages doesn't ''require'' any peripheral constructions, while at the same time it tends to motivate and inspire them, as with Tolkien who created languages and then found that to make the languages sufficiently rich he had to build an entire cosmos to go around them.)  But a good introductory book on linguistics isn't going to be a good introduction to conlanging (unless, perhaps, deliberately designed from that perspective), and in fact the Conlang wikibook has had to struggle continuously against the linguistics-book impulse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sociology as a science of the social phenomena is interested in &quot;Infancy&quot; as an object of study under multiple aspects; we will quote only some examples:
*The change of the view on infancy described by the historians and conceptualized by the sociologists in terms status and role, the statute being allotted by l exterior (the company) him lai$ant more or less of freedom to assume the role qu'il is supposed to play there. Industrialization, the migration of the campaigns towards the city, the work of the children having burst the old family structures, sociology studied in detail the social relations with l interior of this new reduced family structure and to which places it assigns the children. Well other changes of the company, the m?urs, the family was described and analyzed by the sociologists from the point of view of their impact on infancy: Emancipation of the women (the replacement of paternal authority with parental authority), multiplication of the cases of divorce and l'attribution of the custody charge of the children and in a concomitant way multiplication of the recomposed families prolongation of the schooling; the unemployment of the young people and their prolonged stay in the residence of the parents.

Another phenomenon was analyzed very finely by sociology: c'est the increasing sum of pocket money at the disposal of the child which was planned in term to be able d'achat d'un specific group of the company which became the privileged target d'une publicity specifically conceived with its intention.

Sociology also highlighted that in the various social layers which make a company, the status and roles of the members d'une family are not in the same way defined. Aujourd'hui one can also - grace, inter alia, with sociology - evaluate health or pathology d'un family group by holding account of its behavior vis-a-vis with waitings qu'a the company towards him. This last point forms part of the theorization d'une particular psychological therapy qu'est the family therapy that, for lack of place, we will not n'aborderons here.

A last point - in particular compared to sociology - must be underlined: two close sciences (here psychology and sociology) can have the same subject of study (Infancy) but arrive at apparently contradictory results if one is unaware of that the point of view on an object of study is never same the science with the other and that methodologies diverge.

Thus, sociology studied the evolutions of the role and statute of the father and the mother with l interior of the family following l emancipation of the women, and how the infant was implied in these changes. In parallel, the psychologists highlighted that simultaneously with this evolution in the imagination of the infants the mother always represents love, protection and permissiveness whereas the father continues to represent the law and repression.

This point must point out qu'il to us is necessary always much prudence when one wants to generalize a phenomenon observed and more still when one seeks to transpose it from one science to another.

== 6 count basic section ==

I have a few comments on the 6 count basic section. 

The basic step I was taught has the back step coming first.  Using the numbers for the steps listed here, the lead starts with #5 then 6 then 1 on through the rest of the steps. And, for the follow it is a mirror image of the lead, going back with the right foot instead of the left. 

Plus, I was tempted to just delete the word &quot;crap.&quot;  Instead I'll just say I don't think personal opinions about the triple step was a proper thing to add.  Actually for a beginner, I wouldn't have mention that any step taking up those 4 counts could be substituted for the side/side moves.  They usually have enough trouble remembering to keep frame while keeping count to the basic step.

This is a wiki, so anything that you see that you feel like you can improve, you should change.

== Is this a how-to? ==

I think that this would make a fine addition to the how to section. Just because it isn't written like crap and doesn't baby the reader, doesn't mean it wouldn't be good there.

== Naming and types of dance to include ==
[[User:220.253.16.253|220.253.16.253]] As with the [[swing dance]] wikipedia article, it might make sense to distinguish between the swing dances under discussion in this book - eg [[lindy hop]], [[west coast swing]], etc etc etc - and to make some sort of comment about the types of steps which are most frequently associated with each style _historically_ and in the current swing dancing world.

== Overall Structure ==
[[User:220.253.16.253|220.253.16.253]] It might be useful to reference the history of 'swing dancing' at the beginning of the article, and then to divide each section into specific styles (with some sort of disclaimer at the beginning making it clear that it's perfectly ok to borrow from each style in the social context), with a comment about each style. Not to reproduce the individual wikipedia articles, but to perhaps make it clear that 'swing dancing' is a wide genre, made up of many styles (with different histories).

== Cultural Specificity ==

[[User:220.253.16.253|220.253.16.253]] It's important to note that 'swing dances' and 'swing dancing' culture are different in each city and local scene. For eg, there is almost no [[west coast swing]] dancing in Australia, yet [[ceroc]] and [[rock and roll]] are very popular and quite similar in dance style, yet differnt in culture. The discussion of etiquette in this wikibook is a good example.

== Reorganization ==

I'm going to suggest some basic reorganization here.  Per other Wikibooks that I've seen and liked, I think it makes the most sense to have the Swing Dancing page as a Table of Contents for the Manual.  Then the subpages (e.g. East Coast Basic, Charleston Basic, Lindy Hop Basic, Intermediate Moves, etc.) link off of that.  If no one has any objections I'll be bold in the next few days.--[[User:Will.i.am|Will.i.am]] 23:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
*OK, I did it.  I did some major revamping of the structure here to make it all un-orphaned and easier to follow.  Now all it needs is some TLC.--[[User:Will.i.am|Will.i.am]] 23:14, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Application for visualisation ==
Just a heads up if you want to add some pictures of the steps to this book. There is a nice free Java application, that can be used for illustrating dancing steps that already has the basic moves for all dances built in. Have a look here:
http://www.sebastianbauer.info/index.php?page=simpledance
If you create new moves, don't forget to write a mail to the author, so he can make them available to everyone. --[[Special:Contributions/84.178.123.44|84.178.123.44]] ([[User talk:84.178.123.44|talk]]) 16:19, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

Scripts, or writing systems, are one of the first things many people notice when they come in contact with another language. Many people, at some point in their life, have tried making some sort of &quot;code&quot;, with a one-to-one correspondence between their symbols and their native language's letters. Read on to learn how to make a realistic script for a language.

== Types of Script ==

There are 5 main types of scripts.  This page lists them in order from most to least advanced.  The less advanced the system is, the harder it is to learn and change: 

#'''Alphabets''' are the type you may be more familiar with. They consist of a series of symbols, usually between 10 and 45, where each symbol represents a consonant or vowel in the language. Some may have some duplicate letters (e.g., English C, K, and Q), but these usually have some historical meaning, discussed later on. Other will have symbols for consonant clusters, such as Greek &quot;Ξ&quot; /ks/, Cyrillic &quot;Ц&quot; /ts/, or even English &quot;X&quot; /ks, gz/.
#'''Abjads''', also known as Consonantal Alphabets, mark consonants but not vowels. Arabic and Hebrew are examples. While these do have a means of showing vowels, via ''diacritics'', they usually are not shown, except in children's books, books for foreigners, or religious texts. Some, such as Phoenician, had no system for marking vowels at all! They usually contain between 15 and 35 symbols.
#'''Abugidas''' contain consonants paired with vowels that can be changed with diacritics. Hindi and many other South Asian languages are examples. Each symbol has an &quot;inherent vowel&quot;, commonly /a/, so you have each individual symbol meaning /pa/, /ba/, /ta/, /da/, etc. The vowels can be changed or muted with diacritics. They usually contain between 30 and 60 symbols, not counting diacritics.
#'''Syllabaries''' contain different symbols for every syllable in the language, such as Amharic, Yi, or Cherokee. In other words, there is a separate syllable for /ka/, /ke/, /ki/, /ko/, etc., for each vowel and consonant. The symbols standing for the same consonant may be related (as in Ojibwe, where symbols are rotated), or may bear no resemblance to other symbols, such as in Yi or Cherokee. Syllabaries generally range in size between about 40 symbols and up to 400, with Yi being the largest standardized one, with over 800.
#'''Logographic''' systems contain symbols that represent single morphemes, or the smallest meaningful unit in language. (e.g. &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;-er&quot;, &quot;un-&quot; in English.) Many languages contain some logographic symbols, such as &quot;1&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, and &quot;&amp;&quot;, but there are some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, ancient Egyptian, and Mayan, that use(d) logographs to represent much or all of their entire language.

Ideographic systems use one symbol for one thought or idea. Since languages aren't made up directly of thoughts and ideas, and writing systems represent language, true ideographic systems do not exist. They will be covered for the purposes of &quot;alien&quot; languages, though. Chinese is often described as &quot;ideographic&quot; -- this is either just a loose use of the term to mean &quot;logographic&quot;, or it is a misunderstanding -- Chinese characters do not represent ideas directly.  Japanese kanji come closer to the &quot;ideographic&quot; ideal, with one symbol representing any of several synonyms in context.

=== Alphabets ===

Alphabets are the dominant writing system in use in Europe and areas formerly colonized by Europe. Basically, they represent one symbol per sound, including vowel sounds.

All too often, however, alphabets, especially the Latin alphabet, are more complex. Each symbol often represents more than one sound, sometimes distinguished in the language, sometimes not. For example, English &lt;c&gt; represents /k/ and /s/, &lt;x&gt; /ks/ and /gz/ (as in e&lt;u&gt;x&lt;/u&gt;ist), or &lt;a&gt; /a/, /A/, /{/, /O/, or /@/.  The main reason for this is that the Latin alphabet was made for Latin and simply adapted for later languages.  English itself had originally used a runic script, as did the Scandinavian languages.  Latin written in the Latin script is entirely phonetic.  

Many alphabets also have combinations of letters representing a completely different sound. These are called ''digraphs''. In English, the main consonant digraphs are &lt;sh&gt; /S/, &lt;ch&gt; /tS/, and &lt;ng&gt; /N/, plus many others. ''Diphthongs'', or vowel-combinations, also occur often. English &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; represents /aj/ as well as /i/ or /I/. Some languages make use of digraphs for diphthongs, such as &lt;ei&gt; for /ej/.

Note that situations like the above happen very often. As languages change, their orthography (writing system) may adapt, but not always grow to match it. Almost never does a language have letters that represent only one sound but no others. A realistic con-script should not have a direct correspondence between English and itself as well.

Diacritics are another method alphabets may use. Creating new symbols can be difficult and hard to remember, so many languages created &quot;diacritics&quot;, or small, additional strokes, to letters to mark new sounds. The main diacritics used in Latin script languages are the acute: ' (á,é, etc., and usually mark stress), the grave (à, è, etc.), the circumflex (â, ê), the diaeresis (ä, ë), the tilde (ã, ñ, usually marking nasalization on vowels), the cedilla (ç), and many others. &quot;Ligatures&quot;, or combinations of letters, may also be brought in, such as &quot;æ&quot;. The symbol &quot;&amp;&quot; is actually a heavily-modified ligature of &lt;E&gt; and &lt;T&gt;, making &quot;et&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;and&quot;.

Some languages, though, do make new letters, which are often based on previous systems. Examples include the &quot;þ&quot; (thorn, /T/), which was derived from a rune (ᚦ) and &quot;ð&quot; (eth, /D/), developed in the Middle Ages, which are used in Icelandic, Old English, and several related languages.

Some letters may not make a sound themselves, but do affect other letters. For example, the Cyrillic &lt;&amp;#x042c;&gt; (soft sign) palatalizes the consonant before it. Some letters can perform both a function and a sound, such as the Russian &lt;&amp;#x042f;&gt; (&quot;ya&quot;), which both palatalizes the previous consonant and is pronounced /a/.

There are a few scripts termed featural which tend to be similar to alphabets but show phonemic features rather than phonemes themselves. The best example is undoubtedly Korean hangeul, though featural elements also occur in a few other scripts, such as Japanese hiragana and katakana, which are mostly syllabaries but take diacritics to indicate voicing.

*''Greek''
*''Georgian''
*''Armenian''
*''Mongolian''

=== Abjads ===

Abjads are the main writing system of the Middle East. Basically, they mark consonants in an alphabetic fashion, but vowels are not typically marked.

The Arabic and Hebrew abjads are entirely composed of consonants. Vowels can be marked, but generally aren't. Arabic has six vowel marks. Three of them, the 'short vowels', are only marked with diacritics. The other three, the 'long vowels', share symbols with some of the consonants. /a/ shares 'alif /?/, /i/ shares yaa /j/, and /u/ shares waaw /w/. When they are treated as consonants or as vowels can be more clearly seen when vowels are shown.

Arabic has an additional diacritic called the &quot;sukuun&quot;, meaning the letter it is placed over does not have a vowel over it. If the sukuun is placed over 'alif, yaa, or waaw, they function as consonants. If there is no sukuun, but instead a vowel marker, they become long vowels. They can also become diphthongs if they have a sukuun, but the previous consonant has a vowel. So, the following form is pronounced /kaj/:

Ø a

Y K

(where Ø is the sukuun, and remember that Arabic is read from right to left).

Since vowels aren't usually marked, pronunciation has to be inferred by context. The sequence &quot;KY&quot; (using English order) can be pronounced:

/ kaja kajI kajV kIja kIjI kIjV kVja kVjI kVjV kaj /

==== Examples of Natlang Abjads ====

*''Urdu''
*''Hebrew'' (including Hebrew and Yiddish)
*''Syriac'' (used by modern Syriac/Aramaic)
*''Phoenician and Demotic'', all extinct.

=== Abugidas ===

Abugidas are the main writing system of India, other South Asian countries, and South-East Asia. They are basically a group of syllables with a common inherent vowel, which has to be changed with diacritics.

All syllables start out with an inherent vowel, usually /a/, and a different consonant: ka, ca, &lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;a, ta, pa, etc. These each have their own symbol. So, say you want to make the syllable &lt;ki&gt;. The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; diacritic is then added to the &lt;ka&gt; symbol, and negates the /a/. Note that in the Indian and South-East Asian languages diacritics can come before and after a letter instead of only above or below.

Hindi has diacritics for all of its vowels and diphthongs - a, e, i, o, u, r, ai, and au. But what if a word or syllable begins with a vowel? There are two ways you could potentially handle this. In most of the abugidas of Asia, there is a set of &quot;independent vowels&quot;, which are full letters just like any of the other consonants, and their purpose is only for syllable-initial vowels.

The other way is not done in any of the South Asian abugidas, but still doable. Just make a &quot;vowel carrier&quot;, a letter that makes no sound, but can carry vowel diacritics, like the Hebrew aleph.

Many of these abugidas also contain &quot;Conjunct Consonants&quot;, which you don't have to do too. These are basically ligatures, where the form of two letters are combined into one &quot;space&quot;, and they together can take a vowel. For example, when &quot;ta&quot; and &quot;ka&quot; are combined, they become &quot;tka&quot;, which can take diacritics like any other consonant.

*''Telugu'', used by Telugu.
*''Tibetan'', used by Tibetan and Dzongkha
*''Thai''
*''Khmer''
*''Lao''
*''Burmese'', used by Burmese, Mon, and the Karen languages.

=== Syllabaries ===

Syllabaries are spread around the world in use. They contain separate symbols for every CV (consonant + vowel) combination in the language, although final consonants have many ways of being done.

Here is an example of a typical syllabary, romanized. This is the Cree system:

 ê pê tê kê cê mê nê sê šê yê wê rê lê
 i pi ti ki ci mi ni si ši yi wi ri li
 î pî tî kî cî mî nî sî šî yî wî rî lî
 o po to ko co mo no so šo yo wo ro lo
 ô pô tô kô cô mô nô sô šô yô wô rô lô
 a pa ta ka ca ma na sa ša ya wa ra la
 â pâ tâ kâ câ mâ nâ sâ šâ yâ wâ râ lâ
 
 -h -p -t -k -c -m -n -s -š -y -w -r -l

Note that there are also symbols for the vowels alone. To make final consonants (of the CVC form), the last row of symbols, called the &quot;Finals&quot;, are added. So, &quot;tak&quot; would be written with two symbols: &lt;ta&gt; and &lt;-k&gt;. Many syllabaries use this method, and it is basically limited to languages with a small number of legal final consonants.

Another system for finals, used by the Mayan syllabary system, is the &quot;Principle of Synharmony&quot;. This states that a final vowel is marked by reduplicating the previous vowel. For example, a word like &quot;kalo&quot; is done with two symbols, as usual: ka-lo. But, if you want the syllable &quot;kal&quot;, the previous vowel is repeated: ka-la. Since the vowel was repeated, it is ignored on the second syllable. This applies for any vowel. But what if you want to make the syllable &quot;kala&quot;? That requires three syllables, adding in a simple vowel: ka-la-a. The second &quot;a&quot; is negated, but returned by the next syllable.

A third system, used by Hittite, comprised of two sets of syllables, one set in CV form, and another set in VC form.  This way, when a syllable of the form C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;VC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was needed, one would write C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V-VC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for instance, &amp;lt;ka&amp;gt;&amp;lt;al&amp;gt; for &quot;kal&quot;.  Additionally, when the vowel in question needed to be made long, like &quot;kāl&quot;, the pattern became C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V-V-VC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: &amp;lt;ka&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;al&amp;gt;. For &quot;kala&quot; one would simply write &amp;lt;ka&amp;gt;&amp;lt;la&amp;gt; as the /l/ would move onto the next syllable.

Sometimes, though not always, syllables with a relation, such as the same consonant, look similar. For example, the syllables &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ke&quot;, &quot;ki&quot;, etc., may look similar. In systems such as in Ojibwe, the vowel signs are changed by simply rotating the symbol around.

==== Examples of Natlang Syllabaries ====

*''Cree (rotational)'', used by Ojibwe, Cree, Inuktitut, and many other Native American languages; collectively may be known as &quot;Aboriginal Syllabics&quot;.
*''Cherokee''
*''Ethiopian'', used by Amharic, Ge'ez, Tigrinya, and several other languages
*''Katakana and Hiragana'', used by Japanese
*''Yi''
*''Cypriot, Linear B, and Celtiberian'', all extinct

And many more systems.

==== Semisyllabaries ====

There is a set of scripts from pre-Roman Spain that sit in an intermediate category between true alphabets and syllabaries. In those scripts, the plosives combine with the following vowels in a single syllabogram — for instance, there is a single symbol for PA, another for PI, another for PE, etc. — but all other consonants and vowels also have single symbols.  In such a system, for example, the phrase &quot;barenarkenti&quot; would be spelled with the nine symbols &amp;lt;ba&amp;gt; &amp;lt;r&amp;gt; &amp;lt;e&amp;gt; &amp;lt;n&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;r&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ke&amp;gt; &amp;lt;n&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ti&amp;gt;.  In fact, it's likely that such systems evolved out of so-called ''redundant alphabets'', where the stops had separate signs depending on the vowel that followed them, much like the ancient Etruscan alphabet, where the /k/ sound was written &amp;lt;K&amp;gt; before &amp;lt;A&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;C&amp;gt; before &amp;lt;E&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;Q&amp;gt; before &amp;lt;U&amp;gt; (the Etruscan language lacked an /o/ sound).

=== Logographic systems ===

Logographic systems are/were used to write Chinese, Japanese, ancient Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, and many other languages. Ancient civilizations created logography first, and then evolved them into other systems.

In a logographic system, each symbol represents a morpheme, or the smallest meaningful part of language. For example, &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;-er&quot;, &quot;-ist&quot;, &quot;un-&quot; and &quot;anti-&quot; are all morphemes. In a logographic system, each of these would get its own symbol. As you can probably imagine, there are thousands of morphemes in most languages, and hence thousands of symbols exist in any logographic system.

However, these symbols are not all random. In general, symbols of words that represent visible ideas or things are often little drawings. (Remember though that writing constantly develops, so after a few thousand years, there wouldn't be too much resemblance left!) For example, words like &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;flower&quot;, etc. are likely to be drawn as pictures.

Not all words can be drawn this way, though. How are you going to draw &quot;love&quot;, or &quot;-er&quot;, or &quot;anti-&quot;? Different languages had different approaches. In some cases a word with a similar pronunciation is substituted, for example, writing &quot;ant&quot; to mean &quot;anti-&quot;. If you do this often enough, you're on your way to a syllabary, an abugida, or an abjad. In some cases however, another picture is drawn to &quot;explain&quot; the new word: for example, you might draw a spear next to &quot;ant&quot; to mean &quot;anti-&quot; -- spear means you're opposed, right? In ancient Egyptian, the spear would be set aside as a separate symbol, while in Chinese the spear would be incorporated into the &quot;ant&quot; symbol to make a new symbol for &quot;anti-&quot;. (This is why scripts like Egyptian are sometimes called logophonetic, a name also applied to languages using a mix of logographs and some other system.) The choice here is really up to you.

In fact, it is estimated that 90%+ of Chinese characters are formed using the above method: taking an existing symbol with a similar pronunciation, and incorporating another symbol to explain the meaning. Over time, however, these characters' shapes have fossilized, and a lot of sound and meaning changes occur, so some characters are made up of symbols that really don't represent their meanings or sounds very well any more.

*''Zapotec''
*''Mixtec''
*''Aztec''

Now, if you have decided what kind of writing system you want, there are three more steps left to take: Writing Direction, Script History, and Mediums of Writing. Then you can get on to the actual script-making.

== Writing direction ==

All scripts have a certain writing direction. Latin writes from left-to-right. Hebrew and Arabic write from right-to-left. Mongolian is top-to-bottom. These are the main types of directions accounted for in real Earth scripts:

* Left-to-Right: English, Cyrillic, Greek, and many other systems.
* Right-to-Left: Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, Assyrian, and several other systems.
* Top-to-Bottom: Mongolian, and sometimes in Chinese
* Boustrophedon: Ancient Greek

&quot;Boustrophedon&quot; is where on one line a text is read left-to-right, on the next right-to-left, on the next left-to-right again, and so forth.

 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE
 ИI HƧI˩GИƎ FO
 BOUSTROPHEDON
 .Ǝ˩YTƧ


Note that in Ancient Greek, a Boustrophedon language, sometimes the letters would literally be flipped over when reading in the other direction. So, for example, the Greek letter &lt;F&gt; ('digamma') would be &lt;F&gt; when read left-to-right, but the prongs would face left when reading right-to-left.

If you would like to stick with one of the above methods, go ahead. Most scripts use them. A few more complex systems are described below:

Some scripts can be written in many directions, that is, left-to-right, right-to-left, and top-to-bottom are all acceptable. Chinese and Ancient Egyptian do/did this. In Ancient Egyptian, all of the hieroglyphs with a face would face toward the direction in which to start reading. So, if you were reading right-to-left, all of the hieroglyphs that had a face (or a discernible front side) would 'face' right. In Chinese, it must be determined by context.

Another system is the &quot;Rotational&quot; system, a very rare one. As far as I know, only one script ever used it, Rongorongo (the Easter Island script). It is similar to boustrophedon, except that the letters also rotate 180 degrees after each line! If you rotate the reading board around after each line, they would look normal. Here is an example of this using English letters:

[[Image:English rongorongo.svg|English written in a rotational style similar to that of Rongorongo]]

Some other ideas that (so far) have not been used:

*Spiraling in or out
*Writing in clockwise or counterclockwise circles, rotating each character as you write; essentially left to right or right to left but with each sentence on a separate ring outside the last.
*Vertexual; each part of the sentence is on its own line, which points towards a vertex that the entire sentence converges at.

== Script history ==

Scripts are not static. They change constantly, just as language does. Compare writing like Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and modern Latin script. Believe it or not, modern Latin script ultimately derives from ''Proto-Sinaitic'', a small collection of Egyptian hieroglyphs. These hieroglyphs were later adopted into Phoenician, where they were drastically simplified and each assigned a single sound. Through heavy contact with the Phoenicians, soon the Greeks adopted their alphabet, but changed some of their consonant letters, representing sounds that don't exist in Greek, into the Greek vowel signs. Sometime, though we're not entirely sure why, Greek started being written in boustrophedon instead of right-to-left, and then ultimately stuck with left-to-right. When this switch occurred, all of the letters were 'flipped' over horizontally, giving the modern-day Greek alphabet. Then the Etruscans and Latins in the Italian peninsula adopted the Greek alphabet with minor modifications, the Latin one ultimately becoming the script now used throughout most of Europe. Cyrillic script also came from Greek, after the Russians' conversion to Orthodox Christianity, and after about 1,000 years of change, the modern Cyrillic alphabet came to be.

|}

In Proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician the letter stood for the glottal stop /?/, but Greek lacked this sound, so it became /a/.

&quot;A&quot; originally started out as 'aleph, the ox. Later the body disappeared, leaving only the head. Then the head was simplified to a simple line, leaving the most distinctive parts (the horns) intact. Eventually the horns pierced the line, and the letter flipped on its side in Phoenician. In Greek, it was flipped again, and after several lines were trimmed down, it became the modern Latin/Greek/Cyrillic &quot;A&quot;.

Note the change of complexity. Early writing is almost guaranteed to be some sort of picture-writing like hieroglyphics, where each symbol represents exactly what it looks like. But, as time goes on and writing spreads, for many this just became pointless complexity. The symbols start to simplify and sometimes turn into alphabets. When one literate people start to trade with an illiterate one, their writing system has a very good opportunity to spread. Sometimes one script wins over another. For example, in ancient India, there were two main scripts used: Brahmi and Kharosthi, but Kharosthi fell out of use and now all of the major scripts of India and parts of South-East Asia are descended from it.

Sometimes the early pictographic systems never simplify that much. In the Ancient Chinese writing, the characters did change, but many did not simplify as significantly as the Proto-Sinaitic ones. The modern Chinese logographic system is still very complex. The major reform in 1949 was instituted by the Chinese government.

One thing to note is the diversity of scripts in Europe compared to South-East Asia. Almost all of Europe uses Latin script or Cyrillic script, but in South-East Asia every country has at least one of its own scripts. This was probably because of the Roman Empire. The Romans unified most of Europe and had their script well established before they fell, and their script stayed. Such an empire did not exist in South-East Asia, leading to the vast diversity of scripts.

So, basically, the ancient hieroglyphic systems simplify when they are no longer only for priestly use, and therefore can be abbreviated. For the common person, carefully elaborating each symbol is just a major waste of time. This is still true today, to a lesser extent, but that is where cursive came from. Even the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs had heavily-reduced forms, known as &quot;Demotic&quot;, and this was used by the common person. You can see demotic, for example, in the middle section of the Rosetta Stone [http://www.ba.dlr.de/ne/pe/virtis/rose2.gif]. (Warning: Very big image)

Here is a good chart showing the evolution of a single symbol through the South-East Asian languages: [http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/south1.gif]

== Mediums of Writing ==

The surface upon which a script is written actually does influence the script a great deal. When carved into stone, such as in the Fuþark or Runic scripts, the letters tend to be very angular and composed of straight lines. Curves are harder to do in stone than on paper. Also, despite being carved on stone in the Rosetta Stone, the Egyptian Demotic script is much more 'fluid' than the hieroglyphs, and it generally was written on papyrus.

The ancient Sumerians wrote on clay, using a reed stylus to impress symbols on it. This also gives it a very unique look. This type of writing is known as &quot;Cuneiform&quot;.

Some modern languages, such as [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese.htm Burmese], retain their unique scripts from the past. The rounded shape of Burmese stems from the fact that it was originally written on palm leaves, which would tear if there were too many straight lines.

In the mixed-case systems of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts (meaning there is both an &quot;upper-case&quot; (majuscule) and a &quot;lower-case&quot; (minuscule)), the lower-case forms came from cursive versions of the capital letters.

Now, if you have thought about your script and chosen a script type, writing direction, and a medium, now you are ready to create your own script.

If you want to create your own cultures and societies, they will need a Con'''Planet''', or at least a local geography, to influence their beliefs, culture, and interactions. The materials provided in this section deal with how to create a realistic world for your peoples to inhabit.

Geoff Eddy has an excellent guide for creating planets[http://www.cix.co.uk/~morven/worldkit/index.html], which can be extremely helpful. Another website that deals with the scientific side of creating worlds is Anne Viau's [http://www.world-builders.org World-Builders.org].

The members at [http://www.unilang.org/ Unilang] started a wiki online called [http://planet.langwiki.info/ ConPlanet] allowing users to participate and interactively construct their con-nation alongside others in the conworld.

I think Header could be advantageously used. More internal links, or even a synopsis table would also be great. (there's no way to know that the resume at the top of the page are extended below.) - Circéus

:I'm sorry, what do you mean by a &quot;synopsis table&quot; and &quot;resume at the top&quot;? -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 16:45, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I've added some headers and altered some of the formatting. The page is now easier to navigate. What do you think? --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 16:56, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::Well, It's done now anyway. I'm just not familiar enough with the correct wikivocabulary, I guess. Circeus

: Oh, wow, that's nice. I didn't know how to do the codeboxes in Wiki before, that's why I had to drop them. Thanks Ingolemo! -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 17:20, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)


== Romanization ==


How about a romanization section? Maybe it should go into it's own beginner section? I'll write it if you're okay with me adding it. --[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 19:47, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I just noticed there was a small note on it at the end of [[Conlang: Beginner Sounds|Sounds]], we might want to expand it into it's own section. --[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 12:28, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Logographic Systems ==

The following is written about logographic systems: &quot;In a logographic system, each symbol represents a morpheme, or the smallest meaningful part of language.&quot;  That's nowhere even close to true, and very misleading.  In no natural logographic system is this true.  Even in Chinese, there are some glyphs used for more than one word, and some words comprised of more than one glyph (where each glyph either has no independent meaning, or has a meaning that's separate from the meaning produced by combining it with the other).  And that's just Chinese.  In Egyptian, glyphs were used: (1) to stand for words; (2) to stand for phoneme strings; (3) to stand for sounds; (4) to stand for syllables; and (5) to stand for ideas.  Most often, what a Chomskyan linguist would call an inflectional &quot;morpheme&quot; was rendered with a phoneme glyph (though, of course, that same glyph could be used, in combination with a line determinative, to stand for whatever picture it resembled).  In short, this section is, at the very least, biased, and, at worst, hopelessly inaccurate, and I think it should be changed.  [[User:Dedalvs|Dedalvs]] ([[User talk:Dedalvs|talk]]) 21:00, 24 July 2008 (UTC)

:The whole organizational plan of the module starts to fall apart after the first four of the main types of script (which may be related to the notice at the top, '''The text in its current form is incomplete''').  Wikipedia gives, [[Wikipedia:Writing system#Functional classification of writing systems|yonder]], ''six'' types and also admits that systems are apt not to be purely of one type.  The confusion seems to be compounded by a disparity in common usage between ''logographic system'' and ''logograph'' &amp;mdash; apparently, under this usage, symbols in a logographic system are not necessarily logographs.  The question isn't whether such usage is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, but how this module ought to finesse it.  IMO the point about mixed types really ought to be made here. Perhaps the six-type scheme should be adopted.  There are also some topics that are now just sort-of hanging &amp;mdash; off hand, I see ''ideographic system'' and ''logophonetic system'' mentioned but not very well addressed (both closely related to ''logographic system'').

== Meaningless Alphabet ==
Does any conlang or natlang have an alphabet where a letter doesn't represent anything alone?

I've always been brought up with Aggregate Demand (AD), not AE (Aggregate Expenditure?). Advice? Opinion? --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 22:54, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Change==
I've created a proposal list of chapters to change to, a [[Template:Macrobar]] to be used as navigation, and a basic first chapter that gives an overview of economics.  I think the present structure throws out the windows any logical order of learning concepts and breaks it down into chunks which are too small.  I don't recommonmend just throwing it out however, but integrating it into the new scheme, which can expand or change easily based on others' input.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 03:25, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

== Update ==

Is anyone currently working on this wikibook? I can't seem to see many recent changes in the economics bookshelf.... [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)


I suggest that these subjects be covered under a section for GDP, not Aggregate Demand (these are all listed under [[Macroeconomics/Aggregate Demand|Aggregate Demand]] in the pre-change TOC).

==Discussions==

===Content===
It would seem that a book should be viewed in it's entirety and not as a semblance of the whole, therefore I believe there should be some information on the history of macroeconomics including subjects such as Keynes [[User:Eroyce|Eroyce]] 15:00:34, 15 December 2005

I would agree- in most books I've read, the history of economics was brought up in the introduction, and again as it was necessary. An example would be explaining keynesian and classical economics with the aggregate supply curve, and maybe throw something in there about the 1929 stock market crash. Most of this book needs to be looked over and edited fairly heavily, though. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 21:04, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Organization ==

this book should be organized, and links made, before any major changes are added. Also, the name of this book should be 'Principles of Macroeconomics'- to avoid confusion- there is no macroeconomic theory in this book. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 16:58, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

Our history has determined almost every aspect of lives. It has influenced where we live, our religious beliefs, the languages we speak, how we govern ourselves, relations with others around the world, and many other things.  Just as Earth has thousands of years of human history shaping the modern world, so would a conworld have its own Con'''History''', whether it is longer or shorter.  The information in this wikibook will help you develop your own conworld's history and to shape its present.

Be careful when trying to demonstrate noun incorporation, as the reader might reanalyze an utterance like this as a less exotic inflecting SOV clause:

Conlangs are classified into types and subtypes based mainly on why they are created.  The three basic types are ''enge''langs ('''eng'''ineered languages), ''aux''langs ('''aux'''iliary languages), and ''art''langs ('''art'''istic languages).

Whatever your reason for making a language, it's good to keep always in mind why you started it in the first place.

== Engineered languages ==

'''Engelangs''', sometimes called '''englangs''', are conlangs designed to meet objective criteria, rather than subjective goals like &quot;elegance&quot; or &quot;ease of use&quot;.  For example, one might design an engelang so that the arrangement of sounds in a word classifies its meaning; or so that its grammatical structure imitates formal logic; or so that its expressions conform to a certain ideology or point of view (say, Taoism, or feminism).  Subjective goals are always around &amp;mdash; motivating the choice of objective criteria, and filling in gaps in the language design that the objective criteria don't address.  As long as the technical criteria take precedence when deciding features of the language design, it's an engelang.

Be aware (and beware) that the names for this type of conlang and its subtypes vary a bit across the conlanging community.  What we're calling ''engelangs'' here, some conlangers call ''loglangs'' (a term we're using just for the ones that implement formal logic); and some other conlangers call them ''philosophical languages'' (a term we're using for a subtype of engelangs distinct from loglangs).

=== Logical languages ===

'''Loglangs''' are conlangs built around the structure of formal logic.  They are usually designed to investigate how the human mind would work when using a language with that structure.  Logical languages tend to have few or no irregularities and be similar in style to computer programming or markup languages.  They advocate a logical and consistent architectural structure of utterances.  Lojban, a language created to test the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis (the idea that language shapes the operation of the mind), is considered archetypal of the genre.  Others are like Ithkuil, a language created by John Quijada:  Ithkuil exists as an exercise in how human languages ''could'' function.  These often overlap with philosophical languages.

Some examples of loglangs:
*[[w:Loglan|Loglan]] &amp;mdash; developed in the mid-twentieth century, originally as a tool with which to test the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis.
*[[w:Lojban|Lojban]] &amp;mdash; a community-driven offshoot of Loglan.  Its development is ongoing.
*[[w:Ceqli|Ceqli]] &amp;mdash; originally inspired by Loglan, then took a turn toward the naturalistic.
*[[w:CycL|CycL]] &amp;mdash; a knowledge representation language, for an attempt to create artificial intelligence through vast accumulation of knowledge. 
*[[w:Ithkuil|Ithkuil]] &amp;mdash; intended to express thoughts precisely and densely.

=== Philosophical languages ===

'''Philosophical languages''' are conlangs constructed to meet some philosophical goal.  This goal can be to explore how the mind works by altering the fundamental structure of the language (which is the aim of some loglangs, such as Ithkuil), or it can be to see if language is even ''possible'' when certain elements are changed.  In general, philosophical languages are experimental.

In some of them, for example, all the words for manmade objects (artifacts) will typically begin with the same letter, '''t''' for instance, all the words for pieces of furniture will begin with '''to-''', the word for &quot;chair&quot; will be ''tod'', words for different types of chairs will begin with '''tod-''', organisms will begin with '''v''', plant species will begin with '''ve-''' while animals begin with '''vu-''', all vertebrates will begin with '''vuz-''', mammals with '''vuzu-''' and rodents with '''vuzum-'''. 

A common criticism of languages that use such a word categorization system is that the words that are most similar in meaning and topic, and will therefore most need to be distinguished from each other, will sound too alike, and become too confusable to learn, even though the goal of these languages is usually to make memorization easier.  In a few of these languages a single phoneme or very short (two-letter) syllable will indicate an element of meaning, such as &quot;light/vision&quot;, &quot;female&quot;, or &quot;many&quot;.

Some examples of philosophical languages:

*[[w:An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|Wilkins' philosophical language]] &amp;mdash; seventeenth century classification language.  It has been described as paving the way for Roget's Thesaurus.
*[[w:aUI (constructed language)|aUI]] &amp;mdash; 1960s.  Each sound has a meaning, and the meanings of words are built up from the meanings of the sounds.
*[[w:Ro (artificial language)|Ro]] &amp;mdash; early twentieth century classification language.  One of its supporters was Melvil Dewey, creator of the Dewey Decimal System.
*[http://www.ygyde.neostrada.pl/ Ygyde]&lt;!-- [[w:Ygyde|Ygyde]] --&gt; &amp;mdash; twenty-first century.  Two-letter morphemes carry meaning, and longer words are built up as compounds.
*[[w:Toki Pona|Toki Pona]] &amp;mdash; twenty-first century.  Designed to facilitate Taoist thinking.  Very few words with no inflections and uncomplicated meanings, and very simple grammar.

== Auxiliary languages ==

'''Auxlangs''' are designed to help ease communication between two or more linguistically diverse communities.  They use simple phonology and grammar to try to make them easy to learn.  Their grammars are made in such a way as to express the widest range of meanings possible.  There are many Auxlangs, and some of them were among the first constructed languages ever made.

Some examples of auxlangs:

*[[Esperanto]] &amp;mdash; probably the most widely known auxlang.  It includes words from languages of several Indo-European branches and has a highly developed system of word derivation.
*[[w:Volapük|Volapük]] &amp;mdash; the most successful auxlang prior to Esperanto.  Its vocabulary is derived from Germanic roots.
*[[w:Ido (language)|Ido]] &amp;mdash; derived from Esperanto, separating in an event called the schism (or even the Great Schism) from which resentments have not entirely faded more than a century later.  Ido uses a Romance-derived vocabulary.
*[[w:Latino sine flexione|Latino sine flexione]] &amp;mdash; based on [[Latin]] without inflections.
*[[w:Novial|Novial]] &amp;mdash; based on modern West European languages.
*[[w:Solresol|Solresol]] &amp;mdash; based on the musical scale.  It can be sung and played.

Many auxlangs borrow their vocabulary entirely from the Indo-European languages &amp;mdash; often from a mix of Romance and Germanic languages, but most often entirely from Romance languages.  As a result, the vocabulary and general method of reaching the goal of universality sound a lot alike from auxlang to auxlang.  These auxlangs are often called &quot;Euroclones&quot;.  More recent auxlangs that take their vocabulary from more diverse sources and use non-Indo-European grammar include [http://www.vorlin.org/ Vorlin], [[w:Ceqli|Ceqli]], [http://ca.oocities.com/handydad/elomi/elomi-main.html Ilomi], &lt;!-- Dunia, --&gt; and [http://dana.nutter.net/conlang/sasxsek/ SASXSEK].

== Artistic languages ==

'''Artlangs''' are created for a wide range of reasons: fleshing out works of fiction, fun, experimentation, or even historical study (colloquially called &quot;if-langs&quot;).  Most people who create artlangs do so simply because they enjoy it.  Several artlangs have gained high visibility in popular culture in recent years, such as Klingon, created for the Star Trek franchise by professional linguist Marc Okrand; the many Elvish languages, especially Quenya and Sindarin, in Tolkien's Middle-earth; and Dothraki, created by conlanger David J. Peterson for the ''Game of Thrones'' television series.

=== Fictional languages ===

The most familiar and general subset of artlangs are '''fictional languages'''.  These are spoken by the inhabitants of the fictional worlds of a book, movie, television show, video game, comic, or toy, such as Middle-earth, the Star Trek universe, or the game Myst.  These worlds in which they are spoken are called '''conworlds''', inhabited by fictional '''concultures'''.  The conworld influences what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, foods, objects of technology (such as bricks, cannons, or telephones), sports, music genres, ethnic groups, religious concepts, and place names. 

The culture will also have an influence on some things like verb tenses (how your people view the future and the past, or whether time should even be grammatically indicated at all any more than place should), pronouns (whether the speakers need fine enough shades of &quot;we&quot; to distinguish the concept of &quot;you and I&quot; from &quot;he and I&quot;, or whether they have different levels of formality for &quot;you&quot;), and how kinship terms are split up (some languages have different words for older and younger brothers, others do not distinguish &quot;brother&quot; from &quot;sister&quot;, and some have different words for the sister of a sister and the sister of a brother).  Tolkien started out inventing languages for his amusement and then retroengineered a fictional universe to have a world in which these languages would be spoken. 

Since the Internet became popular, many people have now become able to put up information on their conlangs and associated conworlds on their sites, and these have become famous.  Verdurian, the language of Mark Rosenfelder's Verduria on the planet of Almea, is often invoked as a symbolic representative of these Net-based fictional languages.

Some examples of fictional languages:

*[[Klingon]] &amp;mdash; created for the Star Trek franchise by linguist Marc Okrand; meant to have a harsh sound, but be pronounceable by actors, and to reflect a suitably bellicose worldview.
*[[Na'vi|Na'vi language]] &amp;mdash; created for the movie ''Avatar'' by professor Paul Frommer; meant to fit the film concept, and be pronounceable by actors, but not sound like any particular human language.
*[[w:Dothraki language|Dothraki]] &amp;mdash; created for the television series ''Game of Thrones'' by conlanger David J. Peterson.
*[[w:Newspeak|Newspeak]] &amp;mdash; described in George Orwell's novel ''1984''; supposed to prevent dissident thoughts by not allowing them to be expressed.
*[[Quenya]] and [[w:Sindarin|Sindarin]] &amp;mdash; the most prominent of J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish languages; designed to Tolkien's personal taste.  He created Middle-earth as background for the languages.
*[[w:Verdurian language|Verdurian]]&lt;!-- [http://zompist.com/verdurian.htm Verdurian] --&gt; &amp;mdash; created by Mark Rosenfelder for a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons world; borrows from various European languages, but doesn't closely resemble any of them.

=== Altlangs ===

'''Altlangs''' are also known as '''''What if?'' languages''' or '''if-langs'''.  They speculate on an alternate history and try to reconstruct how a family of natural languages would have evolved if things had been different.  What if King Harold had won the Battle of Hastings?  What if the Polynesians had settled in Central America during the time of Meso-American Empires?  What if Alexander the Great had not been able to conquer Egypt?  What if Greek civilization went on to thrive without a Roman Empire, leaving Greek and not Latin to develop several modern descendants?  The language that ''would have'' evolved is then traced step by step in its evolution, to reach its final form.

The revered grandfather of this genre is Andrew Smith's Brithenig, which attempts to determine what Romance languages would have evolved into had the Romans displaced the Celtic people in Great Britain.  The vocabulary of Latin is altered through the same evolution that befell Welsh from the evolution of the Celtic languages through the present day.  An altlang will typically base itself on the core vocabulary of one language and the phonology of another.  An altlang will ideally have meticulous understanding and admirable imagination as to world history, sturdy knowledge of linguistics, and ingenious improvising when it becomes necessary to &quot;toss it up&quot;.

Some examples of altlangs:
*{{sec link auto|w|Brithenig|Brithenig|padlock=no}} &amp;mdash; might have evolved if Latin had displaced the native Celtic language in Great Britain.
*{{sec link auto|w|Wenedyk|Wenedyk|padlock=no}} &amp;mdash; might have evolved if the Romans had conquered Poland.

=== Personal languages ===

'''Personal languages''' are languages that are created by and belong just to the inventor, for just the inventor to see, or perhaps to show off.  A personal language is created for the ultimate purpose of creating a language.  There is no conworld it is associated with, no people whom the creator actually expects to speak it, no product that will be manufactured in its language.  A personal language is considered by many to be artlanging in its purest form, although a personal language may well have no artistic intention behind it.  A personal language may be invented to create a beautiful language or for self-expression.  It may be invented to give out a tribute to a language or language family the creator really likes, attempting to capture the flavor of the original as much as possible, or it may be created just for the fun that there is in creating a language.

Personal languages are often created as practices in linguistics; a conlanger learning about ergativity might write out the grammar of an ergative conlang in order to understand how ergative languages work. Some exist to test outlandish phonologies or orthographic systems, or have hundreds of noun cases or tens of millions of possible verb forms. Many are invented simply because people love constructing languages! The creators of personal languages often share their languages and update their progress over the Internet, and many habitually scrap an old conlang project that hasn't gotten beyond a lexicon of 50 words and start a new one. These personal languages tend to have short lifespans, but others are developed for years on end as their creators try to become truly fluent in them, perhaps using them for diaries and other writings.

=== Micronational languages ===

Some artlangs are '''micronational languages''' &amp;mdash; like fictional languages, but their creators make them real.  They declare territory, issue official flags and currency, and recruit citizens, then have the citizens learn the language.  These are the languages of '''micronations''', sometimes created for entertainment, but often breakaway nations that are created for political purposes, declaring themselves to exist alongside UN-recognized nations (such as Sealand, the Conch Republic, or Atlantium).  The members of these micronations meet up and speak the language they have learned when they are participating in these meets.  The language and its creation belong to all the citizens of these micronations.  They determine the direction of its evolution, invent new grammatical constructions when they discover it is necessary, and coin new words as they speak.

Some examples of micronational languages:

*[[w:Talossan language|Talossan]]

== Other ways of classifying conlangs ==

=== In-between goals ===

The three broad kinds of goals we've described &amp;mdash; technical features, cross-cultural communication, and art &amp;mdash; aren't mutually exclusive.  What if your goal is to see whether a certain technical goal can be successfully combined with your personal aesthetics?  Is that an engelang or an artlang?  [http://www.oocities.com/gataspus/liva.htm Liva] is a conlang with just that sort of goals, and its author has suggested that conlangs should be placed on the interior of a triangle, with the three pure types of conlangs at its corners (see [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html#gnoli-triang here]).

Even if a conlang has a single, pure primary goal, there are enough details in any conlang that the primary goal probably doesn't cover all of them.  Auxlangs have some artistry in their making &amp;mdash; it's been [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#analysis argued] that artistic merit is part of why Esperanto has succeeded so much better than its competitors.  Engelangs may have some artistry in them, too; and artlangs often have some technical aspirations lurking under the surface.

A particular class of mixed-goal conlangs with its own name is the '''fauxlangs''', short for '''f'''ictional '''auxlangs'''.  These are supposed auxlangs created by characters in a fictional setting, often in an alternative history.  Examples include
* Rex May's [http://web.archive.org/web/20091024164900/http://geocities.com/ceqli/Texperanto.html Texperanto] &amp;mdash; created by L.L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, in an alternative history where he emigrated to the Republic of Texas.
* At one time, Ray Brown's [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/TAKE/index.html το άνευ κλίσι Ελληνικό] (&quot;Greek without inflections&quot;) was a fauxlang &amp;mdash; the analog, in an alternative history where Alexander the Great conquered Rome, of Giuseppe Peano's 1903 auxlang [[w:Latino sine Flexione|Latino sine Flexione]].  It was revised a few years ago, though, to be more of an englang because the fictional setting was found too limiting.

=== Relexes ===
&lt;!-- redirect from Relex, links from Beginner, Beginner/Words, Beginner/Grammar --&gt;

A '''relex''' is a conlang generated from a pre-existing language by replacing the forms of the words, while leaving most of the rest of the original language unchanged &amp;mdash; especially,
* the exact meanings of the words from the original language, and/or
* the grammar of the original language.
With both of these unchanged, the conlang is a sort of word-replacement code for the original language&lt;!-- (like {{sec link auto|w|Dog Latin|Dog Latin|padlock=no}} and, for that matter, {{sec link auto|w|Pig Latin|Pig Latin|padlock=no}} are word-replacement codes for English) --&gt;.  By extension, ''relex'' is sometimes used as a broad criticism of any conlang seen as too closely copying another language.

The largest class of relexes are (by reputation, at least) artlangs whose authors failed to notice that they were copying most of the look and feel of their native language.  Not all relexes are artlangs, though, and not all are unintentional.  Auxlangs [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWrelex.html Speedwords] and [http://archives.conlang.info/si/qanvhu/tolchaurjhaen.html Glosa] have both been criticized as relexes of English.  The loglang {{sec link auto|w|Lojban|Lojban|padlock=no}} started as a deliberate relex of {{sec link auto|w|Loglan|Loglan|padlock=no}}, since which their grammars and vocabularies have gradually diverged as both languages underwent further development (see [http://archives.conlang.info/si/qanvhu/khuelwoerjhaen.html here]).

Some relexes may be used for specific purposes. For example, the Israeli miltary uses a relex of Hebrew called &quot;NADBAR&quot;.

The conlanging term ''relex'' is a shortening of the term ''relexification'', borrowed and adapted from linguistics proper.  The linguistic term has a narrower meaning:  in linguistic {{sec link auto|w|relexification|relexification|padlock=no}}, a pre-existing language keeps its grammar but replaces its vocabulary from another pre-existing language.  The language from which the vocabulary is taken is called the ''lexifier''.

=== A priori and a posteriori ===

Particular features of a conlang can be '''a&amp;nbsp;posteriori''' &amp;mdash; meaning borrowed from natural languages, rather than invented &amp;mdash; or '''a&amp;nbsp;priori''', meaning invented rather than borrowed from natural languages.  These terms are most often used to describe the forms of words, as with the {{sec link auto|w|Toki Pona|Toki Pona|padlock=no}} words ''toki'', from the English word ''talk'', and ''pona'', from Latin ''bona'' (good).  An entire conlang may also be described as a&amp;nbsp;priori/posteriori if most of its grammar and vocabulary are of that type.  A conlang described as a&amp;nbsp;posteriori usually borrows from several, or even many, different natlangs; relexes are not normally called a&amp;nbsp;posteriori.

Classification-based vocabulary is an a&amp;nbsp;priori strategy that has been used in a number of engelangs (e.g., {{sec link auto|w|Ro (language)|Ro|padlock=no}}) and some auxlangs (e.g., {{sec link auto|w|Solresol|Solresol|padlock=no}}).  Most auxlangs make extensive use of a&amp;nbsp;posteriori vocabulary.

=== Diachronic languages ===

A '''diachronic''' conlang is equipped with an internal, i.e., fictional, linguistic history.  Since the internal history is fictional, all diachronic conlangs are artlangs; but most subtypes of artlangs include both diachronic and non-diachronic (''synchronic'') languages.

Tolkien's Elvish languages are the most famous example of diachronic conlanging, with an entire family of languages descended from a common ancestor, {{sec link auto|w|Primitive Quendian|Primitive Quendian|padlock=no}}.  Many artlangs, though by no means all, have at least some suggestions of internal history about them, even if no parent language has been fully worked out.

Altlangs are diachronic, by definition.

=== Kitchen sink languages ===

A '''kitchen sink''' conlang is one that has way too many exotic features, all at once for no apparent reason &amp;mdash; &quot;everything including the kitchen sink&quot; in an uncoordinated mishmash.  Unlike ''relex'', ''kitchen sink'' has no neutral technical sense; it's always a strong term of opprobrium.

Kitchen sink languages are at the opposite end of a spectrum from relexes:  where too little tinkering can produce a relex (that lacks interest), too much tinkering can produce a kitchen sink language (that lacks plausibility).  It has been suggested that a conlanger's second conlang &amp;mdash; after they've made a [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#Relexes|relex]] for their first &amp;mdash; is often a kitchen sink language; but even experienced conlangers, tempted by the lure of exotic features, can sometimes fall into the trap of kitchen-sink-ism.  

Caution should also be exercised, though, in ''applying'' the term ''kitchen sink'' to a conlang &amp;mdash; not only because it's such a strong term, but because just having many unusual features doesn't ''necessarily'' make it a kitchen sink language (which is why the term is so strong).  For proper use of the term, the many unusual features should be unjustified; in principle, at least, it's possible for many unusual features to occur in a smoothly coherent design, so that they all feel quite natural in context.  The catch is that &amp;mdash; as David Peterson remarked when awarding the 2007 [http://dedalvs.conlang.org/smileys/ Smiley Award] to {{sec link auto|w|Teonaht|Teonaht|padlock=no}}, a highly respected conlang with several unusual features &amp;mdash; there is a double standard at work between natlangs and conlangs:  any bizarre features of a natlang are natural by definition, but the same features in a conlang would have to persuade on their own merits.  His case in point is {{sec link auto|w|Pirahã language|Pirahã|padlock=no}}, a natlang with no way of expressing time; no way of counting; a culture with no storytelling, oral history, or art; it can be spoken, whistled, hummed, or drummed; and it has different phonologies for men and women.  If it were a conlang instead of a natlang, its creator would have a hard time passing it off as naturalistic.

== Initial content ==

I tried to explain as best as I could (after all, it's not such a big issue to explain) but I feel I fell seriously short, especially on my definition of Loglang. [[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 17:56, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: I fleshed it out but the article still needs work IMO (This is '''Ingolemo''' BTW, I can't log in here).  &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash; preceding comment added 13:30, 20 September 2004 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

== Too many examples? ==

IMO, this page is not supposed to be a list of conlangs. The examples given are only there to emphasize the differences between the types of conlang, and I think that two or three examples are sufficiant to do this. -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 13:00, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I support that. While the added material is much better than my feeble attempt, I do think it could use more paragraph divisions. Also, I believe we'd ideally want to limit ourselves to a few exemples that can be linked to as to provide actually accessible exemples, especially in the Artlang section, where it makes little sense to repeat in the list some languages mentionned in the upper section...--[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 21:52, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Feel free to break up the paragraphs, but in a whole book on conlangs we'd want to have our list of conlangs ''somewhere'', wouldn't we? [[User:24.4.127.164|24.4.127.164]] 23:31, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: I disagree with some of the recent removals, and the reasoning given (if they don't have a Wikipedia article they should be listed here either).  For one, some of the Wikipedia links were bad but the articles do exist (I've added one of them back).  Two, in the nature of things personal languages are probably not going to be notable enough for Wikipedia; but should we list no examples here?  Wikipedia does talk briefly about several personal languages in the text of the article on [[w:Constructed language|Constructed language]], even though none of those languages have nor will probably ever have their own article - I mean Taneraic, Vabungula, and so forth.  I'll leave it up to others whether gjâ-zym-byn deserves a mention here (although it has an article in the Esperanto Wikipedia, in spite of my nominating it for deletion).

:: I do agree that we don't want the list to get too long, and that the list was probably a bit too long before Ingolemo's recent deletions. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 14:09, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

::: I was mostly just trying to justify my trimming of the list and didn't mean to delete any of the more notable conlangs. If the wikipedia authors feel that a particular conlang is notable enough to mention there (whether in it's own article or not) then I have no objection to it's inclusion here. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 19:34, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Linguistics ==

We can share data between this and the linguistics department at Wikiversity, since a lot of the introductory material is pretty complementary. -- [[User:Spack|Spack]] 15:05, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:Do you have anything particular in mind? --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 14:47, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== (imported from ''Talk:Conlang/Relex'') Page adds nothing to Conlang that wikipedia cannot provide ==

This page doesn't fit into the rest of the structure of the [[Conlang]] Wikibook. I'd like to either try to make it fit in (by reorienting it towards a ''How to avoid making a relex''-like goal) or redirect to [[w:Relexification]]. Opinions? - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]]
&lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash; preceding comment added 15:34, 23 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

:The WP article is about linguistic term '''relexification''', not conlanging term '''relex'''.  Moreover, the fact that the conlanging term has a somewhat different meaning is, reasonably, not mentioned in the lead of the WP article, so that sending Conlang readers there would probably leave them misunderstanding what a relex is.  Even if we sent them directly to the &quot;Conlangs and jargon&quot; section of the WP article, that section is, again reasonably, not tutorial for conlangers.  I've tried to adjust this page so that it is about the conlanging term, and tutorial for conlangers.

:All that said, this is still the only page in the Wikibook (that I know of) that has no fixed place in the outline.  Having just significantly adjusted the page, though, I'm inclined to give it some time to settle in in its new form.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:04, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

::I've integrated relexes into Conlang/Types ([[Conlang/Types#Relexes|here]]).  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 05:00, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

== TAKE is no longer a fauxlang ==

Since the mention of fauxlangs was added, the author of TAKE has decided the fictional timeline was too limiting, and divorced the conlang from it.  So TAKE should be removed from that section.  (I'd do so now, but must dash, so am noting it here instead.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:42, 6 November 2011 (UTC)
: Taken care of; didn't remove it, but noted the change.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:38, 23 January 2014 (UTC)

== history merge ==

I've (finally) history-merged the old Conlang/Relex page; the content merge took place several years ago (as noted in a talk thread above, which I just now merged).  The downside of history merge is that there's no easy way to tell which revisions in the merged history belong to which of the original pages; but the history of the other page is pretty short, so here it is (I didn't bother to prune the unimportant stuff).

== ZBB: Project Fix-The-Wikibook ==

Hello all! A bunch of members from the ZBB are joining me in Project Fix-The-Wikibook, where we are going to help update lots of the sections here. Project Members: we can discuss our work here :) - Kalor  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding undated comment was added 16:05, 9 December 2007.&lt;/small&gt;

:It's me, Zoris, from the ZBB. Just want to say I've done a couple edits, really just to improve the quality of the writing. I plan to focus on improving the beginner sections to get beginners started on track. I also will work on the intermediate sections, but there are people out there who have more expertise than I, so I doubt I will be able to contribute much on the most advanced topics. Anyways, here I am. -[[User:Zoris|Zoris]] ([[User talk:Zoris|talk]]) 23:51, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

== Splitoff Project: Constructive Linguistics 101 ==

Hello fellow conlangers. I am starting a similar project but with a significantly different drive. See [http://saizai.backpackit.com/pub/777708 here] for the details.

The [http://www.writely.com/Doc?id=dct5h6zd_1hs6gpz Overview] and [http://www.writely.com/Doc?id=dhhkh27z_1cfqk2w Style Guide] should give all the relevant info.

The basic distinction is that this wikibook is (per below) *not* a linguistics textbook; it's more akin to e.g. the Language Construction Kit. Whereas my project *is* intended as a bona fide linguistics textbook... of a very innovative sort. It teaches constructive linguistics (rather than descriptive).

Take a look at the website and email me if you'd like to participate.  -- Sai  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding undated comment was added 22:46, 4 October 2006.&lt;/small&gt;

== Expert vs. Advanced ==

I think there needs to be some clarification of the exact differences between the Intermediate and Expert levels. I would consider Polisynthetic and Trigger languages to be in the realm of the expert. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 18:36, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:True. Personally I am finding these categories a bit too shaky. We should probably reorganize. &lt;strike&gt;By the way, please sign your comments&lt;/strike&gt;. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 18:21, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Ok. I'll move them down to advanced for the time being. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 18:36, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== IPA or SAMPA ==

I think it's best if we use one of the systems consistantly across all pages. We have a link to an IPA tutorial at the bottom of this page, but most of the articles are written using SAMPA. Can we use one or the other? --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 22:07, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:We're using X-SAMPA because most browsers can't really display IPA by default. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 02:45, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::How about adding a link toward the Wikipedia X-SAMPA article or something like that? The X-SAmpa/IPA chart would be a great addition too for explaining sounds!--[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 17:13, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::I agree. Whatever is decided, It needs to be introduced to the students before they take the intermediate course as all the articles in there already use SAMPA. -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 12:06, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::::Added the section. How about renaming it &quot;Sound notation&quot;? That way we could have &quot;Beginner Sound Notation&quot;, &quot;Intermediate Sound Notation&quot; etc. --[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 12:23, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::::X-SAMPA is hardly an advanced topic and I think it would be a little too overwhelming for beginners. I don't think it needs seperate pages for other levels. -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 19:21, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::::::Okay, whoever that Vladisdead is, he needs to be pointed here! Now I've got to switch everything back to X-SAMPA. Damnit!--[[User:Circeus|Circeus]] 23:11, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:::::::Oops. :) I really think it should be in IPA, but I'm not gonna argue. --[[User:Vladisdead|Vladisdead]] 06:34, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::::::::I'm proposing, in a separate thread, to slightly amend this usage to CXS.  [[Talk:Conlang#Phonetic_notation|'''Here''']].  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:08, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== This is not a linguistics textbook ==

I think everyone, me included, tends to treat this as a linguistics textbook, explaining as many things as possible, and so forth. Well &amp;mdash; it's not. It's a conlanging textbook. People come here to find out how to make their conlangs better, not how real languages work. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 02:39, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

: Agreed. The articles need to be less based about &quot;the way things are (on earth)&quot; and more about &quot;the way things could be (in your conlang)&quot;. -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 12:27, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:: And yet, I think we should always state weather a feature actually happens in a real language. Some people add some features based on this fact. -- [[User:Jotomicron|Jotomicron]] 13:23, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::: But keep in mind that &quot;there are more things in heaven and earth than you dream of in your [conlang]&quot;. I.e. natlangs often turn out to be far more weird than the average beginner's conlang. Apart from which conlanging can provide an excellent 'hands on' way into linguistics for some people. (Marconatrix on ZB) [[Special:Contributions/91.84.119.164|91.84.119.164]] ([[User talk:91.84.119.164|talk]]) 05:20, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

:::: The situation is even more frought than that.  Sometimes a really good way to get insights into the way real languages work &amp;mdash; both for beginners and for linguists &amp;mdash; is to build, or study, a conlang that works ''differently'' from real languages.  To design a conlang like that, you need to know how real languages work without being funneled into someone's notion of how real languages &quot;have&quot; to be.  There's an excellent discussion of conlang naturalness in the [http://dedalvs.conlang.org/smileys/2007.html 2007 Smiley Award essay].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:27, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

== Glossing ==

Do we have a standard for format and abbreviations to use in glossing examples?  If not already, what about [http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/files/morpheme.html the Leipzig Glossing Rules] ? --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 15:08, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

== Naming Policy ==

Now that there is some agreement as to the [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy|wikibooks naming policy]], I think it would be a good idea to begin bringing the Conlang wikibook up to scratch on it. Unless anyone has any objections or someone beats me to it, I'll go ahead in about 2&amp;ndash;3 weeks. Comments? Agreements? Objections? - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 15:00, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
: I've finished converting. I don't know how to get the navigation template to show the SUBPAGENAME of the pages that are being linked to, so for the moment, it looks a little ugly. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 10:42, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

== Derivational morphology ==

Just wrote a stubby outline for [[Conlang/Intermediate/Grammar/Derivation|Conlang/Intermediate/Grammar/Derivational Morphology]]; take a look and see what needs more work. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 19:28, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== Words? ==

Maybe a list of the basic 1000 - 2000 words should be included? Or sample texts to translate, so that one knows when hir conlang is missing words that sie needs to include - or to decide on which words should they start on creating, etc.  [[User:Nfwu|Nfwu]] 10:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== When will this book done? ==

I want to learn conlanging and I am waiting a long time, is there another ebooks or books that I can learn it from? &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash; Preceding unsigned comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.125.89.181|77.125.89.181]] ([[User talk:77.125.89.181|talk]]) 22:17, 11 April 2008&lt;/small&gt;

:Material on conlanging is fragmented all over the web.  If you're looking for a single introductory resource to get you up and running quickly, you might try [http://www.langmaker.com/backissu.htm Jeffrey Henning's ''Model Languages'' Newsletter].  You'll probably want to move on from that to broader and deeper coverage, and IMO for that a good branching-off point would be [http://dedalvs.conlang.org/notes.html David Peterson's ''Notes on Language Creation''].  (The second link from Peterson's preface is, in fact, Henning's newsletter.)  As for completion, or even semi-completion, of this wikibook, I wouldn't recommend waiting for it; the people with most expertise to contribute are most likely to have other demands on their time.  I suspect the wikibook will pull together gradually, in fits and starts, over a number of years.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:01, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

::so much time?? =( [[Special:Contributions/77.127.126.85|77.127.126.85]] ([[User talk:77.127.126.85|talk]]) 13:50, 20 May 2008 (UTC)

:Consider the range of scales possible for conlang projects; in this respect, conlanging is very like model railroading (which Henning compared it to).  You can have lots of fun with a small project, but ranging continuously upward from there, a conlang project can become a lifelong hobby.  In fact, the more fun a small project is, the more likely it is to grow into a lifelong hobby.  Set beside that time scale, crafting a high-quality how-to book on conlanging &amp;mdash; where none previously existed &amp;mdash; isn't likely to take less than a few years, is it?  &lt;p&gt;That said, I'd be happy to have overestimated how long it will take.  If the right people decided to make a big effort, it could be moderately complete by the end of this summer.  I'm guessing from the progress I've seen in the past year or so, and the seemingly (to me, anyway) formidable nature of the sections that haven't even been started yet.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:56, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

WHEN WILL THIS BOOK BE DONE? [[Special:Contributions/77.127.77.102|77.127.77.102]] ([[User talk:77.127.77.102|talk]]) 15:17, 5 October 2008 (UTC)

==Ingressive airstream==
I noticed that there was no section on ingressive airstream, I made a little one, but was wondering if it should be merged with clicks, or have clicks merged with it, since all clicks are ingressive?
[[User:Ave matthew|Ave matthew]] ([[User talk:Ave matthew|talk]]) 16:13, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

:Since both sections are currently so small, for now I'd say there should be just one section; later, when there's a lot more material, it can be split up again if that seems important enough.  The ''file'' should probably be called &quot;Ingressive&quot;, since that's more inclusive.  The ''title'', though, should probably mention clicks prominently, consistent with the style of the preceding section title, &quot;Pharyngeals and their ilk&quot;.  Perhaps &quot;Clicks and their kin&quot; (but that may be a bit too folksy), or &quot;Clicks and other ingressives&quot;?  The ''content''... at a guess, it'd probably work well to have a lead sentence on what ingressive means, then a subsection on clicks, then a subsection (or two) on other ingressives.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:17, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

== Explaining the overall organization ==

The introduction to the Beginner section specifies three things:
*Minimal background: no prior knowledge of conlanging or linguistics.
*Practical objective: allow the reader to build a conlang that isn't a relex.
*What content is appropriate: basic principles of different aspects of language.
I have written lead sentences, trying to follow this pattern, for the introductions to the Intermediate and Advanced sections. [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:29, 16 August 2008 (UTC)

== What to do with Intermediate syntax ==

:''I've moved this thread to [[Talk:Conlang/Advanced/Grammar/Government|the talk page for the section]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:35, 15 December 2008 (UTC)''

== Intermediate/Sounds ==

Here's what I've just done.  The place of Intermediate/Sounds (Phonetics and phonology) in the outline was fraying, with a piece of it broken off into a separate file, and another effective subsection (on Sandhi) started separately; and Intermediate/Sounds also had more internal structure than other parts of the wikibook.  I've tried to fix both problems at once, by splitting off virtually all the content of Intermediate/Sounds into separate files Intermediate/Sounds/*.  (I also botched the job slightly, as I meant to rename Allophony to Sounds/Phones and bring in the surrounding content from Sounds, but instead I created a new page Sounds/Phones &amp;mdash; which I plastered over by doing what I'd meant to do with Allophony but calling the file Sounds/Phonetics, and making Sounds/Phones a redirect to it.  Ideally, Sounds/Phonetics should be moved to Sounds/Phones, destroying the redirect page.)  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:09, 30 August 2008 (UTC)
:Fixed &amp;mdash; Sounds/Phonetics is now Sounds/Phones. [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:54, 3 September 2008 (UTC)

== How to Contribute ==

I have made a surgical adjustment to the content of the [[Conlang#How to Contribute|How to Contribute]] section on the main page.  Realizing this could be an extraordinarily  consensus-sensitive element of the book, I considered for a long time before doing this (though I'd done some very modest rephrasing once before); but as I've struggled with the overall organization of the book, I've seen how the long-term trend throughout is toward bloating low-level sections with slowly but monotonically increasing detail.  Finally I decided that something really had to be done to try to redirect the long-term trend.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:06, 3 September 2008 (UTC)

== Categorisation: Conlang or Conworld ==

Hey all, I found that all of the [[Conlang]] pages were in [[:Category:Conworld]], rather than its sub-category, [[:Category:Conlang]]. I started recategorising, but then thought again, wondering whether there might be a reason why you might prefer having them in the parent category. Anyone object to this recategorisation? Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:07, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;I'm in favor of this change; it sounds like a great idea to me.&lt;/s&gt;  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 04:24, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

I spoke too soon.  Here's a variant proposal.  Replace &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Conworld]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; throughout.  Apparently, does the same thing as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Conlang]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; but makes it quite obvious that it's following a broadly practiced convention.  Having just discovered this template, I'm comfortable enough with the implied standardness of the arrangement to do it myself, if I find time.

It occurred to me that I really should be a bit more informative in my response to your proposal, and I discovered that template in the process of further investigating the use of Category:Conworld for all pages of all Conworld books.  All the Conworld books do seem to use that convention, which was implemented on 24 June 2006 by Jguk, though this book seems to be the only one of them that's really not a stub.  Jguk, by the way, is no longer active.  I found the template because the one exception to the convention seems to be page [[Conhistory]] (but not its subpages).

In the past few months that I've been working slowly-but-steadily on this book, I've been generally cautious in my changes &amp;mdash; an example being that I didn't rock the boat on the Category:Conworld convention &amp;mdash; partly because I was still learning my way around the book's organization, but also because there have been no other regular editors here in all that time (and some months before), so if I do something really stupid there's been no-one to catch it.  About once a year there's a flurry of activity here, but it doesn't last too long, and then you can hear a pin drop.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:20, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

:{{done}} [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:05, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

== Statement of book objectives ==

I've replaced the statement of book objectives, at the top of the main page.

The old statement said that the purpose of the book is to help you make the language you'd like to make, rather than the language you already speak.  There were two problems with that.  It put rather too much emphasis on a negative objective &amp;mdash; to help you ''not'' do something &amp;mdash; and it was really too weak an objective to cover what is apparently being attempted here.  The Beginner section alone should be sufficient to help you not create an accidental relex; and the positive part of the statement, ''help you make the language you want'', is too vague to be informative to readers or authors.

After meditating on the overall organization and content of this book over the past several months of work, the new statement is what I believe to be the essence of it.  I'd like to think it's a more sharply focused version of what the authors here have been doing, rather than just a reflection of my own biases (though I surely can't have entirely filtered out my own biases).

Since authors come and go here over a long timeframe rather than a short one, I decided to put up my new statement on the main page now, where it may do some good, and then invite discussion here on the talk page, rather than propose it here and wait for what could easily be many months.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:27, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

== Phonetic notation ==

Backstory:  To my knowledge, there has been exactly ''one'' discussion of what notation to use, [[Talk:Conlang#IPA or SAMPA|'''here''']].  The consensus reached at that time was X-SAMPA.  In the aftermath of that decision, the editor who was going to undo the stuff that had been changed to IPA never actually did so, and since then some other editors have done stuff using IPA rather than X-SAMPA &amp;mdash; but no-one ever reopened the discussion, and the state of the book is inconsistent, with some places using X-SAMPA and others using IPA.  Although one ''might'' take the more recent editors using IPA as a sort of &quot;vote for IPA&quot;, one might also figure that their choice is largely white noise, since there's no evidence they were even aware of the earlier consensus decision, or they would have either reopened it or at least added a note to the end of it.  In my own assessment of past authors' positions on this issue, the later editors' failure to acknowledge the earlier consensus inclines me to give them less weight.

There is another twist to all this:  [[w:Conlang XSAMPA|CXS]], a.k.a. Conlang X-SAMPA.  It's designed, by and for the conlanging community, to be more convenient than X-SAMPA.  The rise of CXS seems to postdate the consensus discussion here.

My own preference is for CXS.  As a short list of reasons &amp;mdash; I don't claim this is all there is to be said for it, or even all of why it appeals to me, but these are summaries of the top reasons that occur to me just now &amp;mdash; it's easy to generate (no special techniques, just standard use of a standard keyboard); it's easy to display (again, no special techniques, everything already knows how to display ASCII); it's easy to read (because the characters are familiar ''and'' they're reliably well displayed); and readers of this book have more call to use CXS than IPA, or even X-SAMPA, in communication with other conlangers.

'''I propose''' to use CXS for this book.  The process of implementing this has five steps (well, six if you count this talk posting as one).
* Add a notice to the main page that the book is being normalized to use CXS, with a link to this talk thread.  This will both make other editors aware of the issue so they don't step in it (in retrospect, there should have been a notice put on the main page way back when the consensus was originally reached; cf. the main page of featured book [[Latin]]), and it will enable the  possibility of a real discussion.  Later steps of the process are likely to take some time, which should allow about as much opportunity to start a dialog as I can see profitably allowing (since I don't see any profit in deliberately delaying the process beyond the time it's going to take anyway &amp;mdash; somewhat similarly to my much smaller redesign of the lead on the main page, discussed [[Talk:Conlang#Statement_of_book objectives|'''here''']]).

* Revise [[Conlang/Intermediate/Sound notation|Conlang/Intermediate/IPA and X-SAMPA]] accordingly.  I'm putting this step before all other content changes, even though the next major step will be earlier in the book, because this page contains the most blatant statement of IPA preference in the book.

The external link needs to be replaced anyway, because a wikibook should be self-contained, and the use of an IPA table there has probably contributed to later editors assuming, without checking, that the book is going to use IPA.

:For some reason, I've been under the impression that the original discussion settled on using IPA for phonetic notation. It was a while ago so my memory may be inaccurate, but I believe some discussion on this topic took place off-site and that's what was ultimately decided. I personally believe IPA to be the best option, but if you insist on CXS then that's as good a standard as any. [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] ([[User talk:Ingolemo|talk]]) 15:11, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

::Honestly, I'd like to try CXS on the book as a whole and see how it works.

== Table of contents ==

I'm trying something different, which I'm hoping will simplify maintenance work in the long run &amp;mdash; but the only way to know, really, is to try it out for a while and see.  The idea is to have a single master file containing the &quot;table of contents&quot; data, in a format that is straightforward enough for technically unsophisticated authors , and is also usable by a set of templates that automatically generate both the visible TOC on the main page ''and'' navboxes for the top and bottom of each module.  (Whether the format is simple enough is critical; most of the design time on this was to devise the simplest format that would do the job, and it may yet turn out to be the weak point at which the whole scheme fails.)  When an author changes the master list, the visible TOC and the navboxes will all change automatically (once the caches clear) without any painstaking manual adjustment of navbox links.  (Left to its own devices, the system might wait hours before updating the template calls that generate the TOC and navboxes; this can be made to happen immediately on a given module page, or on the main page, by making a no-change edit to that page.)

The documentation for the whole suite of templates is too technical; that's a point that will surely need improvement, but my initial priority was to preserve the information at all, deferring niceties of presentation.

For now I've set up fairly simple navbox templates (&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Conlang/Top}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Conlang/Bottom}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  More elaborate navboxes could be generated &amp;mdash; well, ''I'' could figure out how to generate them, anyway :-) &amp;mdash; but more elaborate doesn't necessarily mean better, so for now I've chosen something that's pretty similar to the pre-existing navboxes.  (This whole arrangement really comes on line when the individual modules are converted to use the new templates, which I expect to do as I find time...)

Maybe on it's own page. The concept of sonority seems more important to me, than just a small table at the end of a page. It influences (as far as I understand) a big part of how a language sounds, and how phonotactic rules are done (no 'p' after 'n', whatever). Maybe also putt it in an appendix, and/or mention how sonority influences language on other pages like syllables or phonotactics.

Would it be possible for you to add a page/draft about sonority to the advanced level?

:  The Intermediate phonology section was actually drastically cut back at one point because there was a massive glut of information about phonology and almost nothing about anything else. I don't remember if we cut anything about sonority at that time, but the existing stuff could certainly be improved. I would welcome an expansion of the syllables page, though I don't think sonority needs a page to itself.

: As to writing a page about sonority in the Advanced level; honestly, if I'm going to do anything I'd rather focus on getting the Intermediate level finished. But there's nothing stopping you from adding that page; you seem to know something about the subject and you definitely care about it. We would welcome the contribution. Doesn't matter if it's not very good; even laying down an outline for a page can be helpful.

: We need to sit down and decide on a structure for the Advanced level. The way I see it, while the Beginner and Intermediate levels have a sort of tutorial feel to them, pages in the advanced level should be more scattered. Since the Advanced level can assume Intermediate knowledge, it should just be a collection of essays about topics relevant to creating a language that go deep into those topics and don't try too hard to be in any particular order or to link up with one another. Less hierarchy and more just random useful stuff. Just some thoughts.

:: It's a common pattern to have university classes on a subject start with an introductory class that gives the beginning student an overview, then a coherent set of intermediate-level classes that cover the various aspects of the subject, and then some advanced-topics classes (or even a single class called &quot;advanced topics in [subject]&quot;) that offer a sort of grab bag of miscellaneous high-powered particulars.

Is there one being maintained? If yes where is it, if no, why not create one. It maybe would be easier to get organized.

I think there's at least one device in-use on en.wb for &quot;automatically&quot; maintaining TODO lists, but I've found myself wanting to avoid any book that has such a thing because it seems to require some expertise to ''use'' it.  I don't want to have to learn yet another specialized tool in order to become more productive; specialized tools requiring expertise to use them are, I think, in general not ideal for wikis.  (I concluded some years ago that the wikis need a general tool for managing expertise &amp;mdash; which, ironically but not surprisingly, could only be created in the first place by a wiki user with certain kinds of technical expertise.

All spoken languages use systems of sounds (called a '''phonology'''), and most of these aren't anything like English, including, hopefully, the conlang that you'll soon have.  This section should help you.

== What's in this section? ==

The parts of this section are:
*'''Phones''':  The difference between ''phones'' and ''phonemes'', and between ''consonants'' and ''vowels''.
*'''Syllables''':  The units of sound that can be pronounced.
*'''Phonotactics''':  How sounds can be arranged into syllables.
*'''Sandhi rules''':  How morphemes may change their sound because of their neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

I think that this article is getting too long (especially given the current lack of content in most other Conlang articles) and is overloading the intermediate with too much information at once. I think that we all need to just sit down and decide what exactly we want this article to say, what we want to save for another article, and what we want to leave for the experts. -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 12:11, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I've come up with a structure that I think would be more accessable to readers;
* Introduction to phones
** The phoneme/allophone distinction
** The vowel/consonant distinction
* Introduction to syllables
** Syllable structure
* Introduction to phonotactics
** Viable consonant clusters
** Sonority scale

Any suggestions for improvements? - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 19:08, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

: That sounds pretty good.  I would keep the phonotactics section very short and leave most of the detail to the advanced phonology chapters. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 15:29, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Ok, this restructuring will take a little time for me to do, mainly due to the work needed to compress the &quot;what are vowels&quot; and &quot;what are consonants&quot; sections to something more succinct. I'm going to drop the &quot;Sonority scale&quot; section and add a little on stress instead, so the phonotactics section should grow only a ''little'' larger than what it is now. - [[User:84.92.170.120|84.92.170.120]] 18:45, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
:: Yes, this was me. I forgot to log in. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 18:46, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
::: I finally submited it. I simplified a lot of the concepts, but I'm worried that I may have simplified some parts too much. Opinions anyone? (the pre-revision page is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Conlang:_Intermediate_Sounds&amp;oldid=318310 here]) - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 18:21, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== Ng - one sound ==

''Note that the &quot;ng&quot; is one sound! It's not an &quot;n&quot; sound followed by a &quot;g&quot; sound.'' You ought to be careful with statements like this. There are some dialects where 'sang' is pronounced [s{Ng], and they would probably consider that [N] to be an allophonic variant of /n/. [[User:Curlyjimsam|Curlyjimsam]] 06:25, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Would you like to write a better example (perhaps involving the digraphs &amp;lt;th&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;sh&amp;gt;)? - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 14:20, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Merging syllables with phonotactics ==

In my opinion, the structure of syllables is too much defined by phonotactics to discuss them on separate pages.
So, I propose a merge of them.

: &lt;span class=&quot;template-ping&quot;&gt;@[[:User:Columbus240|Columbus240]]:&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, a plausible case might be made for the '''intermediate level''' to present them separately.  The beginner and intermediate levels of the book are defined by the limits on how much complication they introduce; so one ought to resist creep of each earlier level into compliations that ought to be left for a later level, otherwise the earlier levels start to lose their identity.  The beginner level tries to introduce the basic elements of language without fancy terms; the word &quot;syllable&quot; barely arises, let alone &quot;phototactics&quot;.  The intermediate level tries to introduce the internal structure of those basic elements, and basic terminology for discussing them; but perhaps the need to treate syllables and phonotactics together is an advanced-level thing?  The advanced level of the book has been under-attended, which one suspects was partly because during the first flurry of activity on the book there was a weakness on distinguishing the three levels, and part of later effort has gone into strenghthening divisions between levels.

: If we do want to shift a bit more of the burden here onto the intermediate level, we should try to more clearly define at the same time what goes in the advanced level, so we don't end up piling everything into intermediate.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:22, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

:: &lt;span class=&quot;template-ping&quot;&gt;@[[:User:Pi zero|Pi zero]]:&lt;/span&gt; So maybe do some stuff on 'proper' phonotactics and syllable building in the advanced level, because the intermediate is (in my opinion) fine like that. I myself don't have experience with linguistics, I just had a look into it since last week, and haven't created a conlang yet(but many ideas), so I won't propose myself as writer of advanced level pages.</text>

1. What are &lt;math&gt;4^3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3^4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1^{250}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{250}^1?&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answers:'''

::a.  &lt;math&gt;\ 4^3 = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64 &lt;/math&gt;

::b.  &lt;math&gt;\ 3^4 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 81 &lt;/math&gt;

::c.  &lt;math&gt;\ 1^{250} = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \ .\,.\,.\,.\  \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

::d.  &lt;math&gt;\ {250}^1 = 250 &lt;/math&gt;


2. Write these numbers as powers of 2: &lt;math&gt;128, 8, 1024&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answers:'''

::a.  &lt;math&gt;\ 128 = 2^7 &lt;/math&gt;

::b.  &lt;math&gt;\ 8 = 2^3 &lt;/math&gt;

::c.  &lt;math&gt;\ 1024 = 2^{10} &lt;/math&gt;


3. What is &lt;math&gt;(2^3)*(2^2)?&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer:'''

:::&lt;math&gt;(2^3) \cdot (2^2) = 2^{3+2} = 2^5 = 32 &lt;/math&gt;


4. What is &lt;math&gt;(2^6)/(2^2)?&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer:'''

:::&lt;math&gt;(2^6)/(2^2) = 2^{6-2} = 2^4 = 16 \ &lt;/math&gt;


5. Harder: Why does &lt;math&gt;3^0=1&lt;/math&gt;? (clue: think about &lt;math&gt;{3^2}/{3^2}&lt;/math&gt;, for example)

'''Answer:'''

:::&lt;math&gt;{3^2}/{3^2} = 3^{2-2} = 3^0 \ &lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; 3^2 = 3 \cdot 3 = 9 &lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; {3^2}/{3^2} = 9/9 = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Natural Numbers ==
Mathematics requires, in order to avoid confusion or absurdity, an unambiguous definition of vocabulary. While this is true of any science, in mathematics this is achieved ''absolutely'' through the abstraction of concepts. 

However, the full description of math as above requires time, and is nowhere elementary. Also, in order to have a true ''axiomization'', a math built up from the roots, we will have to use the strongest, in the logical sense, statements possible. This makes them powerful for proofs but often sacrifices intuitiveness. Thus, we will concentrate on the later,
only rarely using rigour, as necessary.

To do mathematics we must start by finding a way to think about numbers that is as above, unambiguous, while at the same time obvious and natural. We thus come up with the natural numbers.
 
Intuitively, we define these as the set '''N''' = { 1, 2, 3, ... }. We will say a number is a natural number if it belongs to this set. Soon we will find this needs to be expanded even for elementary treatment, but this set alone already has some interesting properties.

If there is a set A such that if we pick an arbitrary number, call it x, and x &amp;isin; '''N''',
we say A &amp;sube; '''N'''. In words, A is a subset of '''N'''.

By x &amp;isin; A we mean that x is &quot;in&quot; A, or that x is an element of A. 

While we have not defined properly a set, membership or inclusion, we have already a feel for what '''N''' ought to be like.

== Mathematical induction ==
=== Principle of mathematical induction ===
''Let A &amp;sube; '''N''' with the following properties:''

(i) &lt;math&gt;1\in A&lt;/math&gt;

(ii) &lt;math&gt;n\in A&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;n+1\in A&lt;/math&gt;

''Then A ='' '''N'''

=== Remark ===
The principle of mathematical induction is implied by the 'least element principle' (2.1). For, assume that '''1.1''' holds and let ''B'' be the set of all elements of '''N''' ''not'' in ''A''. If ''B'' has any elements (that is, is not empty) then it must have a least one. Call this least element ''n''. Then, by (i), &lt;math&gt;n\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus ''n - 1'' is a natural number and is not in ''B'' and so is in ''A''. By (ii), &lt;math&gt;n=(n-1)+1&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number which is in ''A''. But now ''n'' is in both ''A'' and ''B'' which is impossible. So ''B'' must have been empty. That is, ''A ='' '''N'''.

This serves as a fundamental property of the natural numbers, and we, further defining order, will call these numbers well-ordered, primarily because of this principle. In more rigorous terms, we would have to identify a separate axiom, called the axiom of induction, which encompasses this property. However, for our current purposes, this is sufficient.

=== Principle of mathematical induction (modified) ===
''Let A be a set of natural numbers which has the following properties:''

(i) ''The natural number ''&lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is in A''

(ii) ''If'' &lt;math&gt;n\ge n_0&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;n\in A&lt;/math&gt;, ''then'' &lt;math&gt;n+1\in A&lt;/math&gt;

''Then A contains all natural number'' &lt;math&gt;n\ge n_0&lt;/math&gt;

== Numbers ==
In this section, we shall describe some of the more commonly occurring types of numbers together with some of their properties.

===Types of Numbers===
====Natural Numbers, N====
As already mentioned, these are just ordinary counting numbers 1,2,3,4,...,29... . Note that zero has not been included in this set. This varies with different books or mathematicians and may include zero as a natural number.

An important property of the natural numbers is the ordering. Note that natural numbers come with an idea of size so that we can talk about larger and smaller natural numbers.

====Integers, Z====
By the integers, we mean the natural numbers together with their negatives and zero. Although we all, presumably, have a reasonably clear practical idea of how to work with the integers, there are definite problems as to what they actually are. Referring to such things as the 'number line' does not solve these problems because it relies heavily on our intuition.

One way that mathematicians solve this problem is to make an artificial construction which produces an artificial object with the properties we expect of the integers. Although we do not use this in everyday mathematics, it gives a precise definition which we can use to justify our use of negative numbers and also provides a model we can use when we wish to develop quite new constructions which are not so intuitively reasonable. We shall not describe this for the integers but will give a brief description next of a similar process starting with the integers and producing the rational numbers.

====Rational Numbers, Q====
With the integers, we have a number system which is closed under addition, multiplication and subtraction. The next step is to produce a collection numbers which is also closed under division (except by zero). This is the rational numbers. Again we should all be able to manipulate rational numbers but there is some problem with what they actually mean. For example, what does it mean to say that &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{6}=\frac{6}{9}&lt;/math&gt;? We usually want the equals sign to denote the fact that two things are identical and the ''symbols'' &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{6}&lt;/math&gt; are certainly not identical.

So we redefine what we mean by ''equality of fractions''. Let us consider the set of ordered pairs of integers with the second integer non-zero; that is,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}'=\{(x,y):a,b\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ne 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
(An ordered pair is just a pair in which it is specified which comes first and which second.) We want these ordered pairs to represent rational numbers but on a many-to-one basis. So we redefine equality of these ordered pairs by
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(a,b)\equiv (c,d)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ad = bc
&lt;/center&gt;
(Read this as (a,b) is ''equivalent to'' (c,d).) This corresponds to the usual definition of equality of fractions. We can then think of one rational number as being represented by a collection of ordered pairs of integers all equivalent to each other. Two ordered pairs represent the same rational number exactly when they are equivalent.
WE can then go on to define, in terms of the ordered pairs, the usual operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example,
&lt;center&gt;
(a,b) + (c,d) = (ad+bc,bd)
&lt;/center&gt;
We will define addition of rational numbers by taking an ordered pair for each number and then adding these ordered pairs. There is still a problem however. We need to be sure (without checking each case) that, for example, because &lt;math&gt;(2,3)\equiv (4,6)\equiv (6,9)&lt;/math&gt;, then also
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(2,3)+(5,6)\equiv (4,6)+(5,6)\equiv (6,9)+(5,6)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===What is order?===
Again, as we try to find a way to define, based on the already established ideas of addition, and the intuitive idea of order, in what sense is a number larger than another. In what way can we arrange the numbers?

With '''N''' this is easy, we say, if a, b are natural numbers, a &lt; b if there is a natural number c such that a + c = b. From the principle of induction, we can thus order '''N''' in the following manner:
1, 2, 3, ... 
As has been done before with our intuition.

With '''Z''', we run into a problem, where do we start? Since the principle of induction does not apply on '''Z''' as a whole, we have to write it as ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., leaving &quot;...&quot; on both sides.
However, the definition, as before, applies.

With '''Q''', clearly &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, yet &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt; is not in '''N''' and so our definition fails. The new definition would be 

'''Definition: (Order on Q)''' ''Let a, b be rational numbers, then a &lt; b if there is a positive rational number c such that a + c = b.''

We call a rational c positive if it is equivalent to a rational &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{m}&lt;/math&gt; such that n and m are both natural. In other words, if c = &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;, then c is positive if ''pq'' is a natural number. A simple exercise would be to show these are equivalent. (Note: Statements are equivalent if each implies the other.)

Any set such that for each two elements in it we can definitely say a &lt; b, a &gt; b, or a = b is called totally ordered.

===The least element property===
''Any non-empty subset of the natural numbers has a least element.'' The words 'any non-empty subset' mean that the subset we take should have at least one element in it.

Any set with the least element property is called well-ordered. Thus '''N''' is well-ordered as above, while '''Z''' and '''Q''' are not.

===Order properties of natural numbers===
(i) ''There is no largest natural number''.

(ii) ''There are natural numbers which are nearest neighbours in the sense that there is no natural number strictly between them.

===Not finished yet...===

== Proofs ==
===Definition===
A proof is simply a mathematical argument designed to convince the reader of some fact. However an intuitive proof differs from an inductive proof. The former being a fact that can be assumed to be an observable constant from daily experiences (e.g. when two test tubes of milk are poured into one beaker, then if we divide the final volume again into the two beakers, we should get full test tubes again (almost). This explains why ½+½ will still be 1. Since this follows from intuition/observation/experience alone it can be considered an intuitive proof.). The latter, inductive proof, is of the type where many intuitive proofs can be combined to get the desired result. For example, we know that pouring two test tubes of milk gave us two units in the beaker, so if the volume of the test tube can be regarded as a unit volume, then ''n'' such test tubes will give us a total of ''n'' units of milk in the beaker. '''Mathematical proof''' itself is based on natural logic and philosophy. Modern mathematics generally assumes most proofs to be absolute, not without reason though. This allows them to engage in complex problems using purely inductive reasoning. However the basis for all that still remains natural philosophy and logic. This is reflected in Newton's title to a relatively abstract mathematical treatment of his work being titled as 'Principles of natural philosophy'.

===Mathematical terms===
'''and''' - 'A and B' means that both A is true '''and''' B is true

'''not''' - This has the usual meaning in English; note that not(not(A)) is the same as A

'''or''' - This is always what is called 'inclusive or'. That is 'A or B' means that either A is true or B is true '''or both'''.

'''for all''' - This has the usual meaning in English

'''there exists''' - This has the usual meaning in English

'''implies; if-then''' - These kinds of statements are at the centre of mathematical reasoning.

'''if and only if; equivalent''' - 'A implies B' and 'B implies A'

'''Theorem, Proposition, Lemma''' - They all mean roughly the same thing but are in decreasing order of importance.

'''Corollary''' - Something which follows easily from a Theorem but for which the statement is not entirely obvious from the statement of the Theorem.

== Summation Notation ==
The summation notation is a convenient abbreviation for sums of several real numbers. If &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;,...,&lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; are reals, we define
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = a_1+a_2+...+a_n&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The ''summation index k'' is often called a ''dummy index'', as it can be replaced by any other letter:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j&lt;/math&gt;, etc.
&lt;/center&gt;
Sometimes it is convenient to start summation from 0 instead of 1, or from some other integral value. For instance,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^3 x_k = x_0+x_1+x_2+x_3&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=2}^5 j^3 = 2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3&lt;/math&gt;, etc.
&lt;/center&gt;
The most important properties of the summation notation can be summarized as

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k+b_k) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k +\sum_{k=1}^n b_k &lt;/math&gt; (additive property)

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n (ca_k) = c \sum_{i=1}^n (a_k)&lt;/math&gt; (homogeneous property)

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{k+1} = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} a_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; (index translation)

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k-a_{k-1}) = a_n-a_0&lt;/math&gt; (telescoping)

[[Conworld]] : [[conart]] : '''conmusic'''

== Introduction ==

Most westerners are unaware of the great variety there exists in music. Music is by no means the universal language it often is supposed to be. Even in such basic areas as the very building blocks of tonality there exist significant differences between Thai, Indian, Arab, Balinese and European music.

In order to be better equipped to create a new system, it is good to have some kind of grasp of what human cultures have created.

Therefore, this chapter will mostly analyze a number of musical systems somewhat superficially, and also go into the necessary math. Firstly, we will go into how scales are constructed. Secondly, we will look at some rather peculiar vocal techniques that mankind has come up with. Thirdly, miscellaneous things having to do with the music itself will be dealt with. Fourthly, the social and religious aspects of music will be discussed, and finally I will provide you with some listening advice.

The building blocks of music
* [[/Tuning|Can there be alternatives to C D E F G A B C..? ]] &lt;!-- a short introduction to the idea of microtones --&gt;
* [[/Difference|So, what's the difference?]] &lt;!-- a short introduction to how humans HEAR musical intervals, and what technical difference it'll make --&gt;
* [[/Pentatonics|So why are pentatonic scales so popular?]] &lt;!-- An explanation of the tuning ratios of pentatonics and how it relates to timbre --&gt;

The instrumentation and 
* [[/Vocal|Is it possible to sing in that way?]]
* [[/Misc|Are there other things to spice it up with?]]
* [[/Social|So, how do the people relate to music?]]
* [[/Listen|Listening recommendations.]]
&lt;!-- Tuning
----The basics of western 12 tone for reference
---- Just intonation
------ intervals as ratios
-------- the relationship simple ratio = harmony
-------- the most common chords as ratios
------ some words on singing and just intonation
-------- prime limits
-------- pros &amp; cons (pure intervals / modulation and transposing limited)
---- temperaments
------ equal temperaments
-------- how to calculate frequencies
-------- some rather nice equal temperaments
-------- what happens to just intonation ratios?
---------- leeway for maintaining harmony even though ratio goes complex
-------- pros &amp; cons (difficult to tune by ear / free modulation)
------ well-temperaments
-------- difference from equal temperaments
-------- pros &amp; cons (every key has slightly different character)
---- Arabic and Indian systems
---- Pelog and such
---- non-octave systems
---- systems with no apparent logic behind them
---- on timbre and tuning
------ special cases of timbre

-- Special vocal techniques
---- Tuvan throat &amp; overtone singing and similar techniques
------ overtones revisited
---- saame jojk (someone could help out on this)
---- yodeling (as well as this)
---- western opera singing (as well as this)
---- singing in tonal languages (as well as this)

-- Some other thoughts
---- the prevalence of pentatonic systems
---- Rhythm and meter (polyrhythms, tuplets, bars a relatively new invention)
---- Continuity (ie, tuvan music can have pauses half a minute long to catch breath within a song, whileas highly rhythmical music completely would lose the momentum by doing so)
---- drones, harmony, polyphony
---- the use of out of tune tones for effect (blues, jazz, folk; vocals, free-pitch instruments)

-- Music as a social/religious/cultural phenomenon (I don't know very much about this, so someone could help out on it, the following however are given for the music &amp; religion section, and I think I can pull these off:)
---- Christian theology and tuning and polyphony
---- instrumental music and Judaism
---- chanting for religious purposes (shamanism) --&gt;
&lt;!-- what I would like sections on under music as a social phenomenon, but I don't think I can pull off would be
---- blues, jazz, rock, pop as sociological phenomena

      <text xml:space="preserve">if someone knows anything about saame jojk, yoddling, or opera singing technique, some rather short chapters on those would be nice to have, since the two former have interesting characteristics, and the latter is so intimately bound to the evolution of the opera as an art form and the need for achieving volume without amplification and its subsequent effect on vibrato etc.

I will not be able to update this for the next couple of weeks, due to lack of Internet access at my upcoming apartment. However, I will continue the writing of it, plan it, make drafts, etc. and update it as soon as I get my computer plugged. Yep.

The beauty of induction is that it allows a theorem to be proven true where an infinite number of cases exist without exploring each case individually.  Induction is analogous to an infinite row of dominoes with each domino standing on its end.  If you want to make all the dominoes fall, you can either:
# push on the first one, wait to see what happens, and then check each domino afterwards (which may take a long time if there's an infinite number of dominoes!)
# or you can ''prove'' that if any domino falls, then it will cause the domino after it to fall.  (i.e. if the first one falls then the second one will fall, and if the second one falls then the third one will fall, etc.)

Induction, essentially, is the methodology outlined in point 2.

== Parts of Induction ==

Induction is composed of three parts:
# The Base Case (in the domino analogy, this shows the first domino will fall)
# The Induction Hypothesis (in the domino analogy, we assume that a particular domino will fall)
# The Inductive Step (in the domino analogy, we prove that the domino we assume will fall will cause the next domino to fall)

== Weak Induction ==

Weak induction is used to show that a given property holds for all members of a countable [[#inductiveSet|inductive set]], this usually is used for the set of natural numbers.

Weak induction for proving a statement &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; (that depends on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) relies on two steps:

* &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is true for a certain base step.  Usually the base case is &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;P(k)\Rightarrow P(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, given that &lt;math&gt;P(k)&lt;/math&gt; is true, &lt;math&gt;P(k+1)&lt;/math&gt; is also true.

If these two properties hold, one may induce that the property holds for all elements in the set in question.  Returning to the example, if you are sure that you called your neighbor, and you knew that everyone who was called in turn called his/her neighbor, then you would be guaranteed that everyone on the block had been called (assuming you had a linear block, or that it curved around nicely).

=== Examples ===

The first example of a proof by induction is always 'the sum of the first n terms:'

:'''Theorem 2.4.1.'''  For any fixed &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb N,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

* Base step: &lt;math&gt;1=\frac{1\cdot 2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the base case holds.

* Inductive step: Assume that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n}{i}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{i}=\sum_{i=1}^n i + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}+n+1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=(\frac{n}{2}+1)(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

So the inductive case holds.  Now by induction we see that the theorem is true.

== Reverse Induction ==

Reverse induction is a method of using an inductive step that uses a negative in the inductive step.  It is a minor variant of weak induction.  The process still applies only to countable sets, generally the set of whole numbers or integers, and will frequently stop at 1 or 0, rather than working for all positive numbers.

Reverse induction works in the following case.

* The property holds for a given value, say &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

* Given that the property holds for a given case, say &lt;math&gt;n=k+1&lt;/math&gt;, Show that the property holds for &lt;math&gt;n=k&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the property holds for all values &lt;math&gt;n\le M&lt;/math&gt;.

I learnt today from http://people.math.carleton.ca/~ckfong/hs14a.pdf (see example there) that reverse indcution is also usable in the general case:
&quot;to establish the validity of a sequence of propositions Pn (n ≥ 1), it is enough to establish the following

(a) Pn is valid for inﬁnitely many n.

(b) If Pn+1 is valid, then so is Pn.

It can be the case that we can easily prove P1 and if P for n=m so P for n=2m. In this case we have (a) for the infinitely many n = 2 exp k (for k &gt;= 0).

== Strong Induction ==

In weak induction, for the inductive step, we only required that for a given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, its ''immediate predecessor'' (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;) satisfies the theorem (i.e., &lt;math&gt;P(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; is true).  In strong induction, we require that not only the immediate predecessor, but all predecessors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the theorem.  The variation in the inductive step is:

*If &lt;math&gt;P(k)&lt;/math&gt; is true for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;n,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is true.

The reason this is called strong induction is fairly obvious--the hypothesis in the inductive step is much stronger than the hypothesis is in the case of weak induction.  Of course, for finite induction it turns out to be the same hypothesis, but in the case of transfinite sets, weak induction is not even well-defined, since some sets have elements that do not have an immediate predecessor.

== Transfinite Induction ==

Used in proving theorems involving transfinite cardinals.  This technique is used in set theory to prove properties of cardinals, since there is rarely another way to go about it.

&lt;div id=&quot;inductiveSet&quot; /&gt;
== Inductive Set ==
We first define the notion of a ''well-ordered'' set.  A set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''well-ordered'' if  there is a total order &lt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and that whenever &lt;math&gt;Y\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, there is a ''least-element'' in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;\exists p\in Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;q \ \forall q\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.  

An ''inductive set'' is a set &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; such that the following hold:

#&lt;math&gt;\alpha\in A&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the least element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;)
#If &lt;math&gt;\beta\in A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\forall\gamma\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt; \gamma, \gamma\in A&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, you look at that and say &quot;Wait a minute.  That means that &lt;math&gt;A=X&lt;/math&gt;!&quot;  And, of course you'd be right.  That's exactly why induction works.  The principle of induction is the theorem that says:

:'''Theorem 2.4.2.''' If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty well-ordered set and &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is an inductive subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A=X&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of this theorem is left as a very simple exercise.  Here we note that the set of natural numbers is clearly well-ordered with the normal order that you are familiar with, so &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an inductive set.  If you accept the axiom of choice, then it follows that every set can be well-ordered.

== Exercises ==
{{dynamic navigation|expand=no|title=
Show that this identity holds for all positive integers:
  {{Math|big=1|1 + 2 + 3 + &amp;hellip; + n &amp;#61; {{sfrac|n(n + 1)|2}}}}
  &amp;nbsp;
|body=
First, we show that it holds for integers 1, 2 and 3
:1 = 2&amp;times;1/2
:1 + 2 = 3&amp;times;2/2
:1 + 2 + 3 = 4&amp;times;3/2 = 6
Suppose the identiy holds for some number ''k'', then
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k &lt;/math&gt;
is true.

We aim to show that:
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) = \frac{1}{2}(k + 2)(k + 1) &lt;/math&gt;
is also true.
We proceed
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp; &amp; =&amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k\\
\\
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp;+ (k + 1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k + (k + 1)\\
\\
&amp; &amp; = &amp; (k + 1)(\frac{k}{2} + 1)\\
\\
&amp; &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)(k + 2)
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is what we have set out to show. Since the identity holds for 3, it also holds for 4 and since it holds for 4 it also holds for 5, and 6 and 7 and so on.

&lt;/table&gt;

Show that {{Math|big=1|n! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for n &amp;ge; 4}}.
|body=
The claim is true for n = 4. As 4! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. 24 &gt; 16.
Now suppose it's true for n = k, k &amp;ge; 4, i.e.
:k! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;
it follows that
:(k+1)k! &gt; (k+1)2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;
:(k+1)! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;
We have shown that if for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Since it's true for n = 4, it's true for n = 5, 6, 7, 8 and so on for all n.

{{dynamic navigation|expand=no|title=
Show that:
  {{Math|big=1|1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + &amp;hellip; + n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;#61; {{sfrac|(n+1)&lt;sup&gt;2n²&lt;/sup&gt;|4}}}}
  &amp;nbsp;
|body=

Suppose it's true for n = k, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ k^3 = \frac {(k+1)^2k^2}{4} &lt;/math&gt;
it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ k^3 + (k+1)^3 &amp; = &amp;\frac {(k+1)^2k^2}{4} + (k+1)^3\\
&amp; = &amp;  (k+1)^2 (\frac{k^2}{4} + (k+1))\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac {1}{4}(k+1)^2 (k^2 + 4k + 4)\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac {1}{4}(k+1)^2 (k + 2)^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
We have shown that if it's true for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Now it's true for n = 1 (clear). Therefore it's true for all integers.

Adding &lt;math&gt;(k+1)^2&lt;/math&gt; to both sides,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}

&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n\ge 1+nx&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x\ge -1&lt;/math&gt;

First, we show that this statement holds for ''n''=1. 

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^1\ge 1+1\times x&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^1 = 1+1\times x&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that the equation holds for ''n''=''k''. Then, 

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^k\ge 1+kx&lt;/math&gt;

We aim  to show that &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^{k+1}\ge 1+(k+1) x&lt;/math&gt;.

The last step relies on the fact that &lt;math&gt;kx^2 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;k \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and a square is always greater than or equal to 0.

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^{k+1}\ge 1+(k+1) x&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(1-1)^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}1^4&lt;1^3&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\frac{1}{4}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+...+(k-1)^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}k^4&lt;1^3+2^3+...+k^3&lt;/math&gt;

We aim  to show that &lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+...+k^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4&lt;1^3+2^3+...+(k+1)^3&lt;/math&gt;

We know that &lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+...+k^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}k^4+k^3&lt;/math&gt; (added &lt;math&gt;k^3&lt;/math&gt; to both sides of &lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+...+(k-1)^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}k^4&lt;/math&gt;). 

Now we need to show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}k^4+k^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}k^4+k^3&lt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4 \Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4}(k^4+4k^3)&lt;\frac{1}{4}(k^4+4k^3+6k^2+4k+1) \Leftrightarrow 0&lt;\frac{1}{4}(6k^2+4k+1)&lt;/math&gt;

Now we need to show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4&lt;\frac{1}{4}k^4+(k+1)^3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}

\\ \ &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; 0 &lt; \frac{1}{4}(6k^2+8k+3)

The last statement is clearly true (&lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4&lt;\frac{1}{4}k^4+(k+1)^3&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}(k+1)^4&lt;1^3+2^3+...+(k+1)^3&lt;/math&gt;.

|body=
 &lt;math&gt;1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}+...+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\le 2\sqrt{n}-1&lt;/math&gt;

First, we show that this statement holds for ''n'' = 1.

:&lt;math&gt;1\le 2\sqrt{n}-1&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;1\le1&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that the inequality holds for ''n''=''k''. Then,

We know that &lt;math&gt;1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}+...+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}\le 2\sqrt{k}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}-1&lt;/math&gt; (added &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt; to both sides of &lt;math&gt;1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}+...+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\le 2\sqrt{k}-1&lt;/math&gt;). 

Now we need to show that &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{k}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}-1 \le 2\sqrt{k+1}-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\ 2\sqrt{k}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}-1 \le 2\sqrt{k+1}-1
&amp;\Leftrightarrow &amp; 2\sqrt{k}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}} \le 2\sqrt{k+1}
\\ \ &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; 2\sqrt{k \cdot (k+1)}+1 \le 2(k+1)
\\ \ &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; 2\sqrt{k \cdot (k+1)} \le 2k+1
\\ \ &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; 2^2 \cdot {\sqrt{k \cdot (k+1)}}^2 \le {(2k+1)}^2

\\ \ &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; 0 \le 1
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The last statement is clearly true. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{k}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}-1 \le 2\sqrt{k+1}-1&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}+...+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}\le 2\sqrt{k}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}-1 \le 2\sqrt{k+1}-1&lt;/math&gt;, the inductive step, and by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why make a conworld?==

Why do people conworld? Why do people conlang? People go about doing these things for very different reasons, and not surprisingly, the results can also be widely different.

Some people micromanage when they conworld. They draw detailed maps of plate tectonics and then synchronize these with enormous evolutionary trees; they derive meticulously all of their languages from common ancestor languages, tweaking every single irregular verb; their maps are covered with carefully shaded mountainsides and hydrologically plausible drainage systems. For these people, that final satisfaction of everything fitting together perfectly is where the fun lies. But others disagree; their continents are broad strokes of geometrical wonder that utterly defy geological explanation; their flora and fauna are wondrously improbable; their forests are enchanted with magical beings. How did these magical beings originate? Who cares? For what is the fun of conworlding if you can't have some freedom?

Some people willingly and deliberately inject ideas from the real world into their conworld, using their conworld as a kind of test bed for political and philosophical theory (what if an anarchist society existed in ancient times or subjective idealism had practical implications for technology?). People may feel passionately about a real-world culture, or philosophy, and they reflect it into their conworld, when their nations, perhaps, come to resemble greatly those of Medieval Europe, or Arabia, or the Mayans. But others want to create something that is utterly new and completely unlike anything that has ever existed. To them, the real world is boring &amp;mdash; and it's what's in your mind that's really unique and interesting!

Some people make their conworlds utopias.  Their political beliefs are reflected in their conworlds; all of their citizens are happy, productive, prosperous members of what they think would be a perfect society.  Along a similar vein, some people make their conlangs poetic and melodic, their conreligions noble and benevolent.  But there are others who take on a more realist, even pessimistic view.  These people have conworlds filled with slavery, poverty, lawlessness, and war; their conlangs are quirky, if not downright unpleasant; their conreligions initiate bloody conquests and massacres.  And what kind of conworld itself constitutes a utopia is as varied as the religious and political beliefs of the utopians who create these conworlds: a world bordering on the modern and futuristic with beeping electronic technology and commerce and endless entertainment; a medieval world in whose Chain of Being everyone lives beneath a Good King figure; an anarchy; a realization of Christian ideals or Sharia; a peaceful, pastel-colored butterfly-inhabited island where there are no wars; a working model of Communism in which citizens greet their comrades; a theocracy below a God Emperor with tight gender roles into which everyone neatly and dutifully falls to please their ancestors.

Some people conworld for another, different purpose. They are perhaps hosting a role-playing game and need to construct a background with richness and detail; perhaps they are writing a novel and need some place to set it in; or perhaps the conworlds exist for the very purpose of expositing their conception of a utopia. And then there are others to whom the conworld itself is the purpose. To them, the creation ''is'' the conworld; if they do eventually turn it into the setting of a novel, then the novel is merely an exposition of the great masterpiece behind it &amp;mdash; the conworld.

{{mergefrom|Transwiki:Manual transmission driving technique}}

== Introduction ==

This document attempts to describe everyday use of an automobile.
The class of automobile considered is an average performance, front-wheel drive consumer vehicle.

== Accelerator ==

The accelerator, also known as the ''gas pedal'' controls the engine output.
Pressing the accelerator increases the revolutions of the engine, mainly by allowing more air to enter the combustion chambers, or the cylinders, per revolution.
The revolutions for various stages in this section depend on the engine, and every engine has a unique set of values.
The ''tachometer'' gives the value of engine speed at any time.
However, an experienced driver is supposed to know the speed of the engine without taking eyes off the road.
When the car is first started, the engine moves at a speed called the ''idle speed''.
Many consumer cars provide means of changing the idle speed of the engine.

Say the idle speed of an engine is 1000 rpm (revolutions per minute).
There is a minimum speed below which the engine will not fire, called the ''stall speed'', and would be about 750 rpm for our engine.
The other bounding value for the engine speed is called the ''red line''.
This is the maximum speed at which the engine can safely operate.
For our engine, it is about 7000 rpm.
Thus, it is the job of the driver to make sure that the engine speed stays between the stall speed and the red line. Moreover, the accelerator plays a very important role in the over all working of the engine thereby controlling the intake of the air inside the cylinder.

== Steering ==

Almost all the vehicles on the road today have some sort of steering wheel which is used to turn the tires.
Typically, a rack and pinion mechanism is used which will turn the tires by a few degrees for several rotations of the steering wheel.
Some vehicles have a dead zone at the center of the rack, so that you don't have to constantly adjust the steering while driving on the highway.

In the normal position, both hands should be on the wheel in the 10-2 position.
To make a turn in a vehicle, rotate the steering wheel at the start of the turn.
To make a turn to the left while moving forward, move your left hand to the top of the wheel, and pull down to the left.
At the same time, let the wheel run through your right hand.
As you near the end of the turn, steady the vehicle by moving your right hand to the top of the wheel and pulling down and right.
''Do not allow the wheel to spin back on its own!''
Even though this is very tempting, if you do, you will very likely lose control of the vehicle.
You should have the wheels straightened when the turn is complete, or the vehicle will travel in an ''S'' shape, which is bad form.

Most consumer vehicles are ''understeered'', as it is easier to handle for novices and unskilled drivers.
Also, it is difficult to achieve neutral or ''oversteer'' in front wheel drive vehicles.

=== Power Steering ===

Most modern vehicles marketed towards the average consumer has some sort of ''power steering'' installed.
This means that the actual task of turning the wheels is performed by indirect means.
Power steering is not preferred in racing cars as they reduce road feedback.
However, it is much appreciated by the general public, especially for low speed maneuvers.
New technology has come up with a very good solution--the speed sensitive power steering.
This kind of power steering gives effortless low speed maneuvers, but firms up at higher speeds so that you can judge the grip of the tires accurately.

In general, there are two kinds of power steerings available--hydraulic power steering and electronic power steering.
Electronic power steering is the more advanced of the two and is found in more advanced/modern vehicles.
However, the feedback in hydraulic power steering is much better, so that driving is much more fun compared to a car with electronic power steering.

== Turning Radius and Maneuverability ==

The turning radius of a vehicle is the radius of the smallest circle in which it can turn.
Two different values are given--the often quoted value is the ''curb turning radius'', which is half the width of a road in which you can make a smooth turn without hitting the curb.
The other value is called ''wall to wall turning radius'', which is half the distance between parallel walls where the vehicle can turn.

The turning radius of a vehicle depends mainly on the ''wheel base'' and the ''wheel cut'' of the vehicle.
Wheel base is the distance between the front and the rear axle.
Wheel cut is the maximum angle through which the tires turn when the steering is rotated from the center.
The smaller the wheel base, the smaller the turning radius, while smaller the wheel cut, the larger the turning radius.
It may seem that a larger wheel cut is preferable.
However, a larger wheel rotation will lead to more side forces on the tires, which might damage them.

Note that when a vehicle turns, the front wheels will have to turn by different angles so that there is no slippage.
In a turn, the inner front wheel will have a larger cut.
This is achieved by a mechanism known as ''Ackerman linkage''.
One of the modifications that you can make on a stock vehicle is increasing the wheel cut.

Given the front and rear overhang, the wheel base, and the wheel cut, we can calculate the wall to wall turning radius for low speed maneuvers for a vehicle.

The turning radius is related to the ''maneuverability'' of the vehicle, and also affects the design of parking spaces and driveways.
What complicates the design is that the radius of the vehicle's travel varies continuously.
Commercial software is available for such applications, but it takes a very simplified view--''i.e.'', that the radius is constant, and equal to the turning radius.
While this may enable us to see the absolute minimum space, the assumption is that either the driver stops the vehicle completely before making the turn (a very difficult maneuver without power steering), or that the steering is rotated extremely rapidly.
What is more natural is that the vehicle is steered slightly at higher speeds, and more rotation is applied as the speed reduces, with the turning radius being achieved about 20% into the turn.
Similar conditions apply to exiting the turn.

== Aerodynamic Forces and Stability ==

Modern automobiles travel at high speeds on flat roads, and this leads to large aerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle.
The streamlined, close to airfoil nature of many vehicles lead to a large amount of lift even at moderate speeds.
Many sports cars attempt to reduce the lift problem by having rear spoilers.
Some of the higher end (though not the highest) cars attempt to provide more downward force using a rear wing.
Note that such tricks increase the drag and reduce the top speed of the car.

Racing vehicles have attempted to deal with instability by lowering the body so that air cannot get between the under body and the road.
Non racing vehicles are also expected to handle certain amount of unevenness in their path, so that they have a large ''breakover angle''.
Another method employed is to use a pump to lower the pressure at the bottom of the car, reducing the lift.
However, this is not very practical for a standard car.

=== Drag Coefficient ===

The drag coefficient of a car gives an indication of how aerodynamic the car is.
However, note that ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'', the drag coefficient is defined as

&lt;math&gt;C_D = \frac{drag}{\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2A}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the air velocity of the car, and ''A'' is the frontal area.
Thus, a small sports car will have much lower drag compared to a van for the same velocity.
Modern automobiles quote a ''C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' value of less than .35, but frontal area is what counts in this situation.

As can be seen from the above equation, the drag force is proportional to the square of the air speed.
Thus the horsepower required to overcome drag force is proportional to the third power of the speed of the vehicle.
The rolling resistance is approximately independent of the speed of the vehicle, so that the horsepower required to overcome rolling resistance is proportional to the speed of the vehicle (''i.e.'' it increases linearly).
Thus, it is easy to see why it most sports vehicles have top speeds around 200 mph--to have a 20 mph increase in top speed a vehicle with 400 HP engine would need an additional 130 HP!

== Driving a Standard (or Manual) transmission ==

Many high performance cars, like older (before 1990) sports cars have manual transmissions.
Also, cars with very low power output have manual transmission.
For the sports cars, the owners are interested in the highest possible performance, and automatic transmissions, which contain &quot;slush boxes&quot; are not acceptable.
The really small cars produce so little power in their engines that they cannot afford to waste any in the automatic transmission.
Even a very well designed automatic will have about 5% losses due to the torque converter.
Also, automatic transmissions are relatively heavier and more expensive compared to equivalent manual transmissions.
The really high performance sports car being sold today have the automatic manual transmissions, which have the best of both worlds.

=== Preparation ===

Before driving the car, make sure that you are able to sit in a comfortable position.
Adjust the rear view mirrors so that you have a good field of vision.
Depress the various pedals to make sure that you are comfortable with the operations necessary for driving the vehicle.

=== Starting From Rest ===

Many manual transmissions have a hand brake (also called parking brake).
When parked, they are secured by pressing the button and pulling the parking brake upwards until enough pressure is applied to secure the vehicle. 

If the vehicle is on a level road, starting is quite straightforward.
Place your right leg above the brake pedal and press down just to be safe.
You will have to apply a relatively large force because the power brakes depend on engine vacuum to work.
Put the vehicle in neutral gear by depressing the clutch and moving the lever down to the neutral position.
For a modern vehicle, you can start by turning the key, which will start the engine at idle speed.
For older vehicles, you may need to depress the gas pedal when you start.
For both cases, after the engine has started, slightly depress the gas pedal to increase engine speed and hold it there.
Some sports cars such as the Porsche Carrera GT have variable idle speed, so that the idle speed increases as the clutch engages, which means that you can start the engine without depressing the accelerator at all.
You should not race the engine, as it will cause a lot of damage, the only resistance to increase in the engine speed is the inertia of the small fly wheel.
Release the clutch to the bite point, where the vehicle starts to move slightly forward.
After this, release the clutch slowly and smoothly and this will move the vehicle forward.
After the clutch has engaged fully, remove foot from the clutch.
You should never drive the vehicle with foot resting on the clutch.
Depress the accelerator some more to increase speed.

Follow the same procedure, but with the reverse gear instead of the first gear for moving backwards from rest.
Note however, that you will not be running with the clutch fully engaged in most cases since the speed will be too high for basic maneuvers.

==== Starting on an Incline ====

Many times, you may be forced to park on a hill or incline.
In this case, it is important that you be able to start the vehicle without it going backward, and potentially hitting someone behind you.
There is a good way and two bad ways to do this.

The first bad way is to use the handbrake to hold the car while you put your foot on the accelerator and the clutch pedal.
Now press the accelerator slightly and hold it there, so that the engine is at a speed somewhat higher than idle speed.
Release the clutch till it reaches bite point, and as you feel the car starting to move forward, release the handbrake.
This still requires considerable skill, as the engine will stall if you don't release the handbrake in time.
Further, it will not work in cars which don't have a handbrake (many manual transmissions don't).

The second bad way is to put the vehicle in first gear and engaging the clutch fast enough while depressing the accelerator.
The vehicle might not even move back if you do it fast enough.
This can be done in places where you don't have any vehicles right behind you, and even if the vehicle moves back a little, you don't cause any damage.

The good way to start a vehicle on an incline is to hold the vehicle on the incline using the foot brake and slowly release the clutch.
When you feel the clutch reach the bite point, remove the foot quickly from the brake and depress the accelerator slightly.
Note that if you engage the clutch fully, or very close to that, the engine will stall as it tries to work against the slope and the foot brake.
So the ideal point for releasing the brake is at a very small point before the bite point.
Now, the engine is at its idle speed, and cannot pull the vehicle up the slope if the clutch is engaged.
Even if you engage the clutch slowly at this point, the engine will stall.
You will have to depress the accelerator so that the engine speed (and the torque) increases.
Now release the clutch smoothly, while releasing the accelerator slightly.
If you release the clutch and don't release the accelerator, the vehicle will move forward with a larger speed than you want.
If you have done everything right, the vehicle will move forward, and this works in all situations.
The usual mistake in this procedure comes from the inability to judge the bite point.
On level ground, you can feel the vehicle start to move forward when the clutch starts to engage.
However, on the slope, this effect is quite subtle and is easily missed, as the brake prevents the vehicle from moving.
If you release the clutch too much, the engine will stall.
In that case, depress the clutch, shift to neutral and start the engine again.
However, if you don't release the clutch enough when you remove your foot from the brake, then you will be in a lot of trouble.
If the clutch has made ''some'' contact, then you can depress the accelerator a lot to increase the torque, and move the vehicle forward.
However, note that when you do this, you will have to release the accelerator fast as the clutch engages or the vehicle will shoot forward.
Also, when you engage the clutch at such high speeds and torques, there is a lot of wear.
If you release the accelerator too much, the engine will stall.
The other possibility is that the clutch hasn't engaged at all when you remove your foot from the brake.
This is the worst result possible, as the vehicle will now move backward, possibly colliding with the vehicle behind you.
In driving tests, the vehicle moving back is instant failure.
Note that it is a very bad idea to hold the vehicle on an incline using the clutch, as it can cause rapid clutch wear.

=== Stopping a Vehicle ===

Depress the brake slightly to slow the vehicle, and once a good amount of speed has been removed depress the clutch fully and apply brakes smoothly to stop the vehicle wherever you want.
After the vehicle comes to a stop, put the vehicle in neutral without releasing the brake.
Turn off the engine.
Now depress the clutch and if it is a downhill slope put the vehicle in reverse.
Otherwise, put it in first gear.
Release the clutch, and only then release the brake.
You can stop a vehicle from any gear, but remember not to run the vehicle with the clutch depressed for a long time as it can still cause clutch wear.
If your vehicle has a handbrake, engage the hand brake now.

=== Shifting to Higher Gears ===

Once you have successfully engaged the clutch in first gear, you should immediately increase speed and engage the second gear.
You should never operate the vehicle only in the first gear. It is used for starting the movement of the car from a dead stop and low speeds under 15 mph constant speed.
Also, never shift to first gear while the vehicle is moving.
To engage the second gear, release the accelerator and depress the clutch fully.

If you don't depress the clutch fully, you won't be able to move the shift lever in well designed cars.
In many cars, no such fool proof method exists and the result will most likely be a sickening grinding sound of your transmission falling apart.

Move the lever down smoothly to the center.
It should automatically fall into the neutral position.
Now move the lever to the left and then pull down.
Release the clutch smoothly and after that is done, depress the accelerator to increase speed suitable for second gear.

Your aim is to operate the vehicle at the highest gear possible considering the state of the road and traffic.
Thus you should shift to the third gear as soon as possible, and this is as soon as your vehicle speed reaches the minimum value at which it can be driven in the third gear without stalling.
To shift into third gear, release the accelerator and depress the clutch fully.
Move the shift lever up slightly, and it will fall into the neutral position.
In most passenger cars you can now move the lever up from here to the third gear position.

However, some vehicles may have the neutral position midway between the first and third lever positions, so that you may need to move it slightly to the right to move it up to third.
As you can imagine, it takes quite a lot of practice before you can shift to the third gear of such a vehicle, which makes it very difficult to drive.
Hopefully, the market will eliminate such unfriendly designs.

For a vehicle which has six gears, however, the standard H is necessarily different.
For instance, the typical BMW shift has the reverse in the leftmost top position, with nothing vertically down.
The six forward gears are arranged opposite each other in pairs, with the neutral between third and fourth.

Now that you have moved the lever to the third gear position, release the clutch.
Depress the accelerator to increase speed and move to the next higher gear.

Moving to fourth gear is straightforward in almost all vehicles (even in the difficult ones mentioned earlier).
Remove your foot from the accelerator, and depress the clutch fully.
Pull the shift lever all the way down and this will move it to the fourth gear position.
Now release the clutch and place your foot on the accelerator and increase the speed by depressing the accelerator.

Most vehicles have five forward gears, and engaging the fifth gear (usually the overdrive gear) is not difficult.
Remove your foot from the accelerator, and depress the clutch fully.
Move the shift lever up from the fourth gear and it will fall into the neutral position.
Now move it all the way to the right and move it up to the fifth gear position.
Release the clutch and depress the accelerator to achieve the speed limit value for the road.
Note that you should never skip a gear, in most situations.
So what exactly happens when you carry out  the instructions above?
When you take your foot off the accelerator, the engine loses speed due to internal friction and tries to fall back into idle speed.
By the time you complete the actions required to shift the gear position, the rpm of the engine has fallen a fair bit.
This is good, because you need the engine rpm to decrease when you shift gears up.
Thus, taking the foot of the accelerator for the duration achieves the ideal.
This clears up the intent of the statement in the beginning of the paragraph.
The idea is to reduce the engine rpm to an acceptable value while keeping the road speed up.
The reduction in speed will not be possible with skipping gears on a level road.
If you wait a long time, then the road speed will also decrease, so that it will not be greater than the minimum required for that gear.
Thus, you cannot shift from third to fifth, say, under normal circumstances.

=== Shifting to Lower Gears ===

The most fuel efficient setting to drive a vehicle is at the highest gear available.
However, there are cases when you might shift to a lower gear.
The most common is when you have to reduce speed due to road conditions or traffic.
There are two common methods to shift down, and one is much simpler than the other.

The common way to downshift to reduce speed is as follows.
Remove foot from the accelerator and apply brake so that the speed of the vehicle reduces.
Now depress the clutch fully and continue applying brakes till the desired speed is reached.
Now release the brake and move the lever to the gear position appropriate for the speed.
Release clutch slowly.
Depress accelerator and continue.
For instance, if you see that the vehicle in front is temporarily slowing down, you might want to shift down one gear, say, from fifth to fourth.
However, if there is a major obstruction in the road, you might want to slow down to walking speed, and this requires engaging the clutch when in second gear.
Remember that unlike shifting up, you can choose whatever gear you want when downshifting depending on the vehicle speed, except the first.
Choose the first gear only if you have come to a complete stop.

==== Double De-Clutching ====

Note that when you need to move to a lower gear, you want the engine to spin at a higher rpm than it is doing while in the higher gear.
But if you have read the explanation of up shifting in the previous section, you will see that the engine speed will ''fall'' when you remove your foot from the accelerator.
Now if you engage the clutch, the car will jerk as the engine tries to pick up speed.
This is very hard on the synchro and the engine.
The standard way to deal with this is to depress the accelerator while engaging the clutch slowly.
However, this causes excessive clutch wear.
The other method, which requires some skill, is called ''double de-clutching''.

In this method, you take the foot off the accelerator, and depress the clutch fully.
Then move the lever into the neutral position and release the clutch.
Now depress the accelerator for a very short duration, which can be safely done as the clutch is engaged.
Now release the accelerator and depress the clutch.
Move the lever to the next lower gear, and the clutch can be engaged smoothly.
Notice that you will be using the brake to slow the vehicle down, and this method requires you to take your foot off the brake to press the accelerator for a while.
If you are braking because of some traffic trouble or an obstruction on the road, you may not want to do this.
Also, this causes a sudden change in the forces applied on the vehicle, and it can affect the contact between the tire and the surface.
Ideally, all the actions in the vehicles must be smooth, and you should avoid sudden acceleration, braking, steering adjustment etc.
One way to avoid taking your foot off the brake is the so called &quot;heel and toe&quot; method.
In this method, you apply brakes to slow the car down, and then depress the accelerator with your heel while keeping your toe on the brake when the gear position is in neutral.
As you can imagine, doing so without changing the pressure on the brake pedal requires a lot of practice, but once done right, it is the best method.

==== When to Downshift? ====

While the primary reason for downshifting is to reduce speed, there are other situations where it is useful.
You get higher torque in lower gears, and you may want to shift down when facing a hill, if you want to avoid a stall.
Another is when you want to overtake a vehicle quickly.
You can get much more power when overtaking in, say, the fourth gear rather than the fifth gear if the vehicle has a 5 speed transmission.
However, remember that the engine will red line (above recommended &quot;rotations per minute of the crankshaft&quot; which is referred too as &quot;RPM&quot;) at much lower speeds in lower gears.

=== Fuel Efficiency ===

The manual transmission is very efficient in terms of power transfer in that it doesn't have the fixed 5% loss in automatics.
However, another reason many prefer manual transmissions is that it places a lot of control in the hands of the driver.
While climbing a hill, you use a lower gear, since it will have larger torque available.
However, once at the top, you can shift to neutral and turn off the engine, and roll down the hill.
At the foot of the hill, depending on the speed you can shift to the appropriate gear.
Note that the above may not be possible on many modern computer controlled cars, where shutting off the engine may lead to damage many of the running parts, and locking of the steering wheel.

=== Power Band ===

The power band is the range of engine rpm where it produces good power output and this is between the torque peak and the power peak.
In fact, the whole purpose of the gear box is to make sure that the engine works inside the power band at all times.
Consider a vehicle going up a hill--as it moves up from level ground, the slope will cause and increased load against which the wheels have to work.
If the engine is already in the power band, the reduction in speed will increase the torque (as it is beyond the torque peak), and you won't have to shift down.
On the other hand, if the engine is not in the power band, the uphill motion will cause the RPM and torque to fall, requiring a quick down shift.
If you enter a slope with the engine already lugging (too slow (low rpm)for that gear), you may have to double de-clutch (modern cars have syncronisers in all gears for upshifts and downshifts except reverse) rapidly to a lower gear or a gear two positions lower.
For instance, if you approach a hill at the lower limit of your fourth gear, shifting down to third may not help due to the loss of momentum due to the slope of the hill.
You will need to double de-clutch into second gear and then accelerate into third.

=== Braking ===

When you encounter an obstacle in the road and want to slow down, you will do so by first removing your foot from the accelerator and allowing the vehicle to slow down before applying the brake.
It is a good idea to give the driver behind you a warning in this occasion by blipping the brake.
After the vehicle has slowed down a bit (engine braking), apply brakes slowly to reduce speed, and then depress clutch fully and slow down further by braking smoothly.
Now you can switch to the appropriate lower gear and remove your foot from the brake.

One place where need for braking is not so obvious is while coming down a speed breaker.
If you don't break when the rear wheel moves down the speed breaker, the rear end of your car will strike the ground, especially if it has a large overhang at the rear.
So the procedure should be--brake well before the obstacle to make sure that your front is clear of it as the nose dips due to braking, then move smoothly up, making sure you have enough momentum to carry you through (very bad idea to have to rev your engine on a slope), and then when the rear wheel comes off the obstacle reduce the speed even further by smooth braking.

Should you use engine braking?
Well, engine braking still acts through the wheels, so there is no great improvement in road handling.
However, if you are travelling downhill, engine braking is recommended (and is the preferred method) as using the brake pedal will cause overheating and failure of the brake pads.
Another use for engine braking is if you need to come to a stop rapidly.
That is, if you have a vehicle suddenly stop before you, or you have a pedestrian jump in front, and you must absolutely stop the vehicle.
Here you can switch to the lower gear rapidly (say from the 5th to the 2nd), and use the engine for braking along with the brake pads.
Thus, if you have mastered rapid downshifting, you can bring the car to a stop using this method by using all the gears from 5th down to 2nd, instead of skipping gears.
This will definitely cause engine damage, but is preferable to loss of life (either to you or the other people on the road).
The usual method to use engine braking is to switch to a lower gear for this purpose.

The stopping distance in braking is roughly proportional to the square of the speed of the vehicle.
Thus, you will need twice the stopping distance at 40 mph compared to 30 mph.
The stopping distance also depends on the road conditions (whether it is wet, the road is sealed) and the condition of the tires.
It is very important that you maintain adequate distance between your vehicle and the vehicles in front of you as well as the vehicles behind you.
You should reduce speed and increase the distance in wet conditions, for instance.

=== Engine Damage ===

If you follow the safe and recommended practices while using your car, your engine will last a long time.
Note that the engine should not be raced (high rpm at low loads) or loaded at low rpm.
It is easy to get feedback on high rpm--the engine noise increases as speed increases.
However, low rpm loading, where you open the throttle at high gear when the rpm is low, is not as easy to detect.
If you find yourself depressing the accelerator pedal too much at high gear, shift down to a lower gear to bring the engine speed up.
Always be aware of the speed of your vehicle as you drive, and as soon as it drops, shift the gear down, this might result in more gear shifts, and that is all the more reason to choose a vehicle with a good gear box.

You don't usually have much choice in the kind of roads that you drive on, but try to use level roads as far as possible.
Also, make sure that your driveway is flat and if it is at a higher level than the road, then make sure that the incline is closer to the road than the final parking position.
Remember the warning about low rpms and high loads.
A sure fire way to severe engine damage is an inclined driveway, which you drive up everyday at low speeds.

If you look at the load on the bore due to the dynamics of the crank motion of the piston and crankshaft assembly you will find that force acts on one side of the cylinder.
Now, a properly designed engine will have the combustion forces act in such a way as to cancel this effect.

== Driving Test ==

You will need a license to drive a vehicle in any country in the world.
The specifics of tests will differ, but the general idea is to demonstrate your ability to handle the class of vehicle for which you are applying for a license.
A commercial license (to drive trucks, say) will have much more stringent requirements compared to a consumer license (such as for automobiles).
There might be additional restrictions too--for instance, in many countries you cannot obtain a license to drive a manual transmission if you take the test on an automatic.
The test consists of a written exam to test your knowledge of rules specific to the country/area as well as general rules, and a hands on test where you drive the vehicle in traffic as well as some specific maneuvers that you are required to perform.
Also, you might be asked to negotiate some configurations (like the ''standard 8'').
The maneuvers might include, among other, parallel parking, and starting on an incline.

=== Parallel Parking ===

Parallel parking is used to park a car on the side of a road, between two parked vehicles. 

[[Image:ParallelParkingAnimation.gif|right]]

Some of the newer cars (e.g. the [[wikipedia:Toyota Prius|Toyota Prius]]) have automatic parallel parking, where it is done by the onboard computer.

== Driving Terrain and Obstructions ==

When you come across a road with pot holes in it, apart from slowing down, make sure that only one wheel goes into the pothole.
Of course, it would be even better if you could avoid it altogether, but sometimes that is not possible.

Sometimes you may have to stop at a speed breaker--a good idea would be to straddle your vehicle across it, if you cannot go past it altogether before stopping.
When you start, you can engage the clutch without revving the engine and then use the momentum to carry you over the obstruction.

Sometimes you get into a hole which you cannot climb out of even with a lot of revving.
In this case you should unload your passenger and rock your vehicle using the first and reverse gears in sequence, building up amplitude as you would do with a swing.
Do not do this for more than a minute or two as you can easily damage the engine.
If rocking fails, you can try jacking the vehicle up, and filling the hole with some material from the road.

== Low End Performance ==

Many cars are not driven on highways, but within the city.
While automobile manufacturers like to quote highway fuel efficiency and performance for their cars, many vehicles will spend most of their fuel in the city.
As was mentioned earlier, the key to fuel efficiency is to run the vehicle at as high a gear as possible without lugging.
This can be done by extending the power band to the low rpm range.
One way to do this is by way of an exhaust chamber tuned for low end performance.
Using resonance, it is possible to reduce the back pressure from the exhaust gases, so that the breathing of the engine is better even at lower speeds.

A hot rod method to increase low end torque is to use a water spray to cool the exhaust, which will reduce its pressure, leading to better engine breathing.
A big design issue is to prevent entry of moisture into the combustion chamber.
This kind of mechanism was used in the earlier heavy transport aircraft during take off.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We can make electrons move in a conductor by supplying energy. If we apply the energy equally, for instance, by heating it, the electrons will move randomly from atom to atom. This isn't very useful to us. We want to be able to control the direction and flow of the electrons. We can accomplish this by attaching a negative source to one end of our conductor and a positive source to the other end. We have just created a circuit. The electrons will flow from the negative end to the positive end. 	

As we stated earlier, heat is one method of causing electrons to flow. We can also do this by using friction, pressure (some crystals will create electron flow under pressure see piezoelectric effect), magnetism, photoelectric effect, and chemical reactions. Chemical reactions are perhaps the most common source of direct current, better known as a cell or battery. 

A battery usually consists of two conductors, or electrodes, placed in an electrolyte or the chemicals responsible for reacting and producing current flow. There are a large number of different types of batteries. The common carbon-zinc flashlight battery is an example of a primary cell, that is a battery that cannot be recharged. The lead acid car battery is an example of a secondary cell, or a cell that can be recharged. Be cautious with alkaline batteries, some are primary  and some are secondary types. Attempting to recharge a primary battery can be dangerous especially if the heat built up inside the cell causes it to explode.

: Well, this was just a basic outline I set up. We can change it later if there are problems.
: I was planning on &quot;What If&quot; as being 'alternate endings' to real-world events. EG, &quot;Germany won WWII, The Mongols conquered Central Europe, The Romans beat back the Barbarians, the Cold War lead to a Nuclear Exchange&quot;, etc. Just some ideas to get people thinking of new courses of history for their conworld.
: The &quot;New Courses of History&quot; was basically stuff that never happened on Earth. EG, &quot;a major climate shift after the development of civilization&quot;, and... okay, I admit it, there's not much difference. *Edits* -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 15:46, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Eurocentrism ==

I think the categories need to be reorganized... no civilization other than the Western one experienced the ages in that order (Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Industrial, Modern). Why would a concivilization also go through these stages?

Right now I'm thinking about some way of rearranging everything altogether, by using much more general categories like &quot;Developments in Warfare&quot;, &quot;Cultural Interactions&quot;, &quot;Migrations&quot;, &quot;Spread of Literacy&quot;, &quot;Inventions&quot; and so forth. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 01:59, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Well, aren't the &quot;Classical&quot;, &quot;Medieval&quot;, and &quot;Renaissance&quot; categories the main offenders? Cause, at least on Earth, every other nation passed through the others to various extents. So should we try to somehow break up these three?
:&lt;strike&gt;Oh, and why does it say &quot;Retrieved from Talk:Conhistory below?&lt;/strike&gt; Not anymore... -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 12:30, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Yeah, breaking up those three would be good. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 13:33, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Beginning to End ==
Don't forget 'confuturism' or 'conholism' or whatever you would call the creation of an entire timeline, from beginning to end.  This does not need to interfere with local free will, or the freedom of a novelist creating a novel set in a particular time, but (in instances where there is a notion of the 'present') is more general than ''History''.

Does anybody know if this is an official list? If so, where does it come from? All the JLPT sources I've ever seen simply say that &quot;about 100&quot; kanji are required for level 4. --[[User:Auximines|Auximines]] 09:53, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Yes, there is an official Test Content Specification that was revised in 2002. Before 2002, Level 4 contained 80 kanji. Since 2002, it contains 103. So this list is currently over 4 years old. The Test Content Specification book contains all the kanji lists. Note that they also state that up to 20% of the kanji used in the test may not be in the list. To be honest, I can't see much point in maintaining yet another version of the list - especially in a Wiki like this. Wikis cannot provide the features and convenience of web pages like http://www.jlptstudy.com and http://www.jlpt-kanji.com... even though jlpt-kanji's lists are also out of date.


== Not ''that'' official, but still very handy ==

None of the 103 kanji are irrelevant. Please ignore any advice to the contrary and study all 103, as they may all appear on the exam.

== JLPT Kanji ==

What about this site: http://www.jlpt-kanji.com/ ?

== hitori ==

I think &quot;alone&quot; is 独り, and that 一人 means &quot;one person&quot;.. Only when you say &quot;一人で&quot;, then it can mean alone. Can someone confirm this..?

[[User:82.81.220.241|82.81.220.241]] 19:32, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

:Hmm... the differences between them is not significant and 一人で is widely used for both meanings these days. Nebertheless, 独りで might imply &quot;by(for?) oneself&quot; or &quot;using his own power, without help by others&quot; (= 独力で), whereas 一人で can mean both(&quot;by oneself&quot; or just &quot;alone&quot;). Also note that hiragana ひとりで is also used sometimes (google, and you'll see). I feel a relatively strong lonliness in the kanji &quot;独&quot; while not in ひとり nor 一人 (they are &quot;plain&quot;). In fact, (as you know perhaps) &quot;loneliness&quot; is translated as 孤独(感)(kodoku(kan)). Or you might prefer 独占 for &quot;monopoly&quot;. HTH. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 11:39, 22 October 2005 (UTC)


==Other sources of kanji==

This site has some excel sheets of kanji [http://www.chuobunkyo.jp/japanese.php] (inc. kanji, kana &amp; meaning in english), and a .utf file at [http://www.thbz.org/kanjimots/jlpt-voc-4.utf]. Are either of these complete?

== onyomi/kunyomi ==

This may be overkill the way this site is designed, but the kanji dictionaries I've seen give onyomi pronunciations in katakana, and kunyomi in hiragana. I don't know how to change the entire table, but it might be nice if someone else could.
-Matt Grimes

That's my experience, but since the readings are in separate columns there is already a way to distinguish between the two. Therefore I do not think it is a problem of great importance. But if somebody has some free time on their hands… --[[W:User:Holizz|Holizz]]

This is not universal.  Unless there is some pressing need, why not focus on other areas of the JLPT pages? --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 07:06, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Needs moving ==

The test has been rescaled, and the old level 4 (that this page name references) has become level N5.  The new name should be something like &quot;JLPT Guide/JLPT N5 Vocabulary&quot;.  Anyone opposed?  --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 06:56, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
: Page was moved, thanks! --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 23:18, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Removing romaji ==

We list the onyomi and kunyomi in kana and romaji, which is redundant.  Kana is the standard way of showing the reading, and the test taker must learn it anyway, so is removing the romaji fine? --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 04:23, 2 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

When we count apples or oranges or elephants, we are using natural numbers.  Natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, and so on without end.  There is no largest natural number, one can always get a larger natural number by adding 1.{{ref|Numbers}}

===Zero===
Zero represents nothingness.  Zero is less than every natural number.  If we have zero apples or oranges or elephants, we simply do not have anything.

===Other Types of Numbers===

== Teaching Numbers ==

This section is for teachers or home-schoolers. It is about teaching the basic concepts and conventions of numbers.

=== Developing a sound concept of number ===
Children typically learn about numbers at a very young age by learning the sequence of words, &quot;one, two, three, four, five&quot; etc. Usually, in chanting this in conjunction with pointing at a set of toys, or mounting a flight of steps for example. Typically, 'mistakes' are made. Toys or steps are missed or counted twice, or a mistake is made in the chanted sequence. Very often, from these sorts of activities, and from informal matching activities, a child's concept of number and counting emerges as their mistakes are corrected. However, here, at the very foundation of numerical concepts, children are often left to 'put it all together' themselves, and some start off on a shaky foundation. Number concepts can be deliberately developed by suitable activities. The first one of these is object matching.

=== Matching Activities ===

As opposed to the typical counting activity children are first exposed to, matching sets of objects gives a firm foundation for the concept of number and numerical relationships. It is very important that matching should be a '''physical''' activity that children can relate to and build on.

Typical activities would be a toy's tea-party. With a set of (say) four toy characters, each toy has a place to sit. Each toy has a cup, maybe a saucer, a plate etc. Without even mentioning 'four', we can talk with the child about 'the right number' of cups, of plates etc. We can talk about 'too many' or 'not enough'. Here, we are talking about number and important number relations without even mentioning which number we are talking about! Only after a lot of activities of this type should we talk about specific numbers and the idea of number in the abstract.

=== Number and Numerals ===
Teachers should print these numbers or show the children these numbers. Ideally, the numbers should be handled by the student. There are a number of ways to achieve this: cut out numerals from heavy cardstock, shape them with clay together, purchase wooden numerals or give them sandpaper numerals to trace. Simultaneously, show the definitions of these numbers as containers or discrete quantities (using boxes and small balls, e.g., 1 ball, 2 balls, etc. Note that 0 means &quot;no balls&quot;). This should take some time to learn thoroughly (depending on the student).

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 48pt; line-height:48px&quot;&gt;0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9&lt;/div&gt;

=== Place Value ===

The Next step is to learn the place value of numbers.

As you are aware, the number after 9 is 10 (called ten).  This number is represented by a new place, the tens, and each time the number in the second place value increases, represents a collection of ten units.  After this comes the hundred place, followed by thousands.  Even though numbers can be much bigger, we will not need to create larger numbers at this time.

To help visualization, you can represent 10 as a batch of 10 coins, and 100 as 10 such batches.  

=== Place Values in other number systems ===

Other number systems are not the same as the one we currently use.  For example, the Maya Culture where there are not the ten symbols above but twenty symbols.{{ref|Maya}}  Even though there are more symbols, the place value system still remains intact. 

A common number system used with computers is the use of binary, which uses the two symbols 0 and 1.

Here is how the system will be created:

{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| Binary
| 0
| 1
| 10
| 11
| 100
| 101
| 110
| 111
| 1000
| ...
|- 
|Decimal
| 0
| 1
| 2
| 3 
| 4 
| 5
| 6
| 7
| 8
| ...
|}

If one uses the symbols A and B, you can get:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| Binary
| A
| B
| BA
| BB
| BAA
| BAB
| BBA
| BBB
| BAAA
| ...
|- 
|Decimal
| 0
| 1
| 2
| 3
| 4
| 5
| 6
| 7
| 8
| ...
|}

Trinary, which uses three digits, is also possible:

{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| Trinary
| 0
| 1
| 2
| 10
| 11
| 12
| 20
| 21
| 22
| 100
| ...
|- 
|Decimal
| 0
| 1
| 2
| 3 
| 4 
| 5
| 6
| 7
| 8
| 9
| ...
|}

These external websites may give you enough information to figure the place value idea of any number system.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jimmy. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jimmy~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Introduction==
'''Economics''' is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences social science] studying the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. It describes them in terms of the tradeoffs between competing alternatives as observed through measurable quantities such as input, price and output.

Economics is said to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/positive_(social_sciences) positive] when it attempts to explain the consequences of different choices given a set of assumptions and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normative normative] when it prescribes a certain route of action.

The University of Edinburgh announces a new Postgraduate Programme in the Evolution of Language and Cognition.
What is it that makes us human?
How did our brains evolve?
What are the origins of human language?
Why do we think the way we do?
What are the mechanisms of biological, cultural and linguistic evolution?
Human evolution is a topic for cognitive scientists, psychologists, linguists, archaeologists, anthropologists, biologists, and computer scientists. Because of this, the postgraduate programme will suit students from a very wide range of backgrounds. If you are interested in learning more about the evolution of human cognition and language, and about the many disciplines that contribute to its study, we'd like to hear from you. 
Recommended reading: [http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/%7Esimon/0-19-924484-7.pdf Language Evolution], edited by Morten Christiansen &amp; Simon Kirby, published by Oxford University Press.
The subject 
What will I study? The programme covers a wide range of topics. Broadly speaking, you will look at how human cognition evolved in our species, with a particular emphasis on how language evolved.
How do you study the evolution of cognition? We draw on our understanding of how human and animal brains work, knowledge about human and animal behaviour, evidence from genetics and child development, as well as data from the archaeological record (from fossil remains through to evidence of material culture). In addition, some people use computational models to test theories about how cognitive systems evolve.
What counts as language evolution? Modern research in language evolution looks not only at how our species evolved to be able to use language, but also at how languages themselves evolve over time.
How is it different from historical linguistics? This is a tricky question! There is actually no hard-and-fast boundary between the study of language evolution, and the study of language change/historical linguistics. Both subjects focus on the dynamic aspects of language. Historical linguistics, however, typically concerns itself with specific changes in a language or languages, and at a shallower time depth.

LI0058 Origins and Evolution of Language 

Linguistics Honours Option,
Prof. James R Hurford 


Prerequisites
There are no Honours prerequisites for this course. All 3rd and 4th year Honours students may take this course. 
Aims and objectives
The course will show how understanding of all the main subdisciplines of Linguistics can be enhanced by viewing them from an evolutionary perspective. Thus, in cases where other approaches to language do little more than describe the linguistic facts, or at best explain them by stipulated abstract principles, Evolutionary Linguistics can often provide more satisfactory explanations by showing a route by which the facts could have arisen. In short, where much linguistics says `This is how language is', evolutionary linguistics attempts to say 'This is how language got to be that way'. The course will apply this approach to all levels of linguistic analysis, thus outlining areas aptly labelled as Evolutionary Pragmatics, Evolutionary Phonetics, Evolutionary Semantics, Evolutionary Phonology, and Evolutionary Syntax. 
In addition, the course aims to give Linguistics students a survey of the main issues in the evolution and origins of the human language faculty and of actual human languages. The subject matter is inevitably somewhat speculative, but the course will set out a basis of relevant facts accumulated from a range of disciplines within and outwith Linguistics, including animal behaviour, evolutionary theory, computer modelling, genetics, language acquisition, paleontology, archaeology Where facts are scarce, methodological questions about how best to proceed will be examined. After the course, students should be able to speak and write informedly and responsibly about the origins of language, know how to keep track of fresh developments in the field, and be able to put such developments in perspective.

Language acquisition and evolution 


Special Issue: Adaptive Behavior 



Call for Papers
(pdf-format) 



Guest Editor: Paul Vogt 



Submission deadline: 15 November 2004 


It is widely believed that language has evolved through mutual interactive behaviour of individuals within an ecological niche, through individual adaptations and self-organisation. Humans communicate with each other about events that happen in their environment. When novel events occur, they might construct new internal representations of these events - either by learning from other's behaviour or by inventing new behaviour. They can then transmit this newly constructed knowledge to other humans. By subsequent local interactions between individuals, self-organisation can guide the emergence of a global structure called language as has repeatedly been shown by several computer models. 




Many computational studies on the evolution of language have primarily focused on the idea that language is a complex dynamical adaptive system, as outlined above. Central to these studies is the cultural evolution of language, i.e. language is thought to have evolved based on cultural transmissions rather than on biological adaptations. Cultural transmission of language is impossible without the ability to learn language. This special issue is inspired by a recent Symposium on Language Evolution and Acquisition held at the 2004 Human Behavior &amp; Evolution Society conference, and focuses on the relation between language origins, acquisition and evolution. Two main themes to be explored are how could language acquisition mechanisms have evolved, and the impact that particular acquisition skills may have had on the evolution of language itself. 



Adaptive Behavior solicits papers that present synthetic studies that explicitly focuses on the interface between language origins and/or evolution, and language acquisition. The models should involve either computer simulations or robotic platforms. However, those papers that integrate models with psychological, linguistic or biological data are particularly welcome. Papers in this special issue should not exceed the equivalent length of 14 journal pages. See the web-site of the Adaptive Behavior (http://www.isab.org.uk/journal/) for further instructions. 




Topics include (though not restricted): 

Evolution of 
language acquisition skills. 
joint attention. 
corrective feedback.

The Emergence of Language: 
Neural and Adaptive Agent Models

 

 

Guest Editor: Angelo Cangelosi

  

 
 

Connection Science is calling papers for a special issue entitled ‘The Emergence of Language: Neural and Adaptive Agent Models’. 

 

Studies of the emergence of language focus on the evolutionary and/or developmental factors that affect the acquisition and auto-organisation of a linguistic communication system. Both language-specific abilities (e.g. speech, semantics, syntax) and other cognitive, sensorimotor and social abilities (e.g. category learning, action and embodiment, social networks) contribute to the emergence of language.

 

Key research issues and topics in the area include: 

§         Emergentism as an alternative to the nativism/empiricism dichotomy

§         Identification of basic processes producing language complexity

§         Grammaticalization and emergence of syntax

§         Emergent models of language acquisition

§         Evolution and origins of language

§         Pidgin, creole and second language acquisition

§         Neural bases of emergent language processes 

§         Auto-organization of shared lexicons in groups of individuals/agents

§         Grounding of symbols and language in perception and action

 

The main aims of this special issue are to foster interdisciplinary and multi-methodological approaches to modelling the emergence of language, and to identify key research directions for the future. Models based on neural networks (connectionism, computational neuroscience) and adaptive agent methodologies (artificial life, multi-agent systems, robotics), or integrated neural/agent approaches, are particularly encouraged.

The submitted papers are expected to: (i) focus on one or more related research issues (see list above), (ii) explain the importance of the topic, the open problems and the different approaches discussed in the literature, (iii) discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the neural and adaptive agent approaches with respect to other methodologies (including experimental research) and (iv) present original models and/or significant new results. Review papers may also be considered.

 

Invited Papers
 

The special issue will include two invited papers, one from Brian MacWhinney (Carnegie Mellon University) and one from Luc Steels (VUB University Brussels and SONY Computer Labs Paris). The invited papers are:

§         Brian MacWhinney, ‘Emergent Linguistic Structures and the Problem of Time’ (focus on neural network modeling)

§         Luc Steels, ‘Mirror Learning and the Self-Organisation of Languages’ (focus on adaptive agent modeling)

 

Submission Instructions and Deadline
 

Manuscripts, either full papers or shorter research notes (up to 4000 words), following the Connection Science guidelines (http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/authors/ccosauth.asp) should be emailed to the guest editor (acangelosi@plymouth.ac.uk) by December 1, 2004. Reviews will be completed by March 1, 2005, and final drafts will be accepted no later than May 1, 2005. The special issue will be published in September 2005.

BIOTHERMODYNAMICS OF AN INTRANET-LIKE COMPARTMENTAL BRAIN MODEL

We argue about a prototype, the brain, having as a brain model an Intranet-like multicompartmental structure. A private INTRAnet is analogous to the public INTERnet, but has linked compartments functioning within closed spatial limits, say a school. We do not explain here either the selected electronic devices such as routers, hubs and file servers, or the software used. In a school intranet, they connect compartments such as a Library Computer Laboratory (LCL) and classrooms, now blackboxes with various expertises. Now the school intranet is a simple model of a human brain engaged in higher intellectual tasks, such as theorem creation and demonstration. 

As an information processor, the brain integrates subsystems: protominds (1), that is, compartments of brain machinery, brain operating systems (2), memories and transducers, and allows for the emergence of single aimed parallel tasks.

1) BRAIN STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

The basics of the adopted structure refer to Minsky´s (1) A- and B-brains- and to Block- Schacter´s (3,4) A- and P-consciousness.

MINSKY´S A- AND B-BRAINS: -

1. The &quot;mindless&quot; A-brain (left Hub(5)) depends on the presence of an external perceptual world, perceives it, has external alarm- detectors and internal Neuroethological Decision Cycles, NDC(1,6,7,8), but cannot self detect its own presence. It has consciousness but is not conscious of being conscious.
- 
2. The B-brain (right Hub(5)) is the &quot;mind&quot;. Its duty is centered on the A-brain endeavours, and manages its information traffic, excluding the external world. By definition, the inner mental world is B-brain's task. Human beings show not full, but partial conscioussnes of having consciousness, because the parallel workings of the protominds are tractable only in part by B. The links are: 
inner world &lt;--&gt; B-brain &lt;--&gt; A-brain &lt;--&gt; outer world.

BLOCK-SCHACTER'S(3,4) A- AND P-CONSCIOUSNESS: - 

1. A-(Access) Consciousness has many attributes but here it is mostly our brain Operating System with a basic Access- task. It works through Alarm Operators, which nest Gratifying Operators. They trigger with external and internal alarming conditions. The alarm function is fundamental to start and maintain the NDC.
- 
2. P-(Phenomenal) Consciousness constructs mental images or mental similitudes out of subsymbolic information coming from the perceptions. It has to do with inner experiences, like the one a little girl has as she climbs to a big swing and begins to propel herself, understanding their parents loud approval. Or when touching an open flame with the finger. P-consciousness emerges mostly as the access of a large number of body-controls, managing the alarm set-points of an overall alarm-proved homeostatic state (9). 

We have mentioned left and right hubs, according to Weinstein's graphic of a File Server Model for a school-wide Intranet (5).

The listed electronic subsystems are:
1). An &quot;Internet Service Provider&quot;: it means here the perceptual world (10). 

2). A &quot;Router&quot;: here one is reminded of the main site for the Alarm Operators, aware for filtered objects, facts and properties, that is, exhibiting o-,f-, and p-awareness (11), sensible as well to different brain moods or electroencephalic (EEG) waves. So there are many inner protocols, not just one as in standard Intranets. The traffic allows for inputs with sensory transductors and outputs with neuron-muscle complementation. The router satisfies a part of the Intranet's Operating System, and the filters for the Alarm Operators are here considered as belonging to our A-conscious brain Operating System.

3). A first &quot;Hub&quot; with a default connection to the router, managing the links among the active classrooms: the rooms are the A-brain protominds involved in NDC (7,8,12). One set of compartments, associated with every one of the aspects of a &quot;higher&quot; problem NDC (theorem creation and demonstration) presented by the &quot;alarm&quot; operators, could be:
3.1) a first large room (or three smaller ones) with &quot;preparation&quot; experts (7), with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) abilities, referring to old experiences with already-prepared answers to problems, including in the same room particular expertises such as
3.1.1) negative-mood experiences helping to avoid future disasters, inhibitory components of &quot;preparation&quot; or case-based reasoning (CBR-) functions;
3.1.2) positive-mood case-based memories assisting in the construction of a positive solution to the problem, excitatory components (CBR+); and
3.1.3) an overall abstract version without emotional influence, that is, strictly rational and logic (CBRo); a cold and emotion-lacking access and processing to all kinds of cases related to the new problem;
3.2) a second room (protomind) dedicated to deliberative, combinatorial and creative abilities (7), &quot;deliberation&quot; or memory-free combinatory cognition functions, where memory is not needed; and
3.3) a third room for emotional intelligence expertise (13), used in NDC.

4). A second &quot;Hub&quot;: here one may recognize the B-brain component, both A- and P-conscious. It nests the remaining part of the A-conscious B-brain Operating System. It has a default connection to the first Hub and four links
4.1) To a &quot;File Server&quot; connecting related files: in the brain it is the seat for B-brain abilities and includes
4.1.1) the core of the Access-Consciousness brain Operating System, whose tasks are to provide accesses between the Classrooms and the File Server, so as to help with the LCL tasks.
4.1.2) the long-term memories and access to the LCL coded registry.
4.2) To a first division of the LCL: it nests B-brain's P-consciousness. The LCL concentrates -loosely speaking- all the &quot;homeostatic-sensor controls&quot; (9) of the active rooms feelings. From this concentration the LCL should be in the condition to transduce the conscious feelings and experiences which - so to say - fill the net with an overall experience of alertness and progressive task-accomplishment or failure.
4.3) To a second division of same: it nests B-brain-Preconscious (14), the waiting room previous to P-consciousness, for half-way feelings and experiences.
4.4) To the last division: it saves the Unconscious (14), where B-brain control functions only scratch the surface of hidden parallel NDC.

2) BRAIN FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS

The thermodynamics of this blackbox compartmental school-Intranet circuit is based on Kirchhoff electronic equilibria applied to linked nodes. This differs considerably from natural brain biothermodynamic non-linear non-equilibrium phase transition processes. 

Generation after generation, most brain self-organised evolution may be thermodynamically downhill in a scale not entirely microscopical, in a group of protominds scale. (Entropy is growing with fewer degrees of freedom in such a complex system)(15). In the evolved brain, the main darwinian selector is the potentiality of the species to minimize the high priority energy demands (von Baer-Mayr(15) law) maintaining accessed and linked mental capabilities. The evolving arrow seems to aim towards such complex compartmental (16) evolutionary phase transitions - from less linked to more linked - so as to increase its functional and task ranges, with relatively low energy requisites.

When solving problems, the transductions between subsymbolic, symbolic and again subsymbolic signals, demand energy (7) and need at least one scaffold (9) to move uphill.

Applying Hopfield's equations (17), the protominds operating system involved in solving the problem on hand, after the mentioned initial uphill transition, could account for a final energetic decay, with a decrease of large number of initial degrees of freedom.

Neurons are slow and the alarm signals are much faster. This fact (1) appears to be persistently selecting (14). Natural selection gives priority to economic solutions: brain selects bypasses with more velocity but less precision (13). 

A generalized Le Chatelier principle, extended to non-linear situations, replacing equilibria by phase transitions, appears as a theoretical reductionist help with multiple applications (17). 

Now we mention a jazz-band model for the tentative and temporary leadership of one of the multiple protominds, during the NDC, as well as a brain biothermodynamical model of the voting process of said protominds (17).

Within a given NDC one finds various energetic levels involved (7,17). 

All these generally simple facts, when explained one after the other, produce notwithstanding a chaotic EEG. From this chaos the authors see the emergence of a reductionist law, whose first draft may be stated as follows: 

Biothermodynamics, ruled by the von Baer-Mayr reduction, gives a quite simple vision of the workings of mind as a control tool and alarm-situations manager. The emotional intelligence makes clear where the NDC set-points are, because the magnitude of actual feelings measures the unbalance between the set-points and the controlled behaviors under adjustment by the NDC. P-consciousness is the result of all the controls trying to yield homeostasis, surveying the presence of alarms, as a kind of virtual supercontrol (17).  

The model may enlighten some up-to-date topics, like what happens with the superposition of strong attention and alpha-EEG-wave moods.

KEN WILBER
Messenger of the Kosmos

by A. V. Ashok

Ken Wilber has raised a body of work (The Spectrum of Consciousness/1977, The Atman Project/1980, Up From Eden/1981, Eye to Eye/1983, A Sociable God/1983, Transformations of Consciousness/1986, Grace and Grit/1991, Sex, Ecology, Spirituality/1995, A Brief History of Everything/1996, The Eye of Spirit/1997, The Marriage of Sense and Soul/1998, One Taste/1999, Integral Psychology/2000 and A Theory of Everything/2000) that is a monumental discourse on consciousness and evolution and a dizzy feat of theory and vision. Down the decades of the twentieth-century, the wisdom of the East has had a hypnotic appeal for several Western minds—like Heinrich Zimmer, Giuseppe Tucci, Alexandra David-Neel, Rene Guenon, Aldous Huxley, Erich Fromm, Arthur Osborne, Lama Anagarika Govinda, Alan Watts, Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell, Fr.Bede Griffiths and Ram Dass. Today, Ken Wilber is the brightest name in the East-West encounter. In a vivacious synthesis of Western thought and Eastern spiritual traditions and a towering meditation on the origin, nature and destiny of consciousness, Wilber has unravelled our ageless enigma: &quot;Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?&quot; With illuminating wisdom and a glamorous multidisciplinary voice, Wilber has written the biography of consciousness in terms of phylogeny from the Lower Palaeolithic proto-human prehistory of the Australopithecines (6 million years ago) to contemporary postmodernity and of ontogeny from the magical child to the mystical sage. 

Wilber's conceptualization of phylogenetic &quot;worldviews&quot; uses Jean Gebser's terminology for the &quot;four major epochs of human evolution&quot;—&quot;the archaic&quot; (6 million to 200,000 years ago), &quot;the magic&quot;(200,000 years ago to 10,000 B.C.), &quot;the mythical&quot;(10,000 B.C. to 1,500 B.C.) and &quot;the mental&quot;(from 1,500 B.C.)—and integrates the insights of Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Sri Aurobindo, Teilhard de Chardin, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Erich Neumann, L.L.Whyte, Ernest Becker, Joseph Campbell and Jurgen Habermas. Wilber's narrative of phylogenetic &quot;cultural evolution&quot;(the interiority of the species) begins with the &quot;archaic&quot; which is a pre-temporal condition of &quot;slumber in subconsciousness&quot; or &quot;uroboric&quot; &quot;immersion&quot;/ &quot;embeddedness&quot; in nature in a &quot;material&quot; adualism of absence of distinction between inside and outside, subject and object, self and environment that Wilber calls &quot;Eden.&quot; In the &quot;magical&quot; period (of the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon man), the body registered a faint differentiation from nature but a fully differentiated mental self was lacking. The magical &quot;bodyself' or &quot;protomind&quot; though not utterly embedded in nature still carried &quot;adherences&quot; to nature and was &quot;magically intermingled&quot; with nature and restricted to &quot;magic imagery&quot; in a &quot;parataxic mode&quot;(contiguity without connections) and to &quot;primary process&quot; or &quot;magical cognition&quot; in which &quot;objects are perceived as identical if they share outstanding predicates or parts&quot; (&quot;displacement&quot;) and in which &quot;the whole and the part&quot; are confused whereby a member of a class of objects cannot be distinguished from the class itself (&quot;condensation&quot;). &quot;Magical&quot; consciousness experienced a proto-temporal sense of a simple present without a tomorrow and was also marked by a self–absorbed omnipotence without an integrative awareness of the &quot;other&quot; that bred perpetual &quot;tribal&quot; conflicts among the magical hunters and gatherers. Language emerged in the late Pleistocene around 50,000 B.C. and in the initial millennia of its evolution it merely generated &quot;palaeologic thinking&quot; or &quot;mythical cognition&quot;—a linguistic mentality &quot;contaminated&quot; by &quot;magical&quot; adherences. In a &quot;prodigious mutation,&quot; consciousness became &quot;tensed&quot; with an &quot;extended time&quot; beyond the magical simple present when language peaked around 12,000 B.C. which triggered the awesome discovery of agriculture around 10,000 B.C. that entails &quot;making present preparation for a future harvest.&quot; Language enabled consciousness for the first time to traffic in &quot;non-present&quot; entities like the future and the past and in non-sensory/-empirical/-physical symbols that are exclusively mental. This new verbal mind of farming consciousness was an extensive &quot;symbolate&quot; domain of non-empirical mental representations with a &quot;membership&quot; basis. Language made &quot;mythic-membership&quot; consciousness what gave it its name. A shared symbolic community or &quot;polis&quot; made possible by &quot;intersubjective communication (via language)&quot; became the distinctive &quot;arena&quot; of mythic-membership consciousness and &quot;praxis&quot; or social/cultural practice became the distinctive human mode of action. In a &quot;superorganic leap,&quot; polis-praxis shifted consciousness from nature and instincts to culture, history, justice, ethics and morality as its definitive realm of identity. Mythic consciousness also acquired an awareness of &quot;miraculous power in a great Other&quot;(gods and goddesses) beyond the narrow magical/tribal sense of blood-bound kinship that unified the earlier warring egocentric tribes into larger ethnocentric Neolithic villagers. The high period of mythic consciousness was the age of the classical mythologies and civilizations: Egyptian, Babylonian, Sumerian, Aztec-Mayan, Indus Valley and Mycenaean. Coming &quot;up from Eden&quot; through countless millennia, consciousness conclusively broke free from its embeddedness in nature and crystallized out of the body in the middle of the second millennium B.C. and &quot;awakened&quot; as an autonomous and self-reflexive ego. The &quot;Hero Myth&quot; at the start of this epoch is symbolic of the emergence of the ego. In these myths of a Hero slaying a serpent- monster invariably to rescue a treasure, the serpent–monster is uroboros and the treasure it guards is &quot;the ego immersed and encoiled in unconsciousness.&quot; It is with egoic consciousness that the first scream of anguish over mortality and death is heard and the human condition for the first time began to be experienced as &quot;an insufferable state of sin, exile, or delusion.&quot; Egoic consciousness allied with &quot;thought&quot; whose &quot;permanence&quot; neutralized the ephemerality of nature and the body. But in a runaway differentiation, egoic consciousness lapsed into the &quot;dissociation&quot; of an arrogant independence and failed to integrate nature and the body as lower levels in a new compound consciousness. The emergence of the &quot;permanent&quot; ego was accompanied by a deformation of the body. The prana/ elan vital/ libido of the &quot;whole-body&quot; carried a massive sense of mutability and the ego &quot;shrank in terror from the body &quot; and &quot;devitalized&quot; the &quot;whole-body&quot; and &quot;sequestered&quot; it to genital sexuality. Thus arose the disembodied ego and the repressed body of modern times—both &quot;distorted and deformed.&quot; Egoic consciousness not only had a &quot;new body &quot;but also a &quot;new time.&quot; Mythic time though &quot;extended&quot; was seasonal—after an innings, everything had to start all over again in a cyclic scheme. But now egoic time became &quot;linear&quot;—an indefinitely extending &quot;stretch.&quot; However, as the ego was indistinguishable from overweening repressive power, the new limitlessness of linear time became a medium for the overflowing hubris of the ego. But, egoic consciousness had a universalizing solidarity far wider than the ethnocentric fellowship of mythic consciousness and it finally consolidated as &quot;rationality&quot; which is an emancipatory &quot;worldcentric&quot; space of perspectives, possibilities and principles that are valid &quot;not just for me or my tribe or my mythological culture&quot; but for all on a universal scale. With the rise of rationality, mythic believers were replaced by democratic individuals supported and dignified by universal human rights and several new forms of freedom in nation-states based on separation of Church (mythology) and State (reason). In &quot;vision-logic&quot; that supercedes rationality, nation-states unify in transnational post-rational/ &quot;centauric&quot; integration. But today's post-rational international institutions and tools like borderless instantaneous satellite television and the Internet though centauric signifiers carry less than centauric signifieds. It is an error to assume that &quot;the internet is global, so the consciousness using it must be global.&quot; The internet is a post-worldcentric technology but &quot;what goes through the Net&quot; is mostly egocentric and ethnocentric consciousness. The development of technology has outpaced growth of consciousness and this discrepancy often breeds catastrophe. Wilber asks: &quot;What good is it if the Nazis have the net?&quot; Earlier, Auschwitz was &quot; the advanced technologies of rationality hijacked by tribalism,…by an ethnocentric mythology of blood and soil and race,… barbaric in its ethnic cleansing.&quot; Similarly, &quot;the terror of tomorrow &quot; makes Wilber ask: &quot;Do we really want to colonize space with [ethnocentric] Nazis and the KKK? Do we really want Jack the Ripper living 400 years, zipping around the country in his hypercar, unleashing misogynistic nanorobots?&quot; Apparently in a post-rational early vision-logic informational epoch, the world today is truly &quot;struggling&quot; to safeguard its egoic-rationality: nation–states are detribalizing with &quot;blood cleansing&quot; and are threatened by mythic-rational imperialisms like capitalist globalization and religious fundamentalism. 

Wilber's account of ontogenetic development employs as a grid Jean Piaget's classification-- &quot;sensorimotor&quot;(0 to 2 years), &quot;preoperational&quot;(2 to 7 years), &quot;concreate operational&quot;(7 to 11 years) and &quot;formal operational&quot;(11 years and beyond) and uses the formulations of Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Shankara, Freud, Otto Rank, Sandor Ferenczi, Harry Stack Sullivan, Silvano Arieti, and a new generation of American researchers in developmental psychology like Lawrence Kohlberg, Jane Loevinger, Margaret Mahler, John Broughton, Howard Gardner, Robert Kegan, Deirdre Kramer, Susanne Cook-Grueter and Cheryl Armon. Wilber views ontogenetic development as marked by &quot;decreasing egocentrism.&quot; A deconstruction of infancy is a prominent note in Wilber's thought. For Wilber, infancy is &quot;the shallowest consciousness,&quot; a &quot;primary matrix&quot; of &quot;adualistic&quot; confusion and of &quot;massive&quot; narcissism and not an &quot;unconscious Heaven &quot; that merits adult nostalgia or that deserves to be regained as a paradise lost. The preop child is self-centred in a form of egocentrism that Wilber calls &quot;egocentric magic&quot; and defines as &quot;an early inability to transcend one's own perspective and understand that reality is not self-centred.&quot; In the conop stage, the magical egocentric mind turns perspectival and begins &quot; to enter the world of other minds&quot; and learns the rules and roles of its culture and becomes sociocentric, ethnocentric and conventional with a &quot;rule/role&quot; identity. Egocentrism decreases further when the sociocentric self becomes &quot;worldcentric&quot;/postconventional in the formop stage where &quot;one can take the perspective, not just of others in one's group, but of others in other groups.&quot; The worldcentric/ rational self can incur &quot;identity crisis&quot;: what am I beyond social scripts and universal human rights? Pointing out the insufficiency of egoic-rational consciousness, Wilber wonders: &quot;Has nature laboured these billions of years just to bring forth this egoic mouse?&quot; Beyond the &quot;normal&quot; rational citizen is the &quot;centauric&quot; angst-ridden existentialist in &quot;transconsensus, transmembership, transsocial&quot; authenticity. The &quot;centauric&quot; self or the &quot;total bodymind&quot; experiences itself not as a magical/egocentric cosmos or a mythic/ cultural role or a socially adapted rational ego but as a wider/higher unity of existential &quot;being-in-the-world.&quot; Out of its acute vulnerability to the dread of finitude, fragility and nothingness that annuls the inauthenticity of social scripts and rational &quot;bad faith&quot;, &quot;centauric&quot;/existential consciousness suffers a desolation of homelessness that only transpersonal homecoming can dispel. Beyond the existential centaur in successive stages of &quot;transpersonal&quot;/ &quot;transmental&quot; evolution of the &quot;Inward Arc&quot; are the &quot;the psychic&quot; with paranormal siddhis, &quot;the subtle&quot; devotional / bhakti saint of the Sambhogakaya /sukshma sarira and &quot;the causal&quot;/ &quot;the nondual&quot; sage of the Dharmakhaya/ karana sarira/ nirvikalpa samadhi and the Svabhavikakaya/ sahaja samadhi. The ishtadeva of the devotional saints &quot;is God as an archetypal summit of one's own consciousness…that Deity which, from the beginning has been one's own Self.&quot; The devotional rapture of the saints is a glorious ascension in which &quot;consciousness reverts to, or remembers, its own prior and higher identity.&quot; In the causal/ nondual gnosis of the sage, consciousness is &quot;undone&quot; and it &quot;disappears, dissolving back into radiant Emptiness&quot; to become the Freedom of the &quot;unbounded and unlimited, unborn and undying, unseen and unknown&quot; or the &quot;Seer&quot; or the &quot;Witness of all that arises&quot; and &quot;not anything that can be seen.&quot; The message of the mystics is that &quot;the eye with which you see God is the same eye with which God sees you&quot; and that in nondual &quot;One Taste&quot; &quot;you will be everything that you see.&quot; Moksha or the &quot;coming home&quot; of consciousness is ineffable: &quot;When we are in the eye of Spirit, the I of Spirit, what do we finally see?&quot; 

From the Big Bang (15 billion years ago) &quot;which was really the roaring laughter of God voluntarily getting lost for the millionth time&quot; through prepersonal &quot;Eden&quot; and personal Ego to transpersonal/nondual Enlightenment, evolution is for Wilber a lila of the &quot;unfolding&quot; of &quot;Spirit&quot; through &quot;increasingly more conscious forms of Spirit's own self actualization and return to itself.&quot; Evolution is &quot;Spirit-in-action&quot; or &quot;God in the making.&quot; In the beginning, Spirit in sport &quot;forgets itself and empties itself into creation.&quot; In line with Schelling, creation for Wilber is a &quot;falling-away&quot; or &quot;maximum self-alienation&quot; of Spirit, and nature is &quot;slumbering Spirit,&quot; mind is &quot;self conscious Spirit&quot; and nondual enlightenment is &quot;realized Spirit.&quot; Thus the &quot;direction&quot; of evolution is &quot;from nature to humanity to divinity; from subconsciousness to self-consciousness to superconsciousness; from prepersonal to personal to transpersonal; from id to ego to god.&quot; Wilber poetically demarcates his tripartite evolutionary scheme in an axiom: &quot;Nature is unconscious imperfection, God is conscious perfection but poor humanity is conscious imperfection.&quot; As humans are &quot;up from beasts and not yet gods&quot; there has never been &quot; a Golden Age of real Heaven on earth&quot; or a &quot;superconscious Eden&quot; in our &quot;actual historic past.&quot; For Wilber, the ego is not &quot;a fall from a heavenly or spiritual estate&quot; and history is not &quot;devolution&quot; or a progressive alienation from Spirit or God with each epoch &quot;darker and more sinister and less spiritual.&quot; On the contrary, &quot;with the rise of the ego, Spirit is halfway back home&quot; from the prepersonal slumber of Eden and we are invited to &quot;awaken&quot; in transpersonal nonduality as &quot;the eye of Spirit, the I of Spirit&quot; when Spirit &quot;recovers itself absolutely&quot; after its &quot;great search&quot; through the &quot;manifestations&quot; of evolution &quot;to know itself.&quot; &quot;We may all take heart,&quot; affirms Wilber, &quot;for it now appears certain that you and I came up from Eden so that we may all return to Heaven.&quot; The telos of evolution is &quot;the Nondual Heart of One Taste&quot; where &quot;the entire game is undone.&quot; For Wilber, the nondual consciousness of a sage like Sri Ramana Maharshi is the homecoming of evolution. Each epoch in evolution has a collectively actualized &quot;average mode of consciousness&quot; and also an &quot;advanced mode of consciousness&quot; accessed by an evolutionary elite. The shamans, saints and sages who have &quot;penetrated&quot; to the psychic, subtle and causal levels of consciousness respectively are &quot;advanced&quot; realizers of the magical, mythic and the mental-egoic epochs of evolution respectively. Collectively, evolution now is just beginning to meagerly unfold into the post-egoic vision-logic stage beyond which lie the psychic, the subtle and the causal stages. Therefore, the shamans, saints and sages of the past &quot;were ahead of their time, and they are still ahead of ours&quot; and as &quot;voices, not of our past, but of our future…whisper to us from the radiant depths of a greater tomorrow.&quot; 

Wilber also depicts evolution as a saga of &quot;the Atman project &quot; that he defines thus: 

…every individual constantly intuits that his prior Nature is infinite and eternal, All and Whole—he is possessed , that is, with a true Atman intuition. But, at the same time, he is terrified of real transcendence, because transcendence entails the &quot;death&quot; of his isolated and separate-self sense…Because men and women…will not accept the necessary death of the separate self sense, they go about seeking transcendence in ways that actually prevent it and force symbolic substitutes…this I call the Atman project. 

At one level, Up from Eden is an interpretation of time as the Atman project. Wilber points out that 

As long as one holds on to the separate-self sense, one must repress death and its terror. In order to transcend the death terror, one must transcend the self. That is, there is nothing that the self can do to actually get rid of death terror, since the separate self is that death terror—they come into existence together and they only disappear together. The only thing the separate self can do with death is, deny it, repress it, dilute it, or otherwise hide it. 

The &quot;denial of death&quot; seeks &quot;continuing and continuing and continuing&quot; in time which is a perversion of one's &quot;timeless&quot; Nature that is &quot;not an everlasting life in time&quot; but a realization that one's real self is not of time but is &quot;prior to time&quot;: 

…when man denies death , he refuses to live without a future, and therefore he refuses to live timelessly. In denying death he denies the condition of no future, and thus he denies eternity. In short, to deny death is to demand a future—in order to avoid death, man pictures his separate self going forward in time. He wants to meet himself tomorrow. 

For Wilber, time is &quot;a substitute for eternity&quot; and is a medium of self-persistence which is the antithesis of self-sacrifice in transcendence. Time is a sign of one's separate self, fear of death, death denial and loss of Atman in the Atman project. Successive structures of consciousness and stages in evolution are &quot;new attempts to gain Spirit in substitutes&quot; and each structure and stage has its own specific &quot;forms of the Atman project&quot; or &quot;immortality symbols&quot; that are substitutes for &quot;true and eternal life in timeless Spirit.&quot; For the magical/ tribal hunter, the Atman project took the form of surrender of his finger joints in return for the &quot;moment-to-moment self-perpetuation of the hunt.&quot; In the mythic period, agriculture was a &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;heightened death seizure&quot; that inevitably accompanied the new &quot;extended time&quot; opened by language. Wilber reads agriculture as a form of the Atman project to &quot;buy time&quot; as it safeguarded this newly emerged future from the touch of death and preserved it as a promise of life in time in the form of a reward for present work. Wilber locates the origin of &quot;sacrifice&quot; in the Atman project of mythic consciousness. In the infancy of its differentiating separateness, mythic consciousness was hounded by fearful memories of its earlier predifferentiated/indissociated uroboric/archaic immersion as a &quot;Great Mother.&quot; Mythic consciousness sought through sacrifice to expiate its guilt on becoming a separate self and to appease the uroboric Great Mother to &quot;prevent her wrathful Vengeance&quot; on the separate self for differentiating from her in individuating emergence. Through ritualized sacrifice, the &quot;struggling&quot; mythic self attempted to resist the Great Mother's &quot;pull&quot; of &quot;inertia&quot; to revert to uroboric subconsciousness and instead persist in the individuated separateness of mythic consciousness. Wilber distinguishes the biological/ subconscious Great Mother who dominated mythic consciousness through sacrifice from the transcendent/superconscious Great Goddess discovered by a few &quot;heroes&quot; of the mythic period. An &quot;esoteric few&quot; of mythic culture accessed a beginning &quot;Subtle&quot;/ Sambhogakaya awareness of transcendent Oneness underlying the manifold universe incarnated as an Archetypal Deity in the form of a Goddess. Membership sacrifice to the Great Mother involved horrible rites of &quot;brutal victim-sacrifice&quot;—of &quot;literal body death or blood murder&quot;—which were a travesty of &quot;true self-sacrifice&quot;—the sacrifice of the separate self to the Great Goddess that conferred the transcendent realization of &quot;one's timeless and selfless Essence&quot; and &quot;which occurs in the heart, and never involved literal body murder.&quot; The &quot;ritual of blood sacrifice&quot;to the Great Mother was the exoteric/ substitutive &quot;horror&quot; of the Atman project of the masses of the average mode of mythic consciousness while the bloodless &quot;true self-sacrifice&quot; in Sambhogakaya bliss of Subtle Oneness through the Great Goddess was the esoteric/ transformative transcendence of the &quot;advanced souls&quot; of the mythic period. Wilber also locates the origin of &quot;murder&quot; as a &quot;substitute sacrifice&quot; of the Atman Project or as a travesty of transcendence in mythic times. Mythic consciousness &quot;extroverted&quot; its &quot;excessive death terror&quot; and became &quot;death dealing&quot; and made others its &quot;victims.&quot; Wilber exposes the cruel perversion of &quot;true sacrifice&quot; in murder: it is &quot;a new way to magically avoid death by offering up another being's life as a substitute sacrifice.&quot; In the egoic epoch, &quot;thought&quot; which conjured a &quot;crystal unchanging world of concepts&quot; became an agent of the Atman project: &quot;Thought promises eternity by delivering its substitute: permanence.&quot; The existential centaur is the first structure of consciousness not to be implicated in the Atman project as &quot; it is the first self-sense strong enough to openly face and confront death.&quot; 

Of the three thresholds of evolution—prepersonal, personal and transpersonal—the prepersonal and transpersonal are often erroneously &quot;confused and equated&quot; since &quot;both are, in their own ways, nonpersonal&quot;—either the transpersonal is &quot;reduced&quot; to the prepersonal or the prepersonal is &quot;elevated&quot; to the transpersonal. For example, Science, Darwinism and Freud envisage development as rising from prepersonal nature to the &quot;high point&quot; of the rational ego but with nothing beyond and reduce transpersonal experiences to infantile occasions. Religion, Romanticism and Jung envisage humanity as declining from a spiritual paradise to the &quot;low point&quot; of the ego and elevate the prepersonal &quot;subconscious immersion&quot; of phylogenetic and ontogenetic infancy to superconscious glory. &quot;The Pre/Trans Fallacy&quot; is a major protocol in Wilber's thought. 

Drawing on Plotinus, Wilber conceptualizes evolution as &quot;the Great Nest of Being.&quot; Evolution is a &quot;nested holarchy&quot; of matter, body, mind, soul and spirit in &quot;increasing inclusiveness&quot; or &quot;increasing embrace&quot; whereby every higher level is a &quot;nest&quot; that &quot;transcends and includes its predecessor.&quot; One of Wilber's key concepts is Hegel's &quot;aufhebung&quot;: &quot;To supercede is at once to negate and to preserve.&quot; Each level in evolution preserves its predecessor but negates its &quot;partiality&quot;—body includes matter and is more than matter. But at a &quot;fulcrum&quot; or &quot;switch&quot; from one level of evolution/consciousness to the next, transcendence or &quot;differentiation&quot; can go &quot;out of control&quot; and degenerate into &quot;dissociation&quot; whereby the higher level fails to &quot;include&quot; and instead begins to &quot;repress&quot; the lower level as in the case of the repression of the body (or nature or instinct) by the mind (or reason). Wilber endorses Kant's glorious stress on the necessity for the mind &quot;to rise above nature&quot; into &quot;a rational morality and ethical will not found in nature&quot; and function out of a freedom from lower &quot;biocentric impulses,&quot; &quot;egocentric wishes,&quot; and ethnocentric affiliations. But Wilber also indicates that mind/reason/ ego has not evolved into differentiated embrace (of nature/body) but lapsed into dissociated repression. Often the misguided &quot;cure&quot; for repression is &quot;regression.&quot; Several healers and therapies proceed &quot;from saying that body unrepressed by mind is higher than body repressed by mind to saying that body is higher than mind, period.&quot; Wilber designates this recipe to &quot;lose your mind and come to your senses&quot; the &quot;retro-Romantic fallacy.&quot; For Wilber, the &quot;cure&quot; for &quot;the problem of the oak&quot; is not to &quot;go back to being an acorn.&quot; Echoing Schelling, Wilber forcefully affirms that the wisdom of evolution is to achieve a higher integration beyond mind/reason and not to incur a regression below mind/reason. 

Rooted in a sense of the past (phylogenetic and ontogenetic/ collective and individual) as &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;sub&quot; and the future as &quot;post&quot; and &quot;trans,&quot; Wilber is a philosopher of &quot;tomorrow's greater embrace&quot; with a call &quot;to us to go beyond what went before,&quot; to evolve and &quot;go forward&quot; in the &quot;direction&quot; of the &quot;greater depth&quot; and &quot;unprecedented&quot; higher integration of the future in tune with the unfolding/enfolding &quot;emergence&quot; of Spirit and not to regress through &quot;retro-fallacies&quot; into lower &quot;immersion.&quot; Wilber's theory of evolution carries a strong &quot;developmental&quot; prescription of &quot;growth to goodness&quot; and not the nostalgic counsel of &quot;recaptured goodness.&quot; This is not to be misconstrued as an outright rejection of the past. Wilber disapproves of the repression of the past by the present as much as the regression of the present to the past: &quot;…one can fully transcend any level only if one fully honours it first: let us come to bury Caesar; let us praise him first.&quot; However, though undeniably &quot;we are all the sons and daughters of tribes,&quot; the lower levels of our &quot;prerational past&quot; though undeniably &quot;our roots, our foundations&quot; are &quot;yesterday's normality&quot; and not at all an &quot;omega pull&quot; that can take us to tomorrow's &quot;wider depth.&quot; It is this transcending evolutionary dynamics that makes Wilber reject the contemporary trend to revive and celebrate magical/tribal/horticultural kinship with nature as a panacea for the contemporary ecological crisis because the tribal state of being &quot;close to nature&quot; was only a &quot;pre&quot; condition of &quot;ignorance&quot;(when even the body was not fully differentiated from nature not to speak of the mind) that was truly a &quot;lack of capacity to devastate the environment on a large scale [that] does not automatically mean presence of wisdom, let alone reverence for the environment.&quot; The past should always be successfully integrated with the present (without which individual or cultural or evolutionary neurosis occurs) and not resurrected in retro-romantic revivalism/regression as a solution to the pathologies of dissociation and repression of the present. The present should always look forward to a &quot;trans&quot;-formative future and not look back at the transcended past. 

Wilber finds in evolution a &quot;balance&quot; of Eros/Ascent/Prajna (&quot;the lower reaching up to the higher&quot;) and Agape/Descent/Karuna (&quot;the higher reaching down and embracing the lower&quot;). Wilber interprets contemporary Eco-romanticism which espouses nature as the &quot;source&quot; of our Being and the &quot;foundation&quot; of our &quot;salvation&quot; as a sign of &quot;Thanatos&quot; or the &quot;drag&quot; of the lower (or the &quot;hijacking&quot; of the higher by the lower) which is a counter-evolutionary act and a setback to the evolutionary Eros of Ascent to higher and wider integration/embrace. Undeniably, the Ego in mad dissociation has degenerated into repressive &quot;Phobos&quot; and dominated nature and precipitated an ecological peril. As a corective, eco philosophies propagate a &quot;return to nature&quot; which is unacceptable to Wilber as it contravenes his vision of evolution in which, as Schelling proclaimed with pioneering insight, mind &quot;transcends&quot; nature but can and must &quot;include&quot; nature in an &quot;unprecedented&quot; &quot;higher union&quot; and not forsake its status of evolutionary subsequence as a &quot;deeper and wider&quot; stage &quot;beyond&quot; nature and regress to a &quot;prior&quot; dedifferentiated immersion in &quot;shallower and narrower&quot; nature. In Wilber's poetics of evolution: &quot;Each stage is true, each succeeding stage is 'more true.' This is not elitist, and it offers no reason for any epoch (even ours) to picture itself as privileged, because it, too, is destined to pass, to be transcended and included in tomorrow's greater embrace.&quot; 

Wilber calls the Great Nest of Being &quot;the essence of premodernity,&quot; and taking cue from Habermas, endorses Max Weber's definition of modernity as &quot;the differentiation of the cultural value spheres&quot; of art, morals and science (or of what Wilber calls &quot;the Big Three—&quot;I, We, It&quot; or &quot;the Beautiful, the Good, and the True&quot; or &quot;Self, Culture, and Nature&quot;). For Wilber, this differentiation constitutes the &quot;dignity of modernity&quot; as art, morals and science could now each &quot;pursue its own truth without violence and domination from the others&quot; in a new unheard of freedom made possible exclusively by the emergence of reason. The differentiation of I and We gave birth to human rights and freedom from subservience to State and Church; the differentiation of I and It inspired an imagination freed from representation to create non-realist art; and the differentiation of We and It promoted discoveries in science unhampered by Church and State. Wilber also speaks of &quot;the Big Three&quot; of modernity as &quot;the four quadrants&quot; that are the four &quot;faces&quot;of Spirit which exist in complex interdependence: the Upper Left quadrant(&quot;intentional&quot; or &quot;the inside of the individual&quot; or &quot;I&quot;), the Upper Right quadrant (&quot;behavioural&quot; or &quot;the outside of the individual&quot; or It&quot;), the Lower Left quadrant(&quot;cultural&quot; or &quot;the inside of the collective&quot; or &quot;We&quot;) and the Lower Right quadrant(&quot;social&quot; or &quot;the outside of the collective&quot; or &quot;Its&quot;). Wilber contends that the four quadrants of individual consciousness, cultural backgrounds, objective states and social structures &quot;tetra-evolve,&quot; that &quot;each quadrant is intimately correlated with, dependent upon, but not reducible, to the others,&quot; that consciousness is &quot;distributed across all four quadrants&quot; and not &quot;located solely&quot; in any one quadrant, and that &quot; Spirit manifests always and simultaneously as the four quadrants&quot; and therefore the &quot;unpacking of God&quot; should occur non-exclusively or non-reductively as an &quot;integral&quot; performance out of &quot;intuitions touching the I and the We and the It domains.&quot; However, it is not uncommon for epistemologies to interpret reality in terms of only one of the four quadrants or of the Left-Hand or Right-Hand alone and thereby reductively exaggerate &quot;one-fourth of the story&quot; or &quot;only one half of the story&quot; as &quot;the whole story&quot; and &quot;deny not only the importance but the very existence of the other quadrants.&quot; Right-Hand realities (UR and LR) are all exteriors or surfaces and have &quot;simple location&quot;(in &quot;physical spacetime&quot;) and can be &quot;'pointed' to with your finger&quot; and be an object of empirical observation. Atoms, molecules, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, neuronal organisms, neural cord, reptilian brain stem, limbic system, neocortex (triune brain), complex neocortex, SF1, SF2,and SF3 are Upper Right (exterior of the individual) levels while galaxies, planets, Gaia system, heterotrophic ecosystems, foraging survival clans, horticultural ethnic tribes, agrarian feudal empires and early nations, industrial corporate states and informational planetary order and value communities are Lower Right (exterior of the collective) levels. Left-Hand realities (UL and LL) defy &quot;simple location&quot; since they are non-empirical interior depths and invite interpretation. Prehension, irritability, sensation, perception, impulse, emotion, symbols, concepts, conop, formop, vision-logic, psychic, subtle and causal are Upper Left (interior of the individual) levels, while physical-pleromatic, protoplasmic, vegetative, locomotive, uroboric, magic, mythic, rational and vision-logic are Lower Left (interior of the collective) levels. Wilber affirms that &quot;surfaces can be seen but depth must be interpreted&quot; and Empiricism and Hermeneutics have been the &quot;the Right and Left Hand Paths&quot; of &quot;every major knowledge quest, East and West alike&quot; and are &quot;the Two Hands of God.&quot; All Left-Hand interior realities have Right-Hand exterior &quot;correlates.&quot; This does not mean that Left-Hand interiors are not anything other or more than Right-Hand exteriors. But modernity has reduced Left-Hand depths to Right-Hand surfaces and generated a &quot;flatland.&quot; In a classic explanation of the example of &quot;the thought of going to the grocery store,&quot; Wilber shows the &quot;integral&quot; interrelations of intentional, behavioural, cultural and social manifestations of this &quot;thought.&quot; The &quot;interior intentionality&quot; of consciousness (UL) has correlates as &quot;brain states&quot; (UR): &quot;… there was a release of norepinephrine between the neural synapses in the frontal cortex, accompanied by high amplitude beta waves…and so on. All of which is true enough and all of which is important. But that is not how I experienced the thought and I will never actually experience my thought in those terms.&quot; Further, individual consciousness is neither exclusively &quot;of the Upper Left or the Upper Right or both together&quot; because it cannot arise in the first place without a &quot;cultural world space&quot; or an &quot;intersubjective circle of mutual recognition&quot;(Lower Left). Individual &quot;intentions&quot; and &quot;thoughts&quot; do not emerge in a &quot;vacuum&quot; nor can they be generated by the &quot;physical brain alone&quot;: &quot;My thoughts do not pop into my head out of nowhere, they pop into my head out of a cultural background&quot; and cases of a &quot;wolf boy&quot; show that &quot;the human brain, left without culture, does not produce linguistic thoughts on its own.&quot; It is culture that &quot;allows&quot; consciousness, and the whole gamut of capacities of subjective identity is &quot;situated&quot; in &quot;a vast intersubjective world space.&quot; For example, language is not exclusively an &quot;intentional&quot;/subjective expression but a &quot;cultural&quot; competence of intersubjective origin: &quot;… I can take a simple word like 'dog' and point to a real dog and say 'I mean that!' What is so remarkable is that you know what I mean by that. Forget the simple empirical pointing. Instead look at the mutual understanding.&quot; But this LL meaning of a language (semantics) that is culturally shared by a community (or collective signifieds) has Lower Right collective material/social correlates in the form of the rules of the language (grammar and syntax) and spoken and written words (or collective signifiers). All LL collective/cultural practices are not disembodied interiors but have exterior/observable correlates in the form of LR collective/social structures, institutions and systems. 

Wilber advances the view that each of the &quot;levels&quot; of the Great Nest (matter, body, mind, soul and spirit) has four quadrants of manifestations—for example, the intentional self/ I of &quot;mind,&quot; the behavioural nature/ It of &quot;mind,&quot; the cultural background/ We of &quot;mind&quot; and the social environment/ Its of &quot;mind&quot;. Further, not only is any given quadrant one of the four manifestations of a level of the Great Nest, each quadrant as a genre (as UL or UR or LL or LR) has (as indicated above) its own evolutionary history of several stages. Wilber uses the Pythagorean term &quot;Kosmos&quot; to designate the &quot;Totality&quot; of all the levels of the Great Nest each with its four quadrants of manifestation. Wilber also uses the simple shorthand &quot;everything&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Kosmos.&quot; As a philosopher of &quot;everything&quot; with &quot;Kosmology&quot; as theme and an &quot;integral&quot; turn, Wilber in his writings from 1995 has focussed on recent evolutionary mishaps in integration of &quot;levels&quot; and of quadrants within a level and has configured an &quot;integral&quot; recipe for evolutionary reconstruction.. In a bold critique, Wilber claims that though the premodern Great Nest is &quot;the collective wisdom of several millennia of the greatest men and women this planet has ever seen,&quot; it is quite a &quot;static system&quot; as it conceptualizes its &quot;levels&quot; as &quot;simply and everlastingly pregiven, static, unyielding to the advances of time or the unfolding of development&quot; and as it does not, unlike modernity, possess the &quot;differentiation&quot; of the four quadrants to be able to envision, for example, the intentional self of soul, the cultural background of soul, the objective nature(neurophysiology) of soul and the social environment of soul and to see how these four faces of soul also &quot;evolve through time.&quot; Wilber seeks to &quot;modernize&quot; the Great Nest. But modernity itself has most ignorantly &quot;trashed&quot; the Great Nest. Wilber notes that with the rise of modernity in the sixteenth century, the Great Nest &quot;took a colossal hit from which it never recovered.&quot; Wilber contends that the &quot;dignity of modernity&quot; turned into a &quot;disaster&quot; in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Wilber interprets the &quot;disaster of modernity&quot; as the &quot;dissociation&quot; or &quot;imperialism&quot; of &quot;monological science&quot; that &quot;dismissed&quot; &quot;the entire interior dimensions&quot; of &quot;consciousness, psyche, soul, spirit, value, morals, ethics and art&quot; as &quot;hangovers from the premodern, prescientific ignorance of humankind&quot; because none of the &quot;subjective and interior domains&quot; of art and morals fell within the &quot;eye of flesh or empirical instruments&quot; of scientific materialism and that &quot;flattened&quot; the &quot;interior realities of the I and WE&quot; to &quot;objective exteriors&quot; and &quot;exterior surfaces.&quot; This &quot;collapse of the Kosmos,&quot; as Wilber also calls the &quot;disaster of modernity,&quot; is tantamount to a &quot;rejection&quot; of &quot;the core&quot; of the interior truths of &quot;all of the world's wisdom traditions&quot; which have served as &quot;the backbone of every human culture prior to modernity. &quot; Wilber views &quot;the modern West&quot; as &quot;the first major civilization in the history of humanity to deny almost entirely the existence of the Great Nest of Being.&quot; 

Wilber proposes the &quot;integral task&quot; of a synthesis (as in a Hegelian triadic dialectic) beyond premodernity and modernity that would include premodernity and modernity but overcome their respective limitations—the premodern lack of the four quadrants and the modern denial of the Great Nest. This postmodern synthesis/integration of &quot;the enduring truths&quot; of premodernity (or &quot;all-level&quot;) and &quot;the good news&quot; of modernity (or &quot;all-quadrant&quot;) would generate &quot; all of the levels in the four quadrants…[and] all of the quadrants at each of those levels&quot; or as Wilber succinctly defines it &quot; body, mind, soul, and spirit in self, culture, nature&quot; or as he condenses it even further into an integral mantra: &quot;all-quadrant, all-level,&quot;/ &quot;AQAL.&quot; Instead of emerging as such a synthesis, contemporary postmodernity as yet in its &quot;deconstructive&quot; phase has merely compounded the Upper Right &quot;flatland madness&quot; of modernity with another Right-Hand reductionism: Lower Right &quot;aperspectival madness.&quot; 

Postmodernity is early vision-logic of &quot;integral- aperspectival&quot; consciousness that seeks to deconstruct and transcend the exclusionary, marginalizing, silencing, indifferent and oppressive practices of modernity/rationality. But the &quot;bright promise&quot; of the &quot;inclusiveness&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; of vision-logic/postmodernity failed and degenerated into &quot;aperspectival madness.&quot; Wilber speaks of the &quot;horizontal integration&quot; at any level of consciousness which would entail &quot;an integration of the four quadrants at [that] level&quot; and the converse possibility of the &quot;pathological imbalance&quot; at a level of consciousness when there is &quot;overemphasis on the I, We, It domains.&quot; Wilber claims that instead of unfolding in an &quot;all-quadrant&quot; embrace, postmodern integral-aperspectival consciousness &quot;collapsed&quot; to &quot;surfaces, to exteriors, to Right-Hand occasions&quot; and became &quot;crippled&quot; into a Lower Right pluralism or &quot;exterior holism&quot; of aperspectival madness. Instead of an all-quadrant &quot;integralism,&quot; postmodernity merely extended the Right-Hand reductionism of modernity in another &quot;twist&quot; on the collapse of the Kosmos as a LR pluralism with a denial of UL depth (the premodern Great Nest) and an exclusive embrace of only LR surfaces/ &quot;interobjective its&quot;(institutions/structures/ sites of ideology and power). Up to a point, Wilber sees the &quot;pluralistic relativism&quot; sponsored by deconstructive postmodernity as an advance over the &quot;universal formalism&quot; of modernity as it has &quot;opened up the world to a richness of multiple voices.&quot; Typical of his holarchical view that &quot;each wave of existence [level of consciousness] is a fundamental ingredient of all subsequent waves [levels]&quot; and of his integrative magnanimity to &quot;cherish and embrace&quot; every level of consciousness, Wilber acknowledges (using Don Beck's colour terminology of &quot;memetic&quot; taxonomy of consciousness, cultures and nations that dominates his recent writings) &quot;the many gifts of green.&quot; But Wilber indicates in dissent from deconstructive postmodernity that it is &quot;stuck&quot;/ &quot;arrested&quot; in the chaotic incommensurability of &quot;contextual pluralities.&quot; It is not enough for postmodernity to merely provide pluralizing liberation from the hegemonic absolutes of modernity; it should &quot; transcend and include its wonderful accomplishments in an even more generous embrace&quot; and &quot;integrate&quot; the Babel of &quot;unrelated&quot; local voices it has freed--as otherwise, each local voice only &quot;expresses and relishes its uniqueness,&quot; &quot;revolves around itself, becoming its own universe&quot; and is severely self-absorbed. Unless the many excluded narratives, marginalized identities and silenced voices so &quot;nobly&quot; recovered by the pluralistic relativism of deconstructive postmodernity are integrated into a new higher unity of &quot;universal integralism&quot; or &quot;dynamic dialecticism&quot; or &quot;constructive postmodernity,&quot; they will remain merely a &quot;heap&quot; of different contexts and multiple perspectives. Constructive postmodernity can &quot;convert heaps into wholes, fragments into integration, alienation into cooperation.&quot; 

Wilber's quest for the &quot;unity-in-diversity&quot; of constructive postmodernity is in accord with his Kosmic sense of our &quot;need to keep trying to find the One-in-the-Many that is the form of the Kosmos itself&quot; and it becomes the next evolutionary step in the self-realizing movement of the Kosmos one step closer to the ultimate return of the Kosmos to itself. As &quot;aperspectival madness&quot; is a debasement of the original promise of &quot;all-quadrant, all-level&quot; integralism, Wilber's critique of deconstructive postmodernity carries a strong accent on the unfinished project of postmodernity. Wilber emphasizes the evolutionary urgency of achieving the missed synthesis of the Great Nest of premodernity and the four quadrants of modernity and linking it with a &quot;jump&quot;/ &quot;momentous leap&quot; from the early vision-logic of deconstructive postmodernity of &quot;aperspectival madness&quot; or &quot;dynamic pluralism&quot; which is the &quot;green&quot; final wave of &quot;first-tier thinking&quot; to the middle and late vision-logic of constructive postmodernity of &quot;universal integralism&quot; or &quot;dynamic dialecticism&quot; which is the &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;turquoise&quot; of &quot;second-tier thinking&quot; beyond which are transmental &quot;third-tier&quot;/&quot;Kosmocentric&quot;stages of coral/psychic and subtle, causal and nondual in as yet unchristened colours of the ultimate destiny of consciousness. 

With a prodigious mission of evolutionary rehabilitation that can rescue us from the &quot;disaster of modernity&quot; which has worsened into the contemporary &quot;aperspectival madness&quot; of deconstructive postmodernity and make us fit to go forward in higher emergence, Wilber is a visionary custodian of our teleological tryst with an integral and transpersonal tomorrow. With majestic wisdom and marvellous eloquence, Wilber has been reminding us in book after book that we have laboriously come &quot;up from Eden&quot; and should not, individually or collectively, jeopardize the teleological promise of &quot;tomorrow's greater embrace.&quot; A visionary orchestration of multidisciplinary doctrines of diverse thinkers of different times and cultures into a pathbreaking philosophy of the Kosmos, a lofty discourse on the evolutionary meaning of human fate, an erudite narrative of the journey of consciousness through &quot;all our yesterdays&quot; to its &quot;fresh woods and pastures new&quot; of tomorrow, a magisterial presentation of the Kosmos as a teleological play of Brahman, a creative refiguration of the premodern &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; into a paradigm of wisdom for the postmodern wired world, and a sublime meditation in surpassing spiritual prose on eternity and time, the Big Bang and Eden, heaven and earth, the One and the Many, gods and goddesses, pre and trans, higher and lower, inner and outer, left and right, surface and depth, immersion and transcendence, mind and brain, science and spirituality, sex and soul, the child and the sage, I and We, epochs and worldviews, yesterday and tomorrow, atoms and Atman, ego and enlightenment, and Everything and Emptiness, Wilber's achievement is a miracle of prajna and karuna.

Unit of consciousness, synchronization, and the collective dimension

by Nitamo Federico Montecucco

The nineties have been declared by the scientific community the decade of the brain, but, if we look at the real hepistemological target it should be renamed, instead the decade of consciousness. The scientific comprehension of individual and collective consciousness represents the challenge of today's scientific research. After four centuries of materialism science can finally rediscover its original holistic spirit and thus help humanity even in its inner dimension. The new frontier of scientific research is understanding the evolutionary logic behind individual and collective consciousness. In order to accomplished this challenge, it is first necessary to introduce different scientific paradigms which can enable us to penetrate in the inner dimension of reality and the realm of consciousness. Secondly, it is necessary to introduce appropriate models of consciousness which will permit us to analise data in a coherent and evolutionary way. Thirdly, scientific and experimental?? data are needed to understand the nature and logic of individual and collective consciousness.

Among the primary paradigms which have been proposed to scientifically comprehend the psichic realm are David Bohm's &quot;implicate order&quot; and &quot;active information&quot;, Ervin Lazlo's &quot;psi field&quot; and &quot;sub-quantistic void&quot;, and Carl Gustav Jung's &quot;synchronicity&quot;.

My personal approach is oriented towards cybernetics. I define consciousness as: &quot;that which has the capacity of perceiving the meaning of an information&quot;.

Information as &quot;quantum of meaning&quot; 

Lets start from the actual concept of information. If in a positivistic vision of reality information is only synonimous to a signal or bit (used as means to convey a message), from a holistic standpoint it can also be interpreted as &quot;quantum of meaning&quot;. Information without meaning is non-sense.

Lets try to briefly analise its characteristics. Cybernetics describes information as being with no energy and no mass. Manfred Eigen, Nobel prize winner for chemistry, upholds the principle that &quot;the nature of information is immaterial&quot;, while biologist Pier Grassè states that &quot;information makes and animates the living being&quot;.

A &quot;quantum of energy&quot; can be understood as being a package of information and the entire reality can be considered in non-dualistic terms as informed and intelligent energy, with a &quot;protomind&quot; as the physicist David Peat suggest, in constant informatic flow, which can gain?? coherence, crystalize, individualize, self-organized?? and evolve by?? unifying the information's meaning in coherent and synergic way.

Information is the gateway towards consciousness

Physicist and philosopher Henry Margenau states that &quot;Consciousness, though the theory of information says nothing about it, it would have no sense without information.&quot;

Information necessarily implies meaning and thus presumes consciousness. The concept of information is a gateway, an open passage towards the greater implicate dimension of consciousness.

Information, like elementary particles, has a twofold nature; it can be seen as bit from an explicate-energetic viewpoint, or as quantum of meaning (the building block of consciousness) from its implicate-psychic aspect.

Information is a term largely utilized in science which can easily be holistically reoriented and used as element of quantification of consciousness in all its aspect.

The first principle of thermodynamics: entropy and syntropy

Whereas the logic of phisical energy obeys the law of entropy, in cybernetics the concept of information leads to an opposite logic, to the concept of negative entropy, or syntropy, as defined by italian phisicist Fantappié, and thus has an obvious tendency to move towards order and evolution.

Nobel prize winner Ilya Prigogine has in fact shown that the principle of entropy, when applied to &quot;dissipative structures&quot;, defined?? as an open systems far from the thermodynamic equilibrium such as living systems, leads to the opposite result of organisation and order. 

We can thus interpret reality both as physical energy obeying the law of entropy and as information obeying to the law of syntropy.

Knowledge: the principle of conservation of information

The first law of thermodynamics called &quot;law of conservation&quot; states that energy and mass cannot be created nor destroyed but can only be modified and transformed. If we consider energy as information we have the principle of &quot;conservation of information&quot; and therefore of meaning. It is the principle on which DNA , phychic memories and individual sense of identity (of every living being) are based. To understand the meaning of an information is the basic act of learning and to store informations means to accumulate knowledge.

The center of the information network

We can now pass from the theoreitic bases to the model. The intrinsic tendency of information/consciousness is to get together, to become organized and to evolve. In our ordinary observations we perceive the world as being made up of units: stones, plants, sky, people, stars ect. These units, from a cybernetic viewpoint can generically be classified in two categories: non-unitary units and unitary units. A stone, like a lake or a watch, are made up of atoms that show no global or unitary informational activity. If we break down a stone we will have many pieces of stone. A tree, a person or a whale are units composed of cells which show great informational integration and an obvious unity. When we view &quot;a&quot; whale or &quot;a&quot; child we first perceive the unity and not the parts of which it is composed. We do not perceive &quot;a-mass-of-several-billion-cells-shaped-as-a-child&quot; but its individuality, the unit of informations and meanings which is manifest as unit of consciousness.

It is this central unity which animates all living being and permits its biochemical, emotional and psichic functioning. The entire sequence of biochemical and neuropsychic processes within a living organism can in fact be seen as a complex web o cylce of elaboration of infomations which contains a sort of central knot, a cybernetic center. This is why I define consciousness as that which has the capacity of perceiving the meaning of a given information.

The Cyber model

We unconsciously perceive these cybernetic center in living beings as unit?? of consciousness which we call individuality or subjectivity. For greater clarity and to underline the importance of its conscious use, I have redifined this model with the term Cyber which stems from the greek word Kybernetes or &quot;he who governs, who drives&quot;, a term which originally derives from the more anchient sanscrit root Kubera, &quot;rudder, helm&quot;. Cyber is every complex unit which has the capacity to govern itself because - being a unit of consciousness - it understands the meaning of the entire mass of its own information and can respond unitarily. Cyber is the psycosomatic unit, conscious and alive. It is the union of intelligent energies, organically and psicologically structured. A Cyber is indivisible - we cannot devide a child and obtain many children as we do with stones.

The &quot;autopoietic systems&quot; concept of Marturana and Varela adapts perfectly to the caracteristics of the Cyber model. The Cyber model from a humanistic standpoint can be compared to the hindu concept of Atman, Liebenit's Monade, Koestler's Olone, the indotibetan Mandala. From a psychological viewpoint, Cyber is similar to the Assagioli's Sferoidal model and to the the concept of &quot;noo-semantic field&quot; proposed by Christine Hardy.

Without a model of consciousness, modern science cannot enter a different realm of knowledge.

Evolution as quantum leap of consciousness and knowledge

One of the foundamental caracteristics of the Cyber model is that it exsists feeding on information and that it grows accumulating knowledge. Every living organism is a unit which feeds on matter/energy and, being a Cyber, feeds also on information/consciousness, thus lives in a constant process of knowledge of itself and of exsistance. The entire evolutionary process is a process of increase and complexification of knowledge. Every evolutionary step is synchronically manifest as increase in structural and informational order, that is to say that evolution is an undivided process of complexification and expansion of consciousness and physical structure. 

In order to understand individual human consciousness and its quantic leap towards collective consciousness it is necessary to understand the logic of the co-evolutionary proceses which have brought about the creation of the human species. On the earth there are four level of Cyber units: atoms, cells, animals and plants (multicellular organisms) and the planet seen as Gaia, an immense living, intelligent, self balancing being. Every other unit must be considered an aggregate with no cybernetic center. If we observe the evolutionary process from the point of view of the unification of Cyber units into greater units we can pinpoint three great evolutionary leaps or levels; the first occurred at the dawn of creation when elementary particles got together to from atoms, the second, on Earth, when atoms formed the first cells and the third when cells evolved into multicellular organisms like animals or plants.

Today we are witnessing a hypothetical fourth great leap: the transformation from a fragmented individual human consciousness to a planetary consciousness, a process which cannot be forseen but which can be understood in its basic logic and in its deeper sense.

Evolution and coherent comunication

After a long period of evolution, unicellular beings, as primitive units of consciousness, entered a different phase of collective consciousness evolution from which, in time, resulted a new unit of super-individual consciousness. In this melting process the comunication of information became an essential factor to create the coherence which is at the root of the quantum leap. A progressive increase of complexity and transmission of information, seen as global structural and physiological order, is generated among cells. An example of this progressive increase in complexity of information exchange can be seen in the following example of the evoutionary steps occurred from unicellular to muticellular organism: first simple bacterial aggregates with practically no comunication between them exsist, then unicellular colonies with minimal comunication and structural differentiation such as certain types of primitive algae appear, and then life evolves to the more complex and differentiated aggregates such as volvox or sponges and finally unicellular co-evolvolution reaches its maximum potential beyond which we can no longer speak of aggregation but of actual supercellular unity; the multicellular organism, a unit of consciousness infinitely superior to the units of which it is composed.

There are cases such as the ameba from the family of Dyctiostelium in which the unicellular individuals evolve into multicellular organisms during their lifespan. When the conditions of humidity and nourishment in the underwood become critical, individual ameba unite, amalgamate and, thanks to certain chemical transmitters such as AMP-C which activate the process, differentiate like a true multicellular organism. Some of the ameba form a base by grounding themselves to the soil, others grow vertically thinning out to a height where a third group form a swelling in which spores are creted and will mature. When the dry season causes the capsule to break, the new spores are carried by the wind and from these will spring new unicellular ameba.

In multicellular organisms, global information exsists as DNA in every single cell. This allows for an extreemly dense and coherent form of communication. The coherence of transmission of information is certainly one of the key elements to understand collective consciousness.

Evolution of the nervous system

In multicellular animals evolution of consciousness is reflected in the degree of developement of the nervous system. Every leap in comprehension and developement of strategic survival capacities results in the syncronic modification and increase in complexity of the brain.

The theory that I propose considers the individual living consciousness, as intelligent capacity to elaborate, memorize, and utilize the meaning of information, as the true engine behind evolution.

The theory that evolution occurs by chance can be discarded by the simple evidence of the growth with which living organisms evolve in order and complexity. If this process really occurred by chance the complexity of an organism would be inversely proportional to the time of evolution. In truth the opposite actually happens: the more complex living organisms become the faster they evolve.

Evolution from the first procariotic cell (without nucleous) to the first eucariotic unicellular organism (with nucleous) took about three billion years, whereas that from the first microscopic marine unicellular organism to the human being took only 700 million years and the entire human history from the first humanoid untill the present day has taken only 30 million years.

The more consciousness evolves the more rapidly it solves problems and develops the potential of its intelligence.The individual consciousness developes the best possible program to adapt to a given environment, that is to say: it developes the most intelligent and adaptable software and neuropsychic hardware, and naturally selects himself towards less intelligent and adaptable individuals.

Psychic archeology of the brain and of human consciousness

In the nervous system as in its consciousness are represented all the principal structures which have caracterized its evolutionary process: from unicellular organism, to cordates?? to reptiles, then mammals and finally to the human being. The three evolutionary levels present in our brain (reptile, mamal and human), as given by Paul MacLean, are the most tangible evidence of this. Psycosomatics generally believes that the ever increasing presence of psicosomatic diseases and problems ranging from neurovegetative disfunctions to stress and depression are the evidence that there is a scarce communication between the three brains, a phenomenon which MacLean named &quot;schizophisiology&quot;. In psycosomatic terms this low degree of integration is interpreted as the incapacity to fluidly administer and integrate instincts, emotions, feelings and thoughts due to the inhibitory conditioning of family and society (Henry Laborit's &quot;action inhibition&quot;) which results in blocks in character and muscular structure in various parts of the body.

Many psycosomatic problems can also be blamed on a low communication between brain hemispheres. This has been highlighted among others, by research made on brain hemisphere communication both in health individuals and in patients with severed hemispheres as in the &quot;split brain&quot; experiments made by Sperry and Gazzaniga. According to this data, communication between hemispheres involves a few major obstacles, first of all the &quot;self -consciousness&quot; of the left hemisphere as opposed to the un-consciousness of the right. This data also can be interpreted in psychosomatic terms as the difficulty or the incapacity of integrating our masculine and femminine parts caused mainly by family imprinting and educational modes as well as cultural habits.

Briefly we could summarize by saying that: the low coherence in the activity of our brain reflects the fragmentation of our lives and of our culture which is manifest socially as lack of communication.

The basic hypothesis is that the human being could achieve a unitary state of consciousness which would produce a high level of communication and coherence between cerebral and intellectual functions. This inner unity would then be projected outwards as social unity.

1 Introduction

The evolutionary history of any complex system, such as human cognition, or the human language capacity, necessarily starts with something simpler1. It is accepted as a working hypothesis that a precursor of modern human capacity for complex syntactic language was a capacity for protolanguage (Bickerton, 1990), a kind of communication system with no syntax. In protolanguage, although words may have been uttered in short sequences, there were no rules defining wellformedness of strings, and therefore words in protolanguage could not be said to belong to separate syntactic classes, such as Noun or Verb. 

A view commonly encountered about the emergence of true syntactic language is that, during the protolanguage period, there existed a somewhat complex system of mental representation, capable of representing the structure of events with their participant agents and patients. In this view, the move to syntactic language was in large part an externalization of this pre-existing system of representation. ``The mechanism [of syntax] was there all the time, but it was not being used for language.'' (Bickerton, 1998:350) Let us call such a system of mental representation `protothought'. It is often assumed that the structure of this protothought was something like Predicate Calculus (but possibly without quantifiers). 


2 Predicate Logic, Semantics and Psychology

Assuming something like a modern Predicate Calculus form of mental representation for our pre-linguistic ancestors actually attributes to them at least a five-way distinction between types of atomic mental entities, as the following simple formulae illustrate.

CAME(john)       [translation: `John came']


 x[TALL(x) &amp; MAN(x) &amp; CAME(x)]  [translation: `A tall man came']


In such representations, one has to distinguish the following types of atomic element, each of which functions in the representations in a distinctive way and relates to external meanings in a distinctive way: 

*	predicates (e.g. CAME, TALL),
*	individual constants (e.g. john),
*	individual variables (e.g. x),
*	connectives (e.g. &amp;),
*	quantifiers (e.g. ). 

The proposals which derive the basics of modern syntactic structure from such pre-linguistic mental representations are seldom fully explicit on points of detail, but typically seem to assume that individual constants are the evolutionary sources of Proper Nouns, and perhaps also of Common Nouns, while the predicate constants are the sources of Verbs. One account which is completely explicit on this point is found in the computer models of Kirby (2000a, 2000b), and here is it clear that individual constants are the evolutionary source of what emerge as Proper Nouns, and predicate constants the source of Verbs. 

Such an apparatus for prelinguistic mental representation is implausibly rich. I will argue that a reduced apparatus is more plausible. Specifically, in the proposed less complex format for mental representations, there are only 

predicates 
individual variables, but no individual constants, 
just one connective, namely conjunction, `&amp;' 
just one quantifier, the existential, `', implicit in all representations. 
The implication of this proposal is that formulae such as the first given above, CAME(john), were not available as pre-linguistic mental representations, specifically because they contain individual constants. Why do I believe that individual constants cannot be justified as elements of mental representation pre-existing language? A brief look at the place of Predicate Logic in modern scholarship will help to set the scene. 

The originators of modern logical calculi did not intend them to be taken as psychological entities in any way. Frege, for example, was averse to `psychologism', believing that the private concepts of individual people are beyond investigation. The central tradition stemming from Frege interprets logical formulae by a direct relationship with a presumed objectively given world, thus bypassing any psychological stage which might be located in the mind/brain of a user. In this view, meaning is a relation between (logical) language and the world; no mind intervenes or mediates in this relationship between language and the world. ``According to Montague, the syntax, semantics and pragmatics of natural languages are branches of mathematics, not of psychology.'' (Thomason, 1974:2) This approach to meaning has been characterized (and criticized) by Lakoff (1988:119-154) as `objectivist semantics'. 

The designers of the Predicate Calculus assumed, surely correctly, that the world contains individual objects, such as the sun, the moon, particular people, dogs, cats, tables and chairs and so forth. These individual objects are the denotata of the individual constants in logical formulae, such as john. Since, in this tradition, no minds mediate the relation between language and the world, the function which assigns denotations to individual constants is merely stipulated; it is typically explained by the author of a text on logic with enough ordinary-language prose to make the idea of an inherent, or stipulated, link between the logical name and the object it denotes clear enough to the reader. Often, the author conjures up some fictitious little world, with fictional characters in it, and can be confident that a reader will get the idea. Textbooks2 and more advanced accounts of meaning in logic assume that giving a real semantics to sentences involves mapping them to an assumed objective world, without involving any psychological entities such as concepts, thoughts or ideas. 

When linguists began to build generative models of languages including their semantics, it seemed appropriate to assume that the classical and simple languages of logic, such as Predicate Calculus, could be taken in their entirety and used as mental representations of meaning, much as standard IPA phonetic transcriptions can be used to represent pronunciation. Generative grammar, as indeed most modern schools of linguistics, aims to model linguistic competence, that is psychological representations of language in speakers' heads. But it cannot be safely assumed that a formalism, such as Predicate Logic, that was not designed to suit psychologistic purposes, will be appropriate for such purposes. A semanticist who accords psychological reality to semantic representations (e.g. logical formulae), faces not only the task of stating what in the world the components of these representations map onto, but also the task of accounting for how these mappings could come to be known by the language user. 

Theorists of language evolution who assume something like Predicate Calculus representations pre-existing language in the minds of early hominids also face the problem of accounting for the mappings between the mental entities, such as predicates and individual constants, and parts of the world. An account of how mental predicates (e.g. LITTLE, GREEN, MAN) come to be mapped onto properties of the world is, I claim, relatively unproblematic, whereas an account of how mental individual constants (e.g. john, mary) come to be mapped onto particular individuals is, I will argue, impossibly problematic. 


3 Perception and Cognition of Objects

It is crucial to distinguish between perception and cognition. Mental representations of events and their participants are involved differently in these two psychological processes. Let us start with perception, or more precisely `perception-as'. 

3.1 Perception

3.1.1 Unfocussed perception

Some experiences come uninvited. A creature may notice a particular smell, or feel cold, or hear thunder. In prelinguistic hominids, these experiences would undoubtedly have caused different reactions, and can be regarded as separate mental predicates whose denotations are the classes of stimuli giving rise to them. In hearing thunder, or noticing a smell, the perceiver perceives only the smell or the thunder; no other object or person is perceived. Such perceptions can be represented schematically as isolated zero-place predicates, as in

SMELL31

COLD

THUNDER

These could be paraphrased in modern English as `There is a certain smell (around here)', `It's cold', and `Ah, thunder'. Note the lack of any contentful grammatical subjects in these paraphrases. 

If the creature has no language, there is no question of these categories being connected with any words. I assume that non-linguistic creatures have representations which involve mental categories, and that they are able to judge whether or not perceived objects belong in these categories. Such mental categories are partitions of an innately given structured space of possible categories, acquired through experience. Activation of different categories, whether by immediate experience or by rumination, will stimulate different patterns of behaviour; this is what enables non-linguistic creatures to behave systematically in relation to the world. Our imagined creature carries such categories as SMELL31, COLD, and THUNDER in its mind somehow. Their existence in its mind has been distally triggered by its previous experiences. In the act of perception, these categories are reactivated. 


3.1.2 Attending to perceived objects

We now bring particular objects into the discussion. For concreteness, let's say a creature looks, with some attentive deliberation, at a fresh green sycamore leaf. In this case, the focus of attention is the leaf itself, which is an object in the world. In attending to it, and judging it to be a green leaf, the creature applies certain mental categories to it, which we can relatively safely represent as the mental predicates GREEN and LEAF. Let us assume that this much is possible, the creature's species having evolved to be able to recognize greenness and the class of leaves. 

Just as with thunder and coldness, the categories GREEN and LEAF are carried in the creature's mind somehow, having been planted there by its previous contacts with the world. In the act of perceiving a green leaf, these mental categories are brought to bear on an object of attention in the external world. It is natural, for illustrative purposes, to represent the principal elements in such an act of perception by a formula such as3:


GREEN(x) &amp; LEAF(x)

where x denotes the real-world object attended to, and the predicates correspond to the mental categories which the creature judges to apply to this object. Such a formula, then, has a mixed, partly external objective, partly mental, semantics. This is appropriate, because an episode of `perception-as' is an encounter between mental categories and real-world objects. The x in the formula is essentially deictic (or `indexical'). It is not the constant name of any particular object. It only stands, in this convenient expository representation of an act of perception, for whatever object happens to be the object of perception. If, on yet another occasion, the creature sees a different green leaf, the same representation as before, `GREEN(x) &amp; LEAF(x)', would be appropriate, as this is another act of perceiving an object as a green leaf. If I may call this x a variable, it is attention that associates the variable with a real perceived object in the world. 

The same mental predicate can be either a zero-place predicate or a one-place predicate, depending on whether the stimulus comes from an object to which the perceiver is attending. Thus if the creature deliberately sniffed the leaf, its perception might also include SMELL31(x). 

There is a fuzzy borderline between attention to a specific object and awareness of ambient impressions. Attention involves selection of one source of stimulation over others which have an equally good chance of being selected, or attended to. A creature might decide to have a good look at a hole in a tree, as opposed to the tree's bark, or an upper branch. A hole in a tree is something of a size that one can reasonably pay selective attention to. Compare this with a large cave, especially one in which the creature is sitting. As the cave is all around it, it is not clear whether to count a perceptual judgement about the cave as an unfocussed perception or the perception of an object attended to, that is whether this should be represented as4

DARK(x) &amp; CAVE(x) &amp; SMELLY(x)

or as

DARK &amp; CAVE &amp; SMELLY

It will pose no problem to the account proposed here if we allow that mental representations cannot be fully determined, or theorized about, in all cases. Either the creature represents its perceptions as simply ambient (the zero-place case) or more specifically about the place it is sitting in, as opposed to some other place it has chosen not to attend to (the one-place case). 

3.2 Cognition: Representing previously perceived objects

We move now to cognition. The important aspect of cognition, for our purposes, is the memory, or store, of experiences which are no longer current. Consider how the non-linguistic creature, while not actually perceiving a green leaf, stores in memory the fact that it did once see a green leaf. When objects are no longer attended to, the association of an external object with an attention variable is lost, because it is the very act of attention which brings about this association. In the transition from perception to cognition (i.e. the process of putting into memory), then, the variable loses its former (extensional) meaning. The creature can remember that it once had a `GREEN(x) &amp; LEAF(x)' experience, but there is now nothing pointing, as attention once did, to the object itself. The closest that Predicate Calculus can get to this is formulae with existential quantifiers, like:

For any x [GREEN(x) &amp; LEAF(x)]

For any x [DARK(x) &amp; DAMP(x) &amp; SMELLY(x) &amp; CAVE(x)]

The second formula here might be paraphrased as `(I remember) there was a dark damp smelly cave'. Memory of complex experiences (but not involving more than one object) is captured by conjunctions of such atomic proposition-predicates. Each conjunction, or bundle of features, is a separate entry in the mental database, a memory of a separate experienced event. 

Implicit in this account, and the central plank of the whole argument, is the theme that in prelinguistic cognition there are no components of mental representation with the logical status of individual constants, i.e. elements that, as the philosophers say, allow their possessors to re-identify particulars with absolute reliability. 


3.2.1 There are No Particulars in Animal Cognition

The individuals most important us are our near kin, mothers and babies. The following quotation demonstrates the prima facie attraction of the impression that animals distinguish such individuals, but simultaneously gives the game away. 

“The speed with which recognition of individual parents can be acquired is illustrated by the `His Master's Voice' experiments performed by Stevenson et al. (1970) on young terns: these responded immediately to tape-recordings of their own parents (by cheeping a greeting, and walking towards the loudspeaker) but ignored other tern calls, even those recorded from other adult members of their own colony.” (Walker, 1983:215) 

Obviously, the tern chicks in the experiment were not recognizing their individual parents --- they were being fooled into treating a loudspeaker as a parent tern. For the tern chick, anything which behaved sufficiently like its parent was `recognized' as its parent, even if it wasn't. The tern chicks were responding to very finely-grained properties of the auditory signal, and apparently neglecting even the most obvious of visual properties discernible in the situation. In tern life, there usually aren't human experimenters playing tricks with loudspeakers, and so terns have evolved to discriminate between auditory cues just to the extent that they can identify their own parents with a high degree of reliability. Even terns presumably sometimes get it wrong. “ ... animals respond in mechanical robot-like fashion to key stimuli. They can usually be `tricked' into responding to crude dummies that resemble the true, natural stimulus situation only partially, or in superficial respects.” (Krebs and Dawkins, 1984:384) 

A creature can appear to recognize a particular individual reliably if it gets sensory impressions which are fine-grained enough to distinguish this individual from others with which it is likely to come into contact. To manage successfully in `recognizing its mother', a creature need not have a mental distinction between individual and property; all that is needed is the ability to distinguish just the set of properties which in practice differentiates its mother from other candidates. 

English dictionaries often distinguish two senses of the word recognize, as below: 

1 If you recognize someone or something, you know who someone is or what someone is when you see them or hear them, because you have seen them or heard them before. EG She didn't recognize me at first ... 
2 If you recognize something ... you are able to identify it when you see it, for example because you have learned about it or had some previous exoerience of it. EG They are specially trained to recognize the symptoms of radiation sickness ... There was a field planted with what he recognized as maize. (Collins Cobuild English Dictionary) 
This lexicographic distinction rests on the ontological distinction between individuals (or particulars5 ) and universals. The central claim here is that prelinguistic creatures could not have had mental representations containing elements corresponding to particular individuals; they could only recognize things in sense 2 above, but not in sense 1. 

3.2.2 Individual particulars, universal properties

Prelinguistic creatures could not have been able to reidentify particulars with absolute reliability, because, in fact, neither can we. Given what we know about the world, it is, in the limit, impossible. This is not to deny that much of the time we are quite successful at reidentifying particulars, especially where it matters. But situations where reidentification is impossible are also common. For instance, every morning I pick up a bottle of milk from my doorstep. If I have a backlog of undrunk milk from previous days, I add today's bottle to the two or three that are already in the fridge in a particular spatial sequence, so that I know which is which. If someone disturbs my milk filing system, then I no longer know which is which, because I cannot reidentify particulars6. Where it really matters to us to keep individuals apart, we either mark them somehow (as with my milk filing system), or we develop more refined perceptual categories, so that we can remember the difference between individuals in terms of their slightly different properties. This presumably why humans are so proficient at face-recognition. But it is both impossible and unnecessary to refine ones perceptual categories to the point where every individual object is distinguishable from all others. One paperclip is much the same as another, as are sheets of paper, grains of sand, freshman students, and so on. 

The argument above has concentrated on the difficulty with logical individual constants as components of mental representations. The impression may have been given that logical predicates are not problematic in the same way. Philosophers have emphasized to me that, in the limit, predicates are also subject to similar problems. Putnam's Twin Earth argument (Putnam, 1975:223-247) establishes that there could be objectively (i.e. from a God's eye view) two different sorts of stuff that we label water. Our concept of water could fit both kinds of stuff, and the stuff that is chemically XYZ could, to all intents and purposes, serve exactly the same range of purposes as the stuff that is chemically H2O. We wouldn't know the difference. In Putnam's (1975:222) words, ``Extension is not determined by psychological state''. 

There is, however, a great practical difference between an ability to reidentify particulars (such as the very lion who was stalking me yesterday) and an ability to reidentify universals (such as lions in general), and hence a great practical difference between individual constants and predicates. 

Invariant factors in the environment in which humans have evolved have given rise to our perceptual space, and the discriminability of regions within it. The species has evolved to see just the colours it can see, hear just the sounds it can hear, smell just the sounds it can smell, and so forth. Despite some individual variation, the same inputs from the world trigger broadly similar perceptions in everyone, across a wide range of possible inputs. More importantly, there are relatively few cases in which objectively7 disjoint stimuli trigger the same perception. Putnam mentions such a case: ``Although the Chinese do not recognize a difference, the term `jade' applies to two minerals: jadeite and nephrite. Chemically, there is a marked difference. Jadeite is a combination of sodium and aluminum. Nephrite is made of calcium, magnesium, and iron. These two quite different microstructures produce the same unique textural qualities!'' (Putnam, 1975:241) Examples such as it jade pose no problem for a theory that prelinguistic creatures could have had mental predicates corresponding to various classes of stimuli. Their mental predicates would have had a perceptual and functional basis. If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, smells like a duck, feels like a duck and tastes like a duck, it is a duck. 

Properties are procedurally prior to individuals. That is, we use an object's properties to try to determine which individual it is. We humans are often obsessed by this question of which individual is presenting itself to us. We can never be certain, but we get as close as we can by finer and finer subclassifications of the properties we are observing. In life's ongoing calculation of `what is happening', the fundamental empirical premises are the properties which the world presents to us. The conceptual identities of individuals appear only in our conclusions. 

Central to the concept of an individual are the related ideas of uniqueness and spatiotemporal continuity. These are not part of the idea of a property. Many things are red, in different places at the same time. But an individual cannot be in two places at once. Consequently, the evidence needed to assign the same property (a mental predicate) on different occasions is weaker than the evidence needed to conclude that something is the very same individual. To assign a property, in many cases all we need is the evidence of our senses. ``No doubt about it, this is green.'' But without keeping a constant eye on an object, or insulating it somehow, we can never be sure that it hasn't been replaced by a twin, a different individual. 

3.3 Language hints at knowable identity

Modern human languages contain devices which are interpreted as if the reidentification of particulars posed no problem. Proper names are the prime example. But in fact our ordinary usage with proper names is more rough and ready than the usage of logicians with individual constants. We all know many people called Jim, and usually the context of the speech situation clarifies which Jim we are talking about. Thus Jim is in fact only a shorthand for whichever of the people who have been regularly labelled `Jim' in the experience of the interlocutors is most salient in this context. Clearly, Jim in English does not pick out a single individual, though doubtless there are some rare names which do happen to pick out single individuals. But we would not wish to distinguish logically or grammatically between different proper names on the basis of their relative rarity of application. Markers of definiteness, like English the, are also basically shorthand for whichever of the things concerned is most salient in this context. 

Individual objects are less enduring over time than properties. The objects to which proper names are most commonly attached, namely people, only live for a few generations. But almost all of the properties which we see in an individual person can be seen, in different combinations, in other people, long before and long after the brief span of the particular individual. Ars longa, vita brevis might be adapted to the case of properties and particulars, which is related to why, in philosophical discussion, properties are often called `universals'. The relative impermanence of particulars, as opposed to properties, undermines the utility of constant expressions for particulars in the continuing language of a community. Place-names are the most useful designators of enduring individual objects in modern languages, but our early ancestors would have had much less use for fixed place-names than we have. In any case, there is evidence that in modern languages, all place-names in fact derive historically from descriptions, that is from expressions involving property-terms, like the dark pool or the new castle. Probably, all person-names are ultimately so derived as well. 

Linguistic devices suggest that humans are capable of mentally representing unique individuals, using the mental equivalent of logical individual constants. We might even grant, for the sake of this argument, that modern humans do have this capacity. But it is only language that pushes us toward this conclusion. Without an insight into our language, an outside observer of modern human behaviour could not tell that we are able to mentally represent particular individuals. We, in our turn, when we consider the minds of non-linguistic creatures, must adopt the simplest hypothesis compatible with the observed facts. There is no need to hypothesize mental individual constants in animal minds. When animals respond systematically to impressively finely graded stimuli, even to the extent of reliably recognizing what we human observers believe to be unique individuals, there is no need to postulate a special category of mental representation, individual constants. Finely graded predicates, or alternatively, conjunctions of less finely graded predicates, will do the job. 

4 Social life without individual constants

We are considering the emergence of language with modern characteristics from pre-existing cognitive capacities in pre-linguistic creatures. I hope to have made the case that the cognitive representations available to pre-linguistic hominids for remembering the events of their lives are most unlikely to have contained the equivalent of logical individual constants. A more plausible form of pre-linguistic mental representation would have had only predicates, individual variables, a conjunctive connective and an implicit existential quantifier. The baby australopithecine or habiline would have had many stored memories of episodes involving its mother, many containing a form something like this:

SMELL31(x) &amp; SQUAWK7(x) &amp; WARM(x) &amp; CUDDLY(x)

(Here and henceforth, the existential quantifier is omitted from such representations, as it can be taken as implicit. The variables, however, cannot be eliminated, as they are needed for representing memories of events involving several different objects.) 

Our immediate prelinguistic ancestors certainly had complex social lives, as do modern chimpanzees. Expressing it in modern human terms, they remembered who were their friends and enemies, who was whose child, who had recently fought with whom, and who had groomed whom. But the whos in this last sentence tend to impose our modern logical analysis on the animals' behaviour. It is possible, with finely graded predicates, to represent as accurately as is necessary any of the information that australopithecines or habilines would have stored about members of their social group. That this is generally true is shown by a transformation that one can apply to any first-order logical formula containing individual constants, replacing the constants by corresponding (suitably fine-grained) predicates. For example,

CAME(john)

can be replaced by

CAME(x) &amp; JOHN(x)

where JOHN is a predicate which is only satisfied by one individual. Of course, expressing it in terms of a predicate being ``only satisfied by one individual'' is again to express things from a modern, language-informed perspective. To a pre-linguistic hominid, as to a tern chick, it was only important that the mental predicate be specific enough to be reliable in all the circumstances in which it was likely to be used. 

Two-place predications involving different individuals can be handled in this way, but with distinct variables. Thus Kanzi is Panbanisha's child could be represented as 



KANZI(x) &amp; PANBANISHA(y) &amp; CHILD(x, y)




Clearly, representations without individual constants are sufficient to account for the Machiavellian intelligence of apes. 

It is assumed here that our prelinguistic ancestors were capable of forming associations between different concepts, allowing inferences between thoughts involving different predicates. Thus



SMELL14(x)  EDIBLE(x)




might have been a mental rule useful in foraging. Similarly, `portmanteau' predicates could have been created, abbreviating longer conjunctions of more basic predicates. Thus the baby australopithecine we mentioned earlier could have had a rule such as



[SMELL31(x) &amp; SQUAWK7(x) &amp; GAIT12(x)]  MOTHER(x)




5 So what?
How does this argument relate to other issues in the evolution of language? 

The origin of syntax is a central problem. At the heart of syntactic structure is the Subject-Predicate dichotomy. So any claim about the origin of the Subject-Predicate dichotomy is central to theorizing about the origins of modern human language. 

There are two tendencies in the search for explanations of features of language, whether these are evolutionary or otherwise. One tendency is to look in the direction of possibly innate, not necessarily communicatively functional, characteristics of the minds which gave rise to language. Bickerton, in particular, has stressed the representational function of language, as opposed to its communicative function. Accounts of the rise of Subject-Predicate structure from the `pre-existing representation' point of view assume a pre-existing dichotomy between two types of concepts, a predicate type, and a subject (or argument) type; individual constants are the principal instances of concepts of the subject/argument type. In this view, pre-existing propositional representations of Subject-Predicate form get rather straightforwardly translated into linguistic clauses with corresponding structure. 

Such proposals push the question of the origin of Subject-Predicate structure back into pre-linguistic representations, and that is considered far enough to absolve the proposers from further explanation. But, as I claim to have shown, it is unnecessary to attribute such pre-existing mental structure to prelinguistic creatures; they could have got along fine without it, and so they probably did not have it. 

The opposing tendency in linguistic explanation is to appeal to communicative function. Communicative function cannot be a consideration relevant to pre-linguistic (or pre-communicative) mental structure. Pressure from communicative function can only arise once mental representations are externalized in public conventionalized symbols. From this perspective, an alternative explanation for the origin of Subject-Predicate structure is communicatively functional Topic-Comment structure. It must be emphasized that Topic and Comment are not categories of classical (modern) logical systems. Topic and Comment are categories rooted in pragmatics, in the shared knowledge of speakers and hearers, and thus are not, and never have been, the concern of truth-conditionally oriented logicians. 

The argument presented in this paper has been largely negative. I have argued that our prelinguistic ancestors could not have represented the world in terms of formulae involving individual constants, where these individual constants were destined to become the evolutionary antecedents of modern referring expressions by a process of externalization into public language. 

This negative argument is a prelude to a positive argument, in which a mechanism will be shown whereby essentially communicative pressures gave rise to the emergence of modern Subject-Predicate structure, based on prior representations in which the only constants were predicates. In brief, some predicates became selected as prototypically serving a Topic function, while others became selected as prototypically serving a Comment function. And this happened concurrently with the emergence from protolanguage of longer, more coherent strings of words. 

But, for now, that is another story. 


Endnotes
This is not to deny that evolution can sometimes simplify. But the dominant evolutionary trend is from simple to complex; and the original proto-systems were undoubtedly simple. 

E.g. Cann, 1993; Guttenplan, 1997; McCawley, 1981. 

To the best of my knowledge, the first use of such formulae, suggested as prelinguistic representations of meaning, is in Batali (2000). 

For simplicity, I allow the connective &amp; to conjoin more than two conjuncts; as we will not be dealing with disjunction, this will not affect the argument at all. 

I use the terms interchangeably here. 

My dairy does not datestamp its products. 

Objectively, to the best of our current scientific knowledge, that is.

This &quot;cheat sheet&quot; covers most of the basic functionality that an Oracle DBA needs to run basic queries and perform basic tasks.  It also contains information that a PL/SQL programmer frequently uses to write stored procedures.  The resource is useful as a primer for individuals who are new to Oracle, or as a reference for those who are experienced at using Oracle.

A great deal of information about Oracle exists throughout the net. We developed this resource to make it easier for programmers and DBAs to find most of the basics in one place.  Topics beyond the scope of a &quot;cheatsheet&quot; generally provide a link to further research.

'''Other Oracle References'''
*[[Oracle Programming/XML Cheatsheet|Oracle XML Reference]]—the XML reference is still in its infancy, but is coming along nicely.

===SELECT===
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, object tables, views, object views, or materialized views.
   SELECT *
   FROM beverages
   WHERE field1 = 'Kona'
   AND field2 = 'coffee'
   AND field3 = 122;

===SELECT INTO===
Select into takes the values ''name'', ''address'' and ''phone number'' out of the table ''employee'', and places them into the variables ''v_employee_name'', ''v_employee_address'', and ''v_employee_phone_number''.

This ''only'' works if the query matches a single item. If the query returns no rows it raises the NO_DATA_FOUND built-in exception. If your query returns more than one row, Oracle raises the exception TOO_MANY_ROWS.
 SELECT name,address,phone_number
 INTO v_employee_name,v_employee_address,v_employee_phone_number
 FROM employee
 WHERE employee_id = 6;

===INSERT ===
The INSERT statement adds one or more new rows of data to a database table.

'''insert using the VALUES keyword'''
 INSERT INTO table_name VALUES ('Value1', 'Value2', ... );
 INSERT INTO table_name( Column1, Column2, ... ) VALUES ( 'Value1', 'Value2', ... );
'''insert using a SELECT statement'''
 INSERT INTO table_name( SELECT Value1, Value2, ... from table_name );
 INSERT INTO table_name( Column1, Column2, ... ) ( SELECT Value1, Value2, ... from table_name );

===DELETE===
The DELETE statement is used to delete rows in a table.

'''deletes rows that match the criteria'''
 DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_column=some_value
 DELETE FROM customer WHERE sold = 0;

===UPDATE===
The UPDATE statement is used to udpate rows in a table.

'''updates the entire column of that table'''
 UPDATE customer SET state='CA';

'''updates the specific record of the table eg:'''
 UPDATE customer SET name='Joe' WHERE customer_id=10;

'''updates the column invoice as paid when paid column has more than zero.'''
 UPDATE movies SET invoice='paid' WHERE paid &gt; 0;

===SEQUENCES===
Sequences are database objects that multiple users can use to generate unique integers. The sequence generator generates sequential numbers, which can help automatically generate unique primary keys, and coordinate keys across multiple rows or tables.

====CREATE SEQUENCE====
'''The syntax for a sequence is:'''

 CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
     MINVALUE value
     MAXVALUE value
     START WITH value
     INCREMENT BY value
     CACHE value;

'''For example:'''

 CREATE SEQUENCE supplier_seq
     MINVALUE 1
     MAXVALUE 999999999999999999999999999
     START WITH 1
     INCREMENT BY 1
     CACHE 20;

====ALTER SEQUENCE====
'''Increment a sequence by a certain amount:'''

 ALTER SEQUENCE &lt;sequence_name&gt; INCREMENT BY &lt;integer&gt;;

===Generate query from a string===
It is sometimes necessary to create a query from a string.  That is, if the programmer wants to create a query at run time (generate an Oracle query on the fly), based on a particular set of circumstances, etc.

Care should be taken not to insert user-supplied data directly into a dynamic query string, without first vetting the data very strictly for SQL escape characters; otherwise you run a significant risk of enabling data-injection hacks on your code.

Here is a very simple example of how a dynamic query is done.  There are, of course, many different ways to do this; this is just an example of the functionality.

 PROCEDURE oracle_runtime_query_pcd IS
     TYPE ref_cursor IS REF CURSOR;
     l_cursor        ref_cursor;
 
     v_query         varchar2(5000);
     v_name          varchar2(64);
 BEGIN
     v_query := 'SELECT name FROM employee WHERE employee_id=5';
     OPEN l_cursor FOR v_query;
     LOOP
        FETCH l_cursor INTO v_name;         
        EXIT WHEN l_cursor%NOTFOUND; 
     END LOOP;
     CLOSE l_cursor;
 END;

===String operations===
====Length====
Length returns an integer representing the length of a given string. It can be referred to as: '''lengthb''', '''lengthc''', '''length2''', and '''length4'''.

 length( string1 );

 SELECT length('hello world') FROM dual;
 '''this returns 11, since the argument is made up of 11 characters including the space'''

 SELECT lengthb('hello world') FROM dual;
 SELECT lengthc('hello world') FROM dual;
 SELECT length2('hello world') FROM dual;
 SELECT length4('hello world') FROM dual;
 '''these also return 11, since the functions called are equivalent'''

====Instr====
Instr returns an integer that specifies the location of a sub-string within a string.  The programmer can specify which appearance of the string they want to detect, as well as a starting position. An unsuccessful search returns 0.

 instr( string1, string2, [ start_position ], [ nth_appearance ] )
 
 instr( 'oracle pl/sql cheatsheet', '/');
 '''this returns 10, since the first occurrence of &quot;/&quot; is the tenth character'''
 
 instr( 'oracle pl/sql cheatsheet', 'e', 1, 2);
 '''this returns 17, since the second occurrence of &quot;e&quot; is the seventeenth character'''
 
 instr( 'oracle pl/sql cheatsheet', '/', 12, 1);
 '''this returns 0, since the first occurrence of &quot;/&quot; is before the starting point, which is the 12th character'''

====Replace====
Replace looks through a string, replacing one string with another.  If no other string is specified, it removes the string specified in the replacement string parameter.

 replace( string1, string_to_replace, [ replacement_string ] );
 replace('i am here','am','am not');
 '''this returns &quot;i am not here&quot;'''

====Substr====
Substr returns a portion of the given string.  
The &quot;start_position&quot; is 1-based, not 0-based. 
If &quot;start_position&quot; is negative, substr counts from the end of the string. 
If &quot;length&quot; is not given, substr defaults to the remaining length of the string.

substr( ''string'', start_position [, length])
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT substr( 'oracle pl/sql cheatsheet', 8, 6) FROM dual;
&lt;/source&gt;
:returns &quot;&lt;tt&gt;pl/sql&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; since the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pl/sql&quot; is in the 8th position in the string (counting from 1 at the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;oracle&quot;)

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt; 
SELECT substr( 'oracle pl/sql cheatsheet', 15) FROM dual;
&lt;/source&gt;
:returns &quot;&lt;tt&gt;cheatsheet&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; since &quot;c&quot; is in the 15th position in the string and &quot;t&quot; is the last character in the string.'''
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT substr('oracle pl/sql cheatsheet', -10, 5) FROM dual;
&lt;/source&gt;
:returns &quot;&lt;tt&gt;cheat&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; since &quot;c&quot; is the 10th character in the string, counting from the ''end'' of the string with &quot;t&quot; as position 1.

====Trim====
These functions can be used to filter unwanted characters from strings.  By default they remove spaces, but a character set can be specified for removal as well.

 trim ( [ leading | trailing | both ] [ trim-char ] from string-to-be-trimmed );
 trim ('   removing spaces at both sides     ');
 '''this returns &quot;removing spaces at both sides&quot;'''
 
 ltrim ( string-to-be-trimmed [, trimming-char-set ] );
 ltrim ('   removing spaces at the left side     ');
 '''this returns &quot;removing spaces at the left side     &quot;'''
 
 rtrim ( string-to-be-trimmed [, trimming-char-set ] );
 rtrim ('   removing spaces at the right side     ');
 '''this returns &quot;   removing spaces at the right side&quot;'''

==DDL SQL==
===Tables===
====Create table====
'''The syntax to create a table is:'''
 CREATE TABLE [table name]
       ( [column name] [datatype], ... );
'''For example:'''
 CREATE TABLE employee
       (id int, name varchar(20));

====Add column====
'''The syntax to add a column is:'''
 ALTER TABLE [table name]
       ADD ( [column name] [datatype], ... );
'''For example:'''
 ALTER TABLE employee
       ADD (id int)

====Modify column====
'''The syntax to modify a column is:'''
 ALTER TABLE [table name]
       MODIFY ( [column name] [new datatype] );

'''ALTER table syntax and examples:'''

'''For example:'''
 ALTER TABLE employee
       MODIFY( sickHours s float );

====Drop column====
'''The syntax to drop a column is:'''
 ALTER TABLE [table name]
       DROP COLUMN [column name];
'''For example:'''
 ALTER TABLE employee
       DROP COLUMN vacationPay;

=====Displaying constraints=====
'''The following statement shows all constraints in the system:'''
 SELECT
 	table_name,
 	constraint_name,
 	constraint_type
 FROM user_constraints;

=====Selecting referential constraints=====
'''The following statement shows all referential constraints (foreign keys) with both source and destination table/column couples:'''
 SELECT
 	c_list.CONSTRAINT_NAME as NAME,
 	c_src.TABLE_NAME as SRC_TABLE,
 	c_src.COLUMN_NAME as SRC_COLUMN,
 	c_dest.TABLE_NAME as DEST_TABLE,
 	c_dest.COLUMN_NAME as DEST_COLUMN
 FROM ALL_CONSTRAINTS c_list,

          c_src.COLUMN_NAME,
          c_dest.TABLE_NAME,
          c_dest.COLUMN_NAME;

=====Setting constraints on a table=====
'''The syntax for creating a check constraint using a CREATE TABLE statement is:'''

 CREATE TABLE table_name
 (
     column1 datatype null/not null,
     column2 datatype null/not null,
     ...
     CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK (column_name condition) [DISABLE]
 );

'''For example:'''

 CREATE TABLE suppliers
 (
     supplier_id  numeric(4),  
     supplier_name  varchar2(50),  
     CONSTRAINT check_supplier_id
     CHECK (supplier_id BETWEEN 100 and 9999)
 );

=====Unique Index on a table=====

'''The syntax for creating a unique constraint using a CREATE TABLE statement is:'''

 CREATE TABLE table_name
 (
     column1 datatype null/not null,
     column2 datatype null/not null,
     ...
     CONSTRAINT constraint_name UNIQUE (column1, column2, column_n)
 );

'''For example:'''

 CREATE TABLE customer
 (
     id   integer not null,
     name varchar2(20),
     CONSTRAINT customer_id_constraint UNIQUE (id)
 );

=====Adding unique constraints=====

'''The syntax for a unique constraint is:'''

 ALTER TABLE [table name]
       ADD CONSTRAINT [constraint name] UNIQUE( [column name] ) USING INDEX [index name];

'''For example:'''

 ALTER TABLE employee
       ADD CONSTRAINT uniqueEmployeeId UNIQUE(employeeId) USING INDEX ourcompanyIndx_tbs;

=====Deleting constraints=====
'''The syntax for dropping (removing) a constraint is:'''

 ALTER TABLE [table name]
       DROP CONSTRAINT [constraint name];

'''For example:'''
 ALTER TABLE employee
       DROP CONSTRAINT uniqueEmployeeId;

'''See also:''' [http://www.psoug.org/reference/constraints.html Oracle Constraints]

===INDEXES===
An index is a method that retrieves records with greater efficiency. An index creates an entry for each value that appears in the indexed columns. By default, Oracle creates [[w:B-Tree|B-tree]] indexes.

====Create an index====

'''The syntax for creating an index is:'''

 CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name
     ON table_name (column1, column2, . column_n)
     [ COMPUTE STATISTICS ];

'''UNIQUE''' indicates that the combination of values in the indexed columns must be unique.

'''COMPUTE STATISTICS''' tells Oracle to collect statistics during the creation of the index. The statistics are then used by the optimizer to choose an optimal execution plan when the statements are executed.

'''For example:'''

 CREATE INDEX customer_idx
     ON customer (customer_name);

In this example, an index has been created on the customer table called customer_idx. It consists of only of the customer_name field.

'''The following creates an index with more than one field:'''

 CREATE INDEX customer_idx
     ON supplier (customer_name, country);

'''The following collects statistics upon creation of the index:'''

 CREATE INDEX customer_idx
     ON supplier (customer_name, country)
     COMPUTE STATISTICS;

====Create a function-based index====   
In Oracle, you are not restricted to creating indexes on only columns. You can create function-based indexes.

'''The syntax that creates a function-based index is:'''

 CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name
     ON table_name (function1, function2, . function_n)
     [ COMPUTE STATISTICS ];

'''For example:'''

 CREATE INDEX customer_idx
     ON customer (UPPER(customer_name));

An index, based on the uppercase evaluation of the customer_name field, has been created.

To assure that the Oracle optimizer uses this index when executing your SQL statements, be sure that UPPER(customer_name) does not evaluate to a NULL value. To ensure this, add UPPER(customer_name) IS NOT NULL to your '''WHERE''' clause as follows:

 SELECT customer_id, customer_name, UPPER(customer_name)
 FROM customer
 WHERE UPPER(customer_name) IS NOT NULL
 ORDER BY UPPER(customer_name);

====Rename an Index====

'''The syntax for renaming an index is:'''

 ALTER INDEX index_name
     RENAME TO new_index_name;

'''For example:'''

 ALTER INDEX customer_id
     RENAME TO new_customer_id;

In this example, '''customer_id''' is renamed to '''new_customer_id'''.

====Collect statistics on an index====   

If you need to collect statistics on the index after it is first created or you want to update the statistics, you can always use the '''ALTER INDEX''' command to collect statistics. You collect statistics so that oracle can use the indexes in an effective manner. This recalcultes the table size, number of rows, blocks, segments and update the dictionary tables so that oracle can use the data effectively while choosing the execution plan.

'''The syntax for collecting statistics on an index is:'''

 ALTER INDEX index_name
     REBUILD COMPUTE STATISTICS;

'''For example:'''

 ALTER INDEX customer_idx
     REBUILD COMPUTE STATISTICS;

In this example, statistics are collected for the index called '''customer_idx'''.

====Drop an index==== 
'''The syntax for dropping an index is:'''

    DROP INDEX index_name;

'''For example:'''

    DROP INDEX customer_idx;

In this example, the '''customer_idx''' is dropped.

==DBA Related==

===User Management===

====Creating a user====
gg{{FULLPAGENAME}}
'''The syntax for creating a user is:'''

    CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY password;

'''For example:'''

    CREATE USER brian IDENTIFIED BY brianpass;

====Granting privileges====

'''The syntax for granting privileges is:'''

    GRANT privilege TO Gulfnet_krishna(user);

'''For example:'''

    GRANT dba TO brian;

====Change password====

'''The syntax for changing user password is:'''

    ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY password;

'''For example:'''

    ALTER USER brian IDENTIFIED BY brianpassword;

===Importing and exporting===

There are two methods of backing up and restoring database tables and data.  The 'exp' and 'imp' tools are simpler tools geared towards smaller databases.  If database structures become more complex or are very large ( &gt; 50 GB for example) then using the RMAN tool is more appropriate.

====Import a dump file using IMP====

This command is used to import Oracle tables and table data from a *.dmp file created by the 'exp' tool.  Remember that this a command that is executed from the command line through $ORACLE_HOME/bin and not within SQL*Plus.

'''The syntax for importing a dump file is:'''

    imp KEYWORD=value

There are number of parameters you can use for keywords.

'''To view all the keywords:'''

    imp HELP=yes

'''An example:'''

    imp brian/brianpassword FILE=mydump.dmp FULL=yes

==PL/SQL==
===Operators===        
(incomplete)
====Arithmetic operators====
* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Division: /
* Power (PL/SQL only): **

=====Examples=====
gives all employees from customer id 5 a 5% raise
 UPDATE employee SET salary = salary * 1.05
                   WHERE customer_id = 5;

determines the after tax wage for all employees
 SELECT wage - tax FROM employee;

====Comparison operators====
* Greater Than: &gt;
* Greater Than or Equal To: &gt;=
* Less Than: &lt;
* Less Than or Equal to: &lt;=
* Equivalence: =
* Inequality: !=  ^=  &lt;&gt;  ¬= (depends on platform)

=====Examples=====
 SELECT name, salary, email FROM employees WHERE salary &gt; 40000;
 
 SELECT name FROM customers WHERE customer_id &lt; 6;

====String operators====
* Concatenate: ||
create or replace procedure addtest( 
a in varchar2(100), 
b in varchar2(100), c out varchar2(200) 
) 
IS
begin
C:=concat(a,'-',b);

====Date operators====
* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -

===Types===
====Basic PL/SQL Types====
Scalar type (defined in package STANDARD): NUMBER, CHAR, VARCHAR2, BOOLEAN, BINARY_INTEGER, LONG\LONG RAW, DATE, TIMESTAMP(and its family including intervals)

Composite types (user-defined types): TABLE, RECORD, NESTED TABLE and VARRAY

LOB datatypes : used to store an unstructured large amount of data

==== %TYPE - anchored type variable declaration====
'''The syntax for anchored type declarations is'''
 &lt;var_name&gt; &lt;obj&gt;%type [not null][:= &lt;init-val&gt;];

'''For example'''
 name Books.title%type;   /*  name is defined as the same type as column 'title' of table  Books */
 
 commission number(5,2) := 12.5;
 
 x commission%type;   /*  x is defined as the same type as variable 'commission' */

'''Note:'''
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Anchored variables allow for the automatic synchronization of the type of anchored variable with the type of &lt;obj&gt; when there is a change to the &lt;obj&gt; type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Anchored types are evaluated at compile time, so recompile the program to reflect the change of &lt;obj&gt; type in the anchored variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

====Collections====
A collection is an ordered group of elements, all of the same type. It is a general concept that encompasses lists, arrays, and other familiar datatypes. Each element has a unique subscript that determines its position in the collection.

 --Define a PL/SQL record type representing a book:
 TYPE book_rec IS RECORD 
    (title                   book.title%TYPE,
     author                  book.author_last_name%TYPE,
     year_published          book.published_date%TYPE);
 
 --define a PL/SQL table containing entries of type book_rec:
 Type book_rec_tab IS TABLE OF book_rec%TYPE
      INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
 
 my_book_rec  book_rec%TYPE;
 my_book_rec_tab book_rec_tab%TYPE;
 ...
 my_book_rec := my_book_rec_tab(5);
 find_authors_books(my_book_rec.author);
 ...

There are many good reasons to use collections.

*  Dramatically faster execution speed, thanks to transparent performance boosts including a new optimizing compiler, better integrated native compilation, and new datatypes that help out with number-crunching applications.

* The FORALL statement, made even more flexible and useful. For example, FORALL now supports nonconsecutive indexes.

* Regular expressions are available in PL/SQL in the form of three new functions (REGEXP_INSTR, REGEXP_REPLACE, and REGEXP_SUBSTR) and the REGEXP_LIKE operator for comparisons. (For more information, see &quot;First Expressions&quot; by Jonathan Gennick in this issue.)

* Collections, improved to include such things as collection comparison for equality and support for set operations on nested tables.

===Stored logic===
====Functions====
A function must return a value to the caller.

'''The syntax for a function is'''

 CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION function_name [ (parameter [,parameter]) ]
 RETURN [return_datatype]
 IS
     [declaration_section]
 BEGIN
     executable_section
     return [return_value]
 
     [EXCEPTION
         exception_section]
 END [function_name];

'''For example:'''
 CREATE OR REPLACE  FUNCTION to_date_check_null(dateString IN VARCHAR2, dateFormat IN VARCHAR2) 
 RETURN DATE IS
 BEGIN 
     IF dateString IS NULL THEN
         return NULL;
     ELSE
         return to_date(dateString, dateFormat);
     END IF;
 END;

====Procedures====
A procedure differs from a function in that it must not return a value to the caller.

'''The syntax for a procedure is:'''

 CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name [ (parameter [,parameter]) ]
 IS
     [declaration_section]
 BEGIN
     executable_section
     [EXCEPTION
         exception_section]
 END [procedure_name];

When you create a procedure or function, you may define parameters. There are three types of parameters that can be declared:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; '''IN''' - The parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function. The value of the parameter can not be overwritten by the procedure or function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; '''OUT''' - The parameter can not be referenced by the procedure or function, but the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; '''IN OUT''' - The parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function and the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Also you can declare a '''DEFAULT''' value;
 CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name [ (parameter [IN|OUT|IN OUT] [DEFAULT ''value''] [,parameter]) ]

'''The following is a simple example of a procedure:'''
 
    /* purpose: shows the students in the course specified by courseId */
  
    CREATE OR REPLACE Procedure GetNumberOfStudents
       ( courseId IN number, numberOfStudents OUT number )
    IS
 
        /* although there are better ways to compute the number of students, 
           this is a good opportunity to show a cursor in action            */
 
        cursor student_cur is
        select studentId, studentName
            from course
            where course.courseId = courseId;
        student_rec    student_cur%ROWTYPE;
 
    BEGIN
        OPEN student_cur;
        LOOP
            FETCH student_cur INTO student_rec;
            EXIT WHEN student_cur%NOTFOUND;
            numberOfStudents := numberOfStudents + 1;
        END LOOP;
        CLOSE student_cur;
 
    EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
          raise_application_error(-20001,'An error was encountered - '||SQLCODE||' -ERROR- '||SQLERRM);
    END GetNumberOfStudents;

====anonymous block====

 DECLARE 
  x NUMBER(4) := 0;
 BEGIN
   x := 1000;
   BEGIN
     x := x + 100;
   EXCEPTION
     WHEN OTHERS THEN
       x := x + 2;
   END;
   x := x + 10;
   dbms_output.put_line(x);
 EXCEPTION
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
     x := x + 3;
 END;

====Passing parameters to stored logic====
There are three basic syntaxes for passing parameters to a stored procedure: positional notation, named notation and mixed notation.

The following examples call this procedure for each of the basic syntaxes for parameter passing:
 CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE create_customer( p_name IN varchar2, 
                                              p_id IN number, 
                                              p_address IN varchar2, 
                                              p_phone IN varchar2 ) IS
 BEGIN
     INSERT INTO customer ( name, id, address, phone )
     VALUES ( p_name, p_id, p_address, p_phone );
 END create_customer;

=====Positional notation=====
Specify the same parameters in the same order as they are declared in the procedure.  This notation is compact, but if you specify the parameters (especially literals) in the wrong order, the bug can be hard to detect. You must change your code if the procedure's parameter list changes.

 create_customer('James Whitfield', 33, '301 Anystreet', '251-222-3154');

=====Named notation=====
Specify the name of each parameter along with its value. An arrow (=&gt;) serves as the association operator. The order of the parameters is not significant.  This notation is more verbose, but makes your code easier to read and maintain. You can sometimes avoid changing code if the procedure's parameter list changes, for example if the parameters are reordered or a new optional parameter is added. Named notation is a good practice to use for any code that calls someone else's API, or defines an API for someone else to use.

 create_customer(p_address =&gt; '301 Anystreet', p_id =&gt; 33, p_name =&gt; 'James Whitfield', p_phone =&gt; '251-222-3154');

=====Mixed notation=====
Specify the first parameters with positional notation, then switch to named notation for the last parameters.  You can use this notation to call procedures that have some required parameters, followed by some optional parameters.

 create_customer(v_name, v_id, p_address=&gt; '301 Anystreet', p_phone =&gt; '251-222-3154');

====Table functions====

 CREATE TYPE object_row_type as OBJECT (
   object_type VARCHAR(18),
   object_name VARCHAR(30)
 );
 
 CREATE TYPE object_table_type as TABLE OF object_row_type;
 
 CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_all_objects 
   RETURN object_table_type PIPELINED AS
 BEGIN
     FOR cur IN (SELECT * FROM all_objects)
     LOOP
       PIPE ROW(object_row_type(cur.object_type, cur.object_name));   
     END LOOP; 
     RETURN;
 END;
 
 SELECT * FROM TABLE(get_all_objects);

===Flow control===
=====Conditional Operators=====
* and: AND
* or: OR
* not: NOT

=====Example=====
IF salary &gt; 40000 AND salary  &lt;= 70000 
THEN()
ELSE IF salary&gt;70000 AND salary&lt;=100000
THEN()
ELSE()

====If/then/else====
 IF [condition] THEN
     [statements]
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSEIF [condition] THEN
     [statements}
 ELSE
     [statements}
 END IF;

===Arrays===
=====Associative arrays=====
* Strongly typed arrays, useful as in-memory tables

=====Example=====
* Very simple example, the index is the key to accessing the array so there is no need to loop through the whole table unless you intend to use data from every line of the array.
* The index can also be a numeric value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
DECLARE
    -- Associative array indexed by string:

    -- Associative array type
    TYPE population IS TABLE OF NUMBER
        INDEX BY VARCHAR2(64);
    -- Associative array variable
    city_population  population;
    i                VARCHAR2(64);
BEGIN
    -- Add new elements to associative array:
    city_population('Smallville')  := 2000;
    city_population('Midland')     := 750000;
    city_population('Megalopolis') := 1000000;

    -- Change value associated with key 'Smallville':
    city_population('Smallville') := 2001;

    -- Print associative array by looping through it:
    i := city_population.FIRST;

    WHILE i IS NOT NULL LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE
            ('Population of ' || i || ' is ' || TO_CHAR(city_population(i)));
        i := city_population.NEXT(i);
    END LOOP;

    -- Print selected value from a associative array:
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Selected value');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Population of 
END;
/

-- Printed results:
Population of Megalopolis is 1000000
Population of Midland is 750000
Population of Smallville is 2001
&lt;/source&gt;

* More complex example, using a record

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
DECLARE
    -- Record type
    TYPE apollo_rec IS RECORD
    (
        commander   VARCHAR2(100),
        launch      DATE
    );
    -- Associative array type
    TYPE apollo_type_arr IS TABLE OF apollo_rec INDEX BY VARCHAR2(100);
    -- Associative array variable
    apollo_arr apollo_type_arr;
BEGIN
    apollo_arr('Apollo 11').commander := 'Neil Armstrong';
    apollo_arr('Apollo 11').launch :=   TO_DATE('July 16, 1969','Month dd, yyyy');
    apollo_arr('Apollo 12').commander := 'Pete Conrad';
    apollo_arr('Apollo 12').launch :=   TO_DATE('November 14, 1969','Month dd, yyyy');
    apollo_arr('Apollo 13').commander := 'James Lovell';
    apollo_arr('Apollo 13').launch :=   TO_DATE('April 11, 1970','Month dd, yyyy');
    apollo_arr('Apollo 14').commander := 'Alan Shepard';
    apollo_arr('Apollo 14').launch :=   TO_DATE('January 31, 1971','Month dd, yyyy'); 

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(apollo_arr('Apollo 11').commander);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(apollo_arr('Apollo 11').launch);
end;
/

-- Printed results:
Neil Armstrong
16-JUL-69
&lt;/source&gt;

Shocking as it might seem to some people, the twelve tones you find in an octave on the piano don't actually reflect anything but an approximation of a certain selection of tones, that for some reason during the last 300 years became the backbone of western music.

There is nothing inherently natural about the 12 tone system, and it is a mistake to think that music only can be made in it, or using parts of it (like major and minor scales, or pentatonic scales). In fact, a culture won't develop the 'intonation' that we use until it has figured out quite a bit about how frequencies work, and a certain bit of math. The Chinese are as far as I know the only culture out of Europe to have developed the same scale, and they did it way before us, but didn't use it as extensively. I will explain why, eventually.

In the world, there are several different systems with all kinds of foreign tunings: Indian and Arabic which come quite close to having an additional step between our semitones, Thai which comes quite close to having seven equal steps to the octave, Balinese scales, which have somewhat unequal steps with a twist. But more on those, and the whys and hows of them.

If you want to write songs for your conculture, yet maintain a certain depth and uniqueness, copying the western system may not be a good idea. If you must use our scale, then it's possible to use chords in unusual ways or even constructing unusual chords. 

If you are interested in a truly strange scale, take a look at [http://web.archive.org/19991021225909/members.aol.com/bpsite/ this] site which describes the Bohlen Pierce 13 note scale, which is very different from any scale attested in any culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;font size=3&gt;'''Tcl and ADP Reference'''&lt;/font&gt;

This is a reference for using Tcl with ADP pages, for people setting up a site with the ArsDigita Community System (see [[w:OpenACS|OpenACS]] for details).  The first half is just a Tcl overview; the second half deals with .adp pages, custom tags, and AOLServer resources and parameters.

==Tcl Overview==
===Basic Tcl Language Features===
&lt;tt&gt;
'''; or newline''' statement separator
&lt;br&gt;'''\''' statement continuation if last character in line
&lt;br&gt;'''#''' comment out rest of line (if 1st non−whitespace char)
&lt;br&gt;'''var''' simple variable
&lt;br&gt;'''var(index)''' associative array variable
&lt;br&gt;'''var(i,j)''' multidimensional associative array variable
&lt;br&gt;'''$var''' variable substitution (also ${var}xyz)
&lt;br&gt;'''[expr 1+2]''' command substitution
&lt;br&gt;'''\char''' backslash substitution
&lt;br&gt;'''&quot;hello $a&quot;''' quoting with substitution
&lt;br&gt;'''{hello $a}''' quoting with no subst (deferred substitution)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''The only datatype in Tcl is a string. Some commands interpret arguments as numbers/booleans; those formats are:'''
&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;'''Integer''': 12 0xff(hex) 0377(octal)
&lt;br&gt;'''Floating Pt''': 2.1 3. 6e4 7.91e+16
&lt;br&gt;'''Boolean''': true false 0 1 yes no
&lt;/tt&gt;

===Backslash Substitutions===
&lt;tt&gt;
'''\a''' audible alert (0x7)
&lt;br&gt;'''\b''' backspace (0x8)
&lt;br&gt;'''\f''' form feed (0xC)
&lt;br&gt;'''\n''' newline (0xA)
&lt;br&gt;'''\r''' carriage return (0xD)
&lt;br&gt;'''\t''' horizontal tab (0x9)
&lt;br&gt;'''\v''' vertical tab (0xB)
&lt;br&gt;'''\space''' space
&lt;br&gt;'''\newline''' space
&lt;br&gt;'''\ddd''' octal value (d=0−7)
&lt;br&gt;'''\xdd''' hex value (d=0−9,a−f)
&lt;br&gt;'''\c''' replace ’\c’ with ’c’
&lt;br&gt;'''\\''' backslash
&lt;/tt&gt;

===Operators and Math Functions===
''The '''expr''' command recognizes these operators, in decreasing order
of precedence:''
&lt;pre&gt;
− ~ ! unary minus, bitwise NOT, logical NOT
* / % multiply, divide, remainder
+ − add, subtract
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; bitwise shift left, bitwise shift right
&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= boolean comparisons
== != boolean equals, not equals
&amp; bitwise AND
^ bitwise exclusive OR
| bitwise inclusive OR
&amp;&amp; logical AND
|| logical OR
x ? y : z if x != 0, then y, else z
&lt;/pre&gt;
''All operators support integers. All support floating point except :
&lt;tt&gt;~, %, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, %, ^, and |&lt;/tt&gt;.
Boolean operators can also be used for string operands, in which
case string comparison will be used. This occurs if any of the
operands are not valid numbers. The following operators have
&quot;lazy evaluation&quot; as in C:''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;'''&amp;&amp;, ||, ?:'''&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''The expr command recognizes the following math functions:''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;abs hypot int double floor ceil fmod round
&lt;br&gt;cos sin tan acos asin atan atan2 cosh sinh tanh
&lt;br&gt;log log10 exp pow sqrt'''
&lt;/tt&gt;

===Regular Expressions===
&lt;pre&gt;
regex | regex match either expression
regex* match zero or more of regex
regex+ match one or more of regex
regex? Match zero or one of regex
. any single character except newline
^ match beginning of string
$ match end of string
\c match character c
c match character c
[abc] match set of characters
[^abc] match characters not in set
[a−z] match range of characters
[^a−z] match characters not in range
( ) group expressions&lt;/pre&gt;

===Pattern Globbing===
&lt;pre&gt;? match any single character
* match zero or more characters
[abc] match set of characters
[a−z] match range of characters
\c match character c
{a,b,...} match any of string a, b, etc.
~ home directory (for glob command)
~user match user’s home directory (for glob command)
Note: for the glob command, a &quot;.&quot; at the beginning of a file’s
name or just after &quot;/&quot; must be matched explicitly and all &quot;/&quot;
characters must be matched explicitly.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Control Flow===
&lt;pre&gt;
break
Abort innermost containing loop command
case
Obsolete, see switch
continue
Skip to next iteration of innermost containing loop.
exit[returnCode]
Terminate the process, return returnCode (an integer which
defaults to 0) to the system as the exit status.
for start test next body
Looping command where start, next, and body are Tcl command
strings and test is an expression string to be passed to expr
command.
foreach varname list body
The Tcl command string body is evaluated for each item in the
string list where the variable varname is set to the item’s value.
if expr1 [then] body1 [elseif expr2 [then] body2...] [[else] bodyN]
If expression string expr1 evaluates true, Tcl command string
body1 is evaluated. Otherwise if expr2 is true, body2 is
evaluated, and so on. If none of the expressions evaluate to
true, then bodyN is executed.
return [−code code] [−errorinfo info] [−errorcode code] [string]
Return immediately from current procedure with string as return
value.
switch [options] string pattern1 body1 [ pattern2 body2 ...]
The string argument is matched against each of the pattern
arguments in order. As soon as it finds a pattern that matches
string, it evaluates the corresponding Tcl command string body. If
no match is found and the last pattern is the keyword default, its
command string is evaluated
while test body
Evaluates the Tcl command string body as long as expression string
test evaluates to true.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Lists===
Note: list indices start at 0 and the word end may be used to
reference the last element in the list.
&lt;pre&gt;
concat [arg arg ...]
Returns concatenation of each string
join list [joinString]
Returns string created by joining all elements of list with
joinString.
lappend varName [value value ...]
Appends each value to the end of the list stored in varName.
lindex list index
Returns value of element at index in list.
linsert list index element [element ...]
Returns new list formed by using each arg as an element.
llength list
Returns number of elements in list.
lrange list first last
Returns new list from slice of list at indices first through last
inclusive.
lsearch [mode] list pattern
Returns index of first element in list that matches pattern (−1
for no match). Mode may be −exact, −glob(default) or −regexp.
lsort [switches] list
Returns new list formed by sorting list according to switches.
These are:
−ascii string comparison (default)
−integer integer comparisons
−real floating−point comparisons
−increasing sort in increasing order (default)
−decreasing sort in decreasing order
−command cmd Use command which takes two arguments and returns
an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero.
split string [splitChars]
Returns a list formed by splitting string at each character in
splitChars.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Strings===
&lt;pre&gt;
append varName [value value ...]
Appends each of the given values to the string stored in varName.

format formatString [arg arg ...]
Returns a formatted string generated in the ANSI C sprintf manner.

regexp [switches] exp string [matchVar] [subMatchVar ...]
Returns 1 if the regular expression exp matches part or all of
string, 0 otherwise. If specified, matchVar will be wet to all
the characters in the match and the following subMatchVar’s will
be set to matched parenthesized subexpressions. The −nocase
switch can be specified to ignore case in matching. The −indices
switch can be specified so that matchVar and subMatchVar will be
set to the start and ending indice3s in string of their
corresponding match.

regsub [switches] exp string subSpec varName
Replaces the first portion of string that matches the regular
expression exp with subSpec and places results in varName. Returns
count of number of replacements made. The −nocase switch can be
specified to ignore case in matching. The −all switch will cause
all matches to be substituted for.

scan string formatString varName [varName ...]
Extracts values into given variables using ANSI C sscanf behavior.
string compare string1 string2
Return −1, 0, or 1, depending on whether string1 is
lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than string2.
string first string1 string2
Return index in string2 of first occurrence of string1 (−1 if not
found).

string index string charIndex
Returns the charIndex’th character in string.

string last string1 string2
Return index in string2 of last occurrence of string1 (−1 if not
found).

string length string
Returns number of characters in string.

string match pattern string
Returns 1 if glob pattern matches string, 0 otherwise.

string range string first last
Returns characters from string at indices first through last
inclusive.

string tolower string
Returns new string formed by converting all chars in string to
lower case.

string toupper string
Returns new string formed by converting all chars in string to
upper case.

string trim string [chars]
Returns new string formed by removing from string any leading or
trailing characters present in the set chars.

string trimleft string [chars]
Same as string trim for leading characters only.

string trimright string [chars]
Same as string trim for trailing characters only.

string wordend string index
Returns index of character just after last one in word at index in
string.

string wordstart string index
Returns index of first character of word at index in string.

subst [−nobackslashes] [−nocommands] [−novariables] string
Returns result of backslash, command, and variable substitutions
on string. Each may be turned off by switch.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==The Tcl &lt;--&gt; ADP interface==

===Including TCL code in ADP pages===
''Inline replacement:''
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;%= tcl code that evaluates to the text you want embedded %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

''State changing Code:''
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;% tcl commands to change tcl environment
(set vars, do db queries, etc) %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

''Example:''
&lt;tt&gt;Two plus two is &lt;%= [expr 2+2] %&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

===Defining custom tags===
&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
ns_register_adptag &quot;codeexample&quot; &quot;/codeexample&quot; tcl_adp_codeexample

proc tcl_adp_codeexample {string tagset} {
return &quot;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;${string}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Using AOLServer Parameters===
&lt;pre&gt;[ad_parameter UsersCanCreateRoomsP chat]&lt;/pre&gt;

===Resourcing tcl in AOLserver===
''source−file.tcl − to source a particular file.''
&lt;pre&gt;
set_the_usual_form_variables
ns_eval [list source $file]
ns_return 200 text/html ok
wget −O − &quot;http://localhost:8000/source−
file.tcl?file=/web/server1/tcl/myfile.tcl&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
''Note: this does not work for registered tag changes.
To cause a reload of everything:''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;%
set dir [ns_info tcllib]
set list [exec ls $dir]
foreach file $list {
source $dir/$file
ns_puts &quot;sourced: $file
&quot;}%&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Using ns_set===
''When one queries a database, the variable that is set is an ns_set:''
&lt;pre&gt;
# ask AOLserver to give us a database connection
set db [ns_db gethandle]
set sql_query &quot;select first_names, last_name
from users
where user_id = $user_id&quot;
# actually send the query to the RDBMS; tell AOLserver we
# expect exactly one row back
set selection [ns_db 1row $db $sql_query]
&lt;pre&gt;
''Getting information out of an ns_set:''
&lt;pre&gt;
set first_names [ns_set get $selection &quot;first_names&quot;]
set last_name [ns_set get $selection &quot;last_name&quot;]
ns_return 200 text/plain &quot;User #$user_id is $first_names $last_name&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Dealing with Form Variables===
''Importing form variables into a tcl or adp page''
&lt;tt&gt;set_the_usual_form_variables&lt;/tt&gt;
''Manipulating Forms Directly:''
&lt;tt&gt;ns_getform&lt;/tt&gt;

===Decode===
''Do logic w/o breaking out of an ns_write. Just like SQL !''
&lt;tt&gt;[util_decode unknown val1 res1 val2 res2 valN resN defaultresult]&lt;/tt&gt;

===Dealing With .ini file Parameters===
''ad_parameter''
&lt;tt&gt;ad_parameter name { subsection &quot;&quot; } { default &quot;&quot; }&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Returns the value of a configuration parameter set in one of the .ini files in
/web/yourdomain/parameters. If the parameter doesn’t exist, returns the
default specified as the third argument (or empty string if not default is
specified). Note that AOLserver reads these files when the server starts up and
stores parameters in an in−memory hash table. The plus side of this is that
there is no hit to the file system and no need to memoize a call to
ad_parameter. The minus side is that you have to restart the server if you
want to test a change made to the .ini file.&lt;/pre&gt;
''ad_parameter_section''
&lt;tt&gt;ad_parameter_section { subsection &quot;&quot; }&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Returns all the vars in a parameter section as an ns_set. Relies on
undocumented AOLserver Tcl API call ns_configsection (analogous C API
call is documented). Differs from the API call in that it returns an empty
ns_set if the parameter section does not exist.&lt;/pre&gt;















===Converting tcl to adp===
''inclusion of sub−files''
&lt;pre&gt;
# Source user−new.adp. We would redirect to it, but we don’t want
# the password exposed!
# source &quot;[ns_url2file &quot;/register/user−new.tcl&quot;]&quot;
# return
ns_adp_include user−new.adp
ns_adp_break
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you look at any natural language you will quickly find that its grammar is not completely regular. Almost any language will have some words that don't fit in to the usual pattern. Adding irregularities to your conlang is a must if you want it to feel more 'naturalistic'.

== Types of irregularities ==

Despite their name, most kinds of irregularities can be classed into groups.

=== Sound change ===

''You should be familiar with sound changes from previous chapters ([[../History|History]] and [[../History/Common sound changes|Common sound changes]]).  This section aims to show how well-chosen sound changes can affect the regularity of a conlang.''

This is probably the most common cause of irregularities.  Sound changes cause irregularities by changing a word differently depending on what form it is in.  For example, if you have a noun '''ono''' and its plural is formed by suffixing a '''t''' to the end then you have a perfectly regular relationship.

 ono &gt; onot

However, if you make a sound change rule which states that '''o''' becomes '''u''' at the end of a word, then the relationship is no longer so obvious because the '''o''' changes into a '''u''' in the singular but doesn't in the plural because the '''o''' is no longer at the end of the word. 

 onu &gt; onot

Using the right sound changes for your conlang is a good way of adding irregularity to it.

=== Suppletion ===

Suppletion is a slightly rarer phenomenon so if you decide to use it in your conlang then you should do so sparingly. But, of course, before you can use it, you need to know what it is:

Suppletion is when a completely separate word replaces one part of a paradigm. For example, the English word ''went'' is completely unrelated (etymologically speaking) to ''go''. ''Went'' is actually the past tense of a mostly forgotten verb ''wend'' which means more or less the same thing as ''go''. Because the verbs came to mean roughly the same thing, most people stopped using ''wend'' and used ''go'' instead. However, the past tense of ''wend'' survived and was used as the past tense of ''go''.

Thus instead of the paradigm ''go/goes'', ''is going'', ''&quot;goed&quot;'' (''ging''), ''has/have gone'', we now have ''go/goes'', ''is going'', ''went'', ''has/have gone''. Suppletion also affected the English verb ''to be'' (''am/is/are'', ''am/is/are being'', ''was/were'', ''has/have been'').

Okay start, but we really need to sort this out into a more regular format. That is, figure out how to get this information in more of a 'guide' format. -- [[User:Maknas|Maknas]] 16:27, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I've created a draft version but I'm not sure about it. The sound change example would be better if it used a natlang but I couldn't think of a natural example that was simple enough. The original version is available in the history [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Conlang:_Intermediate_Irregularities&amp;oldid=49236] should anyone need to refer to it. --[[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 19:43, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

In Digital circuits there are two parts one is Digital the other is circuits. 

Digital 
: means a description of system which operates on digits or numbers. 
: The numbers that a digital system operates upon are binary numbers.One binary digit just have two values '0' and '1'. This '0' or '1' are analogous to 'off' and 'on', 'false' and 'true', etc. The Binary digIT is known as 'bit'. In day to day activities we use numbers and every digit of that number can be between 0 - 9. We use combination of such digital to for numbers bigger than 9. Similarly we can use combination of bits, i.e. combination of 1 &amp; 0, to form bigger binary numbers.

Circuit can be any electric circuit and Digital circuit is a circuit which is designed to implement the description of digital circuit.  

Digital circuits are developed using a special type of mathematics called 'Boolean Algebra'.

JavaScript is an interpreted computer programming language formalized in the ECMAScript language standard. JavaScript engines interpret and execute JavaScript. JavaScript engines may be designed for use as standalone interpretors, embedding in applications, or both. The first JavaScript engine was created by Netscape for embedding in their Web browser. V8 is a JavaScript engine created for use in Google Chrome and may also be used as a standalone interpretor. Adobe Flash uses a JavaScript engine called ActionScript for development of Flash programs.

===Relation to Java===
JavaScript has no relation to Java aside from having a C-like syntax. Netscape developed JavaScript, and Sun Microsystems developed Java. The rest of this section assumes a background in programming. You may skip to the next section, if you like.

Variables have a static type (integer or string for example) that remains the same during the lifespan of a running program in Java, and have a dynamic type (Number or String for example) that can change during the lifespan of a running program in JavaScript. Variables must be declared prior to use in Java, and have a &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; value when referred to prior to assignment in JavaScript.

Java has an extensive collection of libraries that can be imported for use in programs. JavaScript does not provide any means to import libraries or external JavaScript code. JavaScript engines must extend the JavaScript language beyond the ECMAScript language standard, if additional functionality is desired, such as the required functionality provided by V8, or the Document Object Model found in many Web browsers.

Java includes classes and object instances, and JavaScript uses prototypes.

== The {{HTML:element|script}} element ==
All JavaScript, when placed in an HTML document, needs to be within a {{HTML:element|script}} element. A {{HTML:element|script}} element is used to link to an external JavaScript file, or to contain inline scripting (script snippets in the HTML file). A {{HTML:element|script}} element to link to an external JavaScript file looks like:

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

while a {{HTML:element|script}} element that contains inline JavaScript looks like:

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  // JavaScript code here
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Inline scripting has the advantage that both your HTML and your JavaScript are in one file, which is convenient for quick development and testing. Having your JavaScript in a separate file is recommended for JavaScript functions that can potentially be used in more than one page, and also to separate content from behaviour.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Talk through new HTML5 specification.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Scripting language ===
The {{HTML:element|script}} element will work in most browsers, because JavaScript is currently the default scripting language. It is strongly recommended though to specify what type of script you are using in case the default scripting language changes.

The scripting language can be specified individually in the {{HTML:element|script}} element itself, and you may also use a meta tag in the head of the document to specify a default scripting language for the entire page.

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Script-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/javascript&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

While the &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt; was formally obsoleted in April 2006 by [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt RFC 4329] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt RFC 4329]: Scripting Media Types&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of &lt;code&gt;application/javascript&lt;/code&gt;, it is still preferable to continue using &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt; due to old HTML validators and old Web browsers such as Internet Explorer 5 that are unable to understand &lt;code&gt;application/javascript&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=338278 &quot;application/javascript&quot; and &quot;application/ecmasscript&quot; media types not recognized.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inline JavaScript ==
Using inline JavaScript allows you to easily work with HTML and JavaScript within the same page. This is commonly used for temporarily testing out some ideas, and in situations where the script code is specific to that one page.

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  // JavaScript code here
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Inline HTML comment markers ===
The inline HTML comments are to prevent older browsers that do not understand the {{HTML:element|script}} element from displaying the script code in plain text.

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--
  // JavaScript code here
  // --&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Older browsers that do not understand the {{HTML:element|script}} element will interpret the entire content of the {{HTML:element|script}} element above as one single HTML comment, beginning with &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and ending with &quot;&lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, effectively ignoring the script completely. If the HTML comment was not there, the entire script would be displayed in plain text to the user by these browsers.

Current browsers that know about the {{HTML:element|script}} element will ignore the ''first'' line of a {{HTML:element|script}} element, if it starts with &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. In the above case, the first line of the actual JavaScript code is therefore the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;// JavaScript code here&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

The last line of the script, &quot;&lt;code&gt;// --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, is a one line JavaScript comment that prevents the HTML end comment tag &quot;&lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; from being interpreted as JavaScript.

The use of comment markers is rarely required nowadays, as the browsers that do not recognise the {{HTML:element|script}} element are virtually non-existent. These early browsers were Mosaic, Netscape 1, and Internet Explorer 2. From Netscape 2.0 in December 1995 and Internet Explorer 3.0 in August 1996 onward, those browsers were able to interpret JavaScript.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:JavaScript#History and naming]]&lt;/ref&gt; Any modern browser that doesn't support JavaScript will still recognize the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag and not display it to the user.

=== Inline XHTML JavaScript ===
In XHTML, the method is somewhat different:

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  // &lt;![CDATA[
  // [Todo] JavaScript code here!
  // ]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that both the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[&lt;/code&gt; tags are commented out. The &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; prevents the browser from mistakenly interpreting the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[&lt;/code&gt; as a JavaScript statement (that would be a syntax error).

== Linking to external scripts ==
JavaScript is commonly stored in a file so that it may be used by many web pages on your site. This makes it much easier for updates to occur and saves space on your server. This method is recommended for [http://alistapart.com/articles/behavioralseparation separating behavior] (JavaScript) from content ((X)HTML) and it prevents the issue of incompatibility with inline comments in XHTML and HTML.

Add &lt;code&gt;src=&quot;&lt;var&gt;script.js&lt;/var&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the opening &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag. Replace &lt;var&gt;script.js&lt;/var&gt; with the path to the .js file containing the JavaScript.

Because the server provides the content type when the file is requested, specifying the type is optional when linking to external scripts. It's still advised to specify the type as &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt;, in case the server isn't set up correctly, and to prevent HTML validation complaints.

&lt;source lang=HTML4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Location of script elements ==
The &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; element may appear almost anywhere within the HTML file.

A standard location is within the {{HTML:element|head}} element. Placement within the {{HTML:element|body}} however is allowed.

&lt;source lang=HTML5&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Web page title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML code here --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are however some best practices for speeding up your web site &lt;ref&gt;Yahoo: [http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html best practices for speeding up your web site]&lt;/ref&gt; from the Yahoo! Developer Network that specify a different placement for scripts, to [http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom put scripts at the bottom], just before the &lt;code&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. This speeds up downloading, and also allows for direct manipulation of the DOM while the page is loading.

&lt;source lang=HTML5&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Web page title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML code here --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===So, what is different in these other scales?===

Except that the pianos will have different layouts for their keys, there will be certain differences:

* intervals can sound sweeter or harsher, depending on the characteristics of the scale
* intervals can be perfectly tuned, or only approximately in tune
* there can be more or less available chords
* transposing and modulation can become more or less difficult
* and of course, different scales lend themselves to different purposes
* instruments will be slightly different

However, there also is an opposite effect:

* the available instruments will affect what kind of scales are probable to evolve
* the kind of music will affect what kind of scales are probable to evolve

This is a recipe for '''Ayam goreng kuning''', the traditional fried chicken dish popular in Indonesia. As with most Indonesian poultry recipes, free-range chicken gives the best results. Cut the chicken as you would normally cut chicken for frying.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (just a little)
* [[Cookbook:Galangal|galanga]]
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* desiccated (dried) [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* fried [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]] for [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]
* cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]], for deep frying

==Directions==

# Mix all of the spices except the coconut together with a small amount of water. Use either a mortar or food processor to make a paste.
# Add the coconut to the spice paste. Do not process any longer.
# In a pot, boil the chicken along with the spice paste on low heat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook until all the water has gone.
# In a deep fryer, heat the cooking oil. When the oil is hot enough, deep fry the chicken.
# Remove the chicken and filter the cooking oil. Put the oil back in the deep fryer. Put the chicken along with all filtered spices on top of paper towels.
# After deep frying all of the chicken, put all spices left in the boiling pot into the deep fryer. IMPORTANT: make sure the spice paste is dry enough before frying. Excessive water may explode! If everything is correct, you should see brown particles in the cooking oil. Filter the oil, and sprinkle the fried spice paste on top of the chicken.

Serve with steamed rice and raw vegetables (cabbage, Chinese long beans, and sliced cucumbers). Sprinkle the fried shallot over the rice.

Description: This WordStat dictionary based on the well know Roget thesaurus categorizes 100,685 words and phrases into 1042 categories (6 broad classes).

Requirement: WordStat 4.0 (with English lemmatization option enabled) or WordStat 3.1 if the text corpus to analyze has already been lemmatized.

Limitation: This dictionary has been created using the 1911 edition of the thesaurus. Many modern words are missing. For this reason, its may not be entirely suitable for use in natural-language processing tasks. It may nevertheless be useful for experimentation as well as for the development of more comprehensive categorization systems.

LIWC Dictionary (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary)

The WordStat version of the LIWC Dictionary is currently distributed with the original LIWC 2001 software package. You can order the LIWC software directly from Lawrence Erlbaum Associates web site. The LIWC 2001 software is available in both Windows and Mac format. However, the WordStat version of the dictionary can only be used on a Windows compatible computer with the WordStat content analysis software.

Dictionary information

Description

The LIWC2001 Dictionary is composed of 2,290 words and word stems. Each word or word-stem defines one or more word categories or subdictionaries. For example, the word 'cried' is part of four word categories: sadness, negative emotion, overall affect, and a past tense verb. Hence, if it is found in the target text, each of these four subdictionary scale scores will be incremented. As in this example, many of the LIWC2001 categories are arranged hierarchically. All anger words, by definition, will be categorized as negative emotion and overall emotion words.

Each of the 74 preset LIWC2001 categories is composed of a list of dictionary words that define that scale. The table below provides a comprehensive list of the LIWC2001 dictionary categories with sample scale words, and relevant scale word counts.

The LIWC dictionary is also available Spanish and German. French, Italian and Dutch versions are currently under development. To obtain information about those versions of the LIWC, please contact James W. Pennebaker.

WordStat format

Of the 2,290 words and word stems included in the original LIWC dictionary, only one entry (e.g. LIKE) could not be included in the WordStat version because of specific disambiguation rules used . We are confident that this minor difference won't affect very much the numerical results or conclusions of a content analysis.

Dictionary information

Description - The English Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) is composed of about 3200 words and roots assigned to 29 categories of primary process cognition, 7 categories of secondary process cognition, and 7 categories of emotions.

The Regressive Imagery Dictionary (Martindale, 1975,1990) is a content analysis coding scheme designed to measure primordial vs. conceptual thinking. Conceptual thought is abstract, logical, reality oriented, and aimed at problem solving. Primordial thought is associative, concrete, and takes little account of reality. It is the type of thinking found in fantasy, reverie, and dreams. A running tally of category occurrences is kept, and final output consists of the categories and the percentage of words in a document that were assigned to each category. This output can then be subjected to statistical analyses. The Regressive Imagery Dictionary contains about 3000 words divided into twenty-nine categories designed to measure primordial content and another set of seven categories designed to measure conceptual thought, the inverse of primordial cognition. These categories were derived from the theoretical and empirical literature on regressive thought (Martindale, 1975, 1990). The rationale behind the dictionary is that psychological processes will be reflected in the content of a text. Thus, for example, the more primordial the thought involved in producing a text, the less abstract and the more drive- and sensation-oriented words it should contain. It should be noted that the view of regressive cognition upon which construction of the dictionary was based is not a narrowly psychoanalytic one but is closer to Werner's (1948) or Goldstein's views (1939). Thus, the construct that the dictionary ultimately measures might as well be called dedifferentiated thinking as regressive or primary process thinking. For these reasons, we use the terms conceptual vs. primordial thought.

The dictionary yields a measure, primordial content, derived by summing the percentage of words in a text that belong to any of the component primordial content categories. Primordial content is the sum of the categories listed under the summary categories Drive, Regressive Cognition, Perceptual Disinhibition, Sensation, and Icarian Imagery in Table 1. Generally, a better measure is obtained by subtracting percentage of words in Conceptual Content from the percentage of words in Primordial Content.

Detailed evidence concerning the reliability and validity of the Regressive Imagery Dictionary is reported elsewhere (Martindale, 1975, 1990). Evidence for the construct validity of primordial vs. conceptual content comes from studies where the measure has behaved as theoretically predicted: Significantly more primordial content has been found in the poetry of poets who exhibit signs of psychopathology than in that of poets who exhibit no such signs (Martindale, 1975). There is also more primordial content in the fantasy stories of creative as opposed to uncreative subjects (Martindale &amp; Dailey, 1996), in psychoanalytic sessions marked by therapeutic &quot;work&quot; as opposed to those marked by resistance and defensiveness (Reynes, Martindale &amp; Dahl, 1984), and in sentences containing verbal tics as opposed to asymptomatic sentences (Martindale, 1977). A cross-cultural study of folktales from forty-five preliterate societies revealed, as predicted from the &quot;primitive mentality&quot; hypothesis of Lévy-Bruhl (1910) and Werner (1948), that amount of primary process content in folktales is negatively related to the degree of sociocultural complexity of the societies that produced them (Martindale, 1976). Martindale and Fischer (1977) found that psilocybin (a drug that has about the same effect as LSD) increases the amount of primordial content in written stories. Marijuana has a similar effect (West et al., 1983). Research has also revealed more primordial content in verbal productions of younger children as compared with older children (West, Martindale, &amp; Sutton-Smith, 1985) and of schizophrenic subjects as compared with control subjects (West &amp; Martindale, 1988). It shows the pattern expected for historical trends in primordial content in Martindale's (1990) theory of literarary evolution. Thus, the Regressive Imagery Dictionary does seem to yield a valid index of primordial or dedifferentiated thought in a variety of contexts in which the measure varies as is theoretically expected.

Factor analyses of the categories based on the above mentioned texts have also yielded evidence for the construct validity of the dictionary. The factor analyses have consistently yielded a first factor accounting for about 30 percent of the variance which loads highly on the primordial categories and in a high negative direction on the conceptual categories.

 Description   


WordStat is a text analysis module specifically designed to study textual information such as responses to open-ended questions, interviews, titles, journal articles, public speeches, electronic communications, etc. WordStat may be used for automatic categorization of text using a dictionary approach or various text mining as well as for manual coding. WordStat can apply existing categorization dictionaries to a new text corpus. It also may be used in the development and validation of new categorization dictionaries or taxonomies. When used in conjunction with manual coding, this module can provide assistance for a more systematic application of coding rules, help uncover differences in word usage between subgroups of individuals, assist in the revision of existing coding using KWIC (Keyword-In-Context) tables, and assess the reliability of coding by the computation of inter-raters agreement statistics.

WordStat includes numerous exploratory data analysis and graphical tools that may be used to explore the relationship between the content of documents and information stored in categorical or numeric variables such as the gender or the age of the respondent, year of publication, etc. Relationships among words or categories as well as document similarity may be identified using hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling analysis. Correspondence analysis and heatmap plots may be used to explore relationship between keywords and different groups of individuals.

WordStat is a module that must be run from either of the following base products:

SimStat -This statistical software provides a wide range of statistical procedures for the analysis of quantitative data. It offers advanced data file management tools such as the ability to merge data files, aggregate cases, perform complex computation of new variables and transformation of existing ones. When used with Simstat, WordStat can analyze textual information stored in any alphanumeric, plain text and rich text memo variable (or field). It includes various tools to explore the relationship between any numeric variable of a data file and the content of alphanumeric ones.

QDA Miner - The text management and qualitative analysis program (release date: summer 2003) allows one to create and edit data files, import documents, and perform manual coding of those documents. Several analysis tools are also available to look at the frequency of manually assigned codes and the relationship between those codes and other categorical or numeric variables. When used with QDA Miner, WordStat can perform content analysis on whole documents or selected segments of those documents tagged with specific user defined codes.</text>

Description

The Forest Value Dictionary is composed of 612 words and phrases. It is a classification system that identifies four broad categories of forest values: economic/utilitarian, life support, aesthetic, and moral/spiritual values. . It was originally developed and used to empirically analyze the evolution of forest values in the United States from 1982 through 1993 (Bengston &amp; Xu, 1995)

The table below provides for each of the four categories, sample words and phrases and well as the number of entries.

For an excellent presentation on how to build and validate a domain specific categorization system, we strongly reccommend the reading of Bergston &amp; Xu (1995, see below).

For more information

If you need further information on the Forest Value Dictionary, please contact David N. Gengston at dbengston@fs.fed.us or visit his [http://www.ncrs.fs.fed.us/researchprograms/scientist.asp?id=13 web site].

BELIEVING THE CORPORATION

This chapter is about believing the pronouncements of important
corporations. These organizations have considerable prestige, perhaps
because of the large amounts of money they represent. This in¯uence
rubs off on the people that make up the management team and the nonexecutive
directors who are the Greek chorus of corporate life. We
discover how the organization works, its politics and the in¯uences on
the management team including the CEO credibility cycle and the winwin
options game. We ®nd that often there is a great business leader, the
Stalin in the boardroom that tells us what to believe. We believe the great
leader because we must.
The corporation is the organization of choice of the western democracies
for the conduct of economic activity. They are the show exhibits of the
free enterprise system and dominate international trade and global ®nancial
markets. The great corporations are the producers of the most sophisticated
products even when government might be the customer as for
infrastructure and instruments of war. This is hardly surprising given the
accumulation by corporations of capital and intellectual resources far
beyond the capability of the individual or partnership.
Despite the current ascendancy of the corporation, opinions as to its
ef®cacy are mixed. Corporations are not always popular with everyone.
Several authorities question the role the corporation plays in society and
attribute many of society's de®ciencies to the lack of corporate accountability.
Saul uses a negative term corporatism, which he applies to any
interest group whether specialist, professional, public or private, pro®toriented
or not that share the characteristic that the primary relationship
of individual members is to the organization and not to society at large.
The loss of democracy is justi®ed by the implied promise of better ef®-

ciency. He regards the modern corporation as the direct descendant of the
medieval craft guild.
Antony Jay began his career in a government owned media corporation,
which might explain both his view of the nature of the organization and his
ability to so perceptively describe its functioning. From this basis he
reviewed the company structure and its inhabitants in Corporation Man.
In Management and Machiavelli he also draws out historic precedent with
his image on the grander scale of the medieval kingdom with all its political
intrigue.
The power politics of the company itself we soon realize is no different from
any other organization, whether church, university, army or club. It
contains, like any human society, the elements of monarchy, aristocracy,
nobility and democracy. ¼ Antony Jay11 compares the modern corporation
with the medieval kingdom. It is headed by a king, (or president or managing
director) who is surrounded by his courtiers and advisers (directors and
specialists) and who seeks to maintain his authority over his provinces, some
near some far (divisions and subsidiaries), each immediately ruled by a
baron (or plant manager) who may be either docile or turbulent and
whose own authority (over his factory) may be effective or weak ¼ The
competition for power is between the king, the courtiers and the barons.
The medieval court seems to me to be the more appropriate setting for
the corporate life. The image of the craft guild quaint though it is does not
conjure up an image of time wasting. Medieval craftsman without craft
would not have lasted long. The life and death intrigues of the indulgent
court seem a much more appropriate setting for endless meetings targeted
against rivals rather than actually doing something. The kingdom at least
had the resources to absorb the rivalries and jealousy.
The idea that the staff of the corporation is intrinsically less committed
to the outcome than the individual is far from new. It was the subject of
comment from the great and original Adam Smith more than two centuries
ago where he expected directors to show less anxious vigilance for other
peoples' money than partners in a private company would show for theirs.
Then came the excesses of the industrial revolution and the careers of
the great industrial entrepreneurs. The twentieth century brought the
growth of corporation and in reaction, the growth and subsequent reduction
of government regulation. As we move into a new century the
problem is loss of reality or substance stemming from the lack of ownership
and the responsibility that goes with it.
Our modern economic doctrine still draws from Adam Smith the
requirement that the management of the corporation maximize pro®ts,
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 22
UNCORRECTED PROO
yet these are for the bene®t of owners rather than for themselves. This
rather altruistic presumption provides an unstable basis to the theory of the
®rm. It is odd in that management has the power over the ®rm whereas the
owners are notably without power. Indeed management is speci®cally
engaged to have power and carry forth the execution of the business.
Yet the expectation is that management will forgo its own interest in the
sel¯ess pursuit of pro®t maximization for shareholders.
If this immutable doctrine about making money were religious rather
than economic there would be another doctrine directing money to society
rather than to the individual. But the theory of the ®rm directs the rewards
of enterprise not to society but to the shareholder. The connections
between the actions of the manager and maximization of pro®t have
several links and loose ones at that. At various times society has concluded
that these links were too loose, resulting in corporate governance regimes
to impose on business those disciplines that the theory tells us should
happen automatically. Not surprisingly, this has led to frequent tensions
between those who want an unfettered market and those who seek regulation.
What is management really trying to do amongst all this confusion? It
could be the simple biological urge for survival but we can quickly dismiss
the common self-serving exhortation of management to provide for its
continuity by training successors. This emphasizes survival of the organization
although these actions are often concentrated on dominant managers
who recruit acolytes in their own image with the purpose of ensuring their
own survival rather than permitting their departure. This is an example of a
common form of corporate Antilogic. Do as I say, not what I do.
The desire for survival alone is not suf®cient to explain management's
actions. It must also be related to the concept of satisfying, which is doing
just enough to get by comfortably. Economic theory often depends on the
concept of maximizing, perhaps because the maths is simpler. Yet
management behaviour suggests that the objective is to do just enough.
Amiable survival can become the prime consideration of the current custodians
of the corporation. Robert Townsend does not beat about the bush in
his humorous best-seller Up the Organization. He was a successful chief
executive and he knew what he was talking about when he set out the
actual priorities of the corporation starting with the care and feeding of the
chief executive, his entourage, and the board of directors (mostly his
friends, put by him to ensure the tranquillity of his reign) and ranging
through management, employees, to customers and well down the list to
the shareholders. This attitude demonstrates the limit on the level of pro®t
management needs to seek. Pro®tability is a means to an end with most
Believing the Corporation 23
UNCORRECTED PROO
managers, particularly in the higher echelon wishing to enjoy what they are
doing. Pro®tability need only to be suf®cient to deal with shareholder's
needs and to ensure the survival of the organization. Once that is achieved
the management group can enjoy themselves. They achieve this by ensuring
that those other interest groups get enough to avoid a fuss. What is left
over is for growth, interesting projects and play money devoted to the
management group itself.
The controlling manager group retain power so long as earnings are
suf®cient to pay the regular dividends to shareholders and to provide
reinvestment. This pro®t proviso need not be very onerous. In many
successful corporations survival is not realistically in question although
it is frequently mentioned to keep everyone on their toes. This occurs even
when the ownership position is secure. One example is a consumer goods
multinational that was take-over proof because of a complex ownership
structure. Teams of accountants diligently ensured that all shareholderreporting
requirements were correctly met. But who acted on the reports
they produced? No new share equity has ever been raised during the career
of any current employee. So, for whom was the company managed? Initially
it seemed to be managed in the interests of all management but for
some reason the holders of power retreated further into the citadel. Life
became tougher for management in general and they began to suffer the
same rigours as elsewhere. After a time, internal pressures intensi®ed,
presumably as a result of external competition, benchmarking or some
other Holy Grail. The power-group retreated further and the pressure to
perform reached the general cadre of senior managers. Businesses were
sold, structures downsized and the heroes of past battles were put out to
pasture. Cost cutting exercises caused the regimental dinners to be
cancelled and the old victories to be forgotten.
Considerable attention is indeed given by the corporation to the
commitment, loyalty and morale of the business group to the extent
of demanding participation of the individual to the exclusion of other
activities. However, for the individual continued inclusion in this
demanding club is far from secure. As corporate downsizing and takeovers
have become more common a new paradox has emerged with
company men clinging more closely to the idea of belonging in the
face of declining security. They conspire with their employers in the
pursuit of bonding with organizations that are more likely than ever
before to dispense with their services. But there is only so much worrying
the individual can do. Better to participate enthusiastically in the
belief that the group that parties together is less likely to cast individuals
aside. No one can be sure of the outcome but in the meantime it is best
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 24
UNCORRECTED PROO
to enjoy the party and certainly try not to look like anyone who is
drifting away from the group.
Simple survival for the individual is not enough. Contentment comes
when just enough is done to achieve survival in comfort. The individual
can take steps to improve their own contentment in a process that
reduces aggravation by accepting the established action. Toning down
individual thought reduces effort and makes it easier to accept the errors
of private organizations. The contentment quotient is improved further
by reducing the effort necessary to achieve a satisfactory outcome.
Better still the avoidance of thought reduces the risk of taking decisions
that might prove to be unpopular and so also aids survival. We have
seen how the company pursues pro®t satisfying. The individuals pursue
self-satisfying with the optimum position often involving going along
for the ride and accepting whatever strange things might be going on.
Galbraith called this process the pursuit of contentment.
For most, mental effort is something that is exceptionally pleasant to avoid.
From this comes the nature of all great organization: those serving it have a
powerful commitment to established belief and thus to established action.
This regularly rewards those who surrender independent thought to organizational
policy. Their surrender in turn serves personal acceptance and
social harmony ¼ The organizational man is happy with what exists. As
this mood controls his private life, so it controls his public attitude.12
The net result he identi®es as misjudgements, eccentricities, error, inanity
and delegation are all variants of Antilogic. What is very signi®cant is
the rather ®erce way he identi®es corporations as particularly prone to
these outcomes as though he regards the corporation as the prime source
of Antilogic in society.
Nothing so breeds acquiescence in or indifference to social shortcomings as
daily exposure to the misjudgements, eccentricities and inanities of private
organization. With the rise of the great corporation there comes a contented
accommodation to the larger errors of public life and notably those with no
immediate effect on the one who observes them.13
It is wise for the manager to avoid attention and decisions. Taking
decisions attracts both attention and risk. If action really is required this
should be delegated. The more successful the manager is the greater are the
risks he runs and so there is a tendency for less action and less thought the
higher the manager rises unless he is prepared to make very large mistakes.
In previous generations the personality of the company was very much
that of the proprietor and his family. They invested in the trade that they
Believing the Corporation 25
UNCORRECTED PROO
knew and probably in the community where they lived. This led to the
tendency for most of them to make the best of what they did and be content
to earn a return that permitted them to live well and their business to grow.
They were not so much driven by pro®t maximization. They just needed
enough pro®t in what was a more positive form of community satisfying.
But times change and such an approach is no longer safe. The emergence
of the major corporation, of ®nancial engineering and globalization has led
to large business lions that like to feed on small business zebras. Now
stretching the metaphor in a rather unpleasant way the small business
begins to suspect that it would be rather more pleasant to be bought out
by the lion than to be eaten. Small business owners begin to believe that
life would be more comfortable as an employee of large company than as a
small company entrepreneur. Rather than the theory of the economy being
driven by the entrepreneur seeking to establish new business we may ®nd
that the statistics would suggest entrepreneurs rushing to become
managers. In several countries there has been a trend towards industry
consolidators racing to use recently established share market listings to
buy up small business and professional practices. As part of the process the
selling entrepreneur hopes to receive the capital sum that represents the
market worth of his business. Once on board as an employee, either as a
career recruit or as our acquired entrepreneur, the manager becomes a cog
in the corporate machine.
He discovers that the role of manager and employee does not have as
exciting an image as that of the entrepreneur or speculator. Just as the
urban dweller dreams wistfully of the life of the cowboy or beachcomber,
the employee cultivates a dashing image. The difference between image
and reality confronts the manager with a paradox. The workings of the
corporation require inactivity yet his image requires immediate results.
Corporate success may come from the application of the law of large
numbers to a single participant among many in an essentially neutral
system. If the individuals avoid standing out they retain the chance that
they are the survivors who one day reach the top in a sort of corporate
mortality table.
The solution is simple in concept; ®nd apparent results without risky
commitment. Easier said than done as it is not always possible to avoid
action. Internal rivalry may force activity and there is always the unforeseen
outcomes of dithering. Those who do take action in the drive for
speedy results provide another basic example of Antilogic that so often
begins the downward spiral in a company's fortunes. The initial smallish
problem creates an embarrassment that has to be covered up and replaced
with pro®ts from elsewhere. New aggressive risks are taken with unfortu-
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 26
UNCORRECTED PROO
nate consequences leading to a cycle of staff replacements (the usual
suspects, not necessarily the culprits), new policies, forgotten history,
new losses, new staff, etc. until stability eventually re-emerges probably
with a new owner. Because of inherently high gearing, the banking industry
is particularly prone this type of risk. Similar effects are also common
in business with commodity exposures or risky new product decisions and
so we may infer general applicability. This may provide a clue to the broad
cycles that apply to the fortunes of top management and especially chief
executives as they initially soar and subsequently decline in esteem.
If actual decisions must be made there is a fundamental protection for
top management. The more senior the decision-maker the more likely the
decision will be wrong but the less likely the decision-maker will suffer
adverse personal consequences. This is the bene®t gained from the combination
of effects of ®nancial genius. Those involved with large sums must
be smart. Consider how this works in the typical borrowing transaction.
The person who requests a very large loan must be positively in¯uenced by
the very large sum involved and so will tend to be seen as a ®nancial
genius. The bank of®cer with authority to approve such loans will have
constant involvement with large sums and so will also have been greatly
in¯uenced in this case by the rub off effect. With a ®nancial genius proposing
a loan and a greater genius approving it is no wonder that such transactions
can be speedily waved through. The seniority of the people involved
will ensure that the strict rules required for small transactions will not be
applied and no junior experts will challenge the decision. This example
was from the banking industry but applies to any large ®nancial decision. If
the error is large enough the perpetrator can be promoted all the way to the
CEO's chair.
No matter how they get to the position, all Chief Executives begin with
a positive balance in their CEO credibility account. This is a notional
account that re¯ects the balance of public regard for the CEO and functions
very much like a bank account. The precise starting balance
depends not only on the CEOs' own characteristics but also on the pro®le
of their predecessor's account and the state of the business. A typical new
CEO begins with a balance of, say, 100 units. A unit has no absolute
value but has a relative value over time and in comparison between
CEOs. Boards, journalists, analysts and investors are all very interested
in the relative balance. The board must react if the relative balance
becomes too low. The typical credibility account has a life of approximately
three years and is constantly declining, analogous to a glider that
must lose altitude unless the pilot can ®nd a new source of lift.
In the ®rst year he can do no wrong because of good-guy momentum and
Believing the Corporation 27
UNCORRECTED PROO
this may temporarily offset the decline. All new business leaders are given
the bene®t of the doubt for a period, even the most unlikely appointment.
This can reach the extent that the new man is accepted because, when
appointed, the illustrious predecessor looked as unlikely as this man does
now. All CEOs are given a honeymoon period because the market wants a
new approach, new thinking or a new broom. This is the period when he
can do no wrong and all he says is brilliant. It seems that the tides of
fortune are ¯owing in his direction but in reality when things are going
your way all explanations are seen as brilliant new insights. When things
are going poorly the same explanations will be regarded as folly. Never the
less for a while at least, the Gods smile on the new CEO. In the second
year, depending on performance, the good-guy momentum slackens and
the inherent decline takes over. In the third year the CEO can do no right
and this, together with the ongoing decline, exhausts the balance in the
credibility account.
The job of leading any business has the same basic feature. The basic
truth for CEOs is the same wherever they are. This is not very obvious to
the incoming CEO excited and buoyed up by the honour and prestige of his
new appointment. It therefore behoves the outgoing CEO to prepare the
successor for what to expect by leaving instructions. The departing CEO
had no advice for his successor other than to give him three envelopes with
the instruction to open each in turn if things became really tough. At ®rst
everything was ®ne but after a period trouble started and the new CEO
became the subject of criticism. Our hero opened the ®rst envelope, which
contained a message that read `Blame the old CEO'. Our hero followed the
instruction and life became easier. After a further period the situation
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 28
UNCORRECTED PROO
deteriorated and the now experienced CEO opened the second envelope
and found that it contained the message `Blame the economy'. Again our
now battle hardened and experienced CEO took the advice and life
improved. After a further period of challenging conditions our veteran
CEO opened the third envelope and read the ®nal message `Prepare
three envelopes'.
Ultimately, the non-executive directors act to replace the CEO.
However, the new CEO is given only a credibility balance of 75 due to
the nervousness of the board in the face of the investors looking for quick
results. This lower balance is exhausted more quickly. The process may be
repeated once or twice more with each new CEO receiving a smaller and
smaller balance. After this the Chairman and board are replaced and the
next CEO is given a credibility balance of 200 plus options and the cycle
repeats. Why does he get more than the original CEO? After the disaster
the replacement board will over react and ®nd the most spectacular candidate
possible and so ratchet up both expectations and reward. Just as our
glider pilot can ®nd himself swept up in a weather change so can the post
disaster CEO bene®t from the work of his predecessors and cycles in the
economy.
The choice of the successor CEO is a natural occasion when Antilogic
comes to the fore. The board must now ful®l one of its main reasons for
existence by choosing the new CEO. They had probably hoped for happier
times when the illustrious long serving CEO would choose his own successor.
We have seen how even the unlikely successor can be accepted if he
follows a successful CEO but when a CEO has to be replaced it is more
than likely that the board will chose the well prepared likely appointment.
This will be applauded by the market but probably turn out to be an
inappropriate choice. If the board wants to have a choice of likely candidates
the process can be very wasteful. It is the result of a process apparently
designed to make the wrong selection due to the dif®culty of an
illustrious leader identifying a potential supplanter from amongst his
subordinates.
A good leader has his own vision of where the enterprise should be going
and how it should get there, and his idea of a successor is the man most
likely to keep going in the same direction. Obviously this man is probably
his closest associate, his number two, the man who has supported him most
ably and loyally throughout his career. But the mere fact of having been a
loyal number two is prima facie disquali®cation from becoming number
one. It suggests someone who is better suited to following than leading,
someone whose qualities are complementary to those of the leader instead of
Believing the Corporation 29
UNCORRECTED PROO
identical. A leader will have his own vision, and his own ideas, and they are
unlikely to coincide exactly with those of his predecessor; consequently he
may have antagonized the outgoing leader, or at least questioned his ideas,
put up alternatives of his own, and generally created a slight chill in the
atmosphere. It therefore takes a very wise man indeed to realize that this
thorn in his ¯esh may make a better successor than the apple of his eye.14
Farmers would recognize this as the problem of the old bull and the
young bull. However this situation of the outgoing CEO choosing his
successor will be the exception rather than the rule as few can choose
either their time of going or their successor as the credibility cycle reveals
that the typical CEO has his lowest credibility precisely at the moment that
he is to be replaced.
Once he or she is safely in the seat it is prudent for an incoming CEO to
take down the decorations accumulated during his predecessor's reign.
Incoming CEOs are notably Spartan and fundamental in their tastes and
keen to eschew the excesses of the past. This process is called window
undressing. It is also known as clearing the deck. It would be bad form to
take down too early the decorations of an illustrious predecessor who is
still in the neighbourhood. This could be seen as hasty and ungrateful and
regarded as premature window undressing. The precise timing is dependent
on how illustrious was the predecessor and whether he had overstayed
his welcome.
With the growth of the media has come a whole new process by which
corporations seek to ensure that their interests are portrayed in a favourable
manner. This may involve in¯uencing government policy, or investors
or customers. A complex process is initiated depending on the
audience to be in¯uenced. Much of the process is indirect in that the
message is issued to journalists, especially ®nancial journalists and to
broking and ®nancial analysts in the hope that they will favourably in¯uence
the public or investors. To facilitate this process the corporation
establishes a team variously known as Public Affairs, Public Relations,
and Investor Relations whose function is to service the needs of the
opinion formers. These people are also known as spin-doctors and ¯acks
and draw their expertise from the media and advertising industries rather
than from ®nance, investment or the industry of the corporation. The
external distinction between company and CEO very easily becomes
blurred so that the principle task of this process is often to describe the
great beauty and quality of the Emperor's new clothes. This is just the
same as the children's fairy tale but with a modern media twist. The
dominant CEO can deny the journalist access to stories until such time
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 30
UNCORRECTED PROO
as the CEO's in¯uence declines and past scores can be settled. For a
period this leads to the journalist seeing the world through CEO coloured
spectacles. The role of the analyst and ®nancial journalist is to determine
whether the Emperor is wearing the new clothes today or not. Their
ability to ful®l this role follows a distinct cycle not unrelated to the
CEO credibility cycle. Indeed it may be one of the causal factors. The
analyst or journalist is unlikely to discover that a new CEO is wearing
new clothes but with experience may spot that an old CEO is trying to get
away with new clothes.
It is not important for the Prince to have new clothes; he only needed to
appear to have them. With a little sleight of hand there is no need for
dishonesty. Being caught out in a lie is very counterproductive as is the
in¯exibility of always being truthful. The cunning use of the truth can be
used with impunity while retaining adherence to the ultimate truth of the
end objective.
After practising long enough to appear what you are not, it seems natural
for CEOs to develop suf®ciently to become the reality of their image.
Fantasy and reality have a tendency to blur in a sort of self-ful®lling
prophecy. This evolution follows a pattern that again looks suspiciously
like the credibility cycle so that we may postulate that the rate of transition
between reality and image and vice versa determines the duration of the
credibility cycle. Courage is good but a little public relations help just as
well. What they say need not be true but it is easy and most effective if the
image is not far from the truth. This may coincide with what the audience
wants to hear or already believes and become the perceived truth.
With all this public relations help it actually takes quite a while to
discover where the great leader is marching. Much is made of the power,
wisdom and leadership of the Great Man. No one questions the reality of
this until some bright spark realizes that the great leader is never seen
without his minders, speechwriters and spokesmen. Later they realize that
they have not actually seen him in the ¯esh for a long time. Just like the
Wizard of Oz this Great Leader may be an illusion.
There are considerable dangers in using ex-journalists as public relations
consultants to put across the CEO's story. The current journalists do not like
it. It seems to undermine the purity of their profession and reminds them of
the retirement from the press that will be their lot as well. As a consequence
they are keen to point out the shortcomings of the spin-doctor's work,
accelerating the credibility decline.
Consultants are the other source of support for the CEO. They function
like mercenaries in the employ of a monarch to ensure domination of his
kingdom. They bring few surprises. They say, never to ask a consultant
Believing the Corporation 31
UNCORRECTED PROO
before you know his answer and a good consultant will never answer until
he knows what you want.
After a while the CEO credibility cycle became apparent to many observers
and ®nally to the CEOs themselves. Not unreasonably they found it
prudent to seek some protection in the form of employment packages that
include the predetermined severance packages known as golden parachutes.
The prevalence of the golden parachute has begun to attract
adverse comment because of the apparent cost to the company. Cost is
not the end of the story as there is also bene®t for the company. There is a
group of CEOs who by good luck or good mismanagement succeed in
failing in a succession of high pro®le positions. The employment of such a
CEO is calculated to encourage a take-over with attendant premium and
the generation of real shareholder value. The triggering of change of
control clauses provides the CEO with a welcome change from the golden
routine. Some CEOs embrace this golden technique as a counter to the iron
discipline of the CEO credibility account.
The rapidly moving CEO demands immediate results. The quality of the
results is of secondary importance. The speed of their movements may
come through their own realization of the limits in their management
capabilities. This interpretation implies that the CEO knows his shortcomings
whereas the various boards did not. The phenomenon of the rapid
impact CEO is so pervasive that this explanation has to be unlikely. Possibly
the boards have chosen to ignore the shortcomings but it is much more
likely that the Manager is unaware or unable to admit to this shortcoming
whereas the board recognize both their own role of inactivity and the
contribution of incompetence to the ultimate release of value.
The board is supposed to know about the capabilities of the CEO. It is
their main responsibility as expected in corporate governance. Corporate
governance is broadly de®ned as the way companies govern themselves
with a little help from the government in the form of corporations' law and
regulators. Managers are supposedly paid to manage the business in the
interests of the shareholders. The board is appointed to see that management
carries out its job with their leader the Chairman given the onerous
task of replacing the CEO when the time comes. Annual general meetings
and so forth set the stage for this drama to unfold. I will now consider these
distinct governance categories and see how well it has been working out in
practice.
Starting with the managers we immediately encounter a problem. The
managers don't just want to manage but they want to own as well. Their
rewards have begun to look like those of owners except that the rewards go
up even when pro®t does not. The reality of this self-interest was put in
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 32
UNCORRECTED PROO
stark relief by the simplistic speech on the topic of options for the incumbent
CEO made by a small shareholder at the annual meeting of a major
corporation. His comments were along the lines that the CEO was a ®ne
leader who was already working all the hours available with great results
and so patently giving him more options was a waste of the shareholders
money as he could not conceivably do better.
Share ownership schemes and executive options have taken rewards
beyond payment for service to payment as capitalists towards actual
ownership of the company without the risk. This started as a legal way
to save tax on extra income and was encouraged by some mutual funds to
provide an incentive similar in character to ownership. Over time the tax
situation and incentive needs have changed but the ownership bene®ts
remain.
For the CEO the granting of options is a win-win situation. He must be
attracted in the ®rst instance with an internationally competitive package
irrespective of the chance that he will move internationally or whether an
international rival is realistically likely to move to this location. The
convention must be honoured. Of course, sometimes there are some international
transfers but this is subject to fashion and comes at a particular
point in the credibility cycle when a clean new start is required. Then the
convention is to pay more than the previously disclosed comparable international
remuneration in order to attract the right person. This provides the
necessary periodic upward adjustment in CEO salaries as all the other local
CEOs are brought into line due to the comparative survey.
The CEO will also be given the options justi®ed by a comparative
survey that delivers about the same as the other CEOs. Because our
particular business is not doing as well, it will be necessary to issue a
lot of cheap options to provide the necessary incentive, perhaps increased
because of the perceived risk. Although the options are issued in the
expectation of an improvement in the share price the conservative
accounting assumes no success and no increase in value and so there is
assumed to be no cost to the shareholders. It would be churlish to
begrudge those few extra shares later and international investors positively
want CEOs and management to be rewarded in the same way as
shareholders. When it comes to the retirement of a popular champion
there is a divergence of rewards between CEO and shareholder. It is still
common to give a retiring CEO new options in his retirement years
because of the wisdom of his decisions having an ongoing bene®cial
effect whereas shareholders cease to receive dividends or capital gain
after they sell their shares.
Once he has actually received his options our CEO is now in a win-
Believing the Corporation 33

win-win situation. If the share-price goes up he is rich and everyone is
happy. Perhaps his actions even caused the price to go up. If the shareprice
does not go up and he is a ®ne chap regarded by the board as doing
a good job they will have to issue further options at a lower strike price
to restore his incentive. If he is not popular the board will terminate him
but compensate him as if the options are valuable (despite having been
accounted at nil cost) in order that he goes quietly. There is a going rate
for this as well so that, success or not, the rewards for CEOs continue to
be ratchetted up. The shareholders might not be so happy but the working
of the credibility cycle tends to have them look forward to the
performance of the new CEO.
The real owners are the shareholders but do they take an actual interest in
the company? Are they stock speculators or faceless mutual funds who treat
their holding as simply a negotiable instrument? It is likely that management
and the shareholders will disagree about these questions. However,
there is widespread agreement that the formal forum for reporting to the
shareholders, the annual general meeting, is an historic relic of limited
modern use. The central fallacy is that an enormous company often with
more than 100,000 shareholders is controlled by the shareholders at the
annual general meeting or that the board has the ability to control such an
extensive organization. The AGM is an elaborate exercise in popular illusion
with the element of democracy so reduced as to be merely vestigial.
The widespread condemnation of AGMs is reinforced by the participants
themselves who see it as a historic showpiece often abused by
interest groups who treat it as opportunity to gain attention for their causes.
Labour, consumer, environmental and landowner groups frequently interrupt
meetings in an increasingly persistent manner. In Japan organized
crime made meeting disruption a pro®table sideline. It is conceded that
the AGM is a meeting that is to be endured and at which the minimum
possible business is to be conducted, questions are to be stonewalled and
where possible directors are silent.
The shareholders own the company but they are numerous with individual
votes counting for little. The set piece meetings are dominated by
small shareholders who lack the understanding or information to effectively
interrogate the board. Institutional shareholders normally do not take
part other than providing their proxy to the Chairman. As a result the board
continues to control the outcome of the meeting even if shareholder activists
are able to gain a majority of shareholders present. This is part of the
philosophy of institutions supporting incumbent management and only
showing their displeasure by selling their shares. Naturally, after selling
they no longer have any interest in the affairs of the business. This conven-

tion provides a line of least resistance for management who respond to
shareholder criticism with the suggestion that if they do not like the way
the company is run they should sell their shares. After which of course they
would no longer have any reason to comment. This approach is encouraged
by the psychology of fund managers who have no interest in continued
public exposure of their investment let alone disappointment in an unsuccessful
company. The net effect is that the general meeting only has relevance
in the aftermath of ®nancial catastrophe and is seldom in¯uential in
correcting ordinary mismanagement.
Ostensibly the board represents the shareholders yet they generally only
vote on issues and election lists provided by management and often no
choice is possible. This allows self-perpetuation by the board who are in
fact appointed by themselves and by each other as a network sometimes
with support from other institutions concerned with ®nance.
The effective power of corporate governance lies elsewhere. It is
suggested that the real power is wielded at the board meeting. Although
the board may hold the power over the shareholders the management often
holds the board. Townsend is not very ¯attering about the directors with
the idea of non-boards.
Most big companies have turned their boards of directors into non-boards.
The chief executive has put his back seat drivers to sleep. This achievement
is understood to be admired. In the years that I've spent on various boards
I've never heard a single suggestion from a director (made a director at a
board meeting) that produced any result at all. While ostensibly the seat of
all power and responsibility, directors are usually the friends of the chief
executive put there to keep him safely in of®ce. They meet once a month,
gaze at the ®nancial window dressing (never at the operating ®gures by
which managers run the business), listen to the chief and his team talk
super®cially about the state of the operations, ask a couple of dutiful questions,
make token suggestions (courteously recorded and subsequently
ignored), and adjourn until next month.15
A more sympathetic view is that board inactivity comes from the sheer
dif®culty of carrying out the real role of non-executive directors of guiding
company affairs and the selection of chief executives. The non-executive
directors are burdened by their lack of knowledge of the detail of the
company's affairs and must rely on management for the crucial information
necessary to ful®l their responsibilities. They are forced of necessity
to concentrate on compliance issues. Management has all the detail but is
often unable to judge the company's performance objectively because
they were too close to the issues at stake.
Believing the Corporation 35
UNCORRECTED PROO
It is hard to distinguish the difference between a board that is regarded as
good because the results are good and the board that ensures that the results
are good. Directors are going to be ¯attered by success whether it exists or
not. The accounts will show the pro®t in the best light. If the value of the
shares rises life is sweet. The commentators write ¯attering pieces about
the company and the directors bask in the association. They are welcome
all over town and new offers ¯ood in with the hope that they may achieve
the same result in other places. The board meetings are very pleasant. But
if the share prices dips the adoring crowds begin to thin. Little by little the
commentators begin to question what is happening and after a period of
expressing con®dence in the management the directors begin to ask more
questions and hope that they are the right ones. The meetings become
much less fun but the public image must be maintained. Generally the
directors continue to serve. It is sometimes suggested that this loyalty is
due to the money involved in fees. Maybe there is an element of ®nancial
self-interest affecting the directors and their attitude to fees but this is to
overstate their personal ®nancial interest in the outcome, as this is relatively
modest. The outcome is there but the motivation is a more complex
mixture of in¯uences. First and foremost their role is a continuation of their
own business career and now it is their turn to do to others as they have
already received. It is prudent and justi®able to act in a manner similar to
the other comparable organizations. It gives a very easy satisfying choice
and it is much more comfortable to do the same as everyone else rather
than to risk the loss of prestige associated with a board seat at a well known
company. This gives a dynamic that drives the interrelation between board,
chairman and CEO that is most obvious in the area of remuneration but
in¯uences all areas of decision making. For remuneration the impact is
accentuated by the combination of herding where the boards of each
corporation compare themselves with the others and slipstreaming as
each takes a successive advantage over the other.
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 36
UNCORRECTED PROO
The role of the directors extends to participation in networks between
boards. There is a group of individuals subject to that in¯uence who know
how to play the game and identify the venerable and subtle rules of the
public role that the board plays. The prospect pronouncements that are as
opaque as a Delphic oracle and the ritualistic characteristics, especially in
the set piece shareholder meetings, give a clue that the origins of the board
lie with a Greek drama. In the typical Greek tragedy the chorus is
comprised of twelve elders, still a popular number today. The chorus
presents the voice of moral conservatism, traditionalism and a reluctance
to challenge the present way of thinking. This conservatism is most probably
a function of their age. They are a group of sound but elderly businessmen
with few exceptions. In this sense I mean sound to be seen but not
heard! The chorus must stay inactive, as it is the role of the characters to
respond to the circumstances. So we see the directors remain completely
silent at the AGM despite all sorts of provocation from the ¯oor.
The chorus could not respond other than their continued expressions of
foreboding (which must be their concern about personal liability) yet they
do nothing to either con®rm their fears or to act in such a way as to negate
them. This idea of foreboding is part of the role of creating atmosphere for
corporate governance to reinforce the impression that the interest of shareholders
is being taken very seriously indeed. The creation of atmosphere is
linked to the role as historian (corporate memory) and poet (corporate
image). Sound also indicates an ability to act in the expected way.
By de®nition non-executives are required not to be involved in the
executive decisions of the company. This is probably the explanation
why a survey by an international executive search ®rm revealed that
75% of all non-executive directors of Australian listed companies are
present or former chief executives of other listed companies. Most chief
executives are generalists by background and specialists in their particular
industries. They will have concentrated on general management for many
years before being invited to non-executive roles. For con¯ict of interest
reasons they cannot be appointed to the boards of competitor companies in
their specialist industry and current corporate governance practice frowns
on appointment as non-executive directors in the same company where
they had been executives. Consequently 75% of non-executive directors
bring neither specialist skills nor industry knowledge to the boards on
which they serve. This is not a practical impediment, as non-executive
directors are required not to do anything, hence the title. The principle
criterion for acceptance of a non-executive board invitation is the suitability
of the monthly board meeting day. Once on board the board they join
the Chairman in supporting unquestioningly the actions of the CEO until,
Believing the Corporation 37
UNCORRECTED PROO
at a moment determined by the Chairman, they will join him in not
supporting the CEO.
In due time this will lead to the removal of the old CEO and the selection
of a new CEO. The intervening period may provide the board, which has
trained by not involving themselves in the affairs of the company, with the
opportunity to take over the day to day direction of the ®rm and the chance
to relive their former days of executive glory. Loyal service as a non-active
director is likely to be rewarded in due course with promotion to Chairman
with the responsibility to determine when the CEO is no longer to be
supported. This progression is not automatic as certain prerequisites also
apply. Non-executive directors should not only be non-active, they should
be sound. In this case we mean sound like a barrel, do the right thing and do
not leak.
A recent development has been an increasing number of female nonexecutive
directors. This is a welcome strengthening of board talent as
generally these women have reached the previously mandatory level of
experience at a much earlier age and without the necessity of having had
the previously mandatory chief executive role. This may be the positive
effect of ®shing in a smaller gene pool. We may expect that, if current
seniority criteria for the appointment are maintained, within ten years most
company chairmen will be women.
Despite the ability of management to control their boards there still
remains the irksome compliance duties and for the CEO the ever
present danger of the credibility cycle. Some therefore hanker for a
further solution, really the de®nitive solution, to the problem of shareholders
control and corporate governance. That is to eliminate the
shareholder. The managers go out and raise the funds to buy out the
shareholders. Periodically there are conditions when the management is
optimistic and the shareholders pessimistic so it proves possible for a
management committed to the success of `their' enterprise to bid for
and buy the company. This is when there are waves of management
buyouts (MBO) and leveraged buyouts (LBO). Each corporate strategy
swing gives the potential that some part of the corporation might
become available to its management. There are problems when this
happens, not least the position of the board deciding between the
position of management and that of the shareholders. Knowing what
they know, management would never want to buy what the shareholders
would want to sell! There is also the conceptual dif®culty
that the funding must be serviced by the same business. At least for
the CEO it eliminates the board and shareholders before the CEO
credibility cycle takes its course.
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 38
UNCORRECTED PROO
There are plenty of CEOs who subscribe to the Alfred Chandler philosophy
that the modern business enterprise became a viable institution only
after the `visible' hand of management proved to be far more ef®cient than
the `invisible' hand of the market. They set out to provide that visible hand
and some have succeeded. These leaders share all the human characteristics,
good and bad, of politicians and, sadly, sometimes of dictators.
Business leaders generally begin their reign with humility and enthusiasm.
Their con®dence grows with experience but over time there is a tendency
towards expecting acquiescence and sometimes towards hubris.
We have seen that evolving nature of corporations has led to a loss of
effective control by the owners, the shareholders. Power has migrated
towards the managers supposedly held in check by the non-executive
directors. Although much of the trappings of the entrepreneur are lovingly
embraced, the organizations have become more bureaucratic and political
in nature. Successive waves of management consultants have introduced
the culture and terminology of the sporting ®eld and of the battle®eld.
Much play is made of leadership, loyalty and team spirit. Generally, the
tendency for this to become a personality cult is held in check by the
natural working of the CEO credibility cycle. Sometimes by force of
personality or lucky chance a CEO succeeds in outlasting his board and
re-balancing its loyalty in his favour. Key to their success is an ability to
hang onto power to give enough time to change the organization in their
image through control of personnel.
Once the constraints of the cycle have been loosened it is likely that the
CEO will survive for a dramatically longer term. He or she becomes the
respected industry leader and a phenomenon. This enhanced status
together with the respect it brings can lead to remarkable results and
with the loss of the self constraining nature of the cycle these may be
more extreme, both positive and negative.
The chief executive naturally will seek to get the best out of his cohorts.
Sometimes that may be outright manipulation to rubberstamp his own ill
conceived proposals. Even in benign circumstances where the group are
not sycophants there are inadvertent dangers that prevent a group member
from expressing doubts when the others in the group appear to have
reached a consensus.
This puts a premium on being the ®rst to express an opinion although it
is wiser to guess, or better still know, what the leader's opinion will be. It is
not loyal to make a mistake and guess wrongly. Loyalty also means that
once a consensus is reached truth must be consistent with that decision.
In his own mind (President) Johnson regarded his in-group of policy advi-
Believing the Corporation 39
UNCORRECTED PROO
sers as a family and its leading dissident member as an irresponsible son who
was sabotaging the family's interests. Underlying this revealing image
seems to be two implicit assumptions that epitomize Groupthink: `We are
a good group, so any deceitful acts we perpetrate are fully justi®ed. Anyone
in the group who is unwilling to distort the truth to help us is disloyal'.16
The consensus group of course de®nes help according to the rules of
Groupthink. Janis outlines three concepts that achieve this.
Construct a set of objectives that the leader is intending to achieve `presuming
always that he acts in a rational manner'.17
This proviso is very unrealistic. The second concept emphasizes those
factors that limit rationality of decision making. These could be limits to
the ability to obtain the necessary information, limits to the ability to
process that information and a tendency to ®nd a course of action that
will satisfy the most minimal of goals (a satisfying strategy). This is more
like the typical organization. The more information there is the more
satisfying takes place. Then as the third concept we have of®ce politics.
A variant is a matter of `muddling through'. Policy-makers take one little
step one after another and gradually change the old policy into a new one, all
the while making compromises that keep every politically powerful group
that enters the bargaining reasonably satis®ed or at least not dissatis®ed
enough to obstruct or sabotage the new trend.
This will tend to diffuse dissent, as it is often not worth the personal risk
to indulge in sabotage because the process of incremental change will also
pass. The less technical description is to call it the salami technique. Each
slice individually is not worth making a fuss.
Sometimes the leader is a person of great tenacity both in insisting that
the new trends take hold and in ensuring that he sticks around long enough
to outlast the doubters. He insists that the team plays the way he wants. He
may be so keen on being a team player that he takes it upon himself to be
manager, coach, captain and leading goal scorer. No detail is left to chance
but often it is clear that the new techniques are for the others to follow and
not for the boss himself. One such example is ``Neutron' Jack Welch of
General Electric, one of the most admired managers of all time.
Welch certainly saw himself as a liberator, inspiring others to realize their
responsibility and talents: his key slogan was `Control your destiny or someone
else will'. But everyone knew who was really in control. He had chosen
his own men to push through his reforms and weed out `resistors'. He
replaced the old wedding cake corporate structure with a `cartwheel',
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 40
UNCORRECTED PROO
with the thirteen spokes of the business units all radiating from his own
of®ce. There was now much less scope for opposition and balancing forces:
he had replaced a republic with a monarchy.18
There are many more examples of business leaders gaining such domination
over their organizations as to begin acting as monarchs or dictators.
Their careers have led to colourful reporting of both the heights and depths
of achievement. Sometimes the story ends in tears, which gives the journalists
a further story opportunity as they explain how they had seen it
coming and the rest of us should have known. Each period and each
country have their famous names with Tiny Rowland, Robert Maxwell,
Howard Hughes, the Hunts, Alan Bond, and Al Dunlap amongst the standouts.
Other CEOs show the same tendencies but have been able to avoid
the ®nancial disasters that often provoke a rethinking of a chief executive's
contribution.
In the world of corporate regulation, transparent reporting and the ef®-
ciency of the market, these situations of CEO domination should not
happen as often as they do but there are factors that help them. Firstly,
we like the idea of the big boss. We encourage them in their displays of
importance. This is an important business. Our leader must be suitably
impressive so that we can bask in the re¯ected glory as employees or feel
justi®ed in our investment.
Not only should they look grand. When the times are dif®cult it is
reassuring to have a leader who looks commanding. This applies even in
the best-governed companies. Special challenges require special
measures. The media, staff and investors all look for strength. They
want charismatic leadership. The problem is that once in place the special
challenges leader naturally entrenches his position and it is not so easy to
change the formula or get them out again re¯ecting a universal human
characteristic. Its prevalence changes over time and varies between countries
depending on the impact of shareholder activism, and corporate
regulation in moderating the credibility cycle. One would expect the
more open the reporting of corporate activity the more rapid the working
of the credibility cycle would be yet Sampson claims the greatest dif®-
culty with autocrats escaping the credibility discipline occurs in the most
open of markets, Britain and America.
The biggest companies in America, Europe and Asia all have problems with
controlling autocrats, within their widely varied versions of capitalism. The
Japanese claim to organize retirements and successions better than the West
through their system of consensus, but they also ®nd it harder to dislodge
dominating bosses ¼ `They are absolute corporate kings'. The German
Believing the Corporation 41
UNCORRECTED PROO
chairmen are becoming harder to dislodge, in spite of their supervisory
boards and the industrial failures of the 1990s. `The chairman always begins
to think he owns the company', said one Anglo-German sociologist. ¼
Even the French are becoming more worried about their traditionally
over-centralized power. `The French caste system based on a mandarinate
gives huge power to presidents: it's really based on monarchic principles',
said Octave Gelinier. But British and American companies face the greatest
dif®culties in controlling their autocrats.19
It might be imagined that the mounting criticism would be a clear
enough message for the big boss. This is not the case because those
aggressive characteristics that won the position also serve to reinforce
their own self-esteem with in-built defences. As they work their way
through the credibility cycle the level of applause will subside and gradually
be replaced with criticism. This will have little impact as it is to be
expected!
The danger with autocrats and the charismatic leaders appointed to meet
special challenges is the misdirected energy and uncertain motives.
Commanding action has to be taken and no dissension or even debate
can be tolerated. It is the classic environment for Antilogic. This may
lead to trouble no matter how well meaning the group or benign its intentions.
This is the negative side of Groupthink, which ascribes the ®nest
motives to those actions deemed to be in the interests of the group. Loyalty
demands sticking to the policies of the group even when there are unintended
adverse consequences or policy is working badly. The outcome
might disturb the members' conscience but this is not allowed to overrule
their loyalty to the group. Janis calls this soft-headed thinking, leading to
hard-hearted action.
Paradoxically, soft-headed groups are likely to be extremely hard-hearted
towards out-groups and enemies. In dealing with a rival ¼ policy makers
comprising an amiable group ®nd it relatively easy to authorize dehumanizing
solutions ¼ An affable group is unlikely to pursue the dif®cult and
controversial issues that arise when alternatives to a harsh ¼ solution
come up for discussion. Nor are the members inclined to raise ethical issues
that imply that this `®ne group of ours, with its humanitarianism and its
high-minded principles might be capable of adopting a course of action that
is inhumane and immoral'20
Many of the current management techniques aimed at establishing a
vision, mission statement, team-building, cultural change, compliance
program or whatever are designed to create affable groups. Group cohe-
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 42
UNCORRECTED PROO
siveness is likely to increase hard-heartedness relative to other sources of
faulty decisions. The same tendency can lead to the cover-up. The reasoning
goes as follows. Because our ®ne group performs to the highest standards
any adverse publicity must be for the wrong motivation and
gratuitously damaging. Therefore, to prevent unjusti®ed criticism and
needless concern to the public/investors we will prevent disclosure of
problems. The non-disclosure of problems at Mitsubishi Motor Corporation
and Snow Dairy in Japan are recent examples.
The origins of the hard-headedness adopted by the autocrat are clear to
see in the following quote about a much loved political leader who applied
forceful leadership to achieve what were generally seen as worthy aims.
In the professional study of leadership, style is the man. The school that
thinks leadership is a collection of macho qualities in which not thinking too
deeply, being thick skinned and can do without too many scruples or much
delicacy, as well as relying on well-placed mates, are taken to be all that you
need. It doesn't matter how complicated the world becomes, these are the
old leadership verities; divide the world into the leaders and led; play by the
book when you must, otherwise do what you have to; claim to be tough
unswerving, always and everywhere positive; and treat those who object as
less than men, emotional, impractical and possibly subversive ± though the
odd sop, the gain-after-the pain doesn't go astray when it can't be avoided.
¼ There's an element of the gangs and games of 11 year old boys in all
macho-type leadership ¼ Every macho leader knows, if he's pressed, that
his ¼ authority is derived from some reference to force.21
So, there we have it. The most respectable and benign groups are particularly
prone to Antilogic and this Antilogic can take a sinister turn against
those that do not share the in status. This applies to individuals, corporations,
nations and other groupings. This is particularly obvious in politics
with history littered with the most unfortunate examples but it is also
endemic in the world of ®nance. The clubby world of business and the
ceaseless requirement for soundness from its participants appear almost
predestined to be the laboratory for Groupthink. It also helps to explain
why so many corporate disasters are accompanied with such adverse
consequences for participants and bystanders alike.
This is no doubt a shock for those that would participate at senior levels
in such an environment. It was clear that actual and aspiring chief executives
would resort to savage action to protect their position and so ensure
the future prospects of the corporation. This could be foreseen and avoided
by choice of organization or by willingness to pledge allegiance, without
mistake, to the leader. But Groupthink has revealed that participation in a
Believing the Corporation 43
UNCORRECTED PROO
cohesive and supportive group is no guarantee of a successful outcome. Far
from it as the more cohesive the group the more likely that softthinking
will lead to hard-hearted action and this means victims.
Not everyone thinks that this is a bad thing. The Great Leaders believe
that it is natural and probably inevitable. Remember, they expect criticism
and are ready with the response; `no pain, no gain', `you can't make an
omelette without scrambling eggs', `when the going gets tough the tough
get going'. It is for them to do what is necessary to survive and prosper.
This may mean tough decisions and hard yards and if this means the
components of the group must change then so be it. One change may
lead to another and before we know it there are special rules for the
Great Leader. Whatever they do becomes what is necessary for the
group to survive and prosper. When they begin hearing voices then
watch out for trouble. Corporate history is full of colourful examples but
in order to avoid favouritism the following quotes are about one particularly
uncivilized political leader. These quotes relate to extreme political
outcomes but provide troubling parallels with business practice.
Stalin was given a business nickname, the Boss. He had a ®rm grip on
public relations and personnel, especially where his grasp of succession
planning had the victim run faster and faster to avoid causing disappointment.
Despite the promotion to the most senior levels the victim
could not resist personal ambition and for the good of the team will need
to be removed. The end comes as a surprise in contrast to the less
effective modern technique of transferring the individual into a nonexistent
role.
Much would be written later about the Boss's sadism, as seen in the inevitable
promotion of a victim before liquidation. In fact, he simply wanted his
prey to work harder and to be unaware that the end was near. Above all, he
promoted them at the last minute so that people could see how much he
loved them, and how they had betrayed his trust.22
With globalization or whatever other competitive threat there will be
need for frequent changes of strategy and attendant changes of conviction.
For the Party's sake you can and must at 24 hours' notice change all your
convictions and force yourself to believe that white is black.23
In the rough and tough of business it is recognized that our caring and
upright leader will not and should not be associated with some of the
essential actions that have to be taken. This may mean he is thought to
be unaware of unpleasant activities assisted by the growth of in-depth
language where prohibitions mean the opposite.
Antilogic: Why Businesses Fail While Individuals Succeed 44
UNCORRECTED PROO
The whole gathering of course realized that there was no conspiracy. But
they also knew the in-depth language. They had been told that the party must
have a conspiracy. It was essential for success in the struggle with world
imperialism and the schismatic Trotsky. In conclusion, a secret circular from
Yagoda was read. The People's Commissar warned them that the use of
illegal methods of interrogation such as threats and torture would not be
tolerated. In `in depth language' this meant that such methods were necessary
because the accused must be ruthlessly `broken'.24
The ultimate justi®cation for the contrast between the language and
action of control is the belief that the corporation must be protected and
the leader is above the principles so as to ensure that protection is
achieved.
For the Party's sake! When the former seminarist Stalin called the Party the
Order of Sword Bearers he had just that in mind: the sacred nature of the
Party. Trotsky expressed the same thought in his dictum `the Party is always
right'. Like the church their Party remained pure even if those who served it
erred. For like the church, the Party was founded on scripture, in this case
the sacred Marxist texts, which would never allow the Party to err, or sinful
individual members to change its sacred nature. Hence the principle `everything
for the Party' which allowed them to betray themselves and humble
themselves before Stalin ± the head of the Sacred Party.
The whole process of control demanded by the big Boss depends on the
unquestioning loyalty of assistants who are perversely reassured when in
due time they are also the victims of the process. It is a question of simple
arithmetic that this must be the case.
Bad though the image of Stalin is C.S. Lewis found a still greater evil
that all Company Men would recognize.
I live in the Managerial Age, in a world of `Admin'. The greatest evil is not
now done in those sordid `dens of Crime' that Dickens loved to paint. It is
not done even in the concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see
its ®nal result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried
and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted of®ces, by quiet
men with white collars and cut ®ngernails and smooth shaven cheeks who
do not need to raise their voices. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for
Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the of®ces of a
thoroughly nasty business concern.25
Lewis does not explain what makes a business concern thoroughly
nasty. Is it a very ef®cient ®rm that inevitably becomes nasty or is an
Believing the Corporation 45
UNCORRECTED PROO
inef®cient ®rm that inadvertently becomes nasty? The combination of
Groupthink and Antilogic suggests that it is the affable groups applying
the most modern techniques that through unintended consequences stumble
into trouble.

What is [[wikipedia:geodesy|geodesy]]? Webster defines geodesy as &quot;that branch of applied mathematics which determines by observation and measurement the exact positions of points and the figures and areas of large portions of the earth's surface, the shape and size of the earth, and the variations of terrestrial gravity.&quot; It is a specialized application of several familiar facets of basic mathematical and physical concepts. In practice, geodesy uses the principles of [[wikipedia:mathematics|mathematics]], [[wikipedia:astronomy|astronomy]] and [[wikipedia:physics|physics]], and applies them within the capabilities of modern engineering and technology. 

In the past, military geodesy was largely involved with the practical aspect of the determination of exact positions of points on the Earth's surface for mapping or artillery control purposes. The determination of the precise size and shape of the earth had a purely scientific role. Modern requirements are for answers to problems in [[wikipedia:satellite tracking|satellite tracking]], global [[wikipedia:navigation|navigation]] and defensive missile operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So far we have learned that valence electrons will flow in a conductor if we provide enough energy or force so that the electrons will leave the atom and jump to the next atom. We can cause a net movement of electrons through a conductor by attaching one end to a negative source and the other to a positive source. Because like charges repel and unlike charges attract, electrons will move from the negative source to the positive end. It just sounds wrong to have something move from negative to positive but remember that negative and positive are charge types not amounts. 

The applied force that causes the electrons to flow is called voltage (after the scientist Alessandro Volta) or electromotive force (emf). We give it the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;big&gt;ℰ&lt;/big&gt; in equations. Voltage is measured with a voltmeter or multimeter and is the potential difference between two points in a circuit. The basic unit is the volt (V). 

Consider a battery. The chemical process in the battery creates a surplus of electrons at the negative terminal and a deficiency of electrons at the positive end (due to the fact that absence of electrons does not automatically indicate presence of positive charge, unless we consider this terminal charged with positive ''ions''). The potential difference or voltage between these two points is the &quot;push&quot; that the battery can supply to a conductor that may connect the two terminals.

      <comment>current is measured with an ammeter not a multimeter per se (more accurate)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To make electrons flow in a conductor, we first must supply some form of electromotive force (potential difference). This can be achieved attaching the conductor to some source (generator), like a battery or a power supply. 

Current, then, is the ''rate of flow'' of electrons through the conductor (with unitary diameter), measured in amperes (A) after the French scientist André-Marie Ampère. 
In formulae, current is represented by the letter I.  That's a capital ''eye''.

The ampere is a large measurement so we usually refer to milliampere (mA), being 1/1000 of an ampere, in small measurements.

One ampere is equivalent to

&lt;math&gt;6.24 \times 10^{18}&lt;/math&gt;

charged particles (or 1 coulomb) moving through a unitary section conductor in one second.

Current is measured with an ammeter.

Various proposed bookshelves, not yet implemented.  When you implement one of these, please move the discussion below to the appropriate talk page.

=== Social Science===
It appears that books on history and the social sciences have been disregarded by most persons- the number of contributors seems most limited. I suggest that persons consider spending time to contribute to [[US History]], [[World History]], and others.

Secondly, is there any prospect of combining the presently minimal Humanities bookshelf with the History Bookshelf, yielding one shelf on Social Sciences? [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 00:48, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:I was the one who started US History, about a month ago... it's kinda neglected, but I hope to add more as I get time. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 07:27, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:As the Social Sciences and Humanities really are distinct disciplines with different methodologies and standards, I would agree that keeping them separate is the best approach. I would, however, be happy to start contributing to the Humanities offerings. I am trying to figure out how to start contributing some material for an introductory Philosophy text book, as I am both a professor and student of the subject.  Would it be appropriate/acceptable to organize and synthesize some of the excellent GPL'ed information on Wikipedia and combine it with my own material and prose to start forming something that resembles an organized text?  --RMK, 22 Oct 2003 (sorry, no account yet)

::Sure, getting material from the main Wikipedia is a great way to jump start a book. And you can certainly divide the social sciences and humanities into two sections if you think appropriate. Welcome, I am excited to have you here, especially as a professor. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Thanks for your warm welcome and speedy response. I have begun an introductory text on Western Philosophy, but only just.  Hopefully, time will permit me to continue working on it. BTW, since I work at a university, I also know an historian or two who might be willing to help with the texts there--I'll ask. I also work full-time and teach in Technology and may be able to help there as well (yes, I realize it is a seemingly strange mix). --[[User:RMK|RMK]]

===Game strategy guides===
I notice that we have a page for [[Computer Game Walkthroughs]], and was wondering if there'd be any support for expanding that page into a general game strategy guide bookshelf?  Information about the classical games such as chess, go, and poker could be moved here from wikipedia, as well as newer, less well known games.  This could provide content as well as some public interest.  What does everyone think? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:33, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:Sounds like a good idea... --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 11:47, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::We're currently trying to build a concensus to move these pages over here at [[w:en:WikiProject Games]].  Any opinions from the Wikibookians would be appriciated. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:12, 14 Jan 2004 (UTC)
::: Update? [[User:Sj|Sj]]

:This is a great Idea.  Lets figure out the best way to do this because this will be a great boon to the internet and the gaming communities.  Heres the problem I see us bumping up against.  [http://www.gamefaqs.org gamefaqs.org] already has a serious monopoly on the internet game walkthrough 'market' (seriously go check that site out its monsterous) and this wikibook may be looked upon as a kind of competition with them and it won't win.  AFAIK all game players looking for walkthrough information go there due to the number of games they have cataloged there and the quantity and quality of the walkthroughs.  They do not realize the true merits of the wiki so they will not venture to this wikibook.  
Gamefaqs.org already has walkthroughs for virtually every game in existance.  Is there ANY way this book could work together with them??? Perhaps we could somehow ask gamefaqs to put a link to the wikibook for each game in their catalog?  This would allow game players to find these books when they are looking for more information.  I have bumped into problems hundreds of times in the faqs there that I would have fixed if I could have.  and I have thought of tons of game tips that I would post online if I could.  Now I can thanks to [[Computer Game Walkthroughs]] but it would be very useful to find a way to work with gamefaqs on this issue.

===Merit Badges===
Hello, this is [[w:en:user:TUF-KAT]] from the 'pedia, just dropping by to the Staff Lounge for some cocktails... Created [[BSA Merit Badges]] to place resources on earning merit badges in the [[w:en:Boy Scouts of America]].  If anybody else would like to contribute, please do.  Each merit badge has ten to fifteen or so requirements (though it varies from at least two to more than twenty) on subjects like ''Reptile and Amphibian Study'', ''Swimming'', ''American Labor'', ''Traffic Safety'' and ''Model Design and Building''.  Making at least a brief guide wouldn't take too long, and could also be used as the basis for a less specialized module (example: an [[Ornithology]] module could do much worse than educating the reader on all the [http://www.meritbadge.com/bsa/mb/029.htm requirements for Bird Study merit badge] or [http://www.meritbadge.com/bsa/mb/004.htm Citizenship in the World], and the same for [http://www.meritbadge.com/bsa/mb/007.htm Environmental Science], though the old requirements were better (can't find a copy on the web).  The new ones require experiments -- any dicussion about those?  Might be best to have a separate namespace or bookshelf or something for experiments, so they can be easily cross-referenced).  Since it's so simple, I may just do the Mammal Study module tonight and see if anyone has any comments. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 06:47, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)

===Geography===
Do we have any geography texts (such as [[US Geography]] or [[Geography of Europe]])? If we don't, what bookshelf would they go under? Could we specify the age/grade level for each text, i.e. [[10th grade US Geography]] or [[5th grade Geography of Europe]]? Is there anything on this subject at all? Or does all of this belong at Wikipedia? If it doesn't, we should start something. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 00:42, 3 Jul 2004 (UTC)</text>

Ideas for new books that haven't yet gotten off the ground.  When you start one of these books, move the relevant discussion below to the new talk pages.

==DBQ How-To==
I'm trying to build a How-To for writing a DBQ... currently being built (slowly) at [[wikipedia:How to write a DBQ]]. - [[User:Pingveno|Pingveno]] 00:21, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)
*If it's long enough it can be it's own short book in the history bookshelf. I can imagine this especially so if it's then differentiated into additional chapters between the  Euro History/World History/US History tests [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 01:59, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)
**It probably won't be long, so it might not be worth a space on the shelf. Maybe an entire How-To book should be written on writing essays (such as free response) and preparing for the tests themselves. - [[User:Pingveno|Pingveno]] 02:48, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I've started plans for the How-To, but I'll need to obtain a good DBQ essay, along with the primary history source and any notes. There may be [[wikipedia:copyright|copyright]] problems with using any recent history sources, so whoever gets the DBQ would have to careful. Also, the How-to probably isn't currently up to Wikipedia standards for a stub or article under construction. - [[User:Pingveno|Pingveno]] 02:48, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)
*I'd imagine that test questions themselves would be under copyright. The documents probably won't be in most cases because everything pre a certain date is public domain, and presidential speeches/etc are always in public domain. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 03:51, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)
**Yeh, so maybe test questions would have to be made up. Any history teachers out there? :-)

Ok, now I'm thinking about turning the How to write a DBQ (see above) into a book on the AP test, or maybe just AP History. It would take time to form, and has free competition, such as [http://www.oswego.org/ Oswego High School]. Frankly, I'm not sure I have much time to put into making a book. I could just do the structuring and planning, and leave the rest to the community.

I could ask Oswego High School to release their material on essays, but am not sure who to talk to for legal advice. - [[User:Pingveno|Pingveno]] 00:46, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)

==French books: French for Anglophones, Programmation==

I'm really sorry I get no feed-back for the [[french]] book. I asked what people wanted in chapter 13 (French culture) for weeks, but got no answer... [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 23:46, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:Do not get discouraged.  Announce what you are doing at the French Wikipedia and see if you can get others there interested in helping out - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:28, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Avis aux amateurs : Le livre [[Programmation]] est initialisé. Il faudrait deja se mettre d'accord sur le sommaire. 
: For interested people the french [[Programmation]] book is started. [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 23:46, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)

==HTML, JavaScript and CSS Reference Manuals==
I was thinking to start a free online reference for Web related technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ...) using a Wiki.

I was thinking to start with an HTML reference where each tag is described on one page and where everyone one can contribute. The reference should contain lots of examples and cookbook style recipes. It should highlight differences between browser. It should focus on the standard but should also specify all browser specific features.

Once the HTML reference is started at least two other related reference manuals should be created: JavaScript and CSS. These three manuals  probably will make lots of references to each other.

Also, corresponding Cookbooks should be created, either as part of these reference manuals or as stand alone books.

Ideal features that do not seem to be supported by Wikibooks:
* syntax coloring for code examples
* sample HTML files that can be tested as one reads the reference
* live testing of code
* page templates so a whole book has a consistent layout

Existing books related to this subject: [[Programming:HTML]], [[Programming:XHTML]], [[Programming:JavaScript]] and [[Programming:CSS]].

== Windows Programming ==

Wikibooks has programming language tutorials but they're useless unless you can apply them to an operating system. They usually never go past doing something with a command prompt. (that's it, not even how to make a window) --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 23:27, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

*Well, to go beyond that you run into the problem of needing to use system-specific libraries (except in the case of something like Java which is environment-independent). There are entire books on just programming basic windows GUI programs in C++. However, it is usually required that the reader know the fundamentals of whatever language is being used, and a lot of what's covered is beyond the scope of an &quot;introductory&quot; textbook. The other problem is that it's language dependant, so you couldn't just have a generic book on &quot;Windows Programming&quot;; instead, a book titled &quot;C++ Programming for Windows&quot; or something similar would be more appropriate. But once again, it should be emphasised that it's not an introductory book and that the basic knowledge of the language is required to understand the concepts and examples.

A list of bugs and feature requests specific to Wikibooks.  To file one of the bugs/requests below directly with developers (and to see other bugs and feature requests), please see [http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org Mediazilla].

==Bugs==

===Leading colon bug?===
The colon &quot;:&quot;, where it is the first item in a line, performs an indent function. However, this is no longer the case if it is placed at the front of the very first line in a module. It used to work (all of my German advanced lessons started with an indented instructions paragraph; now they all start with &quot;:This page...&quot;), but just recently ceased working. Functionality is returned if a blank line is added before the line that begins with a colon. Is this a bug or a new quirk? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:27, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)

===Templates and interwiki links===
Are interwiki links not allowed in mediawiki messages?  I have placed

{{Meritbadgedisclaimer}}

On some talk pages, and it clearly doesn't work right, though it displays fine at [[Template:Meritbadgedisclaimer]]. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 20:11, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I noticed that headings don't get carried forward from mediawiki pages, but i dunno if thats it. Use this code instead, it works as below:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;The requirements to this merit badge are copyrighted by the Boy Scouts of America. 
 They are reproduced in part here under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fair_use fair use]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
looks like
:The requirements to this merit badge are copyrighted by the Boy Scouts of America. They are reproduced in part here under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fair_use fair use].

===Bug : MSIE runtime errors===
I keep getting runtime errors when browsing Wikibooks in MSIE: &quot;addcss not defined&quot;. It's usually around line 18 of whatever it is causing the error, but sometimes it reports other numbers like 17. I haven't gotten this on any other Wikimedia sites, just Wikibooks. Wikisource, Wikiquote, etc. all load normally. I have the problem on ''every'' page of Wikibooks, though. :(  --[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 19:22, 25 May 2004 (UTC)

=== Bug : &quot;Editing help&quot; popup window is too small ===
I just looked at &quot;Editing help&quot; for a refresher on something.  The window that popped up was smaller than I would like and it was set such that I could not resize it.  I don't have any idea how hard it is to change such things (is it embedded in the MediaWiki code?), but I thought I'd note my experience.  (...and I really like the MediaWiki's new look!) --[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 17:31, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
: What browser/OS are you using?  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

=== Bug : User login message ===

The message at the user login page below the &quot;Mail me a new password&quot; button is not shown properly: the anchor tags are seen (altough the links are clickable):

==Feature Requests==
===Searching within a book===
How do I restrict a search to just one book? [[User:JWSchmidt|JWSchmidt]] 14:31, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:There is no way at present to search inside one book.  You could approximate it by including the title of the book in your search, but there's no way to limit a search like that. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 22:10, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:The [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=stryer.TOC&amp;depth=2 books] at the Entrez Bookshelf have a nice search function. I'm not sure it will be possible to have multiple contributors construct a complex science or technical book without having useful search and indexing for the books. [[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 00:20, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I totally agree that we need to have a book-specific search capability. That was part of my argument when the site first started to have the pages structured with the name of the book like this: wiki/bookname/partofbook. However even though motion has not been in that direction, eventually we should have a book-speficic function. For example, now with the MediaWiki Table of Contents feature, each page of each book would have a tag in it linking it back to the TOC, and new software could limit searches to the pages containing that tag. However, we need to wait for the developers to do the work. Those guys are not paid as far as I know and are overwhelmed with work already... but in time it should happen (Karl being hopeful although without specific personal experience with how development process works). --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:: I don't know that any developer-time has been devoted to designing such a feature, but there definitely needs to be a standard &quot;Search within this book&quot; interface option, even if it is imperfect. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 22:16, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: '''Searches can be restricted to a single book''' by using the &lt;code&gt;prefix:&lt;/code&gt; option at the end of the search field. For example, searching for &lt;code&gt;Stephenson prefix:History of Rail Transport&lt;/code&gt; finds all pages in the [[History of Rail Transport]] that mention [[Wikipedia:George Stephenson|Stephenson]]. More information at [[WB:SEARCH]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0.9em&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Samwilson|Talk]] &amp;bull; [[Special:Contributions/Samwilson|Contribs]]&lt;/span&gt; ) &amp;hellip; 23:23, 10 March 2014 (UTC)

===Automatic Numbering===
Is there a way to do automatic equation numbering? It'd certainly be useful for the maths, and many of the science, books to be able to say 'see eq. 1.4c' (the third numbered equation in section 1.4) but trying to do that by hand is problematic. I'd probably end up with equation labels in the wrong order, and references that didn't match the referents. Using # doesn't work [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

: No, there isn't. Sorry... You can manually hack in TeX but it isn't pretty. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:48, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)

===Book-specific Layour Features===
The Wiki software doesn't seem to have anything specific to writing books.  Is any developer working on adding support?  As I understand it, even adding a TOC for all the pages in a book has to be done manually. [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]
: Any progress on this?  Specifications of desired features?  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 05:50, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)

===Tags &amp; external program for image generation===
It would be good idea to have an image tag similar to the math tag.  It would make images editable, with the commands inside the tag being processed by an external program to make pngs.  Most of the pictures in books are vector graphics anyway, and this would also help keep source files for a book in one place. Comments? [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]

: What do you mean? Like something for SVG? You might want to take feature requests to Sourceforge. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:06, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:: It wouldn't have to be SVG.  Currently, the math tag contains TeX markup.  We could have markup for a graphics program inside a ''graphics'' tag.  I was hoping that someone in charge here at wikibooks would take it up with the sourceforge developers if there is a consensus.  A single request there probably wouldn't be noticed.  [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]
:::Certainly both this, and automatic numbering would be useful for the more technical books. Wikibooks could use Gnuplot and/or SVG for graphs and diagrams, and support some of Latex's autonumbering features. What would it take to get this adopted? [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]
:::: What it would take is for someone to check in the code in sourceforge.  The math module seems to be a standalone one written in '''ocaml''' (!). [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]

Is there currently a standard program/style for creating diagrams for math/science books?  I have looked, and not found any. [[User:magefile|magefile]]
:My programming skills are too rudimentary to do anything the code. I suppose all we can do is put the requests in and see if anyone follows them up. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

===Entry Forms / Online Quizzes===
It would be nice for the Mediawiki engine to allow simple form creation (popup lists, textboxes, radio buttons) that could eventually be used for things like crude online quizzes or quick entry forms.
--[[User:DougHolton|DougHolton]] 21:30, 16 May 2004 (UTC)

===Random Page in Current Language===

While the &quot;Random Module&quot; feature is nice, I have encountered several pages in languages other than my own.  I'd recommend making an option in the preferences to limit the Random Page to the current language.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 06:08, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

=== Hide Own Contributions ===

Another useful filter would be to hide your own contributions -- particularly when you've authored many of the pages listed on the '''Recent changes''' page.

how to move a text up and down using keys?

You have to intercept the pressing of the keys, see the book example on how to get input from the keyboard and adapt it to detect those key presses, if you don't know the code for a particular key, print it to the screen after you have read it. if you think the example on how to get the keyboard data is missing something please ask again, please do sign you posts txs --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:41, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

== string::find return type ==

Which one is right?

* &lt;code&gt;string::find()&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; ? -- old version of [[C++ Programming/Code/IO/Streams/string]]; but the compiler I'm using today tells me &quot;warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions&quot;.
* &lt;code&gt;string::find()&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;size_type&lt;/code&gt; ? -- [http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/basic_string.html SGI reference]; but the compiler I'm using today keeps telling me &quot;error: 'size_type' was not declared in this scope&quot;.
* &lt;code&gt;string::find()&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;size_t&lt;/code&gt; ? -- [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/find.html another C++ reference]; this seems to compile -- on this ancient compiler I'm using today. But is it portable?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 02:32, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

:What compiler are you using?  &lt;code&gt;size_type&lt;/code&gt; is the correct one, by what is on the 2003 standard.
:Use &lt;code&gt;string::size_type return = yourstring.find( &lt;what you need to find&gt; );&lt;/code&gt; and the &quot;error: 'size_type' was not declared in this scope&quot; should be solved.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:06, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
:: Ah, that makes sense. Now my compiler accepts it. So actually
* &lt;code&gt;string::find()&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;string::size_type&lt;/code&gt;
:: right? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:04, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
:::Well the correct terminology is that the type is size_type, the &lt;code&gt;string::&lt;/code&gt; bit is the namespace/scope were the compiler can find a definition for it, in general a type can be the same or different across several namespaces/scopes sharing the same keyword, in this case it also exists in other namespaces/scope (ie &lt;code&gt;vector::size_type&lt;/code&gt;) and from your previous searches it seems that some time back it was a int.
:::For what is on the standard (2003) the size_type is implementation dependent and size_t will (with a high degree of certainty) be equal to size_type (but the standard doesn't commit to it and I couldn't find a clear reason why...)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:44, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
:::: Thank you. OK, I've updated [[C++ Programming/Code/IO/Streams/string]] based on the new understanding you've given me. As always, feel free to improve that page, even if it means reverting my mis-guided edits. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 13:58, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

== mathematical operations ==
a c++ programe that can display mathematical operations.

:No major problem, the only difficulty would be the output but that depends only on how much it needed to conform with the standard notation. You could output a TeX formula and render it elsewhere.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:50, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

== Ejecting optical drive ==

How to eject optical drive using c++ code on turbo c++ 3.0 compiler without using any windows library or header file?

:Only possibility is to call another program that executes that task. That operation is dependant on the OS.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:09, 28 April 2011 (UTC)

== MATALAB? ==
How does C++ compare with MATALAB? When should one use C++ instead of MATLAB? When is C++ superior to MATLAB? When is MATLAB superior to C++?

:That is a bit like discussing what the differences are between oranges and apples, even more problematic since the analogy is even closer since both are fruits.
:C++ is a programming language MATLAB is not even if it is scriptable the functions or objectives rarely are the same (MATLAB can be used to examine algorithms). Since they really can't be directly compared (unless we define a specific problem that can be addressed by both) the comparison has no meaning in generic terms, each does what it they are proposed to do. Also consider that MATLAB is a commercial product there is some fairly recent products that already replicate some functionalities of that software package in the case of programming languages there is no direct concurrency, there is only one C++ language even if some other languages can perform the same tasks they are ultimately completely distinct in use, capabilities and results (see the book section that compares C++ with similar languages if you need further info on that).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:39, 1 June 2011 (UTC)

In any case doing such logic in a single operation like that is bad coding practice, you can extend it into several operations unless compiler optimization needs to be turned off, in that case you should provide an appropriate comment.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:44, 4 February 2012 (UTC)

== Programming terms ==
hello there, I don't know anything about programming c++, but i ran on these words and would like to know what they are or how to get them:
can you help pls?


*- initial interface
*- data loggin
*- polling system
*- object inspector
*- gage component

thanks a lot {{unsigned3|Elzeinhasan}}

:This have no specific relation to C++, even if they can be declared as terms used in programming. All depend on the context they are used so it would be mostly guessing to what they mean as listed above.
:An interface can be many things but lets assume it refers to classes, in that case the initial interface may be indicating the parent class interface before derivation.
:Data logging relates to keeping &quot;data&quot; for review (a log).
:Polling system may be something like detecting if a system is active (for instance in dealing with threads) or in networks it can also be referring to deciding a priority by a vote (see distributed systems).
:Object inspector is just like it states, you should learn more about Object Oriented Programming first.
:The gage component can be so many things that I will not conjecture about it.
:Programming is hard, it is not only understanding a language but knowing what can be done with it, understanding all the intrinsics of a language. Knowing the code is even less important that fully understanding the concepts behind how and why things are implemented as they are. If you understand those, every language will become very similar to you, as they ultimately share the same basic functional purpose.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:11, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

what's the difference between \n &amp; endl;

:The first is a legacy notation from many older languages including C, the latest (I guess you intended to refer to std::endl) behavior is mostly equivalent but has further uses (streams) and guarantees see for example what was [http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/7350/ answered here], provides a complete coverage of the issue.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:32, 26 January 2015 (UTC)</text>

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) means any kind of programming that uses a programming language with some object oriented constructs or programming in an environment where some object oriented principles are followed.  At its heart, though, object oriented programming is a mindset which respects programming as a problem-solving dilemma on a grand scale which requires careful application of abstractions and subdividing problems into manageable pieces.  Compared with procedural programming, a superficial examination of code written in both styles would reveal that object oriented code tends to be broken down into vast numbers of small pieces, with the hope that each piece will be trivially verifiable.  OOP was one step towards the holy grail of software-re-usability, although no new term has gained widespread acceptance, which is why &quot;OOP&quot; is used to mean almost any modern programming distinct from systems programming, assembly programming, functional programming, or database programming.  Modern programming would be better categorized as &quot;multi-paradigm&quot; programming, and that term is sometimes used.  This book is primarily aimed at modern, multi-paradigm programming, which has classic object oriented programming as its immediate predecessor and strongest influence.

Historically, &quot;OOP&quot; has been one of the most influential developments in computer programming, gaining widespread use in the mid 1980s.  Originally heralded for its facility for managing complexity in ever-growing software systems, OOP quickly developed its own set of difficulties.  Fortunately, the ever evolving programming landscape gave us &quot;interface&quot; programming, design patterns, generic programming, and other improvements paving the way for more contemporary Multi-Paradigm programming.  While some people will debate endlessly about whether or not a certain language implements &quot;Pure&quot; OOP&amp;mdash;and bless or denounce a language accordingly&amp;mdash;this book is not intended as an academic treatise on object oriented programming or its theory. 

Instead, we aim for something more pragmatic: we start with basic OO theory and then delve into a handful of real-world languages to examine how they support OO programming.  Since we obviously cannot teach each language, the point is to illustrate the trade-offs inherent in different approaches to OOP.

= Introduction =
For an overview and history of Object Oriented programming OOP, please reference the [[Wikipedia:en:Object-oriented programming|Wikipedia article]].

The reader is expected to have a basic familiarity with programming in general, as we will give examples in a variety of languages.  We will explain any non-obvious syntax in the discussion, although this is besides the point.  The point is to give some indication of the flavor of the languages and some insight into the real-world application of OO ideas.

== Overview ==
We will divide up OOP into two phases&amp;mdash; classic and modern.  While this distinction is somewhat arbitrary, we believe it is instructive to consider OOP as it was practiced in the 1980s and early 1990s to demonstrate the motivation for more current practices.

'''What is Classic OOP?'''

Object oriented programming can be traced back to a language called [[w:en:Simula|Simula]], and in particular Simula 67, which was popular during the 1960s.  It was Simula that first instituted &quot;classes&quot; and &quot;objects,&quot; leading to the term &quot;object oriented&quot; programming.  By the early 1990s, enough experience had been gained with large OOP projects to discover some limitations.  Languages such as [[w:en:Self programming language|Self]], ideas like interface programming (also known as component or component-oriented programming), and methodologies such as [[w:en:Generic programming|generic programming]] were being developed in response to these difficulties.  Although often derided by OOP purists, it was the standardization of [[C++]] in 1998 &amp;mdash;including generic programming facilities &amp;mdash; that really ushered in the modern era of OOP, which we also refer to as Multi-Paradigm programming.  This is largely due to the popularity of C++ and the genius of the Standard Template Library ([[C++ Programming/STL|STL]]) demonstrating the utility of the new methodology to such a large audience.

=== Classic or Pure OOP ===
By 1980, Xerox had made [[:en:Smalltalk|Smalltalk]] available to outsiders, appropriately named Smalltalk-80.  Unlike other early programming languages, Smalltalk was a complete environment rather than just a language, a characteristic it had in common with Lisp at the time.  While Lisp machines were foreshadowing IDEs to come, Smalltalk was pioneering the GUI, ultimately influencing the development of the Macintosh computer.  Meanwhile, while Xerox was developing Smalltalk during the 70s, the C language was becoming popular thanks to UNIX being largely written in C.  Therefore, it was C &amp;mdash;an otherwise unlikely candidate &amp;mdash;that Bjarne Stroustrup fused with ideas from Simula to create &quot;C with Classes&quot; which was renamed to C++ in 1983.  In 1985, unsatisfied with Smalltalk, C++, and various object systems being tacked onto Lisp dialects, Bertrand Meyer created Eiffel.  Even though much more recent, Java essentially cloned vintage C++, and so we consider Smalltalk, vintage C++, Eiffel, and Java to be Classic OOP.  The object systems tacked onto Lisp (eventually standardized as CLOS in 1994) produced a very different methodology.  While we don't consider CLOS to be Classic OOP, it did influence modern OOP.

=== Modern OOP and Multi Paradigm Programming ===
Classic OOP developed a tendency to over-rely on a technique called &quot;inheritance,&quot; and eventually programmers realized that they were using inheritance for many things that are conceptually distinct.  Modern OOP basically incorporates these concepts, sometimes as language level features, sometimes through programmer practice.  The goal largely being looser coupling, easier maintenance and reuse.  Historically, David Ungar and Randall Smith completed their first working Self compiler in 1987, and by 1990 Sun Microsystems had picked up the project. While Self did not survive to really become a modern OOP language, it was a second generation OOP language.  Then, in the early 1990s, Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee pioneered generic programming and wrote early drafts of C++'s STL.  This began a (still ongoing) trend of incorporating functional programming ideas into more traditional OOP environments, in a kind of reverse CLOS.  Additionally, the early 1990s saw the development of [[:en:CORBA|CORBA]] and Microsoft's COM, which was a natural extension of the ideas that had led to the original Windows API.  This interface or component programming was a natural extension of encapsulation &amp;mdash;a basic tenet of OOP, as we will see.  All of these developments were aimed at further managing or reducing complexity.  Since this was the original goal of OOP and these techniques are used in conjunction with classic OOP, we find it appropriate to consider them in a treatment on &quot;OOP&quot;.

Contemporary object oriented programming, therefore, tends to be rather distinct from classic object oriented programming.  Particularly, getting used to which abstractions are the most useful for which problem types is more challenging now that there are more to choose from!  In a now classic book, Gamma et. al. introduced Design Patterns which helped to synthesize a variety of OOP techniques as applied to very common problems.

=== Future of OOP ===
The future contains more standardization of functional programming techniques in OOP environments, particularly lambda expressions and closures, and more robust meta-programming constructs.  Applying design patterns automatically through generic or meta programming techniques is an interesting area.

== What is an ''Object''? ==
Loosely, the term ''object'' is used to conjure up connections with real world objects like a chair or a guitar.  Except that for software, only some simplified abstraction is used, designed specifically for the task at hand.  While a real chair is composed of atoms and molecules and reacts to its environment based on the laws of physics and its atomic composition, a &quot;chair object&quot; will vary wildly depending on whether you're writing a game or a Point-of-Sale system for a furniture store.  Approaching your problem from the perspective of the chair will not be as productive as approaching the chair from the perspective of your problem.

In most of the languages used in this book, you will find that technically speaking (something akin to whistling 9600 baud, I understand), an object is &quot;an instance of a class&quot;.  Great, so what does that mean?  Well, we can trace this idea all the way back to Plato and his [[:w:en:Platonic idealism|Platonic Ideal]].  If you spent more time watching Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure than reading Plato, the idea is that the concept of a chair is a separate entity from any particular chair.  In other words, you can conceive of a chair in the abstract without thinking of any particular chair. 

In most OOP languages, this ''abstracted'' idea of a chair is called a ''class'' (from classification) and is a prototype or blueprint for actually making chairs.  The act of making something from the blueprint is often called ''instantiating'', and the made thing is both an ''object'' and an ''instance'' of the ''class'' that served as a blueprint.  As humans, we normally tend to do this in reverse &amp;mdash;we categorize objects we encounter.  We can easily identify chair-like things we run into as being chairs; this classification is where we got the term ''class'' in the first place.

It is easy to drift off into abstruse philosophical debates over objectness; in some areas like [[:w:en:Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge representation]] and [[:w:en:Ontology (information science)|computational ontology]] they are very relevant.  However, for a computer programmer, it is only necessary to figure out what your application needs to know about and do with chairs.  This can be a sufficiently difficult problem, it's usually not necessary to make it harder!

If you're still fuzzy on the whole idea, consider a more technical explanation.  Structs (structures), records, tables, and other ways of organizing related information predated object oriented programming.  You may be familiar with something like the following [[:en:Pascal|Pascal]] code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Pascal&quot;&gt;
 TYPE chair = RECORD
                model  : integer;
                weight : integer;
                height : integer;
                color  : COLOR;
              END;
&lt;/source&gt;

This doesn't actually create a chair variable, but defines what a chair variable will look like when you create one.  You could proceed to create arrays of chairs and so forth, and as we hope you've discovered for yourself, this kind of thing is quite indispensable for keeping your programs understandable.  Object oriented programming wants to push this advantage and milk it for every ounce of understandability, correctness, and simplicity it can. 

A fundamental problem solving technique is divide and conquer &amp;mdash;you just have to figure out how to partition your problem into sub-problems.  OOP innovators realized that we already had figured out ways to partition the problem, and it was reflected in the way we organized our data, like above.  If you looked at an application that had that chair RECORD in it, you would surely find lots of code for doing things with chairs. Why else would you bother to define it?  So, if you were to extract all of that code from all over the application and put it together with the chair definition, the reasoning goes, you should have an easier time ensuring that:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; all chair code is correct &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; all chair code is consistent with each other &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; there's no duplicated chair code &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; overall, you have less spaghetti because chair code is no longer tangled up with sofa code etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

So you take that chair definition and that code extracted from all over the application, and call that a class.  Take a chair variable and call it an object, and you're off to the races.

Since this is supposed to be a pragmatic book, let's look at our first example code, this time in Python code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 class Chair:
    model = None
    height = None
    weight = None
    color = None
    def has_arms(self):
        return self.model % 2 # odd-numbered models have armrests
&lt;/source&gt;

This doesn't look terribly different from the Pascal example.  The only difference is that class Chair now contains a '''has_arms''' method. Methods are functions that live within a class, and are usually used to process certain class specific data.  Hopefully the purpose is fairly clear, so let me point out the important part: '''has_arms''' is a ''calculated'' or ''inferred property''—this information is not stored directly.

In Python, you would use this class like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 c = Chair()
 c.model = 15
 c.height = 40
 c.weight = 10
 c.color  = 7

 if c.has_arms():
      do_something
 else:
      do_other_thing
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the &quot;c&quot; variable is an instance of the 'chair' Class, also known as a chair object.  We initialize the properties like you would in Pascal (this will change later!) and do one thing if the chair has arms and something else if it doesn't.  But we never initialized a &quot;has_arms&quot; property or anything of the like.

Since part of the goal is for you to become syntax agnostic, we present this same example again in C++:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 class Chair
 {
 public:
     int model;
     int weight;
     int height;
     int color;
     bool has_arms()
     {
         return model % 2 ? true : false;
     }
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 Chair c;
 c.model = 15;
 c.height = 40;
 c.weight = 10;
 c.color  = 7;

 if (c.has_arms())
      do_something();
 else
      do_other_thing();
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we would just like to mention that this is just the tip of the iceberg and this example is not representative of good style (in either language). There may seem like little purpose to making objects with so little functionality, and you could easily generate equivalent code that requires no new class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct Chair
{
    int model;
    int weight;
    int height;
    int color;
} c;

Chair c = {15, 40, 10, 7 };

if (c.model % 2)
     do_something();
else
     do_other_thing();
&lt;/source&gt;

The purpose of this section is to help you understand the terms; we will delve more into the benefits in the sections on encapsulation, [[w:en:Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], inheritance, and on and on.  However, let us say that while the &quot;low-level&quot; way might seem shorter and simpler, the object oriented benefits accrue with program size and complexity.  This is not surprising, as that's what OOP was designed for, but it does make simple examples hard to come by. So bear with us.

=== State Machines ===
If you are unfamiliar with [[w:en:Finite-state machine|state machines]], we won't delve too deep into them, but we highly recommend you look into them more. It's good for your clarity of thought process. Pedantically speaking, state machines are somewhat complicated mathematical constructs, and there are many interesting results that can be derived using the mathematical notation. But that's not our interest. Our interest is two-fold:

* For one, state machines provide a clear graphical way to illustrate potentially complicated application logic. First, you identify what your possible states are. For example, a server might be IDLE, CONNECTED, BUSY, ERROR, etc. Then, you define all the possible inputs, i.e. messages that the client might send, and for each state diagram the server's response to each input. This helps promote thoroughness as you think about reactions to unanticipated messages in various states.
* Secondly, state machines are a standard tool with a relatively standard notation. There are tools and libraries that will automatically make code given some canonical state machine format as input. This is effectively what regular expression processors do.

In object oriented programming, &quot;objects&quot; are sometimes implementations of [[Wikipedia:en:Finite_state_machine|state machines]].  State machines are a better conceptual underpinning for behavioral entities &amp;mdash;servers, regular expression processors, graphics engine, and virtual machines are all good examples of behavioral entities. 

A basic distinction between simple objects and behavioral entities is that simple objects do not change their behavior based on their value.  In fact, we tend to refer to their ''value'' rather than ''state''.  Simple objects tend to be kept in collections and searched through, passed to and returned from functions, and in general act like values. String and Rectangle are classic examples.  Later on, we'll discuss message passing as an abstraction of method invocation, and it may seem a little strange in the context of simple objects.

If you are still having trouble with the concept of objects, download and play with [http://www.bluej.org/ BlueJ], Most people &quot;get it&quot; within hours of using that IDE.

= Classes, Types, and Classic OOP =
There are some books on OOP that will tell you that the cornerstones of object oriented programming are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, or something along those lines. This is fairly typical of the classic OOP view, and there's nothing wrong with it per-se, it's just that we've generalized some ideas and decoupled things here and there since then.

== Simple Objects vs Behavioral Entities ==
There are two fundamentally different types of objects, created and designed with different purposes in mind, using different techniques.  We label these two types &quot;Simple Objects&quot; and &quot;Behavioral Entities,&quot; although these labels are our own.  Simple objects tend to represent values, like colors, coordinates, vectors, strings, etc, while behavioral entities tend to represent system components like services, message queues, engines, application logic, etc. 

Simple objects, if they own anything, are just wrapping what they own (like a system level handle).  Usually, however, simple objects are untied to anything else, have no complicated startup or shutdown, and have little overhead.  Simple objects tend to demand high performance, guaranteed correctness, discourage incorrect usage, are put in collections, searched, passed around, and generally manipulated by the rest of the program.  Writing good simple objects, combined with good collection libraries provided by your language of choice, can easily reduce the complexity of basic operations by as much as 80%. Simple objects tend to focus on the [[wikipedia:en:Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming)|encapsulation]] side of OOP rather than fancy message passing, as it's usually not a helpful abstraction to think of simple objects sending or receiving messages.

Behavioral entities tend to maintain their state in various collections of simple objects, like a server keeping a list of logged in users.  Behavioral entities tend to focus on behavior (to state the obvious), and configuring or tailoring that behavior in various circumstances.  Message passing mechanisms, including polymorphism, tend to be central to the construction of behavioral entities.  As a result, you tend to get whole families of similar entities, for example, an FTP server, an ssh server, an HTTP server, etc. that all have common functionality (like accepting connections). 

One of the primary forces behind OOP is separating out all of the common elements from these families and writing it once.  This has obvious advantages in debugging and maintenance: you only have to fix bugs in common code once.  Obviously, this is just abstraction at work but OOP gives you a well understood set of tools to do it with. Some languages features are tailored for one or the other.  For example, operator overloading is truly important for simple objects, but mostly irrelevant for behavioral entities.

== Encapsulation ==
Encapsulation is about risk management, reducing your maintenance burden, and limiting your exposure to vulnerabilities &amp;mdash;especially those caused by bypassed/forgotten sanity checks or initialization procedures, or various issues that may arise due to the simple fact of the code changing in different ways over time.  Technically, encapsulation is hiding internal details behind an opaque barrier so as to force external entities to interact through publicly available access points.

Think about it in the context of an OS kernel, like the [[w:Linux kernel|Linux kernel]]. In general, you don't want a common user level application modifying any internal kernel data structures directly &amp;mdash;you want applications to work through the [[w:Application programming interface|API]] (Application Programming Interface). Hence encapsulation is the general term we use for giving varied levels of separation between any core system elements and any common application elements. Otherwise, &quot;unencapsulated code&quot; would be bad for a number of obvious reasons:

* Applications could easily set invalid or nonsensical values, causing the whole system to crash. Forcing the application to use the API ensures that sanity checks get run on all parameters and all data structures maintain a consistent state.
* Internal data structures could be updated and change (even drastically so) between seemingly minor kernel updates. Sticking to the API insulates application developers from having to rewrite their code all the time.
* Applications could be used to &quot;snoop&quot; on each other, elevate their privileges, hog system resources, and violate any number of security protocols if they could directly manipulate kernel data structures.
* Application developers need little or no understanding of the Linux kernel to access kernel data.  The random number engine illustrates this well. It can be accessed through /dev/random instead of wading through kernel structures, and you still get the same data.

There are more, surely you can think of some.  You may be thinking, &quot;This is supposed to be about object oriented programming. I don't want to be a kernel developer!&quot;  Yes, we know, but the software kernel is the perfect example for discussing ''encapsulation'', even though the kernel possesses no object oriented code itself.  Encapsulation does not strictly apply to OOP, but it is used most within it.  All the kernel's internal data &amp;mdash;its message queues, its process lists, its filehandles, etc. &amp;mdash;are all encapsulated inside the kernel, and cannot be seen outside the kernel.  To work with the kernel, you must use its public interface, the API. For all the same reasons, writing your code in this way pertains the same benefits, even for writing a small app like a text editor or a mail client.

Since the entire purpose of encapsulation is to hide details and restrict access, it makes us consider exactly how access is restricted.  It also makes us consider what exactly is a detail that needs to be protected, and what exactly should be exposed to the outside world.  Figuring out what to expose, and especially at what granularity, is something of an art and we'll talk about it more in the section on interfaces.  We'll move on to access restrictions, which come in two basic kinds: compile time and run time.

Encapsulation is nothing but a combining of code and data as a single unit. It is achieved using the class concept, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 class addition
 {
   int a,b;
   public:
   void read()
   {
     cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\n Enter two numbers&quot;;
     cin&gt;&gt;a&gt;&gt;b;
   }
   void print()
   {
     cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\n first number:&quot;&lt;&lt;a;
     cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\n Second number:&quot;&lt;&lt;b;
   }
   int cal()
   {
     return a+b;
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example we are combining data (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;) and the methods (&lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cal()&lt;/code&gt;) in to a single unit called by &lt;code&gt;addition&lt;/code&gt;. Now we can access those methods by using objects.

=== Compile Time Enforced Access Restrictions ===
Many OOP languages have keywords along the lines of &quot;public&quot;, &quot;private&quot; and &quot;protected&quot;.  These three were used by C++ in particular and have been oft copied since.  They are used to group class members into three different levels of access:

* Public: Part of the public interface, anybody can access this member.
* Private: An internal detail, only members of this class may access this member.
* Protected: An internal detail also available to descendants of this class.

As you can see, this is not the most flexible framework for controlling access.  C++ also has a &quot;friend&quot; keyword to allow certain exceptions to access restrictions, but other problems persist.  One common problem results from single classes that grow very large: sometimes you want access restricted to a subset of a classes functions.  Alternatively, many generic frameworks like serialization or persistence need access to &quot;private&quot; data members.  Unfortunately, there is no way to differentiate between &quot;implementation detail&quot; and &quot;secret information&quot;.

These kinds of language-level keywords only serve to prevent programs that violate these restrictions from compiling (and most scripting languages are compiled to some intermediate form these days).  If somebody used a modified compiler that ignored these access restrictions (or in some languages just used some casting tricks), there is generally nothing to prevent a determined programmer from getting around these barriers.

=== Runtime Enforced Access Restrictions ===
Depending on the chip architecture in use, or possibly on the virtual machine running the byte code, it is sometimes possible to put &quot;protected&quot; information into areas of memory that will generate exceptions if read from, written to, or both.  This allows for a program to abort or take other action if encapsulation is violated.

=== Accessors and Virtual (or Calculated) Properties ===
Accessors are just functions that set or return properties of an object.  All too often, you'll see this kind of code in [[Java Programming|Java]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java5&quot;&gt;
class Dummy {
  private int val;
 
  public int getVal() { return val; }
  public void setVal(int val) { this.val = val; }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, &lt;code&gt;getVal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setVal&lt;/code&gt; are ''accessors'', or ''accessor functions''.  Java promotes lots of gratuitous accessors, and it often looks like unnecessary bloat.  Sometimes it is.  But often, people miss the point of encapsulation.  If &lt;code&gt;Dummy&lt;/code&gt; is well thought out, then &lt;code&gt;Val&lt;/code&gt; is conceptually a property of &lt;code&gt;Dummy.&lt;/code&gt;  The fact that in this case that property is kept as a couple of bytes in memory is besides the point for anybody using a &lt;code&gt;&quot;Dummy&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  Even more importantly, users of Dummies are protected from any changes to how Val is calculated.  All too often, the writer of a Dummy class is one himself, and &lt;code&gt;Val&lt;/code&gt; has no logical or conceptual significance, and the accessors just get in the way.

== &quot;State&quot; is Evil! ==
Something that we don't see reiterated enough: State (as opposed to change) is evil!  Or, (perhaps better said) maintaining ''unnecessary state'' is the root of all (''er... many'') bugs.  Let's look at an example, now in [[Ruby Programming|Ruby]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# We're displaying something over time, so we're dealing
# with both pixels and seconds.  Based on the zoom level,
# there is a correlation between them: pixels per second,
# or PPS.

class Timeline
 {
  PPS;
  current_position_in_seconds;
  current_position_in_pixels;
 public:

  GetPosInSeconds() {current_position_in_seconds;}
  SetPosInSeconds(s) {current_position_in_seconds = s;} # oops, we're out of sync

  GetPosInPixels() {current_position_in_pixels;}
  SetPosInPixels(p) {current_position_in_pixels = p;} #oops, we're out of sync
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, we're maintaining gratuitous state &amp;mdash; which is to say, we're holding the position in both seconds AND pixels.  This is convenient, and important for users of this class, but we've messed up the encapsulation here.  Whenever you set the value in one unit, you've destroyed the correctness for the other unit.  Okay, you say, here's a simple fix:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# We're displaying something over time, so we're dealing
# with both pixels and seconds.  Based on the zoom level,
# there is a correlation between them: pixels per second,
# or PPS.

class Timeline
{
  PPS;
  current_position_in_seconds;
  current_position_in_pixels;
public:

  GetPosInSeconds() {current_position_in_seconds;}
  SetPosInSeconds(s)
       {
          current_position_in_seconds = s;
          current_position_in_pixels = s*PPS;
        }

  GetPosInPixels() {current_position_in_pixels;}
  SetPosInPixels(p)
       {
          current_position_in_pixels = p;
          current_position_in_seconds = p/PPS;
       }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This fixes the obvious error with the previous example, but you've created a lot of work for yourself.  Now you have to keep every calculation in every method in the Timeline class duplicated to maintain consistency.  There could be dozens more where this came from (trust me).  And what about when you add in other units, say inches?  You have to duplicate all of that again.  Presumably, you see where this is heading: calculated properties, logical properties, virtual properties, whatever you like to call them.  Let's see this example again:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
class Timeline
{
  PPS; # Pixels Per Second
  IPS; # Inches Per Second
  current_position_in_seconds;
public:

  GetPosInSeconds() {current_position_in_seconds;}
  SetPosInSeconds(s) {current_position_in_seconds = s;}
 
  GetPosInPixels() {current_position_in_seconds*PPS;}
  SetPosInPixels(p) {current_position_in_seconds = p/PPS; }
 
  GetPosInInches() {current_position_in_seconds*IPS;}
  SetPosInInches(i) {current_position_in_seconds = i/IPS; }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we're presuming that the conversion factors of PPS and IPS are set correctly for simplicity, but otherwise we've vastly simplified our problem.  In twenty other functions we now write, we only have to worry about seconds, there's no consistency problems to worry about.  Additionally, if we need to change our base units from seconds to pixels, the Timeline users need never know.

== Inheritance ==
In many books, inheritance and OOP are made to seem synonymous, so it may seem strange that we deferred this discussion so far.  This is a reflection of the diminished role of inheritance over time.  In fact, one of the primary distinctions between Classic and Modern OOP lies in the usage of inheritance.  As the old adage goes, if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.  And so it happened that often times, inheritance was the only tool available to the erstwhile OOP programmer, and so every concept under the sun (or at least the ghostly glow of a CRT) was crammed into inheritance.  This lack of conceptual integrity and separation of concerns led to over-intimate dependencies and many difficulties.  In some languages, programmer technique evolved to make the concepts clearer using the same limited language functions, while other languages explicitly developed features to address these concerns.  Because you are almost certain to be exposed to some of this misguided advice at some point in your OOP learning, we'll try and explain some of the problems to you.  However, much of the discussion will go in the sections where they properly belong!

First off, though, what ''is'' inheritance?  Well, just like when your grandma dies and you inherit that gawd-awful ugly lamp, inheritance in OOP grants the child-class (or derived-class) all of the attributes of the parent (or super) class.  So, for example (in C++):

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Parent
{
public:
   int f() {return 10;}
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Child : public Parent
{
// see, nothing here!  But wait, we inherited the function f()!
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Child c;
int result = c.f();  // huh?  Oh, f() was inherited from the parent!
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Is-A vs Has-A Moley Baloney ===
The most over-used and rather worthless discussion on inheritance that you will see revolves around the &quot;Is-A vs Has-A&quot; discussion.  For example, a car is-a vehicle but has-a steering wheel.  The idea these authors are chasing is that your car class should inherit your vehicle class and have a steering wheel as a member.  You might also run across examples with shapes, where a Rectangle is-a Shape.  The point is, once again, abstraction.  The goal is to identify operations that operate only on the abstract notion of vehicle or shape and then write that code only once.  Then, through the magic of inheritance, you can pass in cars or rectangles or what-have-you to the generic code, and it will work, since the derived classes are everything the parent classes are, &quot;plus more&quot;.

The problem here is that inheritance is mixing together several things: you inherit &quot;typeness&quot;, interface, and implementation all at the same time.  However, all of the examples focus on interface while talking about &quot;typeness&quot;.  The abstract code doesn't care that a car &quot;is-a&quot; vehicle, just that the objects respond to a certain set of functions, or interface.  In fact, if you want to give your chair class accelerate(), brake(), turn_left() and turn_right() methods, shouldn't the abstract code be able to work on chairs then?  Well, of course, but that doesn't make chairs vehicles.

The kinds of solutions proposed in these &quot;is-a&quot; discussions have thus been mostly replaced by so-called ''interface'' programming and template programming.  Since template programming offers the loosest coupling, it focused some attention on the syntactic-semantic confusion.  Just because you have functions with the proper names, does that mean that they do what you think they do?  If a chair class has accelerate(), brake() and other vehicle type methods, does it make sense to have generic vehicle code work on this chair?  This led to more codifying of the assumptions of generic code: say, brake(INFINITY) ==&gt; STOPPED.  This implies that brake(x) != accelerate(-x).  So  chair may make a better vehicle than the Starship Enterprise!

=== Delegation and &quot;Dynamic Inheritance&quot; ===
You will see more about delegation later in the section on message passing, but we wanted to mention that many problems solved by delegation are often tackled by inheritance in languages that don't offer a delegation feature.  It's easier to show an example than explain, so in short, here's what delegation looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
interface I
{
   int f();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
class A implements I
{
   // A member variable that actually services all requests for
   //  calls to the I interface.
   delegate I private_i;

   A(I target)
   {
       private_i = target;
   }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
class B implements I
{
   int f() { return 1; }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
B b;  // create a B object to be the target of A's delegation
A a(b);  // Create an A object, passing in b

int foo = a.f();  // This call to f() is delegated to b.f(), causing 1 to be returned.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Inheritance accomplishes a similar feat

&lt;pre&gt;
class B
{
   int f() { return 1; }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
class A inherits B
{
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
A a;

int foo = a.f();  // returns 1 just like in the delegation example.
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, the delegate can change over time, whereas base classes cannot.  As a result, sometimes delegation is referred to as &quot;dynamic inheritance&quot;.


=== Multiple Inheritance ===
Multiple inheritance is where an object inherits its properties from many different classes.  For example, a house is both a &quot;building&quot; and a &quot;place to sleep in&quot;.

In multiple inheritance, an object inherits its properties from many objects (its ''parents'' or ''base classes'').  Therefore, we need to set up some classes, which we will use C++ for:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Building
{
  int size;
  int purpose;
  int price;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class PlaceToSleepIn
{
  int type; // tent, house, dorm, etc.
  bool pleasant_to_live_in; // true or false
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In C++, to inherit all the types, one uses the : operator, like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class House : public Building, public PlaceToSleepIn
{
  // all of the Building and PlaceToSleepIn variables are here!
  int rooms; // the number of rooms
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Looking at other popular languages : Multiple Inheritance is not a feature of Java, whereas it is used in C++ and Python&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Problems with Inheritance ===
One problem of Inheritance is that users of predefined classes may not know the location of the abstracted data. Therefore, it may not be easy for them to obtain it. Most of the problems with inheritance is due to design fragility or issues with the way a programming language implements it.

A normal issue in dealing with inheritance in large programs is called ''Fragile Base Class''. It arises when subclasses of the base class make assumptions about the property (the definition of the attribute) that are outside the contract provided by the base class.

An example could be of an attribute that was declared in the base class as ''byte'' but later turns out to need the range of ''word''. Changing this to ''word'' will necessitate at least recompiling all sub-classes but that might well not be enough because the sub-classes might have relied on the type of this attribute so that the source code also will need to be changed.

This intrinsic knowledge of the implementor about a given implementation is a problem in general programming but one that OOP/OOD does attempt to solve by offering greater opportunities for better programming practices. But as anything else with code it is up for the programmer to make use of it as to be as transparent as possible as to enable other to take full advantage of its code and so of the property of inheritance.

= Interfaces =
== Introduction ==
An Interface allows a class to expose a different set of properties and methods depending on context. For example, say that you were writing a Visual Basic 2005 application that manages clients. A client could be an individual person, or an organization. Part of the program generates address labels for clients.

You might define a person like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Class Person
    Public LastName As String
    Public FirstName As String
    Public Address As String
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

You might also define an Organization like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Class Organization
    Public Name As String
    Public MailingAddress As String
    Public BuildingAddress As String
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the main differences between a Person and an Organization are:
* a Person has both a first name and a last name, while an organization has only a single name
* an Organization has a separate mailing address, while a Person only has one address

So that you can have the one routine to print address labels, you create an interface called &quot;IAddressLabel&quot; (by convention, the name of an interfaces should start with a capital I).
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Interface IAddressLabel
    ReadOnly Property Name() As String
    ReadOnly Property Address() As String
End Interface
&lt;/source&gt;

You now change the Person class to implement this interface. The main thing to notice is that the Person's first and last names are combined on the label.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Class Person
    Implements IAddressLabel
    Public LastName As String
    Public FirstName As String
    Public Address As String
    Public ReadOnly Property Address1() As String Implements IAddressLabel.Address
        Get
            Return Address
        End Get
    End Property
    Public ReadOnly Property Name() As String Implements IAddressLabel.Name
        Get
            Return FirstName &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; LastName 'combine the first and last names for the address label
        End Get
    End Property
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

You now change the Organization class to implement the IAddressLabel interface. Notice that the address for the label is the mailing address, not the building address.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Class Organization
    Implements IAddressLabel
    Public Name As String
    Public MailingAddress As String
    Public BuildingAddress As String
    Public ReadOnly Property Address() As String Implements IAddressLabel.Address
        Get
            Return MailingAddress 'Use the mailing address for the address label
        End Get
    End Property
    Public ReadOnly Property Name1() As String Implements IAddressLabel.Name
        Get
            Return Name
        End Get
    End Property
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

Now you can group the disparate objects together as a collection of address labels!
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub Main()
    'create a person object
    Dim Bill As New Person
    Bill.FirstName = &quot;William&quot;
    Bill.LastName = &quot;Jones&quot;
    Bill.Address = &quot;123 Test Rd Testville 9123&quot;
    'create another person object
    Dim Sally As New Person
    Sally.FirstName = &quot;Sally&quot;
    Sally.LastName = &quot;Smith&quot;
    Sally.Address = &quot;999 Sample Ave Testburg 9222&quot;
    'create an Organization object
    Dim WidgetsInc As New Organization
    WidgetsInc.Name = &quot;Widgets Incorporated&quot;
    WidgetsInc.BuildingAddress = &quot;9123 Avenue Rd Sampletown 9876&quot;
    WidgetsInc.MailingAddress = &quot;P.O. Box 123 Sampletown 9876&quot;
    'Because all three objects implement the IAddressLabel interface, we can put them in the same array
    Dim MailingList(2) As IAddressLabel
    MailingList(0) = Bill
    MailingList(1) = Sally
    MailingList(2) = WidgetsInc
    'loop through, displaying the address label for each object
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 0 To 2
        MsgBox(MailingList(i).Name &amp; vbCrLf &amp; MailingList(i).Address)
    Next i
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Interfaces vs. Inheritance==
Interfaces and Inheritance can both be used to solve the problem of treating dissimilar objects collectively. For example, if you have a Cat class and a Dog class, but have some routine that needs to process them together, you could either:
* Create an Animal base class, which contains procedures common to both Cats and Dogs, and have Cat and Dog inherit from Animal, or
* Create an IAnimal interface, and have both Cat and Dog implement the interface.

Which approach to use depends on several factors. In general:
* If you are extending an existing class, then use inheritance. For example, if you already have an Animal class, and then discover a need to distinguish between Cats and Dogs
* If you are simply wanting to treat different objects as the same, then use Interfaces. For example, you already have Cat and Dog classes, and then discover a need to manipulate them in a similar fashion

== Factories ==
In the real world, factories are used to make stuff (e.g. automobiles).  In OO programming, factories also make stuff; specifically, OO factories &quot;make&quot; (instantiate) objects.

At least in Java, a constructor is unable to return a reference to an existing object&amp;mdash;it MUST return a brand-new object.  This can cause two problems&amp;mdash;too many object instances, and identical objects that are duplicates&amp;mdash;not the exact same object.

Factories are generally implemented as a public static method inside a class that has only private constructors.  In this way, only the factory can create instances &quot;Guaranteeing&lt;ref&gt;In Java, just having private constructors does not truly guarantee that all your objects came from the factory. Serialization and reflection can still create new instances without going through the constructor.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; that all instances of the object have been created by the factory.

The factory most often has an internal &quot;Cache&quot; of objects.  Whenever a user asks the factory for a new object, the cache is consulted first and one of the cached objects are returned if it is identical&amp;mdash;otherwise a new instance is created, added to the cache and returned.

Factories can also be used to inject user code into an &quot;Unmodifiable&quot; library.  It is possible to save and restore a user object that implements some important functions of a library object.  The library then uses that factory to get instances of the users object, and doesn't even know that the user has replaced a core component with completely new code.

As an example... Say the library uses Library objects all over the place. The library user can create a class (let's call it User) that extends Library. The user then calls LibraryFactory.set(User.class), and the factory stores it.  Inside the library, whenever the library wishes to use a Library object, it calls the LibraryFactory.Factory() function to get a new instance.  Without changing any code, the user can now completely change the way the library functions by overriding one or more methods in his User class.

This is used in various places inside the Java SDK to allow you to change how chunks of the SDK works without rewriting any of the code.

&lt;references/&gt;
== Reference Counting ==
== Garbage Collection ==

Garbage collection refers to freeing of heap-allocated memory.  The heap memory must be freed eventually.  Either the programmers code must explicitly free it, or some automatic system mechanism is required.

The most common mechanism is mark and sweep.  This is where the system knows of certain top-level classes (Threads and windows mostly).  It follows all the references from these &quot;Known&quot; classes to every class that can be reached and marks each class.  When it's done, it &quot;sweeps&quot; (gets rid of) every unmarked class.

Garbage Collection is a huge enabler of Object Oriented development&amp;mdash;it completely changes the way you design.  With code-based memory management it is necessary to have some way to track an object.  If it is created on the stack, it will be deleted when the method exits (so instances passed outside your method will become invalid).  If it is created on the heap, some object must delete it manually&amp;mdash;so if your method is going to create an object and pass it to two other objects that both retain the object, you have a problem.  Who deletes the object? The original method can't because it will have exited before the two objects are finished with it, and the two objects shouldn't know anything about each other.

This type of problem is often solved with &quot;Reference counting&quot; which is another form of garbage collection, but a manual one.  It also leads to fewer long-lived, free-roaming classes being created since they have to be tracked.

GC solves  problem, that of ownership.  If you are programming in a language with Garbage Collection, you may create classes on the fly, pass them off, retain a copy or forget about it...  You really can't go wrong.  When all instances have been &quot;Forgotten&quot;, the class disappears.

The drawback is that GC tends to take a solid chunk of time.  This is less true lately as at least Java has threaded GC and the ability to limit the amount of time GC will run.  There are actually dozens of tuning and reporting options and the ability to select from multiple GC systems to fit your need.

GC Implementations run from trivial (instance counting) to amazingly complex.  The current default Java VM uses a multi-tiered system with different mechanisms for new, middle-aged and old objects.  For instance, since almost all new objects tend to die almost instantly, the first section (Eden) is divided in half.  When one half becomes full, the currently referenced objects are copied to the other side.  The system switches to using the &quot;new&quot; side  and completely forgets about the old half.  There is no explicit code invoked to delete objects that are already gone.

This means that GC can actually be more efficient than traditional allocation/free since there is no free operation for nearly all objects.

Garbage collection should be considered essential to OO Design.

== Persistence ==
Persistence is simply the act of having objects that &quot;Stick around&quot; between invocations of your program.

This can be trivial (Just serializing an object out when exiting, serializing it back in when loading) to a full OO-database implementation.

[[Java Persistence/Hibernate|Hibernate]] is a good program that sits between your application and a database and ensures that your objects are properly persisted.

== Serialization ==
Serialization is converting an object to a stream of bytes that can then be saved to a file or transmitted over a network.

== Abstracting Classes ==
In this article along with the demo project I will discuss Interfaces versus Abstract classes. The concept of Abstract classes and Interfaces is a bit confusing for beginners of Object Oriented programming. Therefore, I am trying to discuss the theoretical aspects of both the concepts and compare their usage. And finally I will demonstrate how to use them with C#.

Hans - a German tourist - is driving through Skåne in southern Sweden with his caravan looking for a place to stay the night. He meets Johan - a local Swedish farmer.

'''Hans:''' Ursäkta mig. Vet du var husvagnscampingen ligger? &lt;br&gt;
''English: Excuse me. Do you know where the caravan camp is located? ''&lt;br&gt;


'''Johan:''' Ja, det är bara att följa den här vägen 5 kilometer och sedan svänga åt vänster. &lt;br&gt;
''English: Yes, just follow this road for 5 kilometers and then turn left. ''&lt;br&gt;


'''Hans:''' Tack så mycket! Jag har letat i flera timmar. &lt;br&gt;
''English: Thank you very much! I have been looking for several hours. ''&lt;br&gt;


'''Johan:''' Det är ingen fara. Fin husvagn förresten. Varifrån kommer du? &lt;br&gt;
''English: Don't worry about it. Nice caravan by the way. Where are you from?'' &lt;br&gt;


'''Hans:''' Jag kommer från Tyskland och är här i Sverige på semester över sommaren, som du kanske förstod. &lt;br&gt;
''English: I'm from Germany and I'm here in Sweden on vacation during the summer, as you might have imagined. ''&lt;br&gt;


'''Johan:''' Jo, det är ju många tyskar som kommer hit under sommaren. &lt;br&gt;
''English: Yes, there are many Germans coming here during the summer. ''&lt;br&gt;


'''Hans:''' Kanske för att Sverige är så underbart. Hur som helst måste jag åka nu. Tack så mycket för hjälpen igen! &lt;br&gt;
''English: Maybe because Sweden is so wonderful. Anyhow I have to go now. Thanks so much for the help again! ''&lt;br&gt;


'''Johan:''' Ha en trevlig semester. Hej då! &lt;br&gt;
''English: Have a pleasant vacation. Good bye! ''&lt;br&gt;

== Travelling ==
Travelling in Sweden is easy. Most people understand and speak good English. Some people are also skilled in German, French, Spanish, and Finnish. Most Swedes can easily understand Norwegian and well articulated Danish.

The biggest railway company is [http://www.sj.se/sj/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=10&amp;l=en Statens Järnvägar] (State Railroads).

The dominating airline company is [[wikipedia:Scandinavian Airlines System|Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS). SAS is a member of [[wikipedia:Star Alliance|Star Alliance]].

There are also buses travelling all over the country. The biggest provider of long distance bus travel is [http://www.swebusexpress.se/english/index.asp?mainid=418&amp;subid=0&amp;subsubid=0 Swebus Express].

=== Driving ===
In Sweden, driving is done on the right side of the road. For some rules and regulations, see [http://www.vv.se/templates/page3____11516.aspx Vägverket] (Swedish Road Administration). You can drive freely for one year on a valid non-Swedish driving licence, and forever if you have a driving licence from an [[wikipedia:European_Economic_Area|EEA]] country. Swiss or Japanese drivers’ licences can be exchanged for a Swedish licence for permanent residents.

Use of public transportation (like [http://www.geographia.com/sweden/bybus.html bus] or [http://www.geographia.com/sweden/byrail.html train]) is encouraged.  In Stockholm, there is a new charge for motorists to reduce congestion on the streets (see [http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5026&amp;date=20060926 The Local]).

=== ''Allemansrätten'' - All People's Right ===
In Sweden, one is allowed to walk in forests and fields and pick berries, mushrooms and flowers, even if it is on private property. This is in Swedish called 'allemansrätten'. There are some restrictions, which mostly anyhow fall under rules of politeness. The right only extends to &quot;the wild&quot; (as forests and meadows), not to obviously planted gardens. The area closest to a house also is exempted. Thus, for instance, one should not camp directly in another's front yard, nor can one light a fire if fire restrictions are in effect. You should not pick flowers that are rare or planted. This also extends to bracnches and twigs on living trees; the owners of a forest may have planted them, and probably plans to sell or let their children sell the trees as wood to the Swedish forest industry, Thus, you only may take fallen wood for a fire. when they are full-grown. You can camp one night on another's land. This right also does not extend to littering or bothering the animals, and you must pack out everything you take in,

=== Currency ===
The currency in Sweden is the Swedish krona (SEK) and öre, where 100 öre is 1 SEK.  Öre are no longer used if paying cash.  The exchange rate is about 8-9 SEK for 1 €. Many Swedes will use the word &quot;crowns&quot; for their currency, since that is the literal translation for ''kronor''.
To get cash in Sweden is easy, visit the closest ATM (called Bankomat or Minuten) with your VISA, MasterCard or similar.

The coins of less value than the 1 SEK are no longer used, however, you will still see prices such as 11 kronor 90 öre, but these prices are rounded to the closest amount in ''kronor'', if you pay cash.

== Vocabulary ==
* '' En bil '' - A car
* '' Ett tåg '' - A train
* '' En järnvägstation '' - A train station
* '' En buss '' - A bus
* '' En biljett '' - A ticket
* '' En maskin '' - A machine
* '' En biljettmaskin '' - A ticket machine
* '' En karta '' - A Map
* '' En bilkarta '' - A Roadmap

As you can see, words can quite easily be put together to form new words. One difference from English is that in Swedish you don't separate the words, you write &quot;en bilkarta&quot;, not &quot;en bil karta&quot;. Writing it with a space is called &quot;särskrivning&quot;, literally &quot;separate writing&quot;, and should be avoided as it's incorrect.

== Grammar ==
This is some short introductory grammar to the definite form in Swedish.
For a more complete guide, look at the page about [[Swedish/Nouns|nouns]].
===Singular===
To make a word into definite form, you add letters to the end of the word and remove the &quot;en&quot; or &quot;ett&quot; from before it. To do this, first you have to know if it's &quot;en&quot; or &quot;ett&quot;. In most cases, not always though (I'll come back to this), you simply add a &quot;n&quot; to &quot;en&quot;-words, and a &quot;t&quot; to &quot;ett&quot;-words if they end with a vowel. If they end with a consonant, you do the same thing, but add an &quot;e&quot; between the word and the ending.
* En bil -&gt; Bilen
* Ett hus -&gt; Huset
* En karta -&gt; Kartan
===Plural===
Plural isn't as easy, as there's five &quot;declensions&quot;. These you simply have to learn, but when you've read and spoken Swedish for a while, you won't have any trouble with it, you'll simply know when to use a certain ending. For now, ask a Swede, or look the word up in a dictionary. More on the declensions [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_grammar#Articles_and_definite_forms here] (link to wikipedia).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== How to use this vocabulary ===

All the conjugation forms of verbs, nouns and adjectives have been given here.

If the ending of the word has been, at some point, divided with a slash (/), it means that the ending has to be attached to the word by dropping the following letter(s) separated by the slash from the rest of the word.

E.g. ''en abborr/e, -en, -ar, -arna'' should become ''en abborre, abborr'''en''', abborr'''ar''', abborr'''arna'''''. Notice how the &quot;e&quot; in abborre is dropped, leaving the stem &quot;abborr&quot;, to which the endings ''-en'', ''-ar'' or ''-arna'' are attached.

If there is no dividing slash at some point in the end of a noun or a verb, the ending is directly attached to the word. E.g. ''en arm, -en, -ar, -arna'' becomes ''en arm, arm'''en''', arm'''ar''', arm'''arna'''''.

Also notice that ''en'' and ''ett'' are both articles and are dealt with in the grammar section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In quantum field theory, action is given by the functional S of field configurations (which only depends locally on the fields), then the time ordered vacuum expectation value of polynomially bounded functional F, &lt;F&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;F&gt;=\frac{\int \mathcal{D}\phi F[\phi]e^{iS[\phi]}}{\int\mathcal{D}\phi e^{iS[\phi]}}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, on shell equations for the classical case usually have their quantum analog because, in a hand wavy way, when integrating over regions of the configuration space which are significantly off shell, the rapidly oscillating phases would tend to produce &quot;destructive interference&quot; wheareas for regions close on shell, we tend to have &quot;constructive interference&quot;.

For example, what is the analog of the on shell [[w:Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange equation]]s, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta}{\delta \phi}S[\phi]=0&lt;/math&gt;?

If the functional measure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\phi&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be translationally invariant (we'll assume this for the rest of this article, although this does not hold for, let's say nonlinear sigma models) and if we assume that after a Wick rotation 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{iS[\phi]}&lt;/math&gt;, 

which now becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-H[\phi]}&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''H'', goes to zero faster than any reciprocal of any polynomial for large values of &amp;phi;, integrate by parts (after a Wick rotation, followed by a Wick rotation back) to get the following [[w:Schwinger-Dyson equation|Schwinger-Dyson equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;\frac{\delta}{\delta \phi}F[\phi]&gt;=-i&lt;F[\phi]\frac{\delta}{\delta\phi}S[\phi]&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

for any polynomially bounded functional ''F''.

These equations are the analog of the on shell EL equations.

If J (called the source field) is an element of the dual space of the field configurations (which has at least an affine structure because of the assumption of the translational invariance for the functional measure then, the generating functional Z of the source fields is defined to be:

&lt;math&gt;Z[J]=\int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{i(S[\phi]+&lt;J,\phi&gt;)}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^n Z}{\delta J(x_1) \cdots \delta J(x_n)}[J]=i^n Z[J] &lt;\phi(x_1)\cdots \phi(x_n)&gt;_J&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;&lt;F&gt;_J=\frac{\int \mathcal{D}\phi F[\phi]e^{i(S[\phi]+&lt;J,\phi&gt;)}}{\int\mathcal{D}\phi e^{i(S[\phi]+&lt;J,\phi&gt;)}}&lt;/math&gt;

Basically, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\phi e^{iS[\phi]}&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a functional distribution (this shouldn't be taken too literally as an interpretation of QFT, unlike it's Wick rotated statistical mechanics analogue, because we have time ordering complications here!), then &lt;math&gt;&lt;\phi(x_1)\cdots \phi(x_n)&gt;&lt;/math&gt; are its moments and Z is its Fourier transform.

If F is a functional of &amp;phi;, then for an operator K, F[K] is defined to be the operator which substitutes K for &amp;phi;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;F[\phi]=\frac{\partial^{k_1}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}}\phi(x_1)\cdots \frac{\partial^{k_n}}{\partial x_n^{k_n}}\phi(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and G is a functional of J, then &lt;math&gt;F[-i\frac{\delta}{\delta J}]G[J]=(-i)^n \frac{\partial^{k_1}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}}\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x_1)} \cdots \frac{\partial^{k_n}}{\partial x_n^{k_n}}\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x_n)} G[J]&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, from the properties of the functional integrals, we get the &quot;master&quot; Schwinger-Dyson equation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi(x)}[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}]Z[J]+J(x)Z[J]=0&lt;/math&gt;

If the functional measure is not translationally invariant, it might be possible to express it as the product &lt;math&gt;M[\phi]\mathcal{D}\phi&lt;/math&gt; where M is a functional and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a translationally invariant measure. This is true, for example, for nonlinear sigma models where the target space is diffeomorphic to &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. However, if the target manifold is some topologically nontrivial space, the concept of a translation does not even make any sense.

In that case, we would have to replace the S in this equation by another functional &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}=S-i\ln(M)&lt;/math&gt;

If we expand this equation as a Taylor series about J=0, we get the entire set of Schwinger-Dyson equations.

Now how about the on shell [[w:Noether's theorem|Noether's theorem]] for the classical case? Does it have a quantum analog as well? Yes, but with a caveat. The functional measure would have to be invariant under the one parameter group of symmetry transformation as well.

Let's see how it goes. Let's just assume for simplicity here that the symmetry in question is local (I don't mean local in the gauge sense. I mean local in the sense that the transformed value of the field at any given point under an infinitesimal transformation would only depend on the field configuration over an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point in question.). Let's also assume that the action is local in the sense that it is the integral over spacetime of a Lagrangian and that &lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}(x)]=\partial_\mu f^\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt; for some function f where f only depends locally on &amp;phi; (and possibly the spacetime position). If we don't assume any special boundary conditions, this would not be a &quot;true&quot; symmetry in the true sense of the term in general unless f=0 or something. Here, Q is a derivation which generates the one parameter group in question. We could have antiderivations as well, like for example BRST and supersymmetry. Let's also assume

&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\phi Q[F][\phi]=0&lt;/math&gt; for any polynomially bounded functional F. This property is called the invariance of the measure. And this does not hold in general. See [[w:anomaly (physics)|anomaly (physics)]] for more details.

Then, 

&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\phi Q[F e^{iS}][\phi]=0&lt;/math&gt;, which implies

&lt;math&gt;&lt;Q[F]&gt;+i&lt;F\int_{\partial V} f^\mu ds_\mu&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt; where the integral is over the boundary. This is the quantum analog.

Now, let's assume even further that Q is a local integral &lt;math&gt;Q=\int d^dx q(x)&lt;/math&gt; where q(x)[&amp;phi;(y)]=&amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;(d)&lt;/sup&gt;(x-y)Q[&amp;phi;(y)] so that &lt;math&gt;q(x)[S]=\partial_\mu j^\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;j^{\mu}(x)=f^\mu(x)-\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)}\mathcal{L}(x) Q[\phi]&lt;/math&gt; (this is assuming the Lagrangian only depends on &amp;phi; and its first partial derivatives! More general Lagrangians would require a modification to this definition!). Note that we're NOT insisting that q(x) is the generator of a symmetry (i.e. we're NOT insisting upon the gauge principle), but just that Q is. And let's also assume the even stronger assumption that the functional measure is locally invariant:

&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\phi q(x)[F][\phi]=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, we'd have

&lt;math&gt;&lt;q(x)[F]&gt;+i&lt;F q(x)[S]&gt;=&lt;q(x)[F]&gt;+i&lt;F\partial_\mu j^\mu(x)&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,

&lt;math&gt;q(x)[S][-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\phi(x)][-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}]Z[J]=\partial_\mu j^\mu(x)[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\phi(x)][-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}]Z[J]=0&lt;/math&gt;

The above two equations are the '''Ward-Takahashi identities'''.

Now for the case where f=0, we can forget about all the boundary conditions and locality assumptions. We'd simply have 

&lt;Q[F]&gt;=0.

Alternatively,

&lt;math&gt;\int d^dx J(x)Q[\phi(x)][-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}]Z[J]=0&lt;/math&gt;

== An example: &amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ==

To give an example, suppose

&lt;math&gt;S[\phi]=\int d^dx \left (\frac{1}{2} \partial^\mu \phi(x) \partial_\mu \phi(x) -\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi(x)^2 -\frac{\lambda}{4!}\phi(x)^4\right )&lt;/math&gt;

for a real field &amp;phi;.

Then,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi(x)}=-\partial_\mu \partial^\mu \phi(x) -m^2 \phi(x) - \frac{\lambda}{3!}\phi(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;.

The Schwinger-Dyson equation for this particular example is:

&lt;math&gt;i\partial_\mu \partial^\mu \frac{\delta}{\delta J(x)}Z[J]+im^2\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x)}Z[J]-\frac{i\lambda}{3!}\frac{\delta^3}{\delta J(x)^3}Z[J]+J(x)Z[J]=0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^3}{\delta J(x)^3}&lt;/math&gt; is not well-defined (&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^3}{\delta J(x_1)\delta J(x_2) \delta J(x_3)}Z[J]&lt;/math&gt; is a distribution in x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), this equation needs to be regularized!

*Computer Hardware

[http://www.osnews.com/story/15819 AROS] is one of the intermediate levels between the computer hardware and the user. It is an open-source, clean-room implementation of AmigaOS 3.x that can be run on many different computer architectures. It runs primarily on x86 hardware but also on motorola 68k, x86_64bit, PowerPC and ARM. It can be installed to HD but also booted directly from CD/DVD or installed to a USB key for portability. This page will cover enough to be able to run a LiveCD or LiveDVD on your office/home PC and, ultimately, to use it. 

AROS is an hobby OS and is not destined to overtake Windows(TM), MacOSX(TM), Android(TM) or Linux but to act as an alternative. AROS, like most other open source initiatives, requires people to take action rather than request features. Missing features will arrive in time and if you do not wish to develop software but wish to push AROS forward then you can optionally donate to any related [http://www.power2people.org/ bounties]. 

Unfortunately, Aros has few developers so upgrades and improvements can take months or even years, so some patience is required. If you require a finished product, then use your existing OS (operating system), but look into our efforts every few months. 

At the moment, AROS is '''not''' recommended to be installed on a working vital data holding machine. Instead, installing to its own separate hard disk or '''usb stick''' is much better. AROS has some multimedia features and has internet access which may require manual editing to use. Most importantly, use AROS to its maximum potential as it stands now, find ways to have fun with it and share your experiences. 

AROS core is now [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/IncompleteAPIs ~80%] finished and is usable, so keep in mind that the software is still considered ALPHA/BETA and in development. Currently AROS is fun to play with on a curiosity level, but it is also interesting to program.

Alternatively, the lively IRC channel setup at the IRC network Freenode. To reach it, use the following data: Channel: #aros  Server: irc.freenode.net   or  irc://irc.freenode.net/aros - the channel is for discussing everything AROS. An alternative irc.superhosts.net - #team*amiga - port 6667 for everything amiga on Sunday Nights. 


AROS is opensource so basically everyone can take part. The source is public and there are daily new commits.and so based on these commits AROS is automatically compiled daily, result are the nightly builds which you can [http://www.aros.org see and download]. 

The nightly builds NB are only used for testing changes, they influence software and for distribution maintainers or used for your own distribution. They are very basic, miss functionality and are not suited for end users. 



There are two standards ABI0 and ABI1. All end user distributions (except 68k based ones) are ABI0 but this will change in the future. 

* ABIv0-on-trunk is now the defacto build that provides all the features of AROS Trunk but is capable of running ABIv0 applications. This branch is a base for Icaros 2.0 and higher (WIP late 2014) The source code is freely available in gitorius and AROS SVN. 
* AROS Trunk (aka ABIv1) = Mostly used by developers but eventually by users when important fixes are implemented. 
* ABIv0 = Deprecated and now used stable branch that does not get new features but receives critical fixes 

AROS is aiming to be highly Amiga OS compatible which it is but sadly it is not totally 100%. The changes being made to ABIv1 will require recompilation of software but to avoid problems and numerous recompilations ABIv0 and ABIv1 were created. Although ABIv1-on-trunk is updated, the old ABIv0 is not updated often (backports of changes to ABIv1 now and then). ABIv1 is the branch where most development is done, making it more modern than ABI0. It will need some time to finish ABI1 but the developers are now defining a stable ABI1 and will be the new versions for all distributions. 


AROS is cross-platform. It supports both big-endian and little-endian platforms. Supported are X86, X64, ARM, PPC and 68k. PPC is at the moment paused. 68k integration is mainly done with UAE but some tests are done on native Amigas. You cannot use X86-64 bit software on X86 or PPC compiled software on X86 and so on. 




===History===

The project was originally started by a small group of Amiga [http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/aros.html enthusiasts] in 1995. These individuals were mainly computer-based college university students at the start, though that student trend has diminished since. An interview with Aaron Digulla [http://arosshow.blogspot.com/2006/12/interview-with-aaron-digulla-who.html here] 


* Much of the early years was concerned with exec, dos and intuition libraries. 
* Early 1999, Haage &amp; Partner used parts of the code in AmigaOS 3.9. 
* March 2001, floppy disk images of AROS became available. 
* Early 2002, AROS changed its name from Amiga Replacement Operating System to Amiga Research Operating System. It was clear that AROS was more than just a replacement. 
* June 2002, AROS devs decided to use Zune (MUI 3.8 rewrite) as the GUI system. 
* November 2002, Eric Schwartz drew Kitty for AROS usage. 
* Early 2003, AROS.org underwent a graphics facelift. 
* Late 2003, GCC C compiler arrived. 
* Early 2004, Aros-Exec opened. 
* Early 2005, Aros Max bootable CD arrived. 
* Late 2005, SFS filesystem ported and allowed, at last, fast access to Doom, etc (cutting the start time from minutes to seconds) and network support arrived. 
* Early 2007, AROS.org underwent another graphics facelift. 
* Mid 2007, the name was changed to AROS Research Operating System after A.Inc. sued Hyperion with a trademark violation. 
* Late 2007, the hard disk installer added and VmwAROS (later called Icaros Desktop) distro launched. 
* Early 2009, Our first usable web browser (OWB)
* September 2010, first wireless support appears and AspireOS started as a distro 
* Early 2012, the first paper-cut bugfix and Fab's Odyssey Web Browser ported 
* Early 2014, backport of most features of ABIv1 into mainstream everyday use

===Future===

Future goals for AROS include expanding its underlying retargetability to support even more diverse architectures, provide [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=3181&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;type=&amp;mode=0 memory protection features] and user level file security, and many other wonderful features missing from AmigaOS &amp;mdash; while still providing as much source level compatibility as is possible (however it is accepted that to achieve some goals code certain things may require a little recoding).





==Different Versions of AROS==


* 1996 - The linux hosted version for i386 was the first to arrive 
* 1998 - i386, The native version for i386-based PC AT computers and compatibles.
* 2004 - x86/64, The native version for 64-bit (x86_64, amd64) PC computers.
* 2007 - efika, The native version for PowerPC Efika computers.
* 2009 - sam440/ppc, The native version for Sam440EP, Sam440EP Flex and Sam460ex computers.
* 2010 - m68k, The native version for m68k Amigas or WinUAE
* 2013 - raspi/armfh, early native version for ARMv6 based Raspberry Pi computers.




=== Distros ===

For end users there are the distributions, mostly created and maintained by one person. 

* For i386 (X86) here are the choices: [http://vmwaros.blogspot.co.uk/ Icaros Desktop], [http://www.aros-broadway.de/files/6f250c95673eb3cbe65221a5e1633eb8-75.html Broadway], [http://www.aros-broadway.de/files/6f250c95673eb3cbe65221a5e1633eb8-75.html Aeros], AMINUX, [https://sites.google.com/site/arosaspireone/home AspireOS] 
* For ARM there is Aeros 
* For 68k [http://www.natami-news.de/html/aros_vision.html AROS Vision] and [http://www.aeros-os.org/styled-11/ AMINUX] 


Another overview of the distributions available:

* Icaros Desktop (Native X86, the heavyweight, including lots of software and extensive 68k emu using AROS Vision see below) 
* Broadway (Native X86, more components than AspireOS, should be updated soon) 
* AspireOS (Native X86, lightweight distribution dedicated to Notebooks/Netbooks, Janus-UAE included for 68k emulation but no roms included)

* AROS Vision (Native 68k, including lots of software, running on emu or even on real hardware) 

* Aeros (Hosted X86 and ARM, combining AROS (Broadway) and Linux apps) 
* AMINUX (similar idea than Amithlon, using a complete Knoppix Linux distribution and directly starting emulation). 


* [http://www.icarosdesktop.org/ Icaros] is a collection of the latest and best AROS applications for x86 hardware, which are tested and ready for use. Download the Icaros ISO image from Icaros and burn it to a recommended DVD or CD (depending on size) using your favorite CD/DVD burning program (most have a burn iso to cd/dvd option). You are looking to burn the contents inside the iso and NOT burn just the iso to a disc.

* Acer AspireOS specific small CD based distro [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=5809&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;type=&amp;mode=0  AROS-Exec discussion] and [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/misc download] 

* [http://www.aros-broadway.de/ AEROS] is a new distribution of AROS hosted on Linux 

* [http://www.aros-broadway.de/ Broadway] is new multimedia based distribution for x86 hardware similar to Icaros in taking the best that AROS offers and provides in a user friendly way to get started very quickly. 

* The [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php nightly builds] or [http://aros.sourceforge.net/downloads/ same builds here] are made automatically every night directly from the SVN (Subversion) tree and contain the latest code for the AROS operating system. However, they have not been tested in any way and can be horrible broken, extremely buggy and may even destroy your system if you're unlucky. Most of the time though, they work fine but with a reduced number of applications i.e. no web browser or multimedia player. 




===Native===

AROS Native is the term coined to AROS being run without any OS underneath it. It runs alone just like AmigaOS(TM) did.

As this version does not benefit from &quot;Hosted&quot; drivers, dedicated ones have to be ported/written. Hence the smaller range of supported hardware peripherals. See Compatibility section below.

AROS-Native, for intel architecture machines, is distributed on bootable ISO's for both 32bit and 64bit platforms. Mixing 32bit and 64bit items is not recommended. 





===Hosted===

AROS was originally developed on Linux running on an Intel-based computer, but runs on many more machines and operating systems (FreeBSD, Linux and Windows). This may sound strange: an OS running on top of another OS. 
Basically, this is to take advantage of existing Linux or Windows drivers (audio, internet) and working environment with which people may be already familiar. A nice term for what AROS does is &quot;Hosted&quot;. 

If you use Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch Linux, it's probably best to use the [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=showfile&amp;file=development/cross/gimmearos.zip gimmearos] script.

==Installation media==

As AROS is still beta, the recommended installation media for AROS x86 is CD-RW DVD-RW, since we can fit the whole system onto a single disk and can be reused when the next version is released. Good branded discs like Taiyo Yuden or Verbatim should be used to reduce frustration later. 

Since nobody currently sells AROS on CDROM or DVD (or any other media for that matter), you will need access to a CD/DVD burner to create the installation disk yourself. After it is on a CD or DVD, then access and writing to USB pendrives becomes available, as well as using good USB manufacturers like Sandisk, Kingston, etc rather than some other no-names. 

The LiveCD/LiveDVD idea was designed to try out, test drive, various operating systems without having to install them to your working system but remember that...

* Once installed to hard-disk, AROS takes about 10 seconds to boot - it takes about 1 minute to boot from a CD/DVD 
* Most apps respond quickly when launched from hard disk. But CD only access it is a little slower. 

If you going to use a virtual emulator, then burning the iso file is '''not''' necessary. 

Please read the Icaros Manual - within Extras/Manuals drawer/folder... or the [http://www.icarosdesktop.com/icarosfiles/IcarosDesktop_manual.pdf Icaros] Desktop website. 


For ARM Pi Aros, copy the files onto a FAT32 formatted SD card. 





====Writing====

Simply download one of the distros above and burn it to a CD-RW or DVD-RW using your favorite CD/DVD burning program (most burning software have a burn iso option). The ideal writing speed is 2x or 4x, higher speeds can give errors and problems.

Check the writing integrity of your CD or DVD if your software has an option to do so before going any further. 





====Booting====

Simply insert the CD into the first CDROM/DVD drive and reboot the computer. The boot is fully automatic, and if everything works you should see a multiple choice graphic card screen after a little while (CDs can take up to a minute - DVDs can be a little longer). 

Some recorded CDs or DVDs have issues with other makes of CD or DVD players, please bear this in mind. 

Since there are various sources of hardware in the x86 world, it is difficult to provide complete support. If the CD/DVD should hang and appear to be doing nothing after a few minutes, you need to reboot and edit the grub boot line (multiple choice screen of video card options). 

With the advent of UEFI from 2011 onwards booting get more confusing. change the BIOS specification from UEFI to CSM. disabled the Fast Boot config so it would recognize my portable DVD-drive and changed the Boot-sequence. also disabled the Secure Boot configuration. 



=====UEFI and GPT=====

* Check that UEFI (the new BIOS) has options set for UEFI boot and not CSM bois mbr boot 
* SATA drive is set for AHCI and not Legacy 

though this can have '''issues''' with any OS already on the hard disk. If in doubt, do nothing and seek advice. 



===== BIOS and msdos =====

*It might require some adjustments to the BIOS setup (usually by pressing DEL or F2 or F1 F12 or ESC on the very early boot up of the computer). Then either one of the options will enable booting from CDROM, as it is quite often disabled by default. Or the other way to is re-arrange the boot order so that CD or DVD comes out on top. Try looking here [http://www.windowsreinstall.com/articles/bios/ Windows] or [http://www.hiren.info/pages/bios-boot-cdrom Bios] or [http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Bios-to-Boot-from-a-CD-ROM Boot] or web search &quot;BIOS BOOT CDROM&quot;

The easiest way to boot from the AROS installation CD or DVD is if you have a computer that supports booting from an optical drive. Most Pentium 2's and above have that BIOS option but... 

* At the '''SAME''' time, check if the SATA/AHCI option is set to Emulate or IDE Legacy, though this can have '''issues''' with any OS already on the hard disk. If in doubt, do nothing and seek advice. 

* check that under BIOS settings you '''DO NOT''' have plug&amp;play OS selected as Aros at this point is unable to route interrupts on its own and needs the BIOS to do that. 

'''Save''' options changed at the end. 





=====Advice for various machines=====

Stages involved in a typical AROS boot start up but be aware that VESA mode gives no visual output whilst booting. Use vga (4bit mode).


&lt;pre&gt;
[Kernel]
[PCI] Everything OK
[ATA] detect hd &amp; cd drives 
[AHCI]
[Boot] choose suitable boot option 
[packet] 
[DOS] 
[MSS] usb setup
[drm] nouveau 
[ATI]
&lt;/pre&gt;
; If boot fails, please give us some indication where the boot stops and the message(s) on screen. 


'''Icaros 2.0 

error code (-6) when ahci.device(has writing to disk problem but not reading) is enabled..

change this line in your grub and reboot if that helps

#module /Devs/ahci.device      &lt;&lt; disable
module /Devs/Alt/ata.device    &lt;&lt; add this line instead

and sata controller can be ahci in bios 




'''Icaros 1.5.x 

At the grub boot prompt, position the cursor over the vga option with the up/down arrow keys and press the letter '''e'''. Using the left/right arrow keys to move and backspace/delete to edit the line where ATA= is to 



;if freezes/stops at [ATA--] ata_Scan  Waiting for Buses to finish Initialising 
* ATA=32bit,nodma 
* ATA=32bit,nosata2pata
* ATA=nopci,nolegacy    (This should disable ATA). 

;if old VIA or SIS chipset motherboards with cdrom read io errors or ATA or the start up just freezes  
* ATA=nodma,nopoll 

Press Ctrl and X together to exit and boot with the new options. Just experiment with different variations until successful. Those working options will need to be reused with every reboot of AROS until you can edit the grub.cfg and make it permanent ie. install to hard disk or usb. 

 Other useful grub command line options - nomonitors, noacpi, vesahack, nopoll 



* A laptop may also have an internal WLAN/Bluetooth-adapter and a hardware switch to switch it off. 
* If you have a USB mouse connected, try using a PS2 mouse. If you have one just for testing, or removing the USB mouse and put back later on in the boot 
* BEWARE of hubs. Moving them to the ports on the back of the machine allowed everything to start working in a &quot;enableusb&quot; removed situation - ie. '''execute s:poseidon-startup''' later 
* Legacy mode sometimes is only available on e.g. the front or just only the backports. 



;Pre 2000 computers which do not have USB boot options can use the floppy disk boot method (either AROS or [http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html Plop] change Setup-&gt;Bootmanager-&gt;Force USB 1.1) which will continue booting from the USB afterwards. 


;Pre 1996 computer does not support booting directly from CDROM you can create a boot floppy (either AROS or [http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html Plop]) and use it together with the CDROM. Simply insert both the boot floppy and the CD into their respective drives and reboot. AROS will start booting from the floppy, but after the most important things have been loaded (including the CDROM filesystem handler) it will continue booting from the CDROM.


;Mac Intel x86 64bit 
* If you use  VESA mode, you can see the debug log if you add 'vesahack' to the command  line.  This  will set up split-screen mode. In the upper half you'll see AROS screen, in the bottom - debug log. 
* If  you  get  crashes  at  early boot, try adding 'NOACPI' to the command line. ACPI stuff is very poorly tested because discovery fails on Mac (different ROM).

==Filesystem directory and file structure overview==

AROS' directory structure is mostly identical to AmigaOS directory structure, with some additions.

AROS: or SYS: also known as DH0: (i.e. the drive partition with AROS) has the following simplified list of the main drawers (directories/folders). 


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|C:
| where AROS looks first for applications/games but will look at Tools, System and elsewhere afterwards
|----
|Devs:
| audio, network and other hardware device drivers are stored
|----
|L:
| where .handler files go 
|----
|Libs:
| extra libraries needed for extra features in AROS itself and applications/games
|----
|Prefs:
| applications to setup and set AROS functions and capabilities
|----
|S:
| startup scripts (for the aros boot process '''not''' grub) are stored here
|----
|Storage:
| place to keep unrequired device drivers
|----
|System:
| applications associated with AROS operating system
|----
|Tools:
| extra applications
|----
|}

Autoupdate of files in a directory is already implemented in Wanderer, but not all file systems handle dos.library/StartNotify() in its full extend, so it appears not to be working. It seems to work correctly in Ram Disk (thanks to AmberRAM handler), and it also works on SFS formatted devices. Other file systems might not yet have it implemented correctly. 

See [[Aros/User/DOS#Drives.2C_Files.2C_Assigns.2C_Directories|DOS manual: Drives, Files, Assigns, Directories]]



=== SFS filesystem checks and balances ===

Whilst the kernel is the heart, the filesystem is the blood of the system... 

Filesystem options 
* FFS
* SFS
* Professional File System PFS3 [http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=52234&amp;highlight=pfs3+free&amp;page=13 m68k] 

SFS is way more advanced and much much faster than the FFS we had. Some people were tired with random &quot;checksum errors&quot; on several HD blocks. 



SFS Tools 
* CLI - sfscheck (look), [http://www.portacall.org/ sfsundelete], sfsdefrag, Defragmenter, setcache, Partition Wizard (optimize), SFSresize, sfsdoctor, SFSSalv hits a usability ceiling around the 10GB / 100,000 file mark, 
* GUI - Smart Info, [http://code.ohloh.net/project?pid=jwOhk5hTW-c&amp;prevcid=1&amp;browser=Default&amp;did=rom%2Ffilesys%2FSFS&amp;cid=GnIIx8qDt6E SFSdefragmentGUI defrag], SFSMUI, 

 sfscheck dh0: seek purge fraglist defragment


127GB partition size limit on hard disks and DVDs current 4gig size limit using SFS are problems. 
Although both MOS and OS4 developers are working on SFS, we do not benefit. They have been developing their own closed source branches of SFS and never cared to participate in the LGPL branch on sourceforge. 
One could extending AROS SFS to support SFS2 (like OS3/OS4) so there's an official way to have big partitions and files. Or support 64bit filesystems file functions via TD64-compliant device driver. 

There are no repair tools, you can't repair SFS partitions. Just copy the files to another partition, format (a few times) the one with the errors and copy the files back. 

A bit error on the harddisk would give this error. Not really SFSs fault but the disk that starts to show errors. Only thing one can do for SFS when this happens is to try to never touch this part of the disk again. 

SFS (Smart File System) partially defragments itself while the filesystem is in use. The defragmentation process is almost completely stateless 

The PC equivalent of the Amiga's RDB is the master boot record (MBR).



App requesters about problems with blockid issues 

Data corruption - corrupted partition has plenty of disk buffers (1000+) 
SFS randomly corrupt partitions on at least three different machines throughout the years, though on another it's run fine and continuously for probably 10 years straight. 
To recover files from your SFS partition you could try to find MorphOS user to try SFSDoctor for your HD. It can repair SFS volumes and its file recovery is faster. 
If there are two simultaneous file writes in progress and you reboot machine (or it locks up or crashes for whatever reason) you may end up with a corrupted filesystem. 

SFS filesystem slows down with usage 




===Installing Applications===

The typical means to install applications under AROS/AmigaOS involves simply copying/extracting the archive (.zip .lha .rar .tar.gz) file containing the applications files to your own desired location i.e. drawer/folder. Once extracted, launching it by double clicking on an icon (recommended) or using the shell (alternative). Generally, this is on a separate partition from your AROS system files, however in reality it can be any location - including RAM: if you don't want it staying around too long especially when you switch off. 

At some time in the future it may be desirable for AROS to have a package-manager like subsystem able to retrieve information online about packages available for AROS and whether they update anything you currently have installed, however at the moment no such ability exists.




===User Data files===

AmigaOS has no notion of a default location to store user data files, and presently neither does AROS - though it may be desirable at some time to provide a common start location.

For most people, Having a Work: (DH1:) partition or other partitions to store data seems preferable.





===User Environment configuration files===

AmigaOS/AROS stores persistent system configuration data in directory assigned to ENVARC:.  This, by default, points to SYS:Prefs/EnvArc.

During boot a copy is made to another assign, ENV:, which is for runtime usage.  Changes to the files here will not survive a reboot.

Setting the env variables is generally done by applications themselves, or when neccessary by the user using the SetEnv command. SetEnv has a SAVE switch to force the persistent copy in ENVARC: to be written also for when you are sure the change should be permanent.

Localisation of AROS interfaces and menus can be found [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4047&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=35100#forumpost35100 here]





===Drivers===

All drivers are placed in the Devs drawer (folder/directory). The network drivers &lt;something.device&gt; go in the Networks sub-drawer. Audio drivers &lt;something.audio&gt; are put in the AHI sub-drawer. Graphics drivers &lt;something.hidd&gt; are put in the Monitors sub-drawer.

===Keys===

====Common Keyboard Shortcuts====

&lt;pre&gt;
RAlt Right Alt Key 
LAlt Left Alt Key 
RWinKey Right Windows Key 
LWinKey Left Windows Key 
RAmiga Right Amiga Key (if one)
LAmiga Left Amiga Key (if one)
&lt;/pre&gt;

;Bootup Options

;HELP key 
Can sometimes be mapped to F11 but can be changed see FKey below 




====FKey====

In Tools/Commodities, there's an FKey commodity which allows you to make actions assigned to some combinations of keys. Now let's launch it and assign the locale switching. After you double-click on FKey icon, launch the Exchange, choose the FKey from list and click the Show button. This will invoke the FKey window. You can see the ALT TAB in list assigned to window switching. Now enter the first key combination, say, ALT Z and go to the right panel. Choose Launch the program from pulldown menu and enter SYS:Prefs/Input as an argument. Append the USE switch and english preset name to the string as shown:

SYS:Prefs/Input USE SYS:Prefs/Presets/english

Click on the New Button to add the another combination. Now set the combination for your locale as shown above, replacing english name with your preset name. Click New button again and then Save Settings. Now you can use defined combinations to switch the layouts.




====Joystick/Joypad====

Poseidon is the USB stack with Trident adding a GUI (graphical user interface) prefs. 

How to use joystick or gamepad with AROS?

Just plug in your digital/analogue joystick or gamepad into USB port. The device will be handled by Poseidon USB stack.

the context sensitive page would come up right on pressing the help key (F12/Menu?) inside the relevant window. The manual is in this archive, just in case it isn't in SYS:Locale/Help


=====How to change joystick mode to analogue?=====

By default a connected USB joystick emulates Amiga digital joystick. To change this behaviour so that the joystick is presented as analogue you need to use Trident preferences application (System:Prefs/Trident).

Open Trident and go to Devices on the left hand side (mouse click once on it). Select your controller from the list to the right and then click on Settings button below. This will open a new window. On the &quot;General&quot; tab find the &quot;Lowlevel Library Joypad Emulation&quot; section near the bottom. Find ports which are set to &quot;Merge with USB&quot; or &quot;Override with USB&quot; and change them to &quot;Analogue Hack&quot;. 

Please note that analogue joystick support is an extension of original Amiga functionality, thus an Amiga application must be explicitly written to use it. AROS SDL library uses this functionality, thus all SDL applications that use joystick, can use the analogue joystick feature.

The HID class has several options how to handle the input data: 

* Don't touch: The movement and button data for is not modified by the hid class. This is the default for the ports 0, 2, and 3. 

* Overwrite with USB: This will kill the  original  data  that  might  had  come  from  the internal  ports  and  overwrites it with the joypad data for this USB interface. Note well: If you have multiple  joypads  connected,  take care  which setting you have selected for each port, because only the last interface with this option will actually send the joypad data to the game. 

* Merge with USB: This option merges the input data of the  lowlevel.library  with  the USB  stream. This only works, if the connected device on the original Amiga  ports  is  NOT  a  mouse  (because  then   the   streams   are incompatible).  Merging  should  be  the preferred method, because it leaves the original joysticks working. 

* Disable: Turns off the port for the application.

* Analogue Hack: Tells Poseidon to force reporting  of  analogue  data  at  the  port. Please  note  that  this only works with programs that understand the analogue  data,  because  it's   an   extension   to   the   original lowlevel.library   standard   made  by  Commodore.  If  you  want  to incorporate this feature in your software, just contact me and I will send you the necessary information. 

* Rumble Port: As addition to the analogue data, the HID class  supports  applications and  games  that want to utilize a rumble pack or force feedback motors in the gamepads. This field selects to  which  lowlevel  port  the  hid device responds, when attempting to use the rumble pack. Normally, this corresponds to the port that has  been  set  in  the  actions  for  the joypad.



=====How to change joystick port assignment?=====

The low  level  library  supports up to four ports. Port 0 is usually used by the mouse, port 1 is the standard port for joysticks/joypads. By default a connected USB joystick is present in Port 1. To change its location to Port 0 you need to use Trident preferences. 

Open Trident and go to Devices window. Select your controller from the list and then click on Settings button. This will open a new window. On the &quot;General&quot; tab find the &quot;Lowlevel Library Joypad Emulation&quot; section. Port 1 should be set as either &quot;Merge with USB&quot; or &quot;Override with USB&quot;. Change this setting to &quot;Don't touch&quot;. Change Port 0 setting to &quot;Merge with USB&quot;.

Go to &quot;Actions&quot; tab. In the &quot;Reports and collection&quot; select first entry named &quot;Joystick&quot;. in the &quot;Usage items&quot; select &quot;X axis&quot;. Go to &quot;Performed actions&quot; area. On the left there will be a list of triggers. Each of them should have (port1) in their params. Click on the first trigger and using buttons to the right of the list change port1 into port 0. Repeat this for all triggers and for all items on &quot;Usage items&quot; list.



=====How to make joystick simulate keyboard keys?=====

With Poseidon it is possible to make the joystick simulate the keyboard pressings. This might enable using joystick for playing games which only have keyboard support. This feature is configured in Trident preferences.

Open Trident and go to Devices window. Select your controller from the list and then click on Settings button. This will open a new window. Go to &quot;Actions&quot; tab. On the right top window select X axis. On the left bottom list select an entry &quot;Digital Joystick, Push left(port 1)&quot;. On the panel to the right change &quot;Digital joystick&quot; into &quot;Raw Key&quot;. A list of keys will be displayed. Select key you wish to send. Repeat the same procedure for &quot;Digital Joystick, Release left (port 1)&quot; option but this time check &quot;Send key up even instead of key down&quot;. Open shell and move your joystick to the left - your selected letter should appear in the shell. 



=====Analogue in Trident Prefs=====
* Open the Trident USB Prefs -&gt; Devices -&gt; Select your joypad -&gt; Settings button -&gt; Action TAB 
* See some &quot;axis&quot; listed under &quot;Usage items&quot; in the top right of the window. They are your analog stick(s) 
* Check [x] Track Incoming Events which is half way down the window on the left 
And you should see some axis activity in &quot;Usage items&quot; when you move the analog stick 



=====Actions=====

HID class item -&gt; Settings -&gt; HID Class Window -&gt; Action Tab -&gt; Action handling area 

Reports and collections -&gt; Usage Items -&gt; Performed actions 


Qualifier keys are *special*. You don't only need to create the actual keypress but also modify the qualifiers.

The correct way is:

Go to the keyboard panel and find the windows menu key by enabling key tracking and pressing the windows menu key. Then assign the right amiga key to it.

Go to the actions panel and find the right amiga key (it's called &quot;Keyboard right GUI&quot;). Remember the actions stored there, best write them down in exact order. Then delete them.
Find the windows menu item and add the missing qualifier action. Be sure the parameters are exactly the same and the order is right.

is set them to Raw, then assign an up and down button for each character, etc.
when you change the settings to RAW so you can assign keyboard strokes. it will always say, KEYDOWN or what ever on the left, it never provides and option for key release.

The problem still remains though that if I try to assign the Directional Pad (Hat) to Arrow Keys, that things will get screwed up and you either can not move with the directional PAD (HAT), or movements are assigned to the Left Analog, and do not work as they should, it's as if the right and down arrow keys are ALWAYS On, regardless of the fact that I did indeed assign a Key release command to each input.

check that by pressing analog directions and see the current values, and the thresholds configured in poseidon to bind them to left/right/up/down.

misconfigured too much stuff in the HID settings, you can always go in poseidon-&gt;config list entry and delete the config item related to your device (or the HID class setting itself), back to basics.



=====Rumble in Trident Prefs=====
Open Trident Prefs and click on the Devices option in the left hand window. Click with the mouse once on your gamepad choice on the right hand side and again on the Settings button below. In the new window, select the '''General''' TAB and half way down on the right there is an &quot;Open Now&quot; button in the section &quot;HID output control window&quot;. Clicking on that button opens another window (HID Control) with sliders for the two rumble engines inside the controllers and you can test if they work. '''Sometimes clicking that button does nothing, other times it will open the window and say nothing is detected.''' The leftmost two sliders do nothing, the third one has a large rumble effect, and the fourth one has a small rumble effect. 





===The Look===

Changing the background, icons, font, menus with zune prefs and shell with escape strings 

AROS has several desktop usability front ends like Wanderer and DOpus Magellan (large), Scalos (medium) and Workbook (small) 

File / Directory manager like Dopus4, Amistart, BoingBar 

General usability decisions - Prefs/IControl, 




====DOpus 5 Directory Magellan====

Dopus 5.x was a whole desktop replacement on the Amiga Workbench (Desktop). 



Left mouse button clicked twice on the desktop background brings up the Device List window. 
Green strip notifies SRCE (source) and if another is open it may be red for DEST (destination). clicking on the red strip changes to green 
Word list of actions with a left mouse click on the DOWN Arrow and directory stuff with &lt; button next to it 




Right Win key together with 4 for the Environment (shortcut for Right Mouse Click - Settings - Environment) - Change the Backgrounds, etc 

Right Win Key together with 1 for the Button Bank Editor (toolbar icons) described [http://amigax1000.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/dopus-59-toolbar-icons-on-x1000.html the icons] associated with Dopus 5. 




Settings - Themes i.e. D5THEMES:   assign for  DOPUS5:Themes

Each Dopus5 themes are stored in a separate directory, named appropriately, which contains further sub directories for 

* Screens (jpg or anything supported by datatypes) 
* Sounds (wav iff snd svx supported) 
* Icons (png newicons glowicons ) 
* Desktop Patterns (iff ) 


Shift and click on the icon - runs the icon 

Closing shutting down the computer and restarting rebooting - F12 and E and put in reboot cold 






====Wanderer ====

* icon text sizes, colors, etc with wanderer prefs


Provides a way to hide the old Workbench 3.1 style of windows and screens. 
The default content of Prefs/Env-Archive/SYS/themes.var should be &quot;themes:ice&quot;.
When using the theme prefs, please do NOT click the Use button. Its useless. As you know, it will ask for the theme volume. Just pick the theme you want, click on Save, then reboot. 

* Decoration is on. Any time trying to change theme, you get: &quot;Please insert volume Theme: in any drive&quot;? 
You could check if you find SYS:System/Themes or if it is missing. Than you could open startup-sequence which you can find in drawer &quot;S&quot;. There should be a line: Assign THEMES: SYS:SYSTEM/THEMES &gt;Nil: 
This does the trick. Open a shell and run: Assign THEMES: SYS:SYSTEM/THEMES 
Than start the Theme prefs again... this should work 

* The theme is the only thing that I know to slow the system a bit, but It's not that performance impacting on most uses, and you can switch it of completely. Remove C:Decoration from the bottom of the file sys:s/startup-sequence. 

[http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=graphics/theme ALua/Zulu script] built for faster Wanderer skin management. You can modify config files, install new (wdz format/zipped skin files) and delete skins via the Theme Manager. 


[http://sites.google.com/site/arosaspireone/download-1 Global.Prefs] 





====Scalos ====

Import your ToolsDaemon configs for top pull down menus for apps, etc. 






====DOpus 4 Directory Opus====

Many users prefer the simplicity of DOpus and the following added to the bottom of the user-startup script in S: drawer/directory 
&lt;pre&gt;
run DOPUS:DirectoryOpus -i &gt;NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;
makes DOpus starts up in Iconified state at the top of Wanderer's screen. Left click on this to highlight and right mouse click to open. 



Just click on the sides of either outer edges of DOpus windows and it will display the parent device/volume list. 


DOpus saves it features in a CFG file which can be edited to suit anyones' needs by reading the [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=utility/filetool Dopus Manual] which is in Guide format. 



====AmiStart ====

* how to disable annoying zune/mui 'bubbles'? 
try a right-click on AmiStart and release on Global settings. Then click on the bubbles gadget. Move the Show Bubbles slider all the way to the left.



====Boing Bar ====

drag icons to ends of the bar and move them on the Bar using the Prefs/BoingIconBar 




====IControl and Windows====

Magic Menu type functionality is implemented in IControl preferences editor: in the frame called Menus, switch type from Pull-Down to Pop-Up and/or iControl just tick the sticky menu option. 


Windows outside screens causing a problem either uncheck &quot;Offscreen move&quot; for windows in IControl prefs editor. Or use FKey commodity and define two key shortcuts: 

* the first using the command &quot;cycle windows&quot; (for example ALT TAB); 
* the second using the command &quot;rescue window&quot; (for example ALT F5). 

Now you can cycle windows until the one you want to rescue (you'll have to guess of course), and then &quot;rescue&quot; it: it will move back inside your screen. 


How to save the window size on wanderer (i try snapshot all, snapshot windows, but it does not work)? Same for icon position on wanderer, i can't save the position. Icon position cannot be saved yet, but you should be able to save the window position and size. sys:prefs - wanderer icon has option to save window size on exit but just for dh0. To get saving working on (DH1: Extras:) partitions try deleting the dh1 disk.info file, then reboot. The system should create a new dh1 icon.

As for viewing all files, removing disk.info for that disk did the job 

* how to list and kill processes (xkill would be useful) ? 
sys:Tools/Wimb scout

sys:Tools/Commodities/Exchange can remove available commodities

sys:Extras/System/Scout can kill

* how to restore 'go up' button in wanderer window? (it doesn't show up anymore).
If you're using Icaros, go to the theme prefs and make sure that decoration is checked. Also, some themes do not use a parent button, so try another theme. You may have to restart Aros before the theme will change.

* Is it really safe to turn off (hardware button) computer at any time (I'm worried about USB hard disk)
yes you can turn off the the computer if none of the drives is in progress (writing). Best to use Wanderer menu option Quit. 




====Icons====

Icons are png pictures renamed as .info e.g. any Office app would have a Office.png renamed as Office.info or MyApp.png as MyApp.info, etc.  

C:Join Image1.png Image2.png TO MyFile.info
is enough to make a dual state icon from two png images. You can then use Wanderer's menu Icon/Information on it to edit its fields and tooltypes.

Is there any way in AROS to change an icon type from Project to Tool or vice versa?
Either the SIT option of [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=showfile&amp;file=utility/workbench/ ProcessIcon], or the TYPE option of HandleInfo (not sure if this one works at all, please test with care).
 processicon sys:pathoftheicon SIT=Project 

SIT Set type of ICON. Allowed types are: &quot;Disk&quot;, &quot;Drawer&quot;, &quot;Tool&quot;,  &quot;Project&quot;, &quot;Garbage&quot;, &quot;Device&quot;, &quot;Kick&quot; and &quot;AppIcon&quot;.

Works like a charm (even with 32bit dual-state AOS4 icons)

[http://www.masonicons.info/6.html AISS toolbar images] unpack unarc them into RAM: and copy Images directory to SYS:Prefs/Presets/ 

AISSions are looked for in PROGDIR:, PROGDIR:Images, SYS:Prefs/Presets/Images and then in TBImages: according to Open Amiga guidelines. 

there is Demos/iconscale which could be launched from S:User-Startup with two arguments, telling it the horizontal and vertical size. IE something like 
 Demos/iconscale 40 40
It will shrink icons... not sure if it will be very nice though. it doesn't work for the icons on the main desktop. 

there is an option to scale an icon to a bounding box afair but i dont remember exactly how to activate it in user-startup. try perhans iconsize followed by two numbers, like:
iconsize 32 32

====Fonts====

Install the #?.ttf files to SYS:Fonts/TrueType. Use SYS:System/FTManager to &quot;Install Font&quot; each #?.ttf file which will generate associated #?.otag and #?.font in SYS:Fonts. Use SYS:Prefs/Fonts to change system fonts and SYS:Prefs/Zune to change others. 

To achieve our goal we will use the Setup Locale, Input, Zune and Fonts, as well as The FTManager.

Begin

The first step you should do is to get the system to know that we speak and write in another language. What you need to do is to open the setup program and choose Locale country, and list &quot;preferred languages&quot; to put it first and then English. If you want the tab &quot;Time Zone&quot; and select city of residence to set the clock correctly. Of course we save our changes and continue opening the setup program Input. This sets the keyboard language as our beginning. When the language layout was created there was no option to switch to Aros keyboard (layout switching), so to write in the language you had to hold down Alt, something you encounter in other functions, such as AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS. This time working with the team of Aros to create a new keyboard layout to replace the old so we can get rid of the button Alt. For now though let only selected this layout and do not turn the switch on the keyboard.

On the occasion of the article, write in the comments below if you'd prefer to keep both layouts, the new words that are in development and this requires the Alt button pressed.

Installing fonts

In this step you need to download some fonts that can support the Greek encoding in our system. The easiest way is to run the script &quot;Download Fonts&quot; you'll find in the folder AROS: Utilities / OWB. This script downloads from the Internet, and unpacks some fonts for OWB, which is placed under the folder Fonts: TrueType. But as these can only be used by OWB and not the system, which unfortunately does not see. To make them available to the rest of the system, open the program FTManager, you will find the folder AROS: System /. From there select the field &quot;Codepage&quot; option &quot;ISO-8859-7&quot; and list the font &quot;Arial&quot; and &quot;Regular&quot; form in which you must double-click with the mouse. In the window that appears, select the bottom right the checkbox &quot;Anti-aliasing&quot; button and then &quot;Install&quot;. Immediately folder Fonts: created files &quot;arialregular.font&quot; and &quot;arialregular.otag&quot;, which are necessary in order to see the system font. Do the same steps if you wish for other fonts.

Final stages 

After completing the above, open the folder AROS: Prefs / and run the program settings Fonts. In the new window, select the fields &quot;Icons&quot; and &quot;Screen&quot; as the font &quot;ArialRegular&quot; to the size you want. In the field &quot;System&quot; to give &quot;s_courier&quot;, which, however, because it is not True Type Font support Antialising, and may seem a little broken. You can also use the CourierNew, if you have installed the above procedure. After you save the changes and open the Zune program settings. In this set the &quot;ArialRegular&quot; font fields in tabs &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Groups&quot;, and save the changes. Reboot the system. To make sure that the above worked properly run NoWinED, which you will find under the folder AROS: Tools /. If that everything is working correctly you will see the menu and the settings window with Greek letters. You can also write in the language using the button Alt. Second program that you can try, which is fully localized, is WookieChat, which you will find in the folder AROS: Extras / Networking. And in this place all the menu and settings window works. 





====Screen Blanker====

[http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=showfile&amp;file=graphics/screenblanker/gblanker.i386-aros.zip Garshneblanker]. Crashes in Icaros 2.0. 

[http://www.morguesoft.eu/Paginas/Downloads.htm Acuario AROS version], the aquarium screen saver. 

Startup: extras:acuariofv-aros/acuario

Kill: c:break name=extras:acuariofv-aros/acuario

Managed to start Acuario by the Executor blanker. 






===Network Connection===

AROS currently only has one real choice for TCP/IP networking - AROSTCP.  This is a port of the AmiTCP package from AmigaOS (TM), with a number of enhancements/fixes from AROS developers. 


* Non USB - easier 
* USB - annoyance through saving prefs and rebooting to restart networking 



====Wired====

 Please use Prefs/Network to set up wired, wireless or usb networking 

The top half of the IPv4 Configuration tab on the Network Prefs deals with the network card/usb and the lower half the router part. 

[[File:MyArosTCP.png|thumb|Aros network setup diagnostics - why does it not work?]]

[[File:AROS Wanderer Network Prefs DHCP.png|thumb|DHCP Settings]]

'''Upper part of IPv4 tab''' 
* Click Add on the top right of the Prefs which opens a window called '''Interface''' 
* Enter Name as net0 (but can be anything as long as it is consistently used in other sections) 
* check mark on Active
* select device to be used using the '''right hand-side gadget''' of the box where the device name will go 
* set Unit to 0 
* IP Mode is default set to '''Get address from DHCP''' 


* IP Mode set to Manual if DHCP does not work 
* IP Address of network card = Take the Gateway (router IP address) below and adjust higher the last digit out of a string of four 
* Subnet netmask = 255.255.255.0 


* click OK



[[File:AROS Wanderer Network Prefs Manual.png|thumb|Manual Settings]]

'''Lower part of IPv4 tab''' 
* IP Mode Get address from DHCP (default) 


* or changing to Manual if automatic DHCP set up does not work 
* '''Gateway''' (Router Internal LAN-IP) = 192.168.0.1 (D-Link Netgear), 192.168.1.1 (Linksys 3com), 192.168.2.1 (SMC Microsoft), 192.168.1.254 (Belkin), 192.168.123.254 (USRobotics) else check with your router manual 
* first DNS = use 208.67.222.222 (opendns) or Gateway number above (to test web browser access to router) or 212.50.160.100 (google)  i.e. or whatever your ISP needs you to set 
* second DNS = use 208.67.220.220 (opendns) or Gateway number above (to test web browser access to router) or 213.249.130.100 (google) i.e. or whatever your ISP needs you to set 


* At the bottom of IPv4 tab, check mark the '''Start networking during system boot''' option 
* Save and reboot (sometimes Network restart fails, so reboot every time to be sure) 




'''an alternative way''' is to take the settings from an OS already using the same internet connection. Another connection will have different settings. 

e.g. From [http://www.ncsu.edu/resnet/windows/ipconfig/ Windows], '''ipconfig /all''' 
and note down the IP, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers values and put these values in &quot;manually&quot; into AROS Network prefs. 

e.g. From Linux via dhcp router have a look at etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.info 
* for manual input look at /etc/networks (IP or Gateway) and /etc/resolv.conf (DNS) 

 Please note that all in one routers (wired+wireless) or separate routers may need different settings 







====Wireless====

[[File:MyArosWirelessSetup.png|thumb|Why does it not work?]]

[[File:MyArosWirelessTCP.png|thumb|Shell commands to work out what is happening]]

We must first make certain you have a Atheros chip as wireless. Open PCITool in Tools directory. Down left hand side are a series of numbers 0.00.0 etc. Click on some at the bottom and hopefully one of them will say Atheros AR5??? or AR242?. 

or a RTL8187B which we use Prefs/Trident to check 


There are many similarities with the above Wired set up so please read the above section as well 


* open Network/Prefs
* In '''IPv4 Configuration''' tab - click Add - enter net0 / active tick / #?.device / Unit 0 / IP Mode = manual (important if default DHCP does not work automatically) 

Make sure that any extra network names (e.g. eth1 or net1) should be deleted and just leave or change the driver on net0 to the device name like atheros5000.device or realtek8180.device. Having two entries here will cause sub-net problems. 

* Go to '''Wireless''' tab and click on &quot;Add&quot; button. 
* Insert network name (SSID your wireless network name use wirelessmanager to get it), select right &quot;encyption&quot; that is most likely &quot;WPA&quot;. 
* Key Type set as &quot;Passphrase&quot;. i.e. type in your password for your router (aka access key). 
* Unselect (no tick) &quot;hidden&quot; if it is selected, then apply. You may have to tick it if wireless does not work. 
* Finally, Save and '''reboot'''. 

For the best chance of success, set networking to start at boot, and then reboot with the USB adapter plugged in. 

To list available networks in the shell use  



To troubleshoot issues with 

 C:wirelessmanager atheros5000.device verbose 

 C:wirelessmanager realtek8180.device verbose 

and capture the output 




If your router doesn't broadcast its SSID, you need to add this option to the network block of the wpa_supplicant.conf on your aros machine and make changes after  # Example blocks: 

 scan_ssid=1

Here's a full description of all the [http://hostap.epitest.fi/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=hostap.git;a=blob_plain;f=wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf config file options].

ap_scan=1

network={
ssid=&quot;YOURESSID&quot;
scan_ssid=1
proto=RSN
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
pairwise=CCMP
group=CCMP
psk=YOURPASSWORD
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
filter_ssids=1
ap_scan=2

}
&lt;/pre&gt;





====USB Ethernet====

Open [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=53746#forumpost53746 Network Prefs] and in the IPv4 Configuration tag (top table covers your usb stick) 

* click Add button
* set Name as net0
* Tick Active box
* enter the usb-ethernet.device e.g. dm9601eth.device, usbpegasus.device or usbasixeth.device use SYS:c/devlist, '''Scout''' or trident prefs to get the correct spelling 
* set Unit to 0 
* IP Mode is set to Get address from DHCP (make sure your router is set right for that) 
'''or manual'''
* IP Address of network card, i.e. 192.168.0.xx or 192.168.1.xx (xx being greater than 1) 
* Subnet netmask = 255.255.255.0 
* click OK



Lower part of IPv4 tab covers the router information 

* IP Mode Get address from DHCP 
'''or if manual settings'''
* Gateway (IP Address of router) = usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 but see router manual to make sure. 
* first DNS = use 194.168.xx.100 or 208.67.222.222 (opendns) or 212.50.160.100 or 192.168.0.1 (no internet access?) 
* second DNS = use 194.168.xx.100 or 208.67.220.220 (opendns) or 213.249.130.100 





====PPP over RNDIS mobile broadband====


Tethering via your smart phone...

Enable and configure at
Android ---&gt;settings --&gt;&gt;more networks --&gt;&gt;Tethering and portable hotspot

add or name your wifi Network SSID
set Security [WPA2 PSK] and password.

and save..

Goto AROS and add your NetWork SSID and password and save..

reboot AROS, make sure your tethering is enabled from android side than magic you have it running..

Same way how you set your home router but this time from your data or wifi via your smartphone or tablet 



Network Preferences (Prefs) settings 

&lt;pre&gt;
device usbrndis.device
unit 0
IP mode:DHCP
set &quot;Start networking during system boot&quot; to OFF
&lt;/pre&gt;

In Icaros,edit s/user-startup and add line 
 addusbclasses &gt; nil:

[[File:AROS Screenshot PPP Mobile Prefs.jpg|thumb|AROS Screenshot PPP Mobile Prefs]]

plug in USB cable, enable usb tethering from phone, and AFTER this start arostcp. 

make sure DHCP is disabled for both DNS/gateway and for the interface. If the DHCP client is running, it will undo some PPP settings when it gives up (after a few minutes or so) 

The advice is different for the new network prefs (Icaros 1.4.1). &quot;Automatic&quot; works for both Ethernet/Wireless and PPP, so you should choose it for PPP now 

[[File:GUI1.jpg|thumb|GUI1]]




====Solving Issues====

* For wired, make sure that the LAN-cable is plugged in before starting the computer 
* In Network Preferences, have '''only one''' item in the IPv4 Configuration tab 
* If using manual settings, make sure all numbers are correct, especially for IP address of the card/usb (changing the last number in chain of four) 
* For any USB based networking, it is often necessary to save in Prefs/Network, reboot AROS and network support can begin 


* If wireless, try getting closer to the router. 
* Switch off the encryption option from your router then try wifi, if successful then your ip/dns is ok. If not then your ip/dns settings are most probably wrong. 
* Replace detachable wireless antenna (best wireless option to buy if you can) with a stronger antenna ie. 5&amp;nbsp;dBi or 7&amp;nbsp;dBi 
* Try with another computer/laptop/machine 



Error 6: Couldn't resolve host name.

Check Scout -&gt; Devices and look at the device that you are using, in the OCnt column it should state 2 which means AROSTCP and Wirelessmanager are both accessing this driver. If 0 or 1, then uncheck the checkbox in Network prefs for starting networking at boot, save and reboot. Then run this is the shell:

C:WirelessManager realtek8180.device unit 0




some quirks setting up the wireless network as well 

1) it's far better setting up either the wired OR the wireless network adapter as net0:, or weird things happen

2) it's better using fixed IP on the local network instead of DHCP

3) network setting must be placed in network setting panel in /prefs, using the wirelessmanager helped me finding available SSIDs, but not actually connecting to them

once done, reboot.


If previous setup is proving problematic 

&lt;pre &gt;

SYS:Prefs/Env-Archive/Wireless.prefs
SYS:Prefs/Env-Archive/Zune/OWB.config
SYS:Prefs/Env-Archive/Zune/global.config
SYS:Prefs/Env-Archive/AROSTCP/WirelessDevice
SYS:Prefs/Env-Archive/AROSTCP/db/Interfaces
&lt;/pre &gt; 

Make a copy of these files and restore in case of problems. 



Please try this test to check if you can connect to your router, ie established that the WiFi layer is working 

̊̊̊̊Boot with networking disabled, by make sure that &quot;Start networking at boot&quot; in Network Prefs is unchecked (no tick).  
̊ Run this in a shell: C:WirelessManager atheros5000.device VERBOSE
̊If the output of that command is too long to summarise here, you can redirect it to a file by adding &gt;RAM:wifi.log to the end, then attach or paste that file here.


try running &quot;status&quot; in the shell and check that AROSTCP is listed/running
If AROStcp is not showing, then AROSTCP is not running. attempted to start it by clicking Use or Save in network prefs, or checking the &quot;start networking at boot&quot; box or typing into a shell. 

 Execute SYS:System/Network/AROSTCP/s/startnet

(run Status again afterwards).



The &quot;cannot resolve hostname&quot; will appear if you are blocked on the wifi network by the router as well as aros not being able to assign correct network address.

One way of testing this might be to disable the firewall in the router. you might also check the router how it sees the attemts aros do to speak to it. The easiest way to do that would be to manually give aros an IP number in the routers accepted range. and see if it shows up at all withing the router.


Tests that can be undertaken to determine correct settings and functions 

&lt;pre &gt;
 ping &lt;router-address&gt; e.g 192.168.0.1 (aka inet) or 80.237.146.33 (www.amiganews.de) 
 ifconfig net0
 ifconfig net0 up
 extras:networking/utils/sanautil/sanautil -d atheros5000.device status
 WirelessManager atheros5000.device verbose &gt;RAM:wifi.log
 ;to send the log to RAM disk to be read easier or if detected, 
 Run WirelessManager atheros5000.device &gt;NIL:
 Run WirelessManager atheros5000.device ssid=&quot;mynet1&quot; &gt;NIL: 
 C:WirelessManager realtek8180.device unit 0 
&lt;/pre &gt; 

Please look at the task list in Scout, and check if WirelessManager and AROSTCP are running. Also look at the device list in Scout to check if realtek8180.device is open. 


start tools/debug/sashimi, maybe it shows some debug messages when disconnection happens.



==== Network Basics ====

Firstly, let's take a look at what your setup most likely looks like, assuming you use a router. See diagram below: 

&lt;pre&gt;
Internet &lt;---------&gt; home router &lt;---------&gt; computer 
-----------external IP------------------internal IP-------------
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay, so what am I trying to show you with that diagram. A few things. Firstly, the IP address that connects you to the Internet is not the same one that connects you to your router. What happens is that your computer doesn't have a direct connection to the Internet, instead your router connects to the Internet, and your computer connects to the router.

You can see the external and internal IP addresses in these example settings...

* Default Gateway : 76.91.64.1 (external IP for ISP/Internet host)
* IP Address : 76.91.71.184 (external IP for home router)

* IP Address : 192.168.0.1 (internal IP for home router)
* Address = 192.168.0.161 (internal IP for computer)

As you can see, there are two internal IP addresses and two external IP addresses. This is because there is a client/server relationship, effectively one address is for the service (server) and one address is for the device trying to access that service (client).

The server addresses in your case are 76.91.64.1 (your ISP's address, serving the Internet), and 192.168.0.1 (your home router's address, serving your home network). The term gateway applies here, they are your gateway to those services.

Subnet masks are used along with IP addresses to determine which IP addresses are allowed access to a network. I did learn the more in-depth rules about subnet masks once (watched a CCNA vid), but I've forgotten about it. The basic level of understanding you'll need is easy to remember though. A subnet mask value of 255 means that portion of the IP address must stay constant, whereas a subnet value of 0 means any unassigned value up to 255 is allowed in the IP address.

By far the most common subnet value is 255.255.255.0. What this means is that the first three parts of the IP address you use to connect to a service must stay the same as the server/gateway address, and only the last section can change.

So if your router's internal IP address is 192.168.0.1, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the only addresses that will be allowed to be used on that network are between 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.255 (I think 192.168.0.0 is reserved for other uses).

Final point to make is about DHCP (a.k.a. dynamic IP) vs static IP. A server/router using DHCP gives a device that connects to it an address within the acceptable range. It usually starts with the lowest numbered free address, so with your router it'll give the first device that connects to it 192.168.0.2, the next device 192.168.0.3, and so on. Static IP addresses are where you set the IP address you want to connect with in advance. 

When using static IP addresses on a router where DHCP is active, it's good to use a high number to avoid conflicts with other devices that are connected to your network, to reduce the risk that both devices will try using the same IP. That's why your current choice of 192.168.0.161 is good, unless you have over 159 devices connected on your current network!



Okay, so what's the next step. Well, if you can use ping, I'd suggest pinging 192.168.0.1. If you get a positive response it means you're connected to your router, if you don't get a response it means the connection between your router and your computer is at fault.

Best to set Printer Prefs in the Prefs drawer to print-to-file or parallel/usb port 


Save document in postscript or convert picture/text to postscript 

Print using compatible [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Platforms/AROS_USB_support#printer.class_-_PostScript_3_and_internal_ghostscript_drivers Ghostscript printer] or Postscript printer 


==== GutenPrint ====

Some work has been done in this aros-exec [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6622&amp;forum=7&amp;post_id=80531#forumpost80531 thread] 

[http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=6154&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;type=&amp;mode=0 IPP Printer support]


;There are no individual drivers yet for HP's Photosmart, EPSON's EPL, CANON's, Lexmark, CUPS PPD, etc 





===Files===

====File endings and datatypes====

* Check if the file has his own .info icon file with a tool set to open it. IIRC this has higher priority over the def_XYZ.info file association. 
* In ENVARC:SYS/def_Text.info or whatever def_ file needs changing, use Wanderer's menu Icon -&gt; Information and change the def_XYZ.info there. If you're on ABIv0 and want it to be applied immediately, you might have to copy it to ENV:SYS/ (or to reboot). 
* Identifying file types by file ending is only a fallback. Far better it is to search for magic words, for flac files this would be &quot;flaC&quot; according to this [http://flac.sourceforge.net/documentation_format_overview.html documentation]. 

For instance, to open PDFs with arospdf not localised in the default drawer of Icaros (Work:Extras/Applications/arospdf) but localised in a custom drawer in AROS. The default tools are defined in the icons in sys:prefs/env-archive/sys e.g. def_PDF. 



File type identification is done by datatype descriptors which you can find in Devs/Datatypes. The AROS build system has a tool which creates such datatype descriptors. 


'''Changing of default tools of existing icons is easy as shown above. Adding of new file types is not hard, but needs knowledge of the AROS build system.'''

;Read [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2533&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=39297#forumpost39297 more here] 



The enduser way would be to download the attached file, which contained two executables:
1) createdtdesc, to make a new datatype description
2) examinedtdesc, to read/show existing datatype descriptions

use 2 to get an idea on how it things are currenty done in aros by providing this executable a file from the drawer sys:devs/datatypes/ (alternatively you can find the original .dtd files here).

use 1 to make your new datatype. Use the accompanied FORMAT file (also here) to read how to make your own datatype descriptor. use 2 to get hints from other datatype descriptors.

Note:
When creating a new descriptor would advise against using the pattern property, but instead use the default pattern of #? and create a Mask that matches your filetype. This requires some research in order to discover how your filetype can be recognized properly. Of course with making something like a descriptor for an ascii textfile, you would fallback to using the pattern (e.g. #?.text as the filetype cannot be determined easily otherwise). 

&lt;pre &gt;
# name - choose wisely and informative. also used for icon's name.
# version - choose as you like as long as it complies with version rules
# basename - the 'root' datatype class. be aware that e.g. it can influence behaviour. for example when choosing binary and using tool multiview in project icon, the file will be viewed as binary file (choosing sound would tell mulitview to view the file as a soundfile). So this can influence the underlying tool being used. Could become messy if users started to modify the tool manually. 
# pattern - This is the file pattern match e.g. #?.text
# Mask - A mask to identify the file. Requires knowledge of the actual file structure. For example 'M' 'Z' for an msdos executable.
# GroupdID - not supported (AROS native) files - use syst as that would be the least intrusive in case an AROS tool/program tries to load such datatyped file.
# ID - In your case, the first four characters of the name at subchapter 1 (in lower case) (or less if name is shorter).
# flags - How the mask needs to be interpreted. In your case would be mostly DTF_BINARY in combination with (wanted or not) DTF_CASE (to tell if mask used letters are case sensitive or not)
# priority - the priority of how the type is handled so that on datatype could have precedence over another? In any case, document tells it to be mostly 0. 
&lt;/pre &gt; 

Now that you know each field and what it does (more or less), you write this fields in a text file for your own invented datatype, save it and create the actual dt with the tool in 1. in the end the created dt must reside in sys:devs/datatypes/ drawer.

Then you would create a default icon in sys:prefs/Env-archive/SYS drawer. Don't forget to reboot or copy .info file to ram:env/sys in order to test. also don't forget to set which tool to start f.e. c:lx or dh4:emulators/mycoolemulator

To test, open Wanderer then show all files and doubleclick on a file of type you just created. Alternatively you could use the 'open' command from shell (with file of datatype you just created as parameter).

And as a last note. it would perhaps be welcome to have a program like xicon and/or runprglist for AROS (unfortunately both without source, but something similar could be created for AROS).

Sounds complicated ?

Perhaps... but OS like windows needs a complete registry to be able to do things like this. And yes, i am aware windows has gui tools that does it (more or less) for you (by manipulating the registry). Same could be done for AROS (without integrating a registry in AROS that is ).

Would that suffice ?

red1+2: typos, reformatting.

disclaimer: please note that using these tools can screw up your currently installed support for datatypes when used incorrectly. Do not use if you do not understand what you are doing. Use at own risk.






====File Sharing====

As AROS knows only a few filesystems (FFS, OFS, SFS, PFS (amiga only), FAT12, 16, 32, Microsoft NTFS (windows), UDF (bluray)). The remaining ones in regular use like MacOSX hfs+, Linux ext2/ext3 and ext4, Haiku BeFS provide a problem in transferring files between each other. 

Linux can access SFS partitions but it needs to be compiled. The latest full source are [http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~mszyprow/programy/asfs/ here]. It compiled fine with a 2.6.30 kernel in Puppy Linux 4.31. 

An alternative, is to use a FAT32 partition. AROS could be installed on to a 4GB USB-key, with 512MB FAT32 partition for sharing, and the rest SFS. It works very well. 

An hosted Linux or Windows install relieves some of the problems. 

Files could be transferred [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=2915&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC Sending] via TCP network. 




=====SMBFS=====

e.g. to connect to a NAS share such as \\NASBOX\Shared use -:

SMBFS WORKGROUP=&lt;YOUR WORKGROUP NAME&gt; VOLUME=&lt;AROS volume name to use&gt;: SERVICE=&lt;UNC Path to connect to&gt;

SMBFS WORKGROUP=MYNET VOLUME=Shared: SERVICE=//NASBOX/Shared

And you will then have an icon appear on your desktop for the volume name you have chosen. 



You can put the above script into wbstartup or  

give it an icon, change it to a 'project' and give it the default tool c:iconx 

Open a shell and type copy sys:script.info &quot;sys:wbstartup/YOURSCRIPTNAME.info&quot;

This should create an icon for your script file.

Now right-click on your script and select 'information'.

Change 'tool' to 'project', put 'c:iconx' into the 'default tool' box, click save 

The reason being that scripts need to be opened with 'execute SCRIPTNAME' (or 'iconx') whereas the programs started from wbstartup are opened using 'run PROGRAMNAME'. It's the same as trying to start a command-line tool from the workbench by double-clicking it.





====Setup ISO images within AROS====

Use [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=driver/storage DiskImage] which supports many cd image formats ISO, CCD, MDF/MDS, CUE/BIN, NRG and UIF. To mount CD or DVD images use below....

&lt;pre &gt;
# Rename your iso 'Unit0' (note no extension).
# Do 'View/All files' on you Aros partition. You should now see a folder called 'Diskimages'. Copy your renamed iso to there. 
(Alternatively, you could type at the shell 'assign FDSK: xxx', where xxx is the location of your iso.) 
# From the shell, type 'mount CD0:' and the iso should appear on the Wanderer desktop. You can now access it like a real disk.
&lt;/pre &gt; 

If you are using an IcAros install, the startup scripts are set up to wipe the Diskimages directory on boot, so its worth keeping a second copy of the iso somewhere else. Alternatively, you could set up extra mountlists for additional iso images. I've made a file called iso1 in the Aros:devs directory that contains the following text:

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Entry for ISO image */

ISO1:
FileSystem = cdrom.handler
Device = fdsk.device
Unit = 1
LowCyl = 0
HighCyl = 0
Surfaces = 1
BlocksPerTrack = 1
DOSType = 0x41434400
Activate = 1
#
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then I just need an iso called 'Unit1' (corresponding to the 'Unit = 1' entry in the mountlist) in Diskimages (or wherever I assign FDSK: to) and to mount I type in at the shell:

 Mount iso1: from devs:iso1

Of course, if you create mountlists for ISO2, ISO3:, etc. (with the corresponding change to the 'Unit = ' line) you can have as many isos mounted as you wish. I just call mine ISO1: etc. to distinguish them from the real CD drives.





==What to do if you are having problems==

If you are just having difficulties getting certain things working in or with AROS, the first port of call should be one of the community forums [http://www.aros-exec.org Aros Exec] or [http://www.arosworld.org/news.php ArosWorld], or IRC channels.

Channel: #aros  Server: irc.freenode.net or irc://irc.freenode.net/aros or using a web-based javascript option like [http://webchat.freenode.net/ WebChat] or [http://en.irc2go.com/webchat/?net=freenode&amp;room=aros IRC2Go]. Channel is #aros and type in a Name. 

However, if you feel you have found a genuine bug/fault in AROS that needs attention, please use the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=439463&amp;group_id=43586&amp;func=browse bug submission form] to record as much information about what happened, why, and what hardware etc. you have so that people may try to assist you.

If your competent enough at programming, we would prefer if you could attempt to identify the problem and possibly correct it yourself, and all contributions to the AROS codebase are warmly received.





==Bounties==

To help inspire developers with both ideas and monetary incentives, rewards are offered for the successful completion of &quot;bounties&quot; (requests for missing/new functionality) chosen by the community and handled by [http://power2people.org power2people] (formerly done by TeamAROS). A monthly option is [http://www.power2people.org/funds/aros/ here].

{{Uncited}}


AROS&lt;ref&gt;[http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php References and sources]&lt;/ref&gt;, like AmigaOS (TM), is a [[w:Message_passing|message-passing]], [[w:Preemption_(computing)|preemptive]] [[w:Multitasking|multitasking]] [[w:Operating_system|OS]]. 

It uses [[w:Reentrant_(subroutine)|re-entrant]] shared libraries to save memory space. 

AROS is based around an executive library kernel (Exec) and two other libraries: 

* Exec (the &quot;kernel&quot;, which is not a kernel in the modern sense), 
* Intuition (graphics and GUI, integrated into the system) and 
* AmigaDOS (Disk Operating System, the Metacomco's Tripos modified to work with Exec). 

The design philosophies of AmigaDOS and Intuition are rather different, the former adopting a C-like API and the latter creating an [http://www.basden.demon.co.uk/amiga/amiga.oo.html object-oriented], message passing aware environment for the programmer. The system base is the only absolute address in AmigaOS (located at 0x00000004) - everything else is dynamically loaded. The OS is well known for delivering high performance due to its close connections with the hardware, while simultaneously having the flexibility to support re-targetable graphics (Cybergraphics) and retargetable audio subsystems (AHI). 

: Diagram showing relationships of libraries to system needed 


Remember, AROS is a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/ABIv1 research] operating system, and while all contributions to the base AROS code are welcome, please bear this in mind and contact the dev list first. 
Writing applications for AROS does not have this limitation. 

While AROS appears and feels almost feature complete, it is still [[Aros/Developer/IncompleteAPIs|missing a number of functions]] from the Amiga API - as well as implementations of [[Aros/MissingFunctionaility|core functionality]]. There are also a number of user applications that, while not strictly part of the AmigaOS 3.1 environment, need to be written.

The current detailed status of AROS completion can be monitored on aros.org's
[http://aros.sourceforge.net/introduction/status/everything.php Status of AROS implementation] page. Developer activities can be monitored at [http://www.ohloh.net/p/aros ohloh]

===Where to get the C/C++ Environment===

If you want to develop for AROS, its generally easier to be running linux hosted AROS development environment especially for C++, cross compiling the code. That's how most developers are doing it. The gimmearos script is a good start in that direction, building the cross compilers and hosted AROS environment, but gimmearos.sh might be out of date or not be completely compatible with any given linux distro. g++ is used to compile owb as well as some other AROS software. If you were hoping for a rich set of C++ libraries or classes defined for the OS feature set, you might be disappointed. 

AROS Native compiling is possible, but you're much more likely to run into the odd bug(s) in the dev environment since it gets little testing and fixing by other developers. 



====Native compilers for AROS====

Namely gcc for C or g++ for C++ are supplied with the [[Aros/Developer/Docs#The_Developer_Environment|Developer Environment]], which is already '''setup''' and part of any current AROS distribution like [http://www.icarosdesktop.org/ Icaros DVD] or the nightlies but '''not''' Icaros Lite CD or Broadway. 

Currently, the developer environment consists of the following software components. GNU GCC 4.x GNU BinUtils, GNU Fileutils 4.x, GNU Textutils and others. 

On single partition systems and the Boot ISO, the AROS Developer environment is installed under &quot;SYS:Development/&quot;. Systems with multiple partitions - such as a Work: partition - tend to install it to there instead, however it can be installed manually to any location. Please remember, if moving, that you will need to correct the Development packages 'install location' env variable to point to the new locations root - look in SYS:S/startup-sequence. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Assign Development: SYS:Development 
Assign C: Development:bin ADD 
&lt;/pre&gt; 




====Cross compilers from other OSs====

'''Windows(TM)''' [http://amidevcpp.amiga-world.de AmiDevCpp] is a cross-compiling developer environment for Windows, able to create binaries for AROS, AmigaOS, and MorphOS.


'''64 bit

First thing you need is Linux system (I suggest Ubuntu 14.04) with installed cmake and x86_64-aros crosscompiler. In order to get the crosscompiler you need to build AROS (either linux-x86_64 or pc-x86_64, I suggest linux-x86_64) locally on that machine. The build instructions for AROS are available here: http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/compiling.php

Once you have the cross compiler and cmake available, we can continue. 


''' 32 bit 

'''A Linux''' option is to use '''cross-compilers for Linux'''. 
Recommend new developer using Debian like distros download the gimmearos.sh script (on [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/cross aros-archives]) to setup the developer environment by downloading necessary packages ...

In order to do that, you have to compile AROS yourself. Download AROS source archive not contrib. Compile AROS by entering the main directory 

 ./configure
 make

([http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/compiling.php More on compiling AROS]). The result will be a basic AROS system without development tools.

To compile C++ on Linux, type 'make gnu-contrib-crosstools', creating the cross-compilers in ./bin/linux-i386/tools/, named i386-aros-gcc, etc.

'''Note''': Currently, to make the cross compilers usable copy 'collect-aros' from tools/ to tools/i386-aros/bin/. At the moment the cross compilers if used from the Linux command line will only find it when it's there.

If you want to compile native compilers (the Developer Environment), type 'make contrib-gnu-gcc', creating native compilers in AROS' System:Development/bin directory.

When the output needs to be stripped 
 --strip-unneeded --remove-section .comment



The Obj-C backend should build out of the box. 

Open contrib/gnu/gcc/mmakefile.src and search for the line which contains &quot;--enable-languages&quot; and add &quot;objc&quot; to the list of languages that follows it. 

    --enable-languages=c,c++,objc

Better make it --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,obj-c++

ObjC++ is broken as soon as you try to use exceptions, but that might change in future GCC versions and it does not hurt having it there already.

Do you need a [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6620&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=63146#forumpost63146 crosscompiler] or a real compiler? In the first case you can get away with just downloading the proper gcc archive, apply the patch and proceed with the normal gcc build. In the case of a real crosscompiler then when downloading the contrib sources, also need to download the normal sources, place the contrib sources into a directory called contrib, need to install autoconf+automake+perl+python, call ./configure, cd into the subdirectory and type make.  

to rebuild GCC with host == build == target == i386-pc-aros. So just get the vanilla sources and apply the patches without bothering about the build system? 




===Beginners Tutorials in C C++===

As AROS is [http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=29856 C based] API compatible to [http://www.pcguru.plus.com/tutorial/introduction.html AmigaOS] 3.x [http://w3.norman-interactive.com/C-Kurs_1_1.html German here], so some of information on programming C on the Amiga applies to AROS as well. Please note that there is a lot of AOS 1.3 (not so useful) and AmigaOS AOS 2.x information around as well. 

Curly brackets missing - try SHIFT + ALT + 7 or 0.

A good introduction to Amiga programming in general, though a little outdated, is Rob Peck's book &quot;Programmer's Guide to the Amiga&quot;. The [http://cataclysm.cx/random/amiga/reference/ Amiga ROM Kernel manuals]: Libraries (3rd edition), and The AmigaDOS manual (3rd edition) are the most generally useful books, the other RKMs, including the Style Guide also have their uses. There were many reference examples from AmigaMail and Devcon notes (available again on an Amiga developers CD). [http://cataclysm.cx/random/amiga/reference/Devices_Manual_guide/node003E.html Libraries and Devices] and the [http://gega.homelinux.net/AmigaDevDocs/ Third Edition]. 

If using Arexx then &quot;The Amiga Programmer's Guide to ARexx&quot; by Eric Giguere, which was published by Commodore is useful as well as &quot;Arexx Cookbook&quot;. 


Apart from this wikibook, documentation and help can be obtained from the following sources:

* Beginners C Guide [http://www.iu.hio.no/~mark/CTutorial/CTutorial.html C Tutorial], 
* [http://fresh2refresh.com/c/c-basic-program/ C programming basics] for students, 
* [https://www.edx.org/courses Free Online course] from American Universities 
* AROS Dev help [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/index.php aros.org AROS homepage], 
* Reference [http://utilitybase.com utilitybase.com DOWN at the moment] - Amiga related [http://amigadev.elowar.com/ API reference]. 


* Source can be found [http://www.liquido2.com/tutorial/index.html here] and [[Aros/Developer/Docs/Examples|here]] and [http://www.blackfiveservices.co.uk/amiga-c/ here]. Lots of example code can be found inside AROS sources themselves. DOWNLOAD the '''contrib source''' archives from [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php Aros site], and study the AROS applications source code, e.g. the test programs from the Tests drawer (folder/directory). Take a look at the code of some smaller AROS programs might be a better and more up to date guide. There a quite a lot of nice examples hidden in the AROS SVN.

===Compiling C/C++ Code===

Native, although we have a IDE Integrated Development Environment (Murks), it does lack a debugger. Whilst others use a combination of a text editor and shell to edit code. Most though use an AROS hosted on Linux to take advantage of the better GCC tools like GDB and various IDEs. 

Open shell - its a menu option at the top left of Wanderer (desktop). Or by using the right Win key and w (or F12 and w) within the directory with the source code. Type in  
 sh 
to change the amiga shell into a unix shell. You can then type in ls (unix equivalent to amiga dir). Take a look [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linux_commands here] for more commands. 

For a single file program-name.c or program-name.cpp
 gcc -o program-name program-name.c  
or 
 g++ -o program-name program-name.cpp
or
 g++ -o test -Wall -g main.cc texturelib.cpp xmodelib.cc -lsdl -lgl 

To close the shell, click on the top left-hand corner to close (twice). Once to get back the aros shell and then again to close finally. Use [http://freshmeat.net/projects/cksfv/ cksfv] as a test. 



Some source code requires the addition of Amiga API libraries, like dos, which you can flag at the compile time as 
 gcc -o julia.exe julia.c -ldos

I use -ldos as example and if you are compiling mui codes it will be -lmui or intuition -lintuition. Other missing symbols are due to linker libraries being necessary for linking in functions that aren't in the standard C libraries. For example some source code would need added 

 -lz or -lm or -lpng or -larosc etc. 

use this in unix line command mode to search for 'search-item' in many .c files (*.cpp for c++, etc.)
 grep -l 'search-item' *.c 


:''More information: [[Aros/Developer/Porting software]]''

=== AROS 64 bit specific code ===

AROS64 already uses 64bit addressing, it just doesn't setup the MMU for more than 4GB physical memory currently.
When porting software to AROS64 it is &quot;mostly&quot; a case of converting ULONG's that are used to store pointers, into IPTR's instead.
Another quirk, is making sure items on the stack are the correct size by using the STACKED attribute for them.

compiling mui stuff for aros setting -std=gnu99 is necessary, had -std=c99 usually 
A MUI application most likely needs only the HOOKPROTOxxx SDI macros. They are compatible with AROS, only the attributes (hook, object attribute) must be given in the right order. 


==Coding conventions==

As the AROS core source is a shared developer experience, there are rules regarding structure and style. When it comes to your creating your own app and coding, the structure and style should be your own, i.e. you should enjoy what you do and do it so that you can understand what is going on. 


===Layout===

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
static void 1st_function()
{
    program
    exit(0);    
}

int main(void)
{
    1st_function();
    2nd_function();
    3rd_function();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

struct Screen * openscreen(void);
struct Window *openwindow(struct Screen *screen, const char *title, LONG x, LONG y, LONG w, LONG h);

VOID 1st_function();
VOID 2nd_function();


int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    program
    return 0;
} /* main */

VOID 1st_function()
{

}

VOID 2nd_function()
{

}
&lt;/source&gt;



===General style===

This code is used by many people and therefore you should keep some things in mind when you submit source code:

* Keep things simple 
* Keep the source clean 
* Always know what you are doing, if not flag it and describe what needs to be done... 
* Explain clearly/simply what you are doing 
* Remember that you write code once but that it is read many times by many people 



===Comments===

AROS uses some of the comments in the source to generate the documentation. Therefore it's necessary to keep a certain format so the tools can find their information. Other comments are ignored but they should explain what you thought when you wrote the code. If you really can't think of an explanation, then don't write the code a second time like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
/* This adds 1 to t */
t ++;
&lt;/pre&gt;

What we think of is this:

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Go on with next element */
t ++;
&lt;/pre&gt;



===Formatting===

This is only '''IMPORTANT''' if you are going to work on the core AROS code or contrib but not applications which may reside outside like on AROS Archives or other websites. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{
    /* a */
    struct RastPort * rp;
    int               a;


    /* b */
    rp = NULL;
    a  = 1;


    /* c */
    if (a == 1)
        printf (&quot;Init worked\n&quot;);


    /* d */
    if
    (
        !(rp = Get_a_pointer_to_the_RastPort
            (
                some
                , long
                , arguments
            )
        )
    ||
        a &lt;= 0
    )
    {
        printf (&quot;Something failed\n&quot;);
        return FAIL;
    }


    /* e */
    a = printf (&quot;My RastPort is %p, a=%d\n&quot;
        , rp
        , a
    );

    return OK;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Looks ugly, eh ? :-) Ok, here are the rules:

&lt;pre&gt;
If several lines contain similar code, put similar things below each other (see a and b);
Put spaces between operands and operators
Put braces {}, brackets [] and parentheses () below each other (d) if there is much code between. 
Brackets and parentheses may be in one line if the code between is small (c)
Indent by 4 Spaces. Two indent levels may be abbreviated by one tab.
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Before committing please normalize the indentation - if you have a mixture of tabs and spaced - please always use spaces, 1 tab = 4 spaces.'''

The reasons for this are: 

# While some editors can use an arbitrary sizes for tabs, it's a bit complicated to tell another editor which tab size was used by the one used to write the code. 
# Most code in AROS was written this way and your code should look like the rest. 
# You can print this code on any printer without special tools to &quot;fix&quot; the tabs. 
# Most editors have smart tabs which do exactly this. If your editor doesn't, write a bug report.

If you have a function with many arguments (d, e) you should put the parentheses in lines of their own and each argument in one line (d) or put the first argument behind the opening parentheses (e) and each following argument in a line of its own with the comma in front. The closing parentheses is in a line of its own and aligned with the beginning of the expression (i.e. the a and not the opening parentheses or the printf()).

Use a single blank line to separate logical blocks. Large comments should have a blank line before and after them, small comments should be put before the code they explain with only one blank line before them.

If you see any TABS in AROS core sources then the suggestion is to &quot;detab the file and commit that separately&quot; either before or afterwards from making functionality changes.  Make two commits instead of one.  This makes it easier for others to see the real changes instead of having to dig through multiple lines of irrelevant diffs. 





===Eliminating Global Variables===

i.e. pass variables to functions (local scope) or classes making it easier to track and debug your code. 

Any time you find that you need a particular thing in 'a lot of different places', chances are that all those places are conceptually related, and so you can create a class, a namespace, a function, or some other higher-level organizational unit to represent that relationship. This makes the program easier to understand. 


Bad Designs 

* All variables are global. 
* There are no standalone functions, only sub-procedures which act on the global variables. 
* Every sub-procedure is at least 500 lines to several thousand 
* Every sub-procedure has more than one task to perform 
* Copy-paste is preferred to writing methods, AND subtle changes are made in the middle of the code 



Good Designs 

* structure program into functions (C or basic) - top-down procedural approach 
* put in class(es) (freepascal or C++) - the object is fixed and you use methods to access the object 

&lt;pre&gt;
 class String_List
 {
 private:
 list&lt;string&gt; m_List;  // member
 public:
 void read_strings() { /* read strings into m_List */ }
 void print_strings() { /* write contents of m_List to stdout */ }
 void sort_strings() { /* sort contents of m_List */ }
 void sort_strings_reverse() { /* reverse-sort contents of m_List */ }
 void unique_strings() { /* remove duplicate strings */ }
 };

 int main()
 {
 String_List myList;  // local
 myList.read_strings();
 myList.sort_strings();
 myList.print_strings();
 myList.sort_strings_reverse();
 myList.print_strings();
 myList.unique_strings();
 myList.print_strings();
 return 0;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This way it is very easy to replace the list with new list for debugging purposes, or replacing the methods without replacing the list, when you want different results. You only have to replace the content of the local variables. 

 So create the structure that matches your data (linked lists, trees, arrays, etc) and what to do with them (sorting, searching, etc)

&lt;pre&gt;
.h usually contain #define #include typedef enum struct extern screen and window definitions (data structures) 
.c should contains functions and algorithms 
&lt;/pre&gt;

One way to look at it is that menu headings act as the .c file and sub-menu headings as functions. 

When you start a project, you place a couple of declarations in the include file. As the project continues, you place more and more declarations in the include file, some of which refer to or contain previous declarations. Before you know it, you have a real mess on your hands. The majority of your source files have knowledge of the data structures and directly reference elements from the structures. 
Making changes in an environment where many data structures directly refer to other data structures becomes, at best, a headache. Consider what happens when you change a data structure. 


Use good variables names to help clarify code and only comment when you need to explain why a certain programming approach was made. 


You're Refactoring Legacy Code, you see a global, you want to get rid of it. How do you do this? 

Exactly what to do depends on how the global is used. The first step is to find all uses of the global throughout the code, and get a feel for what the significance of the variable is and how it relates to the rest of the program. Pay particular attention to the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the variable (when it gets initialized, when it is first used, when it is last used, how it gets cleaned up). Then, you will probably make the global a data member of a class (for OO languages), or you will write some get/set functions. Converting to the Singleton Pattern is common, but you may discover that it makes more sense for the data element to be a member of an existing singleton, or maybe even an instance variable. 

# Create a basic read method, either as a class or a global function. Replace all reads with the access method, but leave the variable defined as a global. 
# Review each of the writes to the method and extract action functions one at a time. Unless two operations are coded identically in the original code, extract each write access separately. 
# Change the variable scope from global to local. 
# Analyze similar action functions to determine if any can be merged, i.e., there are no functional differences in the results of the function, just differences in the implementation details. 
# Review the calls to the read method and see if a more complex functionality should be applied. Follow the approach for writes and unless implementations are identical, create separate access functions. 
# Analyze the access functions for duplication. 



As returning variables by &quot;passing by value&quot; are forgotten, so &quot;passing by reference&quot; is often used instead. The reference is a pointer to the variable so the value is remembered when returned. 



Alternatives

* Hidden Globals
* Singleton Pattern 
* Database or TupleSpace


* Context Object 
* Dependency Injection 
* Stateful Procedures

Porting UNIX library to AROS - dealing with static variables which would make it easy to port such libraries to AROS, keeping the benefits of sharing them on disk, but losing the benefit of actually sharing them in memory.

Our problem arises by the fact we want to share the actual code (the .text section of the library) and constant data, but we need to have per-task .bss and .data sections. If we get rid of our intention to share the .text and .rodata sections, things get quite easy: just load and relocate the library whenever it's open, by whoever it's open. It's like statically linking the library into the executable, except that the final linking is done at runtime.

Library:
   - Private data structure
   - Many public access methods

Device:
   - Private data structure
   - Two (BeginIO/AbortIO) access methods

Resource:
   - Public data structure
   - *NO* access methods
&lt;/pre&gt;

And, being Amiga, there are exceptions to all of these.

[http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=3475&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC HIDD] are used for device/peripheral low level hardware support drivers. The HIDD system is broken up into a collection of classes with a strict inheritance hierarchy. A HIDD class implements a device driver for a single device or in rare cases a group of devices and provides an interface for other programs and devices to access.
      
In order to maintain portability of interfaces across a wide range of hardware this interface will in general not present the raw interface to the underlying hardware. Instead it will present a generic interface that describes many different hardware implementations. This allows for the best reuse of both interfaces and code.

HIDD API is heavyweight though. You need to open a HIDD library, open oop.library, instantiate an object (even if there's no object); and object calls are more costly compared to plain library calls. 

In the V0 branch, in workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau was committed pcimock.hidd. This is a pci driver that allows mocking real PCI devices under linux-hosted. The main idea is to be able to run the real hardware driver under linux-hosted with as little changes as possible(some changes will always be needed though unless someone wants to write complete device simulator) so that driver's code paths can be executed and debugged using gdb. This was a very helpful capability when porting nouveau. Now it is externalized from nouveau.hidd and can be used by other people porting drivers. The pcimock.hidd can currently mock 4 different nvidia cards, 1 AGP bridge and also mock irq.hidd. 

What's the difference between this driver and the pcilinux.hidd? I used that one to develop many different HW drivers for aros. As far as I understood the intention of pcilinux.hidd it is supposed to get access to real hardware that is running under linux. The pcimock.hidd goal is to mock the hardware. For example my dev box is a PCIE system, but I still would like to run the AGP codes paths in nouveau under linux-hosted to check if they don't seg fault. The other case would be to run codes paths for hardware that the developer does not have (Fermi cards in my case). In the case of pcimock.hidd, the AROS driver's code paths will execute as long as you add proper mocking (for example fill in PCI config area or values for registers in BARs). This is an advantage for ported drivers - the code should already work (since it worked on another system) but there might have been mistakes made during porting which can be detected easily with gdb.

In case you are writing your driver from scratch, pcilinux.hidd hidd will give you more advantage, since you can actually access the real hardware from linux-hosted.



Basically your task is to implement a subclass of hidd.ata.bus for your hardware. just implementing the XXXATA__Hidd_ATABus__xxxxxx methods for the Amiga chipset - and appropriate versions of the interface_xxx.c file(s). pretty much everything in probe.c could be ignored - just write a replacement scan for relevant amiga devices and store whatever info you need in the bus data? only the &quot;SUPPORT_LEGACY&quot; blocks might be related. 

You do not need to depend on PCI API. PCI is just a way to discover the hardware on PCs, etc. 
&lt;hidd/pci.h&gt; includes (at some depth) &lt;interface/HW.h&gt;, which defines IID_HW. This comes from the 'generic' HIDD class in: 
 rom/hidds/hidd/hiddclass.conf
did not split up HIDD and HW because they are always used in pair. It's the same as hidd/pci.h bringing definition for: PCI, PCIDriver and PCIDevice. PCI is actually PCIHW, just the name was not changed for backwards compatibility reasons. HW is a 'hub' where HIDD instances plug in. 

ATA HIDD aoHidd_ATABus_Use32Bit value is completely ignored unless ata.device first detects correct command line parameter.
Yes. Unfortunately i was unable to find any comment in code or svn history with explanations. Looked  at Linux source, there 32-bit PIO is also controller driver's property. Some of them enable it, some don't. 

Actually,  switching  the default to ON should be safe. ata.device is fail-safe at this because during IDENTIFY command it validates upper
16  bits,  and  if they appear to be zeroes in all 128 longwords, then 32-bit  mode  is  switched  off.  But, nevertheless, i know how tricky
hardware can be, so i decided not to change original behavior. If  you think it's wrong in some cases, then it's possible to add one
more  attribute  like  aHidd_ATABus_Default32Bit.  If set to YES, then  this means that 32-bit PIO is safe to use by default.

The Amiga used [[Aros/Developer/Docs/Devices|Devices]] to communicate with [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=0&amp;topic_id=3475&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC additional hardware]. AROS has replaced these hardware devices with hidd equivalents but some are still retained for backwards compatibility. 

Local libraries/devices/handlers,etc are supposed to override the ones in ROM if their version is higher than the one in ROM. 


Here is the list of commands exec default: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| CMD_CLEAR
|  Purge the buffer of the device
|----
| CMD_READ
|  Playback Control
|----
| CMD_STOP
|  Stopped the activity of the device
|----
| CMD_FLUSH
|  Empty the queue of commands
|----
| CMD_RESET

While most other &quot;stuff you communicate with&quot; in AmigaOS are devices &lt;ref&gt;AMIGA ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Devices, 3rd Edition. Commodore-Amiga, Inc. Addison-Wesley, 1991.

:[[Aros/Developer/Docs/Handlers/PFS|pfs.handler]]
:[[Aros/Developer/Docs/Handlers/NTFS|fuse.handler]]
:[[Aros/Developer/Docs/Handlers/FFS|ffs.handler]]

filesystem handlers have their own separate system consisting of completely differently structured messages that dos.library use to pass requests (for things like reading, writing, getting directory contents etc.) to them. AROS originally went with implementing filesystem handlers as devices, which might arguably be more consistent with the rest of the AmigaOS API but which is quite incompatible with AmigaOS itself. In retrospect it wasn't a great idea as it made it far harder to port filesystems and the gains were comparatively small, and so there's been a long standing goal of fixing this incompatibility. It has now, June 2011, been reintroduced to all AROS flavors. 

are argstr and argsize valid for the handler startup environment?
DOS/RunHandler() calls DOS/CreateNewProcTags(), and then CallEntry() (in rom/dos/exit.c) to start the handler, so yes, argstr and argsize are *present* in the call signature of the handler. 

Granted, argstr will be NULL and argsize 0, but those values *are* passed to the handler function using: 

&lt;pre&gt;
AROS_UFC3(ULONG, entry,
                         AROS_UFCA(STRPTR, argptr, A0),
                         AROS_UFCA(ULONG, argsize, D0),
                         AROS_UFCA(struct ExecBase *, SysBase, A6));
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Debugging Code==

Please use the [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=43586&amp;atid=439463 AROS Bug Tracker] if any issues are found. 


GRUB Command line list 

&lt;pre&gt;
sysdebug  
usbdebug - allows to see Poseidon's log in debug output
&lt;/pre&gt;


How do I get debugging out of InitResident ? If running i386 hosted on linux sysdebug=initresident on command line.
This  way  you can enable any of listed flags. sysdebug=all stands for &quot;everything&quot;


Have an executable (crosscompiled C++ code) which has 6 MB size on disk, but after loading it in memory, 250 MB RAM is taken. Any software that would split AROS executable into ELF part which would show actual size values? 

 readelf -S executable

it will show you all sections in elf file, including sizes and requested alignment. 

 objdump -h filename

That's will give you a quick overview of the sections and sizes. Ignore all the .debug.* sections. 
Would hazard a guess that you have a large .bss section. That's pretty common in C++. 

Next step:

 nm --size-sort filename | grep ' [bB] '

The last few will be your biggest consumers. Would suggest -C to demangle the symbols... ;) 


Suggest profiling the program (just use some printf's in the main loop for time spent in each part), it usually is quite easy to spot slow parts in games or apps. 



If someone has '#define IPTR ULONG' somewhere. To see where that define is, redefine IPTR in the source code that fails, just above the line that fails, and the preprocessor will tell you where it was defined first. 





===How to setup gdb with AROS/hosted===

Download AROS sources (AROS-xxxxxxxx-source.tar.bz2, where xxxxxxxx is the current date) and AROS contrib sources (AROS-xxxxxxxx-contrib-source) from [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php aros.sourceforge.net/download.php] 

Untar-bzip2 and cd to the unpacked archive directory.

 &gt; tar -xvjf AROS-xxxxxxxx-source.tar.bz2
 &gt; cd AROS-xxxxxxxx-source

Check the link to &quot;contrib&quot; (contrib-source) inside directory, e.g. correct like this:

 &gt; rm contrib
 &gt; ln -s ../AROS-xxxxxxxx-contrib-source.tar.bz2 contrib

Make sure you have the correct locale setting, otherwise compilation will fail at some point. See [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/compiling.php#setting-the-locale-to-iso8859 here] (or link below) for more on that. You might have to enter this:

 &gt; export LANG=&quot;en_US.ISO-8859-1&quot;

Now configure for a debug build - see &quot;./configure --help&quot; for more - here are two examples:

 &gt; ./configure --enable-debug=stack,modules,symbols
 
 &gt; ./configure --enable-debug=all

You may &quot;make&quot; now, or choose a separate directory for your build (e.g. for easy removal), for example if compiling for i386 architecture you could create a directory like this:

 &gt; mkdir linux-i386
 &gt; cd linux-i386
 &gt; ../AROS/configure --enable-debug=stack,symbols,modules

When done configuring you're ready to go:

 &gt; make

Building AROS takes some time - minutes on fast machines (e.g. 2.5GHz quadcore), up to hours on slower machines.
The result will be AROS Linux hosted with gdb debugging enabled.

See aros.org documentation for more on compiling AROS, including more [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/compiling.php --enable-debug] options.


When finished, enter bin/linux-i386/AROS directory (replace &quot;linux-i386&quot; with your compilation target platform, e.g. linux-x86_64, etc.) inside the unpacked archive directory. This directory contains the required .gdbinit file for properly running AROS inside gdb.

 &gt; cd bin/linux-i386/AROS

Run AROS (here: with 128MB of memory) from gdb:

 &gt; gdb --args boot/aros-unix -m 128
or
 &gt; gdb --args boot/arosboot -m 128

 (gdb) r

Watch the shell output - in case AROS complains about &quot;LoadKeyCode2RawKeyTable: Loading &quot;DEVS:Keymaps/X11/keycode2rawkey.table&quot; failed!&quot; you should also see some instructions on how to create a keymap table. (see link above &quot;more on compiling&quot;, too.)
Quit gdb, and try default keymap table:

 (gdb) q
 The program is running.  Quit anyway (and kill it)? (y or n) y
 &gt; cd ../../..
 &gt; make default-x11keymaptable

Re-run AROS, as described above. Try e.g. RAros (= right windows key) + W to open a shell. If this doesn't work you have to create a keymap table yourself, quit gdb again, and make a new keytable:

 &gt; make change-x11keymaptable

A window will open. Watch the window's title bar, and follow the instructions.

When done, re-run AROS. RAros + W should now open a shell.

Next, compile your program with gdb support.


When you start GDB is there a warning which says

   warning: File &quot;&lt;whatever&gt;/.gdbinit&quot; auto-loading has been declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to ...

If so start gdb with &quot;-ix .gdbinit&quot;


&lt;pre&gt;
Summary - In short:

* build AROS with debugging support (i.e. ./configure --enable-debug=all)
* build your application with debugging support (i.e. option -g)
* run AROS in the GNU debugger (you may use the GUI frontend &quot;ddd&quot; which simplifies usage a bit)
* start your application
* use the commands &quot;findaddr&quot; and &quot;add-symbol-file&quot; as written in the debugging manual
* if the debugger doesn't find the source code of your application use the &quot;dir&quot; command of the debugger. 
&lt;/pre&gt;




===How to use gdb===

In AROS open a shell, then (in host shell) use CTRL-Z to go into gdb. Use &quot;b Exec_CreatePool&quot; (one of the functions used early on by startup code in programs) to add a breakpoint, then &quot;cont&quot; and gdb will interrupt somewhere early during startup of &quot;program&quot;. Use &quot;bt&quot; to show backtrace and &quot;loadseg&quot; for &quot;??&quot; entries. One of them will be for &quot;program&quot;. After that you can use &quot;disassemble program&quot;. 

One thing you need to make sure is that .gdbinit you have in your build directory is the same as in source tree. It has been modified some time ago, but the build system does not refresh it - you need to copy it manually 

To recap, please read our debugging [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/debugging.php manual]:


To detect segfaulting when loading, try...

 ./configure --enable-debug --with-optimization=&quot;-O2&quot;

Because crash or no crash may depend on optimization. For newer compilers maybe this helps...

 --with-optimization=-&quot;-O2 -fno-strict-aliasing&quot;

One way to make crashes less random (more easily reproducible) is to activate the munging of free memory in rom/exec/freemem.c which is normally commented out:

&lt;pre&gt;
Index: freemem.c

        /* DOH! it doesn't work even this way. What's wrong???

         */
+
+       if ((SysBase-&gt;TDNestCnt &lt; 0) &amp;&amp; (SysBase-&gt;IDNestCnt &lt; 0))
+           MUNGE_BLOCK(memoryBlock, MEMFILL_FREE, byteSize);

     }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Mungwall can be turned on at runtime. Currently this works in all hosted versions. Just specify &quot;mungwall&quot; on kernel command line and it works. It can work on native too. In order to enable it you need to parse kernel command line, and if &quot;mungwall&quot; is present, set EXECF_MungWall bit in IntExecBase.IntFlags. 

This needs to be done before the first AllocMem() for obvious reasons. And never reset back this flag! If you change it on a working system, you are doomed. 

Hosted ports do the processing in rom/exec/prepareexecbase.c --enable-debug=mungwall option in configure still works but is going obsolete.  A kludge in rom/exec/allocmem.c is responsible for this and it needs to be removed when the transition is done.

BTW,  on  i386-pc  port it can be activated by &quot;mungwall&quot; argument on command line, you don't need to rebuild AROS.
New mungwall affects not only AllocMem()/FreeMem(), but also pools. I also tested it with AllocAbs(), seems to work correctly. 

Runtime mungwall works on:

* pc-i386
* pc-x86_64
* linux-i386
* linux-x86_64
* darwin-x86
* linux-ppc

Works on all hosted ports, if the port itself is working. 

* amiga-m68k
* Not on sam440-ppc and efika-chrp-ppc, even if they would be able to be built at moment. Does not work on (for now, need NVRAM support) 



When starting my freshly rebuilt i386-linux-aros which was compiled with full debugging support I get sometimes the error &quot;Program exited with code 0377&quot;. Add the following to your .gdbinit: 
 set follow-fork-mode child




Here are some of the custom AROS gdb functions (defined in &quot;.gdbinit&quot; file) to resolve &quot;in ?? ()&quot; entries in backtrace: 
&lt;pre&gt;
#0 0xb7ffd424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
#1 0xb7e2a657 in sigsuspend () from /lib/libc.so.6
#2 0xb7c63900 in ?? ()
#3 0xb7c640e3 in ?? ()
#4 0xb7c641e0 in ?? ()
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use

 loadseg 0xb7c63900
 loadframe 2
or
 loadbt
and some others. Use &quot;help &quot; for a little help text. If the commands do not work try &quot;loadkick&quot; first.


Use &quot;thistask&quot;, &quot;taskready&quot;, &quot;taskwait&quot; to get list of AROS tasks. &quot;bttask &quot; shows backtrace of a task which is in ready or in wait queue and &quot;loadseg&quot; to resolve &quot;??&quot; entries in it's backtrace (&quot;loadframe&quot; would not work as it assume current running task).





===Native debugging tools for AROS===

SYS:Tools/Debug/'''Sashimi''' - displays error messages

One suggestion is to do a bug() debugging. Each time bug() is executed it will be output on sashimi. 
You include &lt;aros/debug.h&gt; and place bug(&quot;something\n&quot;); in your source code at location though which control passes. 

To get the output - open an aros shell 

 SYS:Tools/Debug/sashimi &gt; RAM:out.txt 

'''Ctrl C''' to end the output to the RAM Disk. 




SYS:Tools/Debug/'''Bifteck''' 

you must enable debugging at boot time entering the GRUB menu editing line (E key) and adding &quot;debug=memory&quot; to your boot line, then press Ctrl+X to complete booting. 

Open a shell and enter the line below to run Biftek and grab the debug messages collected in RAM into a text file. 

 tools/debug/bifteck &gt; ram:debug.txt 





SYS:Utilities/'''Snoopy''' - monitors OS function calls, run &quot;Sashimi&quot; to see Snoopy's output 

SYS:Tools/'''WiMP'''    - the Window (and Screens) Manipulation Program 



You can use the -E option of gcc to find out how preprocessor macros are expanded.




===Errors===

crash in strcasecmp usually means that one of its arguments is NULL.


Old Amiga [http://www.amigacoding.com/index.php?title=Guru_codes&amp;redirect=no Guru Codes]

If the crash is in intuition. Sometimes, if it relates to text, a null pointer sets it off. 
an uninitialised pointer can have any address (this is a common fault). 

Compiling on 64bit, Many old code would not properly typecast when doing pointer-integer conversions and thus at least throw a warning. This can easily be located and fixed.

Then again, many current compilers also throw a warning when you try to assign a pointer value to an integer and the integer is possibly too small. This happens under .NET for example when a 64 bit pointer is assigned to something like an ULONG - so exactly the case which you described.

* Use texteditor or some tool to replace all &quot;ULONG&quot; with &quot;IPTR&quot; and &quot;LONG&quot; with &quot;SIPTR&quot; in the sources. 

* Fix (change IPTR/SIPTR back to ULONG/LONG) the few places which really rely on ULONG/LONG being exactly 32 bit. That's for things like pixel (ARGB) buffers, structs written/read to disk, colormaps, but probably not much else. 





== Misc ==

===APL, MPL, BSD, GPL and LGPL Licences===

The majority of AROS sources in licensed under AROS Public License ([http://aros.sourceforge.net/license.html APL]) which (to a degree) protects us from someone taking AROS sources and not contributing improvements back (for example MorphOS took some AROS source and then contributed changes back)

It is written to allow the use of AROS code in other open source or commercial projects without exception whilst providing a mechanism so that improvements/additions can find their way back to the original source in one form or another. 

There are &quot;3rd&quot; party applications used by AROS that do not fall under this license, which are an extra &quot;Contrib&quot; download for convenience.  

Anyone can port GPL-ed network and sound drivers as AROSTCP and AHI are GPLed. Direct using (porting) [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs GPL]-ed code in other parts of AROS (gfx, sata, usb) is not possible because AROS license is not compatible with GPL. You need to utilize permissive licensed code like BSD or MIT/X11.


BSD and MPL license are the closest to APL. 

APL however is not so compatible with LGPL/GPL.

LGPL case - you cannot statically combine APL code with LGPL. You can, however thank to LGPL being &quot;lesser&quot; restrictive, use LGPL dynamically loaded libraries in APL codes.

GPL case - you cannot combine APL code with GPL in any way if there is no explicit clause by GPLed code authors allowing that. If you do combine APL with GPL in &quot;bad&quot; ways described above - you have a problem (you violate GPL). This problem might result in everything in AROS becoming GPL or everything running or AROS becoming GPL (here I'm not sure really). The other scenario is that you are not allowed to legally distribute such code at all. To be honest I have grasped how to violate GPL, but I'm still no exactly sure what happens when you violate it (but I'm sure it's not anything nice)

GPL software can run on top of non-GPL &quot;system components&quot; (see system components exception of GPL), but the other way around (non-GPL using GPL) leads to problems. This means applications like scout, or Quake III are ok (in the majority of cases). 

Theres no reason GPL drivers cannot be ported - but they cant be in AROS's ROM (requires linking APL code with GPL), nor can AROS depend on them (e.g. they must use existing apis).
If they are launched (dynamically linked) by a user action that is allowed. It is also allowed to distribute such binaries together for convenience.

GPL is not about statical or dynamic linking but is about executing process and function calls. 


These components - SFS, isapnp, Zune texteditor, AHi, network drivers, freetype, openuirl, BHFormat, Edit and (&quot; dynamically loaded libraries&quot;) are LGPL, not GPL. Mesa/Nouveau stuff is MIT. Some user tools are GPL though. 

'''AROS (system)'''
* system components (libraries/classes/devices/etc) cannot be GPL as they would propagate GPL to complete system as well as GPL is not compatible with MPL from which APL is based 
* system components can be LGPL v2 or a permissive license (MIT/BSD)
* system applications can be anything you like (but still I would prefer APL or permissive so the code can be reused if needed)

'''Contrib:'''
* no rules - contrib does not impact AROS system since nothing in AROS system depends on contrib. 



About stealing code: The chances of this happening is exactly the same whether we are APL or GPL. If any closed-source option wanted to do it, there is no one that can validate otherwise. MorphOS has used some AROS codes, but contributed changes back. 

The rationale behind APL is that while it guarantees that the original developer will get the improvements back (to a certain degree - file based), the person who uses the codes does not have to open his original codes. BSD does not guarantee that the original developer gets improvements. GPL requires the person using the codes to open his codes as well. 

The copyright holders needs to stay - we just need information from them that the codes are available under APL (for example a checked-in file like in case of Poseidon). We don't do transfer of copyrights. 

; Ultimately what can and cannot be done is up to the author(s) - not the licence.

AHI: it has special provisions (COPYING.DRIVERS). The library is LGPL, preferences software is GPL and drivers can be anything without breaking GPL/LGPL.

Network stack: well, we are long overdue for a new, IPv6 enabled network stack anyway, anyone interested? ;) Seriously though it seems like the glue code is GPL and as all the drivers. However some of the drivers are our own code, so they could be relicensed to LGPL. 



 Same filter as the AROS trunk list. These should all be libraries or plugins - no programs.

===Types===

* UBYTE/BYTE for 8bit
* UWORD/WORD for 16bit
* ULONG/LONG for 32bit
* UQUAD/QUAD for 64bit

&lt;pre&gt;
UBYTE    Unsigned 8 bit integer variable (byte).
BYTE     Signed 8 bit integer variable (byte).
UWORD    Unsigned 16 bit integer variable (word).
WORD     Signed 16 bit integer variable (word).
ULONG    Unsigned 32 bit integer variable (longword).
LONG     Signed 32 bit integer variable (longword).
FLOAT    32 bit IEEE floating point variable.
UQUAD    Unsigned 64 bit integer variable.
QUAD     Signed 64 bit integer variable.
DOUBLE   64bit IEEE floating point variable.
BOOL     Boolean variable, TRUE and FALSE are also defined in exec/types.h.
VOID     Void.

APTR     A generic pointer for multiple purposes - Arrays.
STRPTR   A pointer to a null-terminated string.
IPTR     Really important in AROS, the only way to declare a field that can contain both: an integer or a pointer.
&lt;/pre&gt;

if you want to write really portable app, you may be interested in standard datatypes defined in C99: int8_t, uint8_t, int16_t, uint16_t, int32_t, uint32_t, int64_t, uint64_t, intptr_t, uintptr_t. They are all defined in inttypes.h include file. 

In exec/types.h the following short-cuts are typedef'd. They are used often in AROS, so you should nearly always include exec/types.h and soon only they will be removed from sys/_types.h include, all types are now defined in include files named aros/types/xxx.h. 

(Preparation for C library split; sys/xxx.h include will only be available there when compiling with POSIX C library)


Compiler specific types, like int and long might change their size. In case of AROS, similar to linux, int remains 32 bit whereas long grows to 64 bits in size. 

If you use Amiga-like data types, i.e. BYTE/UBYTE, WORD/UWORD, LONG/ULONG and QUAD/UQUAD or the C99 standard types (uint8_t and so on, see stdint.h include) then you should have less issues to solve than by using types without size guarantee. 

Of course, all pointers grow to 64 bytes using 64bit cpu. Most of the code can be just recompiled and will work. In rare cases, where e.g. pointers are casted to integers, a special care must be taken. Especially in the cases, where pointer is casted to LONG/ULONG (this code will break on 64 bit AROS) eg.  '#define IPTR ULONG'. 

With compiler delint patches which the majority of them are simple casting issues to make the compiler happy. Notice some of the changes involve introducing double casts. In very recent versions of GCC. Yes, the bulk of the double casts are for converting 32 bit addresses (ie from a 32 bit PCI DMA address register) to a 64 bit pointer. First cast is to IPTR (to expand to 64 bits, and prevent sign extension if the address is above 0x7FFFFFFF), and then to APTR. 

ULONG != IPTR except on 32bit .. so if you need to store pointers make sure and use IPTR and not ULONG (which some old code does). For this reason things like Taglist elements are 64bit (since the tag data can be a pointer). 
If your passing items on the stack you should use the STACKED attribute to make sure they are correctly aligned (on 64bit all items on the stack are 64bit..)

There is more issues like using &quot;== 0L&quot; causes problems. 




===Endian===

*BE 
*LE

Use the macros from &lt;endian.h&gt; instead making a guess based upon architecture defines
 
&lt;pre&gt;
#if _BYTE_ORDER == _BIG_ENDIAN

#elif _BYTE_ORDER == _LITTLE_ENDIAN

#else
+
#error &lt;whatever.h&gt; - Byte order for this architecture is unsupported! 
&lt;/pre&gt;




===SVN and GIT===

If you want to help develop AROS OS itself, you can view GIT/SVN entries [http://repo.or.cz/w/AROS.git git repo], [http://www.ohloh.net/p/aros/commits ohloh] or [https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/ svn repo] and access [Git version git://repo.or.cz/AROS.git here], [https://www.gitorious.org/aros/aros/commit/a7fda9e ARIX commits] or [https://gitorious.org/aros/aros GIT old] 

If you have SVN access (early 2015 there's a new SVN server, create a new account at trac aros org) and/or have obtained the source [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php AROS site] - you can compile the current build tools/environment using:

 &gt; make development

and follow this [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/compiling.php#building procedure].


https://trac.aros.org/trac#Developing

If you plan on contributing back changes, please post information about such changes first on this [http://mail.aros.org/mailman/listinfo/aros-dev/ mailing list] for more experience developers can validate whether they are correct. 


Then there are the nightly build machines. They svn update before the build and run configure as one of the next steps. autoconf might be added to the nightly build scripts. 

Our build relies on packages downloaded from Internet (SDL for example) - it always worked this way. The minimal requirement (when just building core AROS) is binutils and gcc. If you build contrib as well, you need many more packages to be downloaded.

===SDI Calls===

Integrate the 'SDI'-headers to allow easier porting to all amiga-like platforms. 



&lt;pre&gt;
PUTCHARPROTO( PutTheChar, char c, struct SPrintfStream *s  )
{
 // REAL CODE
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



have &quot;SDI_compiler.h&quot; and &quot;SDI_hook.h&quot; included 

its more organized like

 #include SDI/SDI_hook.h

than

 #include SDI_hook.h

option 1 --- i also use when back porting from amiga's..

&lt;pre&gt;
#ifdef __AROS__
#include SDI/SDI_hook.h
#else
#include SDI_hook.h
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

also

you can add the -i include/sdi/ location if you do not want to add or edit any files.


Defining HOOKPROTO to IPTR name(struct IClass * cl, Object * obj, Msg msg); solved the problem 

A MUI application most likely needs only the HOOKPROTOxxx SDI macros. They are compatible with AROS, only the attributes (hook, object attribute) must be given in the right order. examine compiler/include/aros/symbolsets.h (AROS_LIBREQ) 

compiling mui stuff for aros setting -std=gnu99 is necessary (i have had -std=c99 most of the time).  




===Locale with Flexcat===

Most languages have a locale, but not every app is localized, the only thing needed is to translate the &quot;catalog&quot; files. It is a case of locating the correct catalog and saving the translated version. 

For every app that lacks of your language catalog and is localized anyway, you should find (in the sources) files related to locale:

* file.cd = catalog descriptor, contains base msg, with internal language (usually english)
* language.ct = catalog translation, contains every translated msg, indexed as in the file.cd.

Compare with other localized apps... Then, &quot;make my_app-catalogs&quot; should create and install your translated catalogs. ex : for, saying, sys:prefs/wanderer: 

on root of AROS sources, type:
 &quot;make workbench-prefs-wanderer-catalogs&quot;
then (if you changed the .cd file):
 &quot;make workbench-prefs-wanderer&quot;

For apps not localized, you have to adapt their code to support it, if it is possible...



noticed the original .cd file has many (//) strings at the end of any voice, so added them also to the .ct file. 
That (//) is only for cd files. I'm highly recommending to use FlexCat for updating ct files, e.g. like this: 

 flexcat app.cd deutsch.ct newctfile deutsch.ct

You'll get error checking and new entries are marked in the resulting ct file.

When editing .ct files, only change those lines containing translation and perhaps version string, nothing else.
The rest is up to the relevant tool, flexcat. In order to update your translation, type in the following in your shell: 

 flexcat xyz.cd xyz.ct NEWCTFILE xyz_upd.ct COPYMSGNEW

This way you will not only make sure you have correct translation file but flexcat also pre-fills newly added strings with &quot;*** NEW *** text. Even better tool for checking cd/ct/catalog files is catcheck, but this one is sadly only available for AmigaOS/68k... 




Some languages have variations, like portugues from portugal and portugues from brasil differs...

This is the way to go. I will have a look at language files, but basically if those two languages differ you have to do two separated set of translation files, yes.
(you could create a brazilian slang language localization too)

* At system level localization for one language is a dot language file.
(ex: locale:languages/klingon.language)

* At app level localization is a dot catalog file
(ex: locale:catalogs/klingon/system/libs/dos.catalog)

* At sources level, the dot ct file, and &quot;$language&quot; dot cd files and some building framework.
(ex: catalogs/my_app.ct catalogs/klingon.cd catalogs/mmakefile.src support.c support.h)



Please, use Flexcat to generate CT files: 
 FlexCat wanderer.cd NEWCTFILE=deutsch.ct

Then fill the first 2 lines with something useful:
&lt;pre&gt;
## version $VER: wanderer.catalog 1.1 (9.2.2006)
## language deutsch
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can even update the CT-File: (This adds the new strings)
 FlexCat wanderer.cd deutsch.ct NEWCTFILE=deutsch.ct


To compile a catalog you only need the .cd file and your translation (.ct file):
 FlexCat multiview.cd deutsch.ct CATALOG=MultiView.catalog

===C Utils Misc===

The AROS source uses at several places the __DATE__ macro to fill the date entry of a $VER tag. Problem is that c:version doesn't understand that date format (e.g. &quot;May 21 2011&quot;). As a result the output of e.g.
&gt; &quot;version c:shell full&quot; contains &quot;(null)&quot;. Is extending the version command to understand the format of __DATE__  the right solution for that problem? 

AmigaOs compilers should use __AMIGADATE__ macro or similar form, if it isn't implemented it could be emulated in makefile: -D__AMIGADATE__=\&quot;$(shell date &quot;+%d.%m.%Y&quot;)\&quot; 

BTW. I think DD.MM.YYYY is better format than &quot;Month DD YYY&quot; because &quot;Month DD YYY&quot; is not localized in any way. 

&quot;strnicmp&quot; shouldn't work with NULL pointers



The Situation:

compiled a linklib using c++ object files (using the c++ cross compiler).
compiled a C stub that uses the linklib (using the c++ cross compiler).

Try to link them together (using the c++ cross compiler) with C object
files (using the normal target c compiler) that need to use -nostartup
= cant do because using the c++ files pulls in arosc (for stdio etc) -
so wants to have the autoinit stuff present.

What can I do about this??

If it is possible to manually open it then what do I need to do exactly?






=== ENV ===

The philosophy behind ENV: is that keeping configuration files there allows you to  'Use'  preferences  by  keeping  a copy in ENVARC: intact. However in some cases (like this one) it is not required. 

99% of the time that statement is true (not required) for pretty much every file in ENV: or do people change their default icons - and prefs settings - every boot? 

There seem to be a bad habit of late with developers changing things to reflect their own personal preference when the change isnt actually necessary - It would be nice if people could refrain from doing that in the tree without atleast discussing it on the dev-list first (and with good reasoning unless they commited said work in the first place..) 

We're not keen on the pollution of the &quot;S:&quot; dir: it's meant to be for scripts. What's wrong with &quot;ENV:&quot;?
Only the fact that it takes up RAM. I  understand  that  for  PCs  with  several gigabytes of RAM this is
irrelevant. But let's remember about other machines. The philosophy behind ENV: is that keeping configuration files there allows you to  'Use'  preferences  by  keeping  a copy in ENVARC: intact. 

However in some cases (like this one) it is not required. 

How about implementing in the style of HappyENV then? RAM-disk handler that falls through to reading from ENVARC: if there is no such file stored in it already. Removes RAM usage for unchanged files, removes the need to copy ENVARC to ENV in startup-sequence. 
Shouldn't be too hard to make from AmberRAM, or even just extend AmberRAM to provide this service. 

Is it feasable to build a special version of AmberRAM handling ENV: that will try and copy the requested file from ENVARC: if it isnt found in ENV: ? 
Additionaly it could mark closed &quot;files&quot; as untouched - and expunge them from ENV: after a period of time to free up additional RAM:, or when the system is running low on free memory? 

Silenty disappearing files may not be a good plan. Would be nice if the following would work: 

ASSIGN :ENV SYS:Prefs/Env-Arc ADD
ASSIGN :ENV RAM:ENV  ADD

Where new files put in ENV: end up in RAM:ENV, and opening files looks in RAM:ENV first, then SYS:Prefs/Env-Arc 

Well - thats essentially what im proposing but without the assigns - or need for a RAM:ENV directory. 
Adding it as a feature of AmberRAM sounds like the most memory efficient way (one handler to load in RAM) but thats only if it is possible to make it handle ENV: additionaly to RAM:, and if it is even possible to add the proposed functionality (...and how to make it enable it when accessing ENV:).

===(AS)MP support===

[http://www.natami.net/knowledge.php?b=6&amp;note=31148&amp;order=&amp;x=1 It does not at the moment support resource tracking and SMP due to amigaOS (TM) 3.1 original design]. 
As long as the CPU initiates the DMA transfers through the OS, and the OS ensures that the transfered memory is within the region accessible to the user initiating the transfer, everything is fine. The CPU is the conductor, and the CPU by that has the control of which DMA transfer is initiated and which is not.
All you need to do is to write device drivers reasonable. Hint: CachePreDMA and CachePostDMA exist.
All the Os has to do is to verify that the memory regions to be transfered are valid, and prohibit direct access to the DMA control registers from user space. None of these algorithms imply huge costs.
The current OS design doesn't really allow virtual memory in first place, Forbid() is again the problem. 


Another suggestion is ... Forbid/Permit function calls are meant to halt multitasking so as no other task could intervene with what ever the calling task is doing, e.g. setting semaphores. Disable/Enable calls are meant to halt interrupts and as a side effect they also halt task switching.

One option is to make it compulsory to protect shared resources with semaphores and forbid the use of simple Forbid() calls as to protect something. Setting semaphore should be done if possible with atomic instructions (check and alter in one instruction), but I don't think it would be much of a loss to system performance to do global Forbid() if no other mechanism were not available. Or make the second concurrent ObtainSemaphore call halt the second calling task and force if possible a task switch which ever gives better results.

Semaphores could store the owning tasks task pointer instead of boolean to make things easier.

[http://www.tbs-software.com/guide/index.php?guide=autodocs.doc%2Fmemory.doc&amp;node=1 memory.library API] seem to low level. IMHO the programs should not know how the swapping is implemented. I would just go for one new memory flag
MEMF_SWAPPABLE that indicates that a certain memory region or a whole memory pool won't be accessed during Forbid()/Permit() etc. It only solves part of the problem, it only implements virtual memory and not memory protection. For the latter you need to be able make certain memory inaccessible by other programs, some memory read-only for one task and read-write for other tasks, etc. And I think this should be done in the same Address Space in order to avoid you constantly need to swap between different address spaces. 
So to summarize, if there are programs using this API we may provide a wrapper layer to get them working but I am not convinced this API should be the reference API with whom to provide VM to AROS programs. 




=== Variadic ===

variadic functions (i.e. functions with an arbitrary amount of arguments). 

&lt;pre&gt;
    #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
    [...]

    char * STDARGS GetKeyWord(int value, char *def, ...)
    {
        [...]
        va_list va;
        [...]
        va_start(va, def);
        [...]
        va_end (args);

&lt;/pre&gt;

Please keep with using stdarg rather than having va casted to a LONG * type and varargs handled manually. Doing so, prevents tons of casting, where a simple va_arg can be used. So, string = *((char **) args) instead of string=va_arg(va, char *). 

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

int printf (const char * format, ...)

{
    int     retval;
    va_list args;

    va_start (args, format);

    retval = vfprintf (stdout, format, args);

    va_end (args);

    fflush (stdout);

    return retval;
} /* printf */
&lt;/pre&gt;



Couldn't find varargs.h or stdarg.h. and have no use for AROS_SLOWSTACKHOOKS or AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS. 

GCC looks for stdarg.h in a different place: 
 /bin/linux-i386/tools/lib/gcc/i386-aros/4.2.2/include/stdarg.h

Here is a path for a &quot;normal&quot; header:
 bin/linux-i386/tools/lib/gcc/i386-aros/4.2.2/../../../../i386-aros/sys-include/aros/system.h


The use of vararg.h isn't supported by newer gcc versions. If you want your code to run on architectures that pass part of variadic arguments in a number of registers you need to use AROS_SLOWSTACK macros. Otherwise your program will not work on powerpc and x86_64 ports. 



Of course the SLOWSTACK stuff is not needed in a function that can use va_list, va_start, va_arg and va_end. It's only needed if you want to write functions like DoMethod or similar. 

 #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

should be enough no matter if you do cross or native compiling. If it does not work, something is wrong and should be corrected. 

Stdarg.h is here, Development:lib/gcc/i386-aros/4.2.2/include/ 

...which is part of the compiler's default include paths. In other words, #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt; works out of the box, indeed. (sorry, I should have just tried it before invoking &quot;search&quot; or &quot;find&quot;...) 

furthermore, myprintf() as shown above won't work, because...

 printf(format, args);

...is wrong - the second argument does not match printf() prototype, it expects a argument list, but args is of type va_list (obviously) - so one has to use...

 vfprintf(stdout, format, args);

...instead, just like in the original printf(), and add fflush(stdout).

additionally, one could use...

 int myarg = va_arg(args, int);

...between va_start() and va_end() to access individual arguments, where each call to va_arg() returns an argument casted to the desired type (here: &quot;int&quot;) from the list given (here: &quot;args&quot;) and advances to the next one.

wrapping up vfprintf() and modifying the format string now is a major speedup! no more backslash-n typing! this has been haunting me for years!



On MOS and AmigaOS, the NewObject variadic function is kept in the static library. It takes most of the parameters on the stack - thanks to that the implementation of NewObject calls the NewObjectA function. Everything works perfect, and the typical MUI macros may be easily used.

This, however, is not the case when you compile for AROS. Here, NewObject is a variadic macro, not a function. Thanks such approach we do not need any custom compiler in case of systems, where the arguments of variadic functions are passed partially through registers and partially through the stack (This is the case of PPC and x86_64, this is also the reason why both OS4 and MOS require specially patched compilers).

Since NewObject is a macro, the gcc's preprocessor expects the list of macros arguments enclosed within parentheses. In MUI macros it is not the case. Imagine the following test code:

&lt;pre&gt;
#define foo(a,b) ((a)+(b))

int loosy_function(int a, int b)
{
    return foo(a,b);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will compile and work, but the following piece of code:

&lt;pre&gt;
#define foo(a,b) ((a)+(b))
#define END )

int loosy_function(int a, int b)
{
    return foo(a,b END;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will fail with the error: unterminated argument list invoking macro &quot;foo&quot;

There are two ways of fixing your issue. Either create your new objects outside this huge MUI constructions, and in there use just a pointer, or get rid of the &quot;End&quot; macro and exchange it with &quot;TAG_DONE)&quot;.


Badly written software is, for example, casting va_list to an APTR or even doing so as if va_list were a plain table of function arguments. Such code needs to be fixed because it has very few chances to work anywhere but on author's machine ;)



The problem is nOt that they assume sizeof(APTR) == 4, its that they often do not use APTR, and use ULONG to store pointers exclusively. If the code used APTR/IPTR as it should - most of the &quot;problems&quot; wouldn't exist. 

It would also help if people would start using variadic arguments properly. Many coders do assumptions which shall never be made. Instead, they should consider using stdarg.h file and all the va_* functions :)

&lt;pre&gt;
admin/
branches/
trunk/
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have added two extra dirs there: tags and imports 

As discussed when we branch ABI V0 and [[Aros/Developer/ABIv1|ABI V1]] it would also be good to introduce tags. Normally this is done in a directory in the repository called tags. Currently we don't have this directory there. (We do have branches/tags that is a hack I have done because one doesn't have write access in the top directory. I think this directory is not clean and should be removed). 

The second directory I would introduce is an imports directory for implementing vendor branches as discussed in the svn [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html book]. Currently we use code from several different projects and that code is stored inside the AROS tree; we seem to have problems with keeping this code up to date and merge our changes upstream. Maintainers of up stream projects like the MUI classes etc. have complained about this (to put it lightly). 

Introducing these vendor branches would make it easier to see what changes we have made and make patches to be sent upstream and make it easier to import newer upstream versions of their code. Although can't &quot;copy&quot; the vendor brach into the main branch because it's already there, so start with a &quot;merge&quot;. 

Yes, the first step to make the code already in the repository compatible with the vendor branches will be the most difficult. The best way to do it the following way: 

* first import the version on which the current AROS code is based into the vendor branch
* then import the new version over it in the vendor branch
* finally merge the difference between these two version in the AROS code present in the repository.

For example, place NList directly under vendor and not in a subdirectory like &quot;contrib/zune/classes&quot;. 



Actually after we have a stable [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/specifications/drafts/abiv1.php ABIv1 (2012 or later)]. We need to move away as much as possible from the contrib directory to some other repositories. The reasons are ... 

* The AROS repository should be for the core AROS code.
* other contrib projects should be tried to be compiled for all Amiga-like OSes.
* The release scheme for AROS and the other programs should not have to be aligned.
* Binary versions should be provided on aros-archives and on aminet and/or OS4Depot to install them. (Some clever programs should maybe be provided to make the life of distribution developers easier). 
* avoid parallel forks of programs for AROS and the other amiga OSes. 

If there is really a need for a place for hosting AROS projects we may investigate setting up such a server but then including bug tracking, governance, maillist, etc. for each project separately. I personally think there are already enough places like sourceforge, google code, savannah, etc. where people can go for hosting such projects.

Leveraging a 'common' OS with a lot of machine support (Linux, MacOS, Windows, QNX, etc) is something that AROS has been doing for quite a long time, and I consider it the biggest strength of AROS. I feel that we should work more on the AROS experience and programming model, in the same way the Google's Android layers on top of Linux, or MacOS X layers on top of the Darwin/BSD kernel. 

Some real, huge, improvements can be made to AROS if we are willing to (in the future) deemphasise the native ports: 

* The graphics + layers subsystem could be implemented as a shim on top of a OpenGL ES implementation (ie on any modern Linux system, or the RaspberryPI's hardware, MacOS X, etc). 
  - This also allows every window to be on its own 3D surface with backing store, allowing Wanderer (or a Commodity)
rearrange/zoom/animate app windows without having to send a pile or refreshes to them

* Use OpenAL as the sound backend 

* AROSTCP would be a thin layer over the native OS's TCP/IP stack 

* dos.library, poseidon.library, and input.device would be slim shims over the native APIs

* If we move to loading all libraries' into the application's task space, instead of a single global instance of the library, this will allow SMP and MMU more easily. 
  - Yes, it will require a lot of work in the libraries to make this transition
  - Yes, I do think it will be worth it in the end.

* A 'fat binary' install format (or, maybe LLVM bytecode) that can be 'flattend' to the target architecture on installation. 



So, what would this 'AROS of the future' look like? 

* AmigaOS 3.x style API, with certain 'fundamental changes' to message passing
* Uses the underlying OS' device drivers, so more AROS developer effort can go to user-visible features and bugfixes 
* Allows AROS applications to run side-by-side with the OS's native apps 


And why would anyone want to program on such a system?

* AROS applications would run on any system that has the AROS Framework installed
* AROS applications are pixel-for-pixel the same on all platforms. 
* Develop with the knowledge that you are guaranteed OpenGL and OpenAL, and the rest of the AROS Framework



an option for mmake to dump it's dependency of metatarget in a graphviz[*] input file. This should make it possible to 
visualize the dependencies and hopefully be inspiration for cleaning up some mess, circular or unneeded dependencies and so on.

==Description==
This is an example 'Hello World' program to demonstrate the basics of using c under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Research_Operating_System AROS]

==The Code==

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main(void)
{
    puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Save this as a plain text file named 'helloworld.c'.
Inside AROS you can do this by opening a shell (e.g. hit RightAROSKey* + w in Wanderer), typing 'edit helloworld.c', entering the code above, hit RightAROSKey + w to save it, hit RightAROSKey + q to quit editing.

(*on most keyboards RightAROSKey is the Windows key on the right side)




==Making It Compile==

If you've created 'helloworld.c' inside AROS, compile it with:

  gcc -o helloworld helloworld.c

To cross-compile it from linux, provided you've got a proper SDK installed, making the executable &lt;tt&gt;helloworld&lt;/tt&gt; program on AROS-linux-hosted takes this step:

 i386-aros-gcc -o helloworld helloworld.c

In both cases, the result will be an executeable called 'helloworld', which should run under AROS.




==Running It==

In case you've cross-compiled from linux, move the executable into the AROS-linux-hosted installation tree, e.g. like this (assuming 'AROS/' is the root directory of AROS-linux-hosted, which corresponds to the 'System' partition inside AROS):

 &gt; mv helloworld AROS/

Inside AROS, find and run your executable via Wanderer, in our case: double-click 'System' icon on Wanderer desktop, double-click 'helloworld' icon (you might have to hold right mouse button and select 'Window -&gt; View -&gt; All Files' to see it). A window will be opened displaying the program's output.

Or, to run it from AROS' shell, assuming you're still in the same directory where you compiled it, just type it's name:

 System:&gt; helloworld

Measurement Theory in Physical Mathematics Monograph 

by

Leo Himmelsohn

Second Edition (2001)

The “Collegium” International Academy of Sciences Publishers

First Edition (2001)

0. Abstract

The purpose of this monograph is to give many new very effective ideas and tools to the specialist in measurement technology in order to help him solve his urgent problems. Details, grounds, and developments are available in the monographs and articles by the author at his Web site.

Traditional mathematics with hardened systems of axioms, intended search for contradictions and even their creation suggests no suitable basic concepts and solving methods for many typical problems in measurement technology. This generally holds when solving valuation, estimation, discrimination, control, and optimization problems as well as in particular by measuring very inhomogeneous objects and rapidly changeable processes. There are gaps between the real numbers, and the probabilities of many reasonable possible events vanish or do not exist at all. In each concrete (mixed) physical magnitude, there is no known operation. Sets are no models for many collections without structure. Each measure has a very restricted domain of sensitivity. The absolute error alone is not sufficient for quality estimation. The relative error is uncertain in principle and has a very restricted domain of applicability. The unique known method applicable to overdetermined problems typical in measurement technology is the least-square method that has narrow applicability and adequacy domains as well as many fundamental defects. For estimating the quality of distribution approximations, there is no applicable proposition. This results in the unreliability of measurement data processing, loss of time and costs, dangers, accidents, and catastrophes.

Object-, task- and problem-oriented mathematics by the author within his physical mathematics by the principles of new scientific thought brings many natural, universal, and effective basic concepts and solving methods, in particular, for many typical problems in measurement technology. The hypernumbers fill the gaps of the real numbers, perfectly precisely discriminate noncoinciding infinitely great or small objects, and each possible event has a positive probability. An introduced quantifying operation holds in every concrete (mixed) physical magnitude. The hypersets with any quantity of each element perfectly express arbitrary collections without structure. The hyperquantities build a universal hypermeasure independent of dimensions. Hypererrors and reserves bring reliable estimations of approximation quality and of the confidence in the exactness of any precise possibly distributed object. An iteration method of the least normed powers, hypererror and reserve equalizing iteration methods, and a direct-solution method give both quasisolutions to contradictory problems and for the first time their contradictoriness measures. Demodulation methods provide recovering true distributions (in space and time) of very inhomogeneous objects and rapidly changeable processes by using discrete inexact measurement data.

The proposed basic concepts and solving methods are universal and very effective perhaps by solving any problem in measurement technology and especially urgent in the case of responsible objects under dynamically changeable extreme conditions. For example, in elasticity theory, it becomes possible to estimate experimental stress and strain distributions in many spatial solids possibly with stress concentration. Mechanical and optical properties of many objects in high-pressure engineering were complexly optimized. Proposing general strength theory and general implantation theory in solid physics allowed to discover many new phenomena and laws of nature in these areas as well as to create inventions having, in particular, measurement technology orientation.

1. Basic Principles

1.1. Principles of Object-, Task-, and Problem-Oriented Thought

Exclusively practical purpose arrangement.

Unrestricted freedom in foundations research and development.

Inheritance (effective using all the known concepts, methods, and results).

Purposeful creation (of all the necessary and useful objects but no hindering ones such as counterexamples leading to artificial contradictions typical in traditional mathematics).

Exact discrimination (by holding universal conservation laws) of noncoinciding possibly infinitely great or small objects. 

Tolerable simplicity (choosing the best in the not evidently unacceptable simplest).

Unrestricted flexibility (even creating an individual mathematics for an urgent problem).

Reasonable fuzziness (intuitive ideas without axiomatic strictness).

Symbolic existence (of all the necessary and useful even contradictory objects).

Bounded consecutive generalizations (of concepts in definitions).

Unity and relativity of opposites (real/ideal, specific/abstract, exact/inexact, definitively/possibly, pure/applied, theory/experiment/practice, nature/life/science).

Sufficient partial laws (if there are no known general laws).

Scientific optimism (each urgent problem can be solved effectively and adequately enough).


1.2. Principles of Object-, Task-, and Problem-Oriented Mathematics

Universal expressibility (of each urgent object).

Intuitivism (instead of axiomatic approaches).

Nonstrict essence (without strictness in presentations).

Decision delays (by estimating sense and existence).

Symbolic sense (of each urgent contradictory object).

Unrestricted operability (each operation on an arbitrary set of operands).

Quasiequivalent reduction (by an equivalent parameter).

Natural generalizations (not formal but essential and useful).

Structural considering (systems as objects with structures).

Quasicritical phenomena (in the structures of systems).

Practical tendencies (of infinite processes).

Simplest corrections (if they are reasonable in a certain hypersense).

Subtle estimation (to discriminate noncoinciding objects).

Reasonable control (by possibly inexact knowledge).

Quasisolving and supersolving (a problem by determining its quasisolution as the best possibly inexact pseudosolution, its supersolution as the best exact solution, and its contradictoriness measure).

Reserve determination (estimating the exactness of each exact object or model by its confidence and reliability).

Unified presentation (of bounded concepts).







2. Numbers, Operations, Sets, and Measures




2.1. Real Numbers and Hypernumbers



Traditional mathematics believes there are no gaps between the real numbers whose set is denoted by R. The probabilities of many typical reasonable events do not exist, for example, the same probability pn = p of the choice of a certain natural number n (e.g., 7) in the set N = {0, 1, 2, ...}. This might be proved as follows. If that probability were positive, the infinite sum of those probabilities for all natural numbers would be +¥. If that probability were zero then the countable sum of those probabilities for all natural numbers would vanish because each partial sum would be zero and the limit of the sequence of these sums would vanish. But this infinite countable sum is the probability of the reliable event, that some natural number is chosen, and must be exactly 1. Further the probabilities of many typical possible events vanish (e.g., that of the choice of a certain point on a segment of a straight line or curve), as if those were impossible events. +¥ is a lot of many different infinities hardly distinguishable. In ancient times, it was counted as follows: 1, 2, many; the concept „many“ played the role of a lot. Any measure of each segment or interval on a straight line or a curve is independent of whether or not that includes its endpoints. Bolzano [1] has stated his dissatisfaction with such circumstances and tried to do something in the particular case of a natural-number length. Cantor [2] has introduced cardinal numbers to roughly discriminate very different infinities only. For example, the cardinal numbers of the segment [0, 1] and of the complete three-dimensional space are both equal to the same continuum cardinality c. The cause is that, in contrast to the real numbers, each infinite cardinal number absorbs all the less and even equal cardinal numbers. Infinitely small infinitesimal numbers have been already introduced by Leibniz [3] and justified (together with hypernumbers) by Conway [4], Klaua [5], Robinson [6], and Sikorski [7] (see also [8, 9]). But these do not allow to conveniently express each required amount, e.g., that probability of the choice of a certain natural number. Belonging and existence answers („This is an infinitesimal number“; „There is such an infinitesimal number“) bring no satisfaction because all the necessary operations should be also applicable to the hypernumbers. If there were no equality such as i2 = –1, the situation with the imaginary numbers would be similar. It would be impossible to both determine specific solutions to many very important equations also in measurement technology and operate on such numbers. Instead of this, one could say: „That is an imaginary number“, „There is such an imaginary number“. The conclusion is obvious. Also in measurement technology, it is an urgent problem, in a suitable extension of the real numbers, to exactly express all the infinitesimal, finite, infinite, and combined pure (dimensionless) amounts and conveniently operate on them.

In object-oriented mathematics, namely in hyperanalysis [10], this problem is solved as follows. First, the real numbers with all operations, relations, and their properties are taken. All infinite cardinal numbers are then included in such a way that in this extension called the hypernumbers, the same operations, relations, and their properties (also the conservation laws without absorption) hold. For an essentially unique interpretation of infinite cardinal numbers, each of them is expressed by means of the so-called hyperquantity Q of a certain standard set reasonably chosen, for example:

À = Q(…, – 2, –1, 0, 1, 2,...)/2 = Q(0, 1, 2,...) – ½ = Q(N) – ½,

c = Q[0, 1[ (incl. 0 and excl. 1) = Q]0, 1] (excl. 0 and incl. 1).

This allows to exactly discriminate all different hypernumbers incl. infinitesimals, finite numbers, and infinities because, for instance, no infinitely large hypernumber can absorb any infinitesimal, and the conservation laws unrestrictedly hold also at infinities. Further each pure (dimensionless) amount, also an infinitesimal or infinite one, is exactly expressed by a unique suitable hypernumber.

Only some representative examples follow:

Q(N+) = Q(1, 2,...) = Q(N) – Q{0} = (À + ½) – 1 = À – ½;

Q{z, z + 1, z + 2, ...} = Q{z + 1× n | n Î N} = À - z + ½ (z Î R);

that probability pn = p of the choice of a certain natural number n (e.g., 7) in the set N = {0, 1, 2, ...} is the unique solution 1/(À + ½) to the equation Q(N)p = 1;

Q[a, b[ = Q]a, b] = |b – a|c,

Q]a, b[= |b – a|c – 1,

Q[a, b] = |b – a|c + 1,

Q(R) = 2Àc;

the probability p of the choice of a certain point on a straight line is the unique solution 1/(2Àc) to the equation Q(R)p = 1;

for the segment [a, b], a plane, and the complete three-dimensional space, the similar probabilities are 1/(|b – a|c + 1), 1/(2Àc)2, and 1/(2Àc)3, respectively.

This realizes Bolzano’s dream [1] on discovering the mysteries and paradoxes of the infinity with effective operations at it like those on the usual numbers.







2.2. Concrete (Mixed) Magnitudes, Hyperelements, and Quantification



In each concrete (mixed) physical magnitude, e.g., 5 liter petrol, the unifying operation is not obvious. „Petrol multiplied by 5 liter“ or, all the more, „5 liter multiplied by petrol“ would be not reasonable. There is no known suitable operation.

For such a purpose, object-oriented mathematics proposes hyperelements, quantifying, and quantity definition [10].

Hyperelements are hyperunions of equal objects.

Hyperelement means an object of the form qa (read: deep q of a) for any two objects a (its basis, unique element) and q (the quantity of a in qa). 

Examples:

2.5 kgmeat, loafbread, -100 DM + $ 60money;

1a =° {a}° = {a}

where a little circle ° means that namely hyperobjects incl. hyperrelations are considered and is optional if those can be replaced with the corresponding usual ones;

na =° {a, a, ... , a}° ( n times, n Î N+ = {1, 2, 3, ...}).

Quantifying means the following hyperoperation with one parameter q:

Qq: a ® qa, Qq(a) = qa.

Quantity determination means the hyperoperation 

Q: qa ® q, Q(qa) = Q(a Î qa) = q

with

Q(b Î qa) = 0 (b ¹ a).

Nonempty hyperelemens qa, rb are called similar (qa @° rb) by a = b and hyperequal (qa =° rb) by a = b, q = r. The empty hyperelement # Î Æ, whose uncertain intermediate forms 0a and q# have to be reduced to its final certain canonic form 0#, coincides with the empty set Æ and is considered to be similar to each hyperelement and hyperequal to itself only. 







2.3. Sets and Hypersets



Cantor sets [2] may contain any object as an element either once or not at all; its repetitions are ignored also by Cantor set relations and operations [11 – 15]. Those set operations are only restrictedly invertible. The simplest equations 

X È A = B

and 

X Ç A = B

in X are solvable only by A Í B and A Ê B, respectively (uniquely by A = Æ and A = B = U = a universal set [2], respectively). The equations 

X È A = B

and

X = B \ A

are equivalent only by A = Æ. In a fuzzy set [16, 17], the membership function of each element may also lie strictly between these ultimate values 1 and 0 in the case of uncertainty only. Element repetitions are taken into account in multisets [18] with any cardinal numbers as multiplicities and in ordered sets (tuples, sequences, vectors, permutations, arrangements, etc.) [11 – 13]. Unordered combinations with repetitions are considered in [13] to be no sets but equivalence classes of equipartite arrangements with repetitions. In many unordered collections (for example, of bonds and coins), namely the quantity (multiplicity, number, amount) of each element is decisive and can be arbitrary, for example, 3.5 kg, 1 loaf (bread), – 45 DM by buying and those with opposite signs by selling.

For such a purpose, object-oriented mathematics proposes hypersets [10, 19, 20] as possibly the most general collections (divisible objects) without structure.

Hyperset means a hyperelement or a collection and, equally, a hypersum of hyperelements: 

A =° {... , qa, ... , rb, ...}° =° ... +° qa +° ... +° rb +° ... .

Excepting irreducible hypersets of the form 

A° =° {... , qa, ... , rb, ...}°°,

a hyperset must be reduced through hyperadding all similar hyperelements. 

In a hyperset, the quantity of any element means its quantity in the unique similar hyperelement of the hyperset after its reducing: 

Q(a Î A) = q.

If in a hyperset there is no hyperelement similar to an element, its quantity in the hyperset vanishes: 

Q(c Î A) = 0.

The (reduction-independent) hyperquantity of a hyperset means the hypersum of the quantities of all elements of the hyperset as the result of its quantity determination:

Q(A) = ... +° q +° ... +° r +° ... .

Quantifying a hyperset is multiplying its element quantities: 

sA =° s{... , qa, ... , rb, ...}° =° {... , sqa, ... , srb, ...}°,

Q(sA) = sQ(A).

The graph of a reduced hyperset A means the pair and possibly point hyperset

G(A) = {... , (a, q), ... , (b, r), ...}.

Examples: 

{0a, q#}° =° 0# (=° Æ);

{qa, -ra, s#}° =° q - ra;

{20 , p# , -10, e1}° =° {(1)0, e1}°;

Q(1/20, 1, 2,...) = Q(N) – Q{1/20} = (À + ½) – ½  = À;

|a, b| = 1/2a +° ]a, b[ +° 1/2b.

A unit quantity is optional: 

a = 1a =° {1a}° =° {a}° = {a}.

The hypersets naturally generalize the Cantor sets [2] whose particular case corresponds to either zero or unit element quantities only. The linear notation of a hyperset without structure is used as the most convenient one. The Euler–Wenn diagrams [11] are also applicable to hypersets. Even by ... , q, ... , r, ... Î [0, 1], the fuzzy sets [16, 17] are generalized by the hypersets that can and may also be entirely certain even by such limited element quantities. The hyperset 

{¼apple, ½pear}°

can consist of exactly a quarter of an apple and a half of a pear. 

In hypersets and hyperelements, negative, rational, irrational, imaginary, and concrete (mixed) quantities naturally appear by subtraction (e.g., as losses, debts, deliveries, sales, expenses), division (shares), taking roots, and measuring.

Examples: 

10 DM money - 15 DM money =° -5 DM money

(e.g., an account to be settled in the case of a zero personal account; therefore, the empty set Æ is not the (nonexistent) „emptiest“ hyperset but the neutral one only like zero that is the neutral number but not the (nonexistent) smallest one); 

(34)1/2 =° Ö32;

(-11)1/2 =° ±i(±1)

where i is an imaginary unit; 

a housewife purchase result might be 

{loafbread, 1.5 kgmeat, case + 2water-melons, 0.1 literlinseed-oil, 2 packetsdetergent, 3 boxesmatches, -58.74 DM - $ 5money, -2 htime, -2.5 literpetrol}°.

If necessary, different units in a quantity can be (exactly, approximately, conditionally, time-dependently, etc.) transformed into a common unit with corresponding factors (here, e.g., through 

1 case Û 8, 

$ 1 Û 2.15 DM, more exactly ca. 2.2 DM Þ $ 1 Þ 2.1 DM).

Hypersets are called hyperequal if they in the reduced forms contain the same hyperelements.

An algebraic hypersum as a result of algebraic hyperadding certain hypersets means a hyperset that is the corresponding algebraic hypersum of all the hyperelements of the hypersets-operands:

...+° {... , qa, ...}° -° ... -° {... , rb, ...}° +° ... =° {... , qa, ... , - rb, ...}°.

Example: 

{31, 0, p2}° -° {q3, e1, -i0}° +° {ei, -p2, i1}° =° {1+ i 0, 3 - e + i1, - q3, ei}°.

A hyperproduct as a result of hypermultiplying certain hypersets means a hyperset that is the hypersum of all the hyperproducts of exactly one hyperelement of each of the hypersets-operands. 

Example: 

{21, -12}° ´° {-32, 64}° =° {21 ´° -32, -12 ´° -32, 21 ´° 64, -12 ´° 64}° =° {-62, 34, 124, -68}° =° {-62, 154, -68}°.

A hyperquotient as the result of hyperdividing a hyperset by a hyperelement means a hyperset that is the hypersum of all the hyperquotients by dividing each hyperelement of the hyperset-dividend by the hyperelement-divisor.

Example: 

{-4-2, 69}° /° -8-6 =° {1/2(1/3), -3/4(-3/2)}°.

In object-oriented mathematics [10, 19, 20], it is possible to practically unrestrictedly operate on hypersets like numbers.







2.4. Measures and Hyperquantities



Each known measure [11 – 13] is sensitive only within a certain dimension. For example, the area measure gives 0 for a segment of any length, nontrivial results for areas only, and +¥ for a spatial body of any sizes. Also by matching the dimensions of an object to be measured and of a measure, the last is not sensitive to those changes of the object that have a lower dimension in comparison with the object. As mentioned, the linear measure gives the same result for a segment and an interval with pairwise coinciding endpoints independently of whether or not these belong to the set to be measured. And in the case of the mixed (combined) dimensions of a set to be measured, which, for instance, consists of some points, lines, areas, and spatial bodies, no known measure can take all this into account.

In object-oriented mathematics, the hyperquantities [10] build a universal hypermeasure.

Example:

Q((0, 0, 0) È° {0} ´ |–1/2, 1/2] ´ {0} È° [3, +¥[2 ´ {4} È° ]–¥, –1|3) =

1 + (c + 1/2) + ((À – 3)c + 1/2)2 + (– 1 + À)3c3 =

7/4 + (À – 2)c + (À – 3)2c2 + (À – 1)3c3.







3. Errors and Reserves



3.1. Errors and Hypererrors


For estimating measurement data, the absolute error and the relative one [11 – 13] are usually determined. 

The absolute error alone offers no sufficient quality estimation giving, for example, the same result 1 for the acceptable formal (correct or not) equality 1000 =? 999 and for the inadmissible one 1 =? 0. Further the absolute error is not invariant by equivalent transformations of a problem because, for instance, when multiplying a formal equality by a nonzero number, the absolute error is multiplied by the absolute value of that number. 

The relative error should play a supplement role. But even in the case of the simplest formal equality a =? b with two numbers, there are at once two propositions, to use |a – b|/|a| or |a – b|/|b| as an estimating fraction. It is a generally inadmissible uncertainty that could be acceptable only if the ratio a/b is close to 1. Further the relative error is so intended that it should always belong to the segment [0, 1]. But for 1 =? 0 by choosing 0 as the denominator, the result is +¥, for 1 =? –1 by each denominator choice 2. Hence, the relative error has a restricted range of applicability amounting to the equalities of two elements whose ratio is close to 1. By more complicated equalities with at least three elements, e.g., by 100 – 99 =? 0 or 1 – 2 + 3 – 4 =? –1, the choice of a denominator seems to be vague at all. This is why the relative error is practically used only in the simplest case and very seldom for variables and functions.

Object-oriented mathematics proposes a hypererror [19, 21] irreproachably correcting the relative error and generalizing it possibly for any conceivable range of applicability.

For the same simplest formal equality a =? b of two numbers, a hypererror can be represented by the estimating fraction 

da =? b = |a – b|/(|a| + |b|) (3.1.1)

in the case |a| + |b| &gt; 0, which should simply vanish by a = b = 0.

We can get a shorter and more explicit notation by introducing extended division 

a//b = a/b by a ¹ 0;

a//b = 0 by a = 0 

independently of the existence and value of b.

The estimating fraction (3.1.1) is then represented without words:

da =? b = |a – b|//(|a| + |b|). (3.1.2)

To generalize (3.1.2), it is possible to add a positive hypernumber p suitable in a specific problem to the denominator and/or to replace the origin 0 with a hypernumber h:

da =? b (p, h) = |a – b|//(|a – h| + |b – h| + p). (3.1.3)

Another possibility is using the quadratic estimating fraction 

2da =? b = |a – b|//[2(a2 + b2)]1/2 (3.1.4)

instead of the previous linear one (3.1.2). 

The outputs (return values) of such hypererrors always belong to the segment [0, 1], which should hold for the relative error. 

Examples:

d0 =? 0 = 0;

d1 =? 0 = 1;

d100 =? 99 = 1/199;

2d0 =? 0 = 0;

2d1 =? 0 = 1/21/2;

2d1 =? –1 = 1.

We shall use the linear estimating fraction (3.1.2) alone if it suffices.

For a formal vector equality 

åwÎWzw =? 0,

a hypererror can be represented by the estimating fraction (3.1.2)

d(åwÎWzw =? 0) = ||åwÎWzw||//åwÎW||zw||

whose denominator contains all elements that have been initially in the equality, i.e., before any transformations. If all the vectors are replaced with numbers, the norms can be replaced with the moduli (absolute values).

The quadratic estimating fraction (3.1.4) is

2d(åwÎWzw =? 0) = ||åwÎWzw||//(Q(W)åwÎW||zw||2)1/2.

Examples:

d100 – 99 =? 0 = 1/199 = d100 =? 99;

d1 – 2 + 3 – 4 =? –1= |1 – 2 + 3 – 4 + 1|/(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1) = 1/11.

For a formal functional equality

g[wÎWzw] =? 0

with a domain of definition Z and a range of values in a normed vector space, a natural generalization idea is to define a hypererror (3.1.2) by the estimating fraction 

dg =? 0 = medZ||g[wÎWzw]||//supZ||g[wÎWzw]||.

Its numerator is a mean value of the norm of the function in its domain of definition Z. The denominator is the least upper bound on the norm of this function in the same domain of definition. If the range of values of the function contains numbers only, the norms can be replaced with the moduli (absolute values). 

For a formal equality

g[wÎWzw] =? h[wÎWzw]

of two functions with a common domain of definition Z and with ranges of values in a common normed vector space, the following holds. A further natural generalization idea is to define a hypererror (3.1.2) by the estimating fraction

dg =? h = supZ||g[wÎWzw] – h[wÎWzw]||//supZ(||g[wÎWzw]|| + ||h[wÎWzw]||). 

Its numerator is the least upper bound on the norm of the difference of these functions in their domain of definition Z. The denominator is the least upper bound on the sum of the norms of these functions in the same domain of definition. If the ranges of values of the functions consist of numbers only, the norms can be replaced with the moduli (absolute values). 

If a formal functional equality in its initial form contains more than two functions, the numerator of the estimating fraction is the least upper bound on the norm of the difference of the sides of the equality. The denominator is then the least upper bound on the sum of the norms of all the functions available in the initial form. For example, in the case of a formal equality

g[wÎWzw] – h[wÎWzw] =? k[wÎWzw],

the estimating fraction (3.1.2) is

dg – h =? k = supZ||g[wÎWzw] – h[wÎWzw] – k[wÎWzw]||//supZ(||g[wÎWzw]|| + ||h[wÎWzw]|| + ||k[wÎWzw]||).

Let us consider a hyperset of equations over indexed functions (dependent variables) fj of indexed independent variables zw, all of them belonging to their possibly individual vector spaces. We may gather all the available functions in the left-hand sides of the equalities without further transformations. The unique natural exception is changing the signs of the functions by moving them to the other sides of the same equalities. The hyperset can be brought to the form 

w(l)(Ll[jÎF fj[wÎW zw]] = 0) (lÎL) (3.1.5)

where

Ll – an operator with index l from an index set L;

fj – a function (dependent variable) with index j from an index set F;

zw – an independent variable with index w from an index set W;

[wÎW zw] – a set of indexed elements;

w(l) – the quantity as a weight of the equation with index l.

When replacing all the unknowns (unknown functions) with their possible “values” (some known functions), the hyperset is transformed into the corresponding hyperset of formal functional equalities. To conserve the hyperset form, let us use for these known functions the same designations fj. For the equality with index l 

w(l)(Ll[jÎF fj[wÎW zw]] =? 0) (lÎL), (3.1.6)

an estimating fraction may be

dl(m(l)) = {lim [V(zl’)]-1ò(||Ll[jÎF fj[wÎW zw]]||l//sup||Ll[jÎF fj’[wÎW zw]]||l)m(l) dV(zl’)}1/m(l) (zl’ ® zl) (3.1.7)

where 

m(l) – a positive number, we shall take 1;

in the denominator, a direct (not composite) function of independent variables is used and by determining the least upper bound, all different isometric transformations (conserving the norms) 

|| fj’ [wÎW zw]||j = || fj [wÎW zw]||j

of even equal elements are considered.

For the complete hyperset of the equalities, an estimating fraction can be chosen in the forms

d(m) = ålÎL w(l)dl(m) // ålÎL w(l) (3.1.8)

(the arithmetic mean value) by the linear law,

2d(m) = {ålÎL w(l)[dl(m)]2 // ålÎL w(l)}1/2 (3.1.9)

(the quadratic mean value) by the quadratic law, and

nd(m) = {ålÎL w(l)[dl(m)]n // ålÎL w(l)}1/n (3.1.10)

by the law of the nth power (n &gt; 0).







3.2. Reserves



The absolute error, the relative error, and the hypererror of any exact object or model always vanish. But not only in measurement technology, it is often reasonable to additionally discriminate exact objects or models by the confidence in their exactness reliability. For example, both

x1 = 1 + 10-10

and

x2 = 1 + 1010

are exact solutions to the inequation x &gt; 1, x1 practically unreliable and x2 guaranteed. Their discrimination is especially important by approximate data, which is always the case in measurement technology. Traditional mathematics cannot provide this. 

Object-oriented mathematics proposes for this purpose the basic concept of the reserve [19, 21], which is quite new in mathematics and extends the hypererror in the following sense. The values of a hypererror H belong to the segment [0, 1], those of a reserve R to [–1, 1]. For each inexact object I, H(I) &gt; 0 and we can take R(I) = –H(I). For each exact object E, H(E) = 0 and R(E) ³ 0. A proposition to determine the reserve of an inexact object as its hypererror with the opposite sign is at once evident. For an exact object, it seems to be reasonable, to first define a suitable mapping of the object with respect to its exactness boundary and to further take the hypererror of the mapped object. It is exact only if the object itself precisely lies on its exactness boundary where the reserve vanishes. Otherwise, the mapped object is inexact and the object itself has a positive reserve.

For inequalities, such a mapping can be replaced with negating inequality relations and conserving equality ones. In our example, we have (see (3.1.2))

Rx &gt; 1(x1) = Rx &gt; 1(1 + 10 -10) = Hx &lt;? 1(1 + 10 -10) = 10-10/(2 + 10 -10)

and

Rx &gt; 1(x2) = Rx &gt; 1(1 + 1010) = Hx &lt;? 1(1 + 1010) = 1010/(2 + 1010).

Further we need some useful agreements. Let a problem be a hypersystem of relations containing both known elements and unknown ones, which can be regarded as values and variables, respectively. 

A pseudosolution to such a problem is an arbitrary hypersystem of such values of all the corresponding variables that, after replacing each variable with its value, the problem becomes a hypersystem of relations containing known elements only, and each of its relations becomes determinable (e.g., true or false). 

If each of the last relations is true, such a pseudosolution is also called a solution to the problem. 

If a pseudosolution to such a problem has the least hypererror or the greatest reserve, respectively, by a specific realization of a certain method among all pseudosolutions to the problem, then this pseudosolution is called the quasisolution to the problem by this realization of that method. A quasisolution is not necessarily a solution, which is especially important in contradictory problems that have no solutions in principle but can possess quasisolutions. 

If a solution to such a problem has the greatest reserve (note that all solution hypererrors are zero) by a specific realization of a certain method among all the solutions to the problem, this solution is called the supersolution to the problem by this realization of that method. The supersolution to such a problem not necessarily coincides with its quasisolution because the set of the solutions is a subset of the set of the pseudosolutions. If the both exist then the quasisolution, which is not necessarily a solution, has a not less reserve in comparison with the supersolution. If in the last comparison, namely the strict inequality holds, then the quasisolution is certainly no solution. 

If a pseudosolution to such a problem has the greatest hypererror or the least reserve, respectively, by a specific realization of a certain method among all the pseudosolutions to the problem then this pseudosolution is called the antisolution to the problem by this realization of that method. 

Quasisolutions and supersolutions, as well as antisolutions, not necessarily exist because a set of hypererrors or reserves not necessarily contains its greatest lower bound and its least upper one, respectively.

Let us determine the supersolution to the compound inequation 

1 &lt; x &lt; 2

as the set of two simple inequations. The simplest way is to solve the equation

Rx &gt; 1(x) = Rx &lt; 2(x)

on the interval defined by the compound inequation itself. We receive (see (3.1.2)):

dx &lt; 1 = dx &gt; 2,

|x – 1|/(|x| + |1|) = |x – 2|/(|x| + |2|),

(x – 1)/(x + 1) = – (x – 2)/(x + 2),

x = 21/2.

Let us further determine the supersolution to the generalized compound inequation

a &lt; x &lt; b (3.2.1)

in the case a &lt; b also by solving the equation

Rx &gt; a(x) = Rx &lt; b(x)

on the interval defined by the compound inequation (3.2.1). We receive (see (3.1.2)):

dx &lt; a = dx &gt; b,

|x – a|//(|x| + |a|) = |x – b|//(|x| + |b|),

by a &gt; 0 (x – a)/(x + a) = – (x – b)/(x + b), x = (ab)1/2,

by b &lt; 0 (x – a)/(– x – a) = – (x – b)/(– x – b), x = – (ab)1/2,

by a &lt; 0 &lt; b x = 0,

by ab = 0 no supersolution.

For a ³ b, the same is the quasisolution only.

Similarly, in the overdetermined set of equations

x = a,

x = b, (3.2.2)

where variable x is an unknown real number, a and b known real numbers, for the quasisolution holds the following: 

if a and b have the same sign, it is their geometric mean value with the same sign;

it vanishes if a and b have distinct signs;

it does not exist if ab = 0.

If in the case (3.2.1) we are dissatisfied by a &lt; 0 &lt; b and ab = 0, it is also possible to use the estimating fraction (3.1.3) where normally one parameter only (either p &gt; 0 or h) suffices. Let us first use p:

|x – a|/(|x| + |a| + p) = |x – b|/(|x| + |b| + p),

by a ³ 0 (x – a)/(x + a + p) = – (x – b)/(x + b + p), x = – p/2 + [(p/2 + a)(p/2 + b)]1/2,

by b £ 0 (x – a)/(– x – a + p) = – (x – b)/(– x – b + p), x = p/2 – [(p/2 – a)( p/2 – b)]1/2.

By p = 1, for the compound inequation 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, we receive the supersolution 

x = (31/2 – 1)/2 » 0.36603

and for –1 &lt; x &lt; 0

x = – (31/2 – 1)/2 » – 0.36603.

Let us now use the parameter h and introduce

X = x – h,

A = a – h,

B = b – h.

We have

|X – A|//(|X| + |A|) = |X – B|//(|X| + |B|)

and, for example, by h &lt; a 

(X – A)/(X + A) = – (X – B)/(X + B),

X = (AB)1/2,

x = [(a – h)( b – h)]1/2 + h.

Let us take h = –1 for the compound inequation 0 &lt; x &lt; 1. We then receive the supersolution 

x = 21/2 – 1 » 0.41421.

By h ® –¥ in the general case of the compound inequation

a &lt; x &lt; b,

we receive the supersolution 

x = (a + b)/2

by a &lt; b, which is the quasisolution only by a ³ b, corresponding to the use of the absolute errors or the least-square method.







4. Methods



4.1. Least-Square Method and Its Defects



The least-square method by Legendre [22] and Gauß [23] is practically the unique known one applicable to contradictory problems, e.g., overdetermined sets of equations, no of which can be derived from the other ones and the amount of which is greater than that of the unknowns (independent variables or dependent ones called functions). Experimental data are inexact, and their amount is always taken greater than that of the parameters in an approximating function often geometrically interpretable by a straight line or curve, plane or surface. That is why this method was possibly the most important one for measurement technology and seemed to be irreplaceable.

For the hyperset of equations above (see (3.1.5) – (3.1.7), (3.1.9)), the method minimizes the sum 

ålÎL w(l) lim {[V(zl’)]-1ò||Ll[jÎF fj[wÎW zw]]||l2 dV(zl’)} (zl’ ® zl). (4.1.1)

A deep analysis of the least-square method by the principles of object-oriented thought and object-oriented mathematics has discovered many fundamental defects in both the essence (as causes) and applicability (as effects) of this method that is adequate only in some rare special cases and at least needs attention.

The most important defects in the essence of the least-square method itself are the following:

1. The method is based on the absolute error alone not invariant by equivalent transformations of a problem.

2. The method ignores the possibly noncoinciding physical dimensions (units) of relations in a problem.

3. The method does not correlate the deviations of the approximation desired from the objects approximated with these objects themselves.

4. The method simply mixes those deviations without their adequate weighing.

5. The method considers equal changes of the squares of those deviations with relatively less and greater moduli (absolute values) as equivalent ones.

6. The method foresees no iterating.

7. The method is based on a fixed algorithm accepting no a priori flexibility.

8. The method provides no own a posteriori adapting.

9. The method uses no invariant estimation of approximation.

10. The method considers no different approximations.

11. The method foresees no comparing different approximations.

12. The method considers no choosing the best approximation among different ones.

These defects in the essence of the least-square method result in many fundamental shortcomings in its applicability. The most important of them are the following:




1. Loss of applicability sense.

The method loses any sense and is not applicable at all to problems simulated by a set of equations with different physical dimensions (units), e.g., to a mechanics problem with one equation by the impulse conservation law and another equation by the energy conservation law.




2. No objective sense of the result.

3. No result invariance by equivalent transformations of a problem.

The result returned by the method has no objective sense because the result depends on choosing or introducing accidental parameters inessential for a problem. Let us unify two determined subsets of linear equations with the same unknown variables and different unique solutions in one overdetermined set of equations and use the method. If all the factors by the unknown variables in the equations are of the same order, the result lies more or less properly between the solutions of the subsets. But let us first multiply each equation of the first subset by a number greater than 1 by an order (e.g., 10) and use the method. The result then becomes very close to the solution of the first subset with relatively greater factors. Let us secondly take once more the initial set of equations before that multiplication, multiply each equation of the second subset by a number greater than 1 by an order (e.g., 10), and use the method. The result then becomes very close to the solution of the second subset with relatively greater factors. 

For example, let us consider the set of two equations 

x = 1,

x = 2. (4.1.2)

The method returns

x = 3/2

that is the arithmetical mean value of 1 and 2. Let us first multiply the first equation by 10. For the set 

10x = 10,

x = 2,

the method returns

x = 102/101

that is very close to the solution of the first equation. 

Let us secondly take once more the initial set (4.1.2) of equations and multiply only the second equation by 10. For the set

x = 1,

10x = 20,

the method returns

x = 201/101

that is very close to the solution of the second equation. 

Those are equivalent transformations of a set of equations, and by each adequate method, the result may not change.




4. Restriction of the class of acceptable equivalent transformations of a problem.

For contradictory sets of linear equations, the following holds. Only so-called simple multiplications of all the equations by a common nonzero number, whose sign can be individually chosen for each equation because namely the squares of these additional factors have to coincide, do not change the result and are acceptable by using the method. But all the other so-called complicated multiplications of those equations by nonzero numbers without a common modulus (absolute value) are also equivalent transformations of such a set, which are unacceptable by using the method.




5. No essentially unique correction of the loss of applicability sense.

If the equations of a set have different physical dimensions (units), there are different proper possibilities, to bring all the equations to a common physical dimension (unit), and the result essentially depends on such a choice. In that mechanics problem with one equation by the impulse conservation law and another one by the energy conservation law, it is equally proper, to multiply the first equation by either a whole velocity or half of it, nothing to say about choosing one of several velocities.




6. Possibly ignoring some part of a problem.

In an overdetermined set of equations, this takes place for ones whose factors by the unknowns are relatively small in comparison with those in the other equations of the set. Such ignoring holds by the squared factor law and is often strong enough.




7. Paradoxical approximation.

For less values, the method brings greater (even absolute) errors and, in turn, for greater values, less (even absolute) errors. By relative errors and hypererrors, such a paradoxicality is still much stronger. 

For example, let us consider the problem on the best approximation to the two points 

x1 = 1, y1 = 1,

x2 = 10, y2 = 15

of the Cartesian plane x0y by a straight line 

y = kx

where namely the best value of a real-number parameter k is required. For this purpose, the method minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviations in the direction 0y, namely 

(1k – 1)2 + (10k – 15)2,

which brings

k = 151/101.

For the first point with relatively less coordinates, the absolute error, relative ones, and hypererror are 

D1 = |k – 1| = 51/101,

d1’ = |k – 1|/|k| = 51/151, 

d1’’ = |k – 1|/|1| = 51/101,

H1 = |k – 1|/(|k| + |1|) = 50/252 = 25/126,

respectively, and for the second point with relatively greater coordinates, 

D2 = |10k – 15| = 5/101,

d2’ = |10k – 15|/|10k| = 5/1510 = 1/302, 

d2’’ = |10k – 15|/|15| = 5/1515 = 1/303,

H2 = |10k – 15|/(|10k| + |15|) = 5/3025 = 1/605.




8. No analyzing the deviations of the result.

The deviations of the result obtained from the objects approximated are not analyzed by the method at all.




9. No adequate estimating and evaluating the quality of the result.

No tools to adequately estimate and evaluate the quality of the result obtained are used by the method at all.




10. The highest truth ungrounded.

Each result is presented by the method as the highest truth without justification.




11. No refining the results.

The results obtained cannot be refined by the method itself.




12. No choice.

Even if the result returned by the method by solving a specific problem is obviously unsatisfactory, the method provides no other possibility and practically requires accepting such a result without criticism.







4.2. Iteration Method of the Least Normed Powers



Basic ideas of the method are the following:

1. Instead of absolute errors, hypererrors are minimized.

2. Results are corrected by iterating.

3. Both the power and the hypererror parameters may be freely chosen.

The method minimizes [24, 25] the mean value (see (3.1.6), (3.1.7), (3.1.10), (4.1.1))

d(f(k), f(k+1), m) = {[ålÎL w(l)]-1ålÎL w(l) (lim [V(zl’)]-1ò(||Ll[jÎF fj(k+1)[wÎW zw]]||l//sup||Ll[jÎF fj’[wÎW zw]]||l)m dV(zl’)}1/m (zl’ ® zl) (4.2.1)

of the hypererror of a pseudosolution to the hyperset of equations (3.1.5)

where 

m – a positive number that is 2 in the method of the least normed squares;

f(k+1), f(k) – the (k+1)st and kth approximations to the quasisolution to the hyperset of equations (3.1.5); 

in the denominator, a direct (not composite) function of independent variables stands, and by determining the least upper bound, all different isometric transformations (conserving norms) even of equal elements

|| fj’ [wÎW zw]||j = || fj(k) [wÎW zw]||j

are used.

This ensures that each next approximation to the quasisolution to the hyperset of equations can be expressed over the prior approximation already known, which provides iterating. Another possibility (especially if the set L is infinite) is minimizing the hypererror 

d(f(k), f(k+1)) = suplÎLlim [V(zl’)]-1ò(||Ll[jÎF fj(k+1)[wÎW zw]]||l//sup||Ll[jÎF fj’[wÎW zw]]||l)dV(zl’) (zl’ ® zl) (4.2.2)

where sup M – the least upper hyperbound on an ordered hyperset M. This hyperbound is the hyperset of the least upper bounds on the subsets of M reduced from above. The least upper hyperbounds on two hypersets are ordered by ordering the usual least upper bounds on their hypersubsets minimally equally reduced from above to discriminate them.

Example:

One pseudosolution to a set of four equations brings for them the hypererrors 0, 1, 1, and 1, respectively; another one 1, 0, 0, and 0. Intuitively, the second pseudosolution is better than the first. But their Cantor sets of the hypererrors are both {0, 1} and hence provide no discriminating the pseudosolutions by their quality. The hypersets of the hypererrors are {31, 0}° and {1, 30}°, respectively. Again the usual least upper bounds are both 1. The minimal reducing the hypersets from above is subtracting the hyperset {1}° and brings the required discrimination: 

sup({31, 0}° –° {1}°) = sup{21, 0}° = 1 &gt; 

sup({1, 30}° –° {1}°) = sup{30}° = 0

and therefore

sup{31, 0} &gt; sup{1, 30}°.

The known formulas in the least-square method can be used also here by m = 2 to determine all the currently unknown variables in the next approximation in the numerators after replacing all the variables in the prior approximation with their values already known in the denominators.

Replacing the hypererrors with the reserves that naturally have to be maximized brings a further method generalization also applicable to determining the supersolution to a set of relations.







4.3. Hypererror and Reserve Equalizing Iteration Methods



A hypererror equalizing iteration method is still more effective. At any point [wÎW zw], the hypererror (see also (3.1.7))

dl[wÎW zw] = ||Ll[jÎF fj[wÎW zw]]||l//sup||Ll[jÎF fj’[wÎW zw]]||l 

of each (lth) equation in the hyperset (3.1.5) for a pseudosolution 

[jÎF fj[wÎW zw]]

is determined.

Now the lth equation (3.1.5) can be equivalently transformed as follows:

(Ll[jÎF fj(k+1)[wÎW zw]]//sup||Ll[jÎF fj’[wÎW zw]]||l) ´

(||Ll[jÎF fj(k)[wÎW zw]]||l//Ll[jÎF fj(k)[wÎW zw]]) = 0 (lÎL) (4.3.1)

where the second fraction drops out if its denominator vanishes.

The mathematical sense of this transformation (4.3.1) is following. If the kth approximation were substituted for the (k+1)st one, the left-hand side of the equation (4.3.1) would be equal to the hypererror dl(k) of the kth approximation. 

Let us order the hyperset of the hypererrors dl(k). The left-hand sides of two equations with the greatest absolute value of the difference of their hypererrors dl(k) with corresponding indexes l are setting equal to each other. Such a procedure is repeated for the other equations, and so on. By every step of designing such an equalizing hyperset of equations, each initial equation is used at most once if possible. A new equation drops out if it can be derived from the already designed equations of the equalizing hyperset. Independently of ending each step, this designing is finished when the equalizing hyperset of equations has exactly one solution. If this hyperset contains all the possible independent new equations and nevertheless has more than one solution, the required amount of additional new equations that express equalizing the greatest hypererrors dl(k) to zero must be also designed.

This algorithm for designing the equalizing hyperset of equations provides the following:

1) each solution to an initial hyperset of equations is a solution to the corresponding equalizing hyperset of equations;

2) if an initial hyperset of equations is consistent, the passage from it to the equalizing hyperset of equations is an equivalent transformation;

3) if an initial hyperset of equations is inconsistent, the equalizing hyperset of equations is consistent;

4) if an initial hyperset of equations is overdetermined, the equalizing hyperset of equations is determined;

5) the complication of an equalizing hyperset of equations is the same as that of the corresponding initial hyperset of equations. In particular, if all the initial equations are linear algebraic, all the equalizing equations are also linear algebraic.

A solution to an equalizing hyperset of equations expresses the (k+1)st approximation to the quasisolution to the corresponding initial hyperset of equations through the kth approximation. If for their hypererrors, the inequality

d(f(k), f(k+1)) £ d(f(k–1), f(k))

holds then the equalizing hyperset of equations for the (k+2)nd approximation is not redesigned but only modified where k+1 is substituted for k. If this inequality is not valid, it is necessary to return to the kth approximation and redesign the equalizing hyperset of equations.

The sequence d(f(k), f(k+1)) is nonnegative, monotonically nonincreasing in k and therefore has a limit

d = lim d(f(k), f(k+1)) ³ 0 (k ® ¥)

as a measure of contradictions in the initial hyperset of equations. This measure remains invariant if the initial equations are equivalently transformed by complicated multiplication. Earlier it was only stated that some specific set of equations is contradictory without estimating and, all the more, exactly measuring this contradictoriness, which is proposed by the author perhaps for the first time.

A criterion for finishing the iterations can be a stabilization (within an acceptable inaccuracy chosen) of the equalizing hyperset of equations, of its quasisolution approximation as well as of the hypererrors of both the separate initial equations and the complete initial hyperset of equations.

Replacing the hypererrors to be minimized with the corresponding reserves to be maximized leads to a reserve equalizing iteration method generalizing the described hypererror equalizing iteration method and additionally allowing supersolutions determination. 

These methods are very effective by solving problems simulated by overdetermined hypersets of equations, which is always the case by best approximating experimental data in measurement technology.

Let us consider the same problem on the best approximation to the two points 

x1 = 1, y1 = 1

x2 = 10, y2 = 15

of the Cartesian plane x0y by a straight line 

y = kx

where namely the best value of a real-number parameter k is required. Equalizing the hypererrors (3.1.2) gives the condition

|k – 1|/(|k| + 1) = |10k – 15|/(|10k| + |15|)

that can be solved by the interval method opening the modulus signs also without iterating, i.e., finitely. The best solution under this condition is chosen by the criteria of the least hypererrors of the equations 

|k – 1|/|k| = 0,

|10k – 15|/|10k| = 0,

which in this case simply requires the least value of |k – 1|/|k| on the interval [1, 15/10] = [1, 3/2]. The equalizing condition then gives 

(k – 1)/k = –(10k – 15)/(10k),

k = 1.51/2 » 1.22474.

In this case, the quadratic estimating fraction (3.1.4) would lead to the same value in another way:

|k – 1|/[2(k2 + 12)]1/2 = |10k – 15|/{2[(10k)2 + 152]}1/2,

k = 1.51/2 » 1.22474.

For the first point with relatively less coordinates, the absolute error, relative ones, and hypererror (3.1.2) are 

D1 = |k – 1| = 1.51/2 – 1 » 0.22474,

d1’ = |k – 1|/|k| = (1.51/2 – 1)/1.51/2 » 0.18350,

d1’’ = |k – 1|/|1| = (1.51/2 – 1)/1 » 0.22474,

H1 = |k – 1|/(|k| + |1|) = (1.51/2 – 1)/(1.51/2 + 1) » 0.10102

and for the second point with relatively greater coordinates 

D2 = |10k – 15| = 15 – 10 × 1.51/2 » 2.75255,

d2’ = |10k – 15|/|10k| = (15 – 10 × 1.51/2)/(10 × 1,51/2) » 0.22474,

d2’’ = |10k – 15|/|15| = (15 – 10 × 1.51/2)/15 » 0.18350,

H2 = |10k – 15|/(|10k| + |15|) = (15 – 10 × 1.51/2)/(10 × 1.51/2 + 15) » 0.10102.

Let us now use the hypererror equalizing iteration method itself to show what to do if the equalizing hyperset of equations cannot be finitely solved, which is typical. To prepare iterating, let us transform the equalizing condition unique in our case on the interval already chosen as follows:

(k(n+1) – 1)/(k(n) + 1) = (15 – 10k(n+1))/(10k(n) + 15),

(k(n+1) – 1)/(k(n) + 1) = (3 – 2k(n+1))/(2k(n) + 3)

where k(n) means the nth approximation to the best value of k.

Let us first take k(0) = 1. Then we receive 

(k(1) – 1)/(k(0) + 1) = (3 – 2k(1))/(2k(0) + 3), k(1) = 11/9 » 1.22222,

(k(2) – 1)/(k(1) + 1) = (3 – 2k(2))/(2k(1) + 3), k(2) = 109/89 » 1.22472

that is very close to the exact value k = 1.51/2 » 1,22474.

The quadratic estimating fraction (3.1.4) brings 

(k(n+1) – 1)/{2[(k(n))2 + 12]}1/2 = (3 – 2k(n+1))/{2[(2k(n))2 + 32]}1/2,

(k(1) – 1)/{2[(k(0))2 + 12]}1/2 = (3 – 2k(1))/{2[(2k(0))2 + 32]}1/2,

k(1) = (131/2 + 3 × 21/2)/ (131/2 + 2 × 21/2) » 1.21980,

which is in this case more complicated and somewhat worse.







4.4. Direct-Solution Method



Earlier we considered the overdetermined set (3.2.2) of equations

x = a,

x = b,

where variable x is an unknown real number, a and b known real numbers with the same sign, and their geometric mean value with the same sign is the quasisolution. The last coincides with the quasisolution to the compound inequation (3.2.1)

a &lt; x &lt; b

and is also the supersolution if a &lt; b.

The idea to use the geometric mean values with the same sign can be generalized for more than two elements as follows.

Let us consider a hyperset

A = {... , aa, ... , bb, ... , g0, ...}° (4.4.1)

whose elements ... , a, ... , b, ... , 0, ... belong to a common normed vector space and their quantities ... , a, ... , b, ... , g, ... are nonnegative real numbers, together with its hypersubset

A’ = {... , aa, ... , bb, ... }° (4.4.2)

after excluding exactly all the hyperelements (4.4.1) with zero elements. The complete hyperset A (4.4.1) is said to be approximated by such an element x of the same vector space that x is the quasisolution to the hyperset of equations

.................

a(x = a),

.................

b(x = b),

.................

g(x = 0),

................. (4.4.3)

with the corresponding quantities and so can be regarded as the best approximation to all the elements (with their quantities as weights) of A (4.4.1). Of course, this quasisolution x is not necessarily an element of the hyperset A (4.4.1) itself.

The essence of the direct-solution method is that the element 

x = Q(A’)//Q(A)(... + aa/||a||n + ... + bb/||b||n + ...)//(... + a/||a||n + ... + b/||b||n + ...) (4.4.4)

of the same vector space is at once proposed as a proper approximation to this quasisolution generally unknown where n is a nonnegative real number. All zero elements are also taken into account (of course, not geometrically but arithmetically) due to the first fraction 

Q(A’)//Q(A) = ( ... + a + ... + b + ...)//( ... + a + ... + b + ... + g + ...) (4.4.5)

together with all the quantities. The case n = 0 in (4.4.4) corresponds to the usual arithmetical mean value by using the least-square method (and the absolute error) with quantities as weights where zero elements have not to be initially excluded and relatively small elements are also adequately taken into account. The case n = ½ in (4.4.4) corresponds to our idea to use geometric mean values, and by further essential increase of n (e.g., for n ³ 1), relatively great elements are weakly taken into account. In the following examples, we shall therefore take namely n = ½ in (4.4.4).

Let us return to the same overdetermined set of equations (3.2.2)

x = a,

x = b

by ab &gt; 0. The method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) proposes 

x = (1 + 1)/(1 + 1)(1a//|a|1/2 + 1b//|b|1/2)//(1/|a|1/2 + 1/|b|1/2) = (ab)1/2 sign a (4.4.6)

as a quasisolution, which is already known. (4.4.6) is also the quasisolution to the compound inequation (3.2.1)

a &lt; x &lt; b

by ab &gt; 0 and is additionally the supersolution if a &lt; b.

Let us add to the same set (3.2.2) of equations the third one 

x = 0

with a zero element. Only the denominator of the first fraction (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) then naturally changes:

x = (1 + 1)/(1 + 1 + 1)(1a//|a|1/2 + 1b//|b|1/2)//(1/|a|1/2 + 1/|b|1/2) = 2/3(ab)1/2 sign a.

For the set of equations

x = 1,

y = 1,

x = 3,

y = 2,

we receive (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5))

x = (1 + 1)/(1 + 1)(1×1/|1|1/2 + 1×3/|3|1/2)/(1/|1|1/2 + 1/|3|1/2) = 31/2,

y = (1 + 1)/(1 + 1)(1×1/|1|1/2 + 1×2/|2|1/2)/(1/|1|1/2 + 1/|2|1/2) = 21/2.

For the set of equations

x = 1,

x = 0,

y = 1,

x = 3,

y = 0,

y = 2,

we receive (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5))

x = (1 + 1)/(1 + 1 + 1)(1×1/|1|1/2 + 1×3/|3|1/2)/(1/|1|1/2 + 1/|3|1/2) = 2/31/2,

y = (1 + 1)/(1 + 1 + 1)(1×1/|1|1/2 + 1×2/|2|1/2)/(1/|1|1/2 + 1/|2|1/2) = 2/3×21/2.

Earlier we considered hypersets of equations with only one unknown variable in each of them. Such hypersets of equations are equivalent to problems on the quasisolution to the corresponding point hyperset or also on the supersolution to the corresponding hyperset of inequations because the obtained equations for the hypererrors and reserves, respectively, in these cases are the same.

Let us consider a more complicated overdetermined set of equations such that each of them might include two or more unknown variables, e.g.,

x + 2y = 3,

2x – y = 1,

x – y = 1,

2x – 3y = 0. (4.4.7)

These four straight lines (4.4.7) have 4×3/2 = 6 intersections

x = 1, y = 1,

x = 3, y = 2,

x = 5/3, y = 2/3,

x = 3/4, y = 1/2,

x = 9/7, y = 6/7,

x = 0, y = –1. (4.4.8)

Each of them belongs to exactly two straight lines and therefore is taken with quantity (2×1)/2 = 1. If an intersection belongs to exactly three equation lines or, generally, m ones then it has to be taken with quantity (3×2)/2 = 3 or m(m – 1)/2, respectively, because this means a limiting case of a triangle or m-gon, respectively, where m is a natural number. By such counting, the conservation law for the amount of intersections holds independently of their coincidences. It would be also possible to duplicate all these quantities because this would change no results. But this would bring many superfluous factors, and an intersection of m equation lines would have to be taken with quantity m(m – 1) and not simply m, otherwise the conservation law for the number of intersections could be violated. Therefore, let us choose the formula m(m – 1)/2. Naturally, this has to be additionally multiplied by the product of the quantities (weights) w(l) of all the equations whose lines contain that intersection.

In contrast to the hypersets of equations with only one unknown variable in each of them, every equation with at least two unknown variables brings another hypererror and reserve in comparison with point hypersets and hypersets of inequations. Note that pseudosolutions have to be estimated namely in the initial hyperset of equations. In this general case, an equivalent problem on a point hyperset or a hyperset of inequations cannot be proposed. To use the same effective method by searching for quasisolution approximations, we can consider an approximately equivalent problem on a certain point hyperset. The hypererrors and reserves of all the pseudosolutions including quasisolution approximations have to be exactly estimated in the initial hyperset of equations itself in principle.

Naturally, let us first take the hyperset of all the intersections (with the mentioned quantities) of the equation interpretations, in this case equation straight lines. Generally, it is not admissible to equivalently use all the intersections by determining quasisolution approximations because there might be misleading intersections. Some straight lines can be parallel to each other, and their intersection then lies at infinity in one of two directions, which would bring an ambiguous and false result infinite as well. By almost parallel straight lines, their intersections lie so far from the area of possible quasisolution approximations that taking those intersections into account would fake quasisolution approximations. Because the last ones have to be estimated anyway by means of the initial equations themselves, namely the shortest distances to all the equation straight lines and not their remote intersections are of great importance. There are at least two ways for our choice.

1. The distances of each intersection from the geometrical interpretations of all the equations are taken into account due to its quantity suitably transformed. For example, the last one can be divided by the sum (possibly of the squares) of the distances of the intersection from all the equation interpretations, in this case equation straight lines. Each infinitely remote intersection then brings exactly 0, which is reasonable. And generally, the farther an intersection from all the equation interpretations that do not contain it, the less its influence on the result. This approach takes all intersections with their proper weights into account, needs no individual intersection hyperset analysis, and seems to be very suitable for computer-aided investigations.

2. Some hypersubset of the intersections for their further considering is chosen, which, of course, needs an individual intersection hyperset analysis. A proper choice algorithm might be following. Let us first exclude each intersection such that on each straight line containing this intersection, all the other intersections lie on one half-line whose origin is this intersection that is hence no intermediate one. A second step is possibly adding some first excluded intersections by the rule that each equation straight line has to be represented by at least one intersection belonging to this line, otherwise the corresponding equation would be ignored. For example, by two intersecting straight lines, their intersection is first excluded and then taken into account. Further, in many cases it can be reasonable to take some additional intersections first excluded into account. By choosing each additional intersection, the first and main criterion is the representativity one by which namely the equation lines or other interpretations, containing the least number of intersections already chosen, have to be represented by additional intersections. The second criterion of choice is certainly the distance criterion requiring to choose such an intersection that the sum (of nonnegative powers, e.g., squares analytically especially convenient in many cases) of the distances of this intersection from all the equation interpretations is the least one among such sums for all the intersections first excluded. For example, by three straight lines with three intersections, all three ones are first excluded, two of them with the least distance are then included and finally the third possibly remote intersection is first ignored and then taken into account by comparing both results or also using iterations. We can consider many different possibilities, estimate the quasisolutions to the corresponding point hyperset problems as pseudosolutions to our problem, choose the best of them or also consider all such quasisolutions as corrected point hypersets, etc. In the last case, the direct-solution method is iteration one. By each step, also the first approach, e.g., with dividing the quantity of each intersection or pseudosolution approximation by the sum (of the squares) of the distances of the intersection or pseudosolution approximation from all the geometrical equation interpretations, in this case equation straight lines, can be used. This second approach has also flexibility advantages with many choice possibilities and comparison ones.

Let us return to our problem and first determine the distances between each intersection (4.4.8) and each straight line (4.4.7).

In our problem by the second approach, first only three intermediate intersections 

x = 5/3, y = 2/3,

x = 3/4, y = 1/2,

x = 9/7, y = 6/7 (4.4.9)

are chosen, which represent all the four equation straight lines, and no completion is necessary. In a second consideration by the representativity criterion, we can also take the additional intersection 

x = 0, y = –1 (4.4.10)

into account, which represents the straight lines to the equations

2x – y = 1,

x – y = 1

as a second intersection, and each of the two remaining straight lines contains two intersections earlier chosen. But this intersection lies relatively far, and by its consideration, the distances have to be taken into account by quantity determination. The intersection

x = 1, y = 1 (4.4.11)

lies much nearer than the additional intersection to the three intersections already chosen and would be chosen by the distance criterion, but it is only the second one. Nevertheless, we can also take (4.4.11) as an additional intersection instead of (4.4.10) into account in a third consideration. The more approximation attempts, the better results.

In the first consideration of the three points (4.4.9) without taking the distances into account in the quantities, the method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) brings the quasisolution

x = 3/3[(5/3)/|5/3|1/2 + (3/4)/|3/4|1/2 + (9/7)/|9/7|1/2]/[1/|5/3|1/2 + 1/|3/4|1/2 + 1/|9/7|1/2) » 1.170,

y = 3/3[(2/3)/|2/3|1/2 + (1/2)/|1/2|1/2 + (6/7)/|6/7|1/2]/[1/|2/3|1/2 + 1/|1/2|1/2 + 1/|6/7|1/2) » 0.659

to the corresponding point set problem. The hypererrors (see (3.1.2), (3.1.7)) of the equations in their initial set (4.4.7) by this quasisolution approximation are:

dx + 2y =? 3 = |x + 2y – 3|/(|x| + 2|y| + 3) » 0.0933,

d2x – y = ? 1 = |2x – y – 1|/(2|x| + |y| + 1) » 0.1703,

dx – y = ? 1 = |x – y – 1|/(|x| + |y| + 1) » 0.1729,

d2x – 3y = ? 0 = |2x – 3y|/(2|x| + 3|y|) » 0.0841.

The hypererror of the whole set (4.4.7) of equations itself as a quantitative measure of its contradictoriness can be approximately determined namely by this quasisolution approximation and is 

1d = (dx + 2y =? 3 + d2x – y =? 1 + dx – y =? 1 + d2x – 3y =? 0)/4 » 0.1302

(see (3.1.8)) as an arithmetical mean value by the linear law,

4d = {[(dx + 2y =? 3)4 + (d2x – y =? 1)4 + (dx – y =? 1)4 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)4]/4}1/4 » 0.1469

(see (3.1.10)) by the law of the fourth power (four is the number of the equations in their set).

In the first consideration of the three points (4.4.9) with taking the distances into account in the quantities, the method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) brings the quasisolution

x = (13/9 + 32/19 + 49/13)/(13/9 + 32/19 + 49/13)[13/9×(5/3)/|5/3|1/2 + 32/19×(3/4)/|3/4|1/2 + 49/13×(9/7)/|9/7|1/2]/[13/9/|5/3|1/2 + 32/19/|3/4|1/2 + 49/13/|9/7|1/2) » 1.189,

to the corresponding point set problem. The hypererrors (see (3.1.2), (3.1.7)) of the equations in their initial set (4.4.7) by this quasisolution approximation are:

The hypererror of the whole set (4.4.7) of equations itself is

In the third consideration of the four points (4.4.9) and (4.4.11) without taking the distances into account in the quantities, the method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) brings the quasisolution

y = 3/3[ (2/3)/|2/3|1/2 + (1/2)/|1/2|1/2 + (6/7)/|6/7|1/2 + 1/|1|1/2]/[1/|2/3|1/2 + 1/|1/2|1/2 + 1/|6/7|1/2 + 1/|1|1/2) » 0.731

to the corresponding point set problem. The hypererrors (see (3.1.2), (3.1.7)) of the equations in their initial set (4.4.7) by this quasisolution approximation are:

dx + 2y =? 3 = |x + 2y – 3|/(|x| + 2|y| + 3) » 0.0737,

d2x – y =? 1 = |2x – y – 1|/(2|x| + |y| + 1) » 0.1308,

dx – y =? 1 = |x – y – 1|/(|x| + |y| + 1) » 0.2118,

d2x – 3y =? 0 = |2x – 3y|/(2|x| + 3|y|) » 0.0133.

The hypererror of the whole set (4.4.7) of equations itself is

1d = (dx + 2y =? 3 + d2x – y =? 1 + dx – y =? 1 + d2x – 3y =? 0)/4 » 0.1074

(see (3.1.8)) as an arithmetical mean value by the linear law, 

2d = {[(dx + 2y =? 3)2 + (d2x – y =? 1)2 + (dx – y =? 1)2 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)2]/4}1/2 » 0.1300

(see (3.1.9)) by the quadratic law, and 

4d = {[(dx + 2y =? 3)4 + (d2x – y =? 1)4 + (dx – y =? 1)4 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)4]/4}1/4 » 0.1554

(see (3.1.10)) by the law of the fourth power.

In the consideration of all the six points (4.4.8) by the first approach with taking the distances into account in the quantities, the method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) brings the quasisolution

x = (26/15 + 1/5 + 13/9 + 32/19 + 49/13)/(26/15 + 1/5 + 13/9 + 32/19 + 49/13 + 13/74)[26/15×1/|1|1/2 + 1/5×3/|3|1/2 + 13/9×(5/3)/|5/3|1/2 + 32/19×(3/4)/|3/4|1/2 + 49/13×(9/7)/|9/7|1/2]/[26/15/|1|1/2 + 1/5/|3|1/2 + 13/9/|5/3|1/2 + 32/19/|3/4|1/2 + 49/13/|9/7|1/2) » 1.151,

y = (26/15 +1/5 + 13/9 + 32/19 + 49/13 + 13/74)/(26/15 + 1/5 + 13/9 + 32/19 + 49/13 +13/74)[26/15×1/|1|1/2 + 1/5×2/|2|1/2 + 13/9×(2/3)/|2/3|1/2 + 32/19×(1/2)/|1/2|1/2 + 49/13×(6/7)/|6/7|1/2 + 13/74×(–1)/|–1|1/2]/[26/15/|1|1/2 + 1/5/|2|1/2 + 13/9/|2/3|1/2 + 32/19/|1/2|1/2 + 49/13/|6/7|1/2 + 13/74/|–1|1/2) » 0.750

to the corresponding point set problem. The hypererrors (see (3.1.2), (3.1.7)) of the equations in their initial set (4.4.7) by this quasisolution approximation are:

dx + 2y =? 3 = |x + 2y – 3|/(|x| + 2|y| + 3) » 0.0618,

d2x – y =? 1 = |2x – y – 1|/(2|x| + |y| + 1) » 0.1362,

dx – y =? 1 = |x – y – 1|/(|x| + |y| + 1) » 0.2065,

d2x – 3y =? 0 = |2x – 3y|/(2|x| + 3|y|) » 0.0114.

The hypererror of the whole set (4.4.7) of equations itself is

1d = (dx + 2y =? 3 + d2x – y =? 1 + dx – y =? 1 + d2x – 3y =? 0)/4 » 0.1040

(see (3.1.8)) as an arithmetical mean value by the linear law, 

2d = {[(dx + 2y =? 3)2 + (d2x – y =? 1)2 + (dx – y =? 1)2 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)2]/4}1/2 » 0.1276

(see (3.1.9)) by the quadratic law, and 

4d = {[(dx + 2y =? 3)4 + (d2x – y =? 1)4 + (dx – y =? 1)4 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)4]/4}1/4 » 0.1527

(see (3.1.10)) by the law of the fourth power.

All these quasisolutions to the corresponding point set problems seem to be sufficient and roughly equally suitable quasisolution approximations to our problem on the set of equations. Its unknown quasisolution should be close enough to these approximations. The last result with taking all the intersections and distances into account seems to be the best one. The hypererror of the whole set of equations by the quadratic law might be the most suitable for both the analytic comparison of different pseudosolutions by quasisolutions search within one approach and the numeric comparison of the results by different approaches. The linear law and more likely the law of the fourth power can play a completion role. Note that in simple examples with two points and the geometrical mean quasisolution, the linear law brings not the global least value but a local maximum.







4.5. Typical Examples for Comparing Different Methods



Let us first consider the problem on determining the best linear approximation to the four points 

(x, y) = (–1, –1); (1, 1); (8, 10); (12, 10)

of the Cartesian plane x0y by a straight line with a general equation 

y = ax + b

where namely the real-number coefficients a and b are required. 

The least-square method (see (4.1.1)) gives 

y » 0.927 x + 0.364

as a final and nonimprovable result (essentially deviating from the intuitively evident analytic and graphical choice 

y = x)

with 

1d » 0.128,

2d » 0.135,

4d » 0.146

(see (3.1.8) – (3.1.10)) as hypererrors.

Let us use the proposed method of the least normed squares (powers by m = 2) (see (4.2.1)) and take a(0) = b(0) = 1 (which is obviously false) as the 0th approximation. Then at once the first approximation brings a very good result

a(1) » 0.99789; 

b(1) » 0.00817; 

1d(1) » 0.0525,

2d(1) » 0.0718,

4d(1) » 0.0864

(see (3.1.8) – (3.1.10)).

In the problem on the quasisolution to the overdetermined set of linear equations 

29x + 21y = 50,

50x – 17y = 33,

x + 2y = 7,

2x – 3y = 0, (4.5.1)

this set can also be considered as a union of the two following determined subsets. The first of them 

29x + 21y = 50,

50x – 17y = 33 (4.5.2)

has relatively greater factors by the unknown variables x and y and

x = 1,

y = 1 (4.5.3)

as the unique exact solution. The second subset 

x + 2y = 7,

2x – 3y = 0 (4.5.4)

with relatively less factors by the unknown variables x and y has another unique exact solution, namely 

x = 3,

y = 2. (4.5.5)

The least-square method (see (4.1.1)) gives 

x » 1.00234; 

y » 1.00750; 

1d » 0.151,

2d » 0.223,

4d » 0.286

(see (3.1.8) – (3.1.10)) as a final and nonimprovable result practically ignoring the second subset (4.5.4) with relatively less factors.

Let us use the proposed method of the least normed squares (powers by m = 2) (see (4.2.1)), again taking the units 

x (0) = 1,

y(0) = 1

as the 0th approximation, which accidentally coincides with the exact solution (4.5.3) to the first subset (4.5.2), is obviously false as applied to the whole set (4.5.1) of equations, and should be no especially suitable choice according to the experience with the least-square method. The first approximation then gives at once the much better result

x (1) » 1.263; 

y(1) » 1.051; 

1d(1) » 0.163,

2d(1) » 0.195,

4d(1) » 0.250

(see (3.1.8) – (3.1.10)).

The hypererror equalizing iteration method (4.3.1) brings the good further approximations 

x (2) » 1.5974; y(2) » 1.4374; 1d(2) » 0.1855, 2d(2) » 0.1879, 4d(2) » 0.1925;

x (3) » 1.5993; y(3) » 1.4674; 1d(3) » 0.1864, 2d(3) » 0.1884, 4d(3) » 0.19219;

x (4) » 1.5981; y(4) » 1.4684; 1d(4) » 0.1864, 2d(4) » 0.1884, 4d(4) » 0.19216

and also the desired result 

x » 1.60; y » 1.47; 1d » 0,186, 2d » 0,188, 4d » 0,192

(see (3.1.8) – (3.1.10)).

Let us apply to this problem also the second approach of the direct-solution method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) without taking the distances into account. First three intermediate intersections 

x = 1, y = 1,

x = 150/129, y = 100/129,

x = 185/117, y = 317/117 (4.5.6)

only are chosen that represent all the four equation straight lines (4.5.1), hence no completion is necessary. In a second consideration by the representativity criterion, we can also take the additional intersection 

x = 3, y = 2 (4.5.7)

into account, which represents the straight lines to the equations

x + 2y = 7,

2x – 3y = 0

as a second intersection, each of the remaining two straight lines containing two intersections already chosen. 

In the first consideration of the three points (4.5.6) without taking the distances into account, the method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) brings the quasisolution

x = 3/3[1/|1|1/2 + (150/129)/|150/129|1/2 + (185/117)/|185/117|1/2]/[1/|1|1/2 + 1/|150/129|1/2 + 1/|185/117|1/2) » 1.225,

y = 3/3[1/|1|1/2 + (100/129)/|100/129|1/2 + (317/117)/|317/117|1/2]/[1/|1|1/2 + 1/|100/129|1/2 + 1/|317/117|1/2) » 1.285

to the corresponding point set problem. The hypererrors (see (3.1.2), (3.1.7)) of the equations in their initial set (4.5.1) by this quasisolution approximation are:

d29x + 21y =? 50 = |29x + 21y – 50|/(29|x| + 21|y| + 50) » 0.111,

d50x – 17y =? 33 = |50x – 17y – 33|/(50|x| + 17|y| + 33) » 0.055,

dx + 2y =? 7 = |x + 2y – 7|/(|x| + 2|y| + 7) » 0.297,

d2x – 3y =? 0 = |2x – 3y|/(2|x| + 3|y|) » 0.223.

The hypererror of the whole set of equations (4.5.1) itself is

1d = (d29x + 21y =? 50 + d50x – 17y =? 33 + dx + 2y =? 7 + d2x – 3y =? 0)/4 » 0.172

(see (3.1.8)) as an arithmetical mean value by the linear law, 

2d = {[(d29x + 21y =? 50)2 + (d50x – 17y =? 33)2 + (dx + 2y =? 7)2 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)2]/4}1/2 » 0.196

(see (3.1.9)) by the quadratic law, and 

4d = {[(d29x + 21y =? 50)4 + (d50x – 17y =? 33)4 + (dx + 2y =? 7)4 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)4]/4}1/4 » 0.226

(see (3.1.10)) by the law of the fourth power.

In the second consideration of the four points (4.5.6) and (4.5.7) without taking the distances into account, the method (see (4.4.4), (4.4.5)) brings the quasisolution

x = 4/4[1/|1|1/2 + (150/129)/|150/129|1/2 + (185/117)/|185/117|1/2 + 3/|3|1/2]/[1/|1|1/2 + 1/|150/129|1/2 + 1/|185/117|1/2 + 1/|3|1/2) » 1.536,

y = 4/4[1/|1|1/2 + (100/129)/|100/129|1/2 + (317/117)/|317/117|1/2 + 2/|2|1/2]/[1/|1|1/2 + 1/|100/129|1/2 + 1/|317/117|1/2 + 1/|2|1/2) » 1.432

to the corresponding point set problem. The hypererrors (see (3.1.2), (3.1.7)) of the equations in their initial set (4.5.1) by this quasisolution approximation are:

d29x + 21y =? 50 = |29x + 21y – 50|/(29|x| + 21|y| + 50) » 0.198,

d50x – 17y =? 33 = |50x – 17y – 33|/(50|x| + 17|y| + 33) » 0.145,

dx + 2y =? 7 = |x + 2y – 7|/(|x| + 2|y| + 7) » 0.228,

d2x – 3y =? 0 = |2x – 3y|/(2|x| + 3|y|) » 0.166.

The hypererror of the whole set of equations (4.5.1) itself is

1d = (d29x + 21y =? 50 + d50x – 17y =? 33 + dx + 2y =? 7 + d2x – 3y =? 0)/4 » 0.184

(see (3.1.8)) as an arithmetical mean value by the linear law, 

2d = {[(d29x + 21y =? 50)2 + (d50x – 17y =? 33)2 + (dx + 2y =? 7)2 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)2]/4}1/2 » 0.187

(see (3.1.9)) by the quadratic law, and 

4d = {[(d29x + 21y =? 50)4 + (d50x – 17y =? 33)4 + (dx + 2y =? 7)4 + (d2x – 3y =? 0)4]/4}1/4 » 0.192

(see (3.1.10)) by the law of the fourth power.

In the second consideration we have directly received a certainly better result that is very close to the result of the hypererror equalizing iteration method. This problem has also shown that namely the quadratic hypererror 2d has especial advantages as applied to the whole set of equations. The linear hypererror 1d seems to be not very suitable for this purpose but can play a completion role together with 4d.

The more methods, approaches, and trials, the better quasisolution approximations. Naturally, the hypererror of each quasisolution approximation has to be determined namely by means of the initial set of equations.





4.6. Demodulation Methods



Measuring each physical magnitude not uniformly distributed in space and/or time [26] by means of a real physical device with nonzero sizes and inertia results in inadequate measurement data. These are distorted (modulated) by a certain law and/or delayed and hence differ from the true distribution. In measurement technology, especially by very heterogeneous objects and rapidly changeable processes, it is very important to recover the true distributions by using measurement data [27]. Such a delay can be considered stable in many cases and compensated by a corresponding displacement of the measurement data in the positive direction of the time axis. But modulation much more complicated depends on the properties of both the distribution and device. Therefore, suitable demodulation methods are very important for measurement technology.

For example, let us consider a one-variable function p(s) continuously distributed and integral-mean modulated on each segment of a constant length D:

MD: p(s) ® p(s) = D-1òs-D/2 s+D/2 p(t)dt (4.6.1)

where MD is the corresponding measurement operator. The domain of definition of p(s) can be restricted by not greater than D from each boundary point of the domain. It is important to know whether and under what conditions an inversion of the measurement operator (4.6.1) exists and is unambiguous and how that can be determined.

Let us first consider the unambiguity problem. If some functions p(s) and q(s) are solutions to the equation (4.6.1), r(s) = q(s) – p(s) is a solution to the equation

òs-D/2s+D/2 r(t)dt = 0.

Its differentiating by s shows that for each s from the domain of definition, the equality

r(s + D/2) = r(s – D/2)

is an identity. Therefore, r(s) is a periodic function where D is a period. The integral mean value of the function on each segment, whose length is exactly the period, vanishes. The inversion of MD (4.6.1) is therefore ambiguous and determined up to such a function r(s), e.g., a finite or infinite sum of harmonic functions with divisors of D as periods. If the device is such suitable one that the variation of the distribution p(s) on each segment of length D is small enough in comparison with the least value of the distribution itself on the same segment, such a function r(s) can be considered vanishing and the inversion practically unambiguous. Otherwise, it is necessary and sufficient to additionally use another device with such a constant D’ that D’/D is theoretically irrational and practically an uncancelled fraction with the sum of the numerator and denominator great enough.

If there is a continuous inversion of MD (4.6.1), the function p(s) (4.6.1) is continuously differentiable, and vice versa. The thorough proof brings also an inversion algorithm that could be used if the measurement data would be an exactly known continuous distribution. But this is only seldom the case. We usually know some discrete values of the function p(s) (4.6.1) with measurement errors. In such a situation, interpolating and, all the more, numerically differentiating would lead to very great errors. Therefore, the following method is advantageous. We often know the domain of definition and some properties of a distribution (whether or not it is periodic or monotone, what order of magnitude, extreme values and signs under what conditions it has, etc.). In many cases this allows to a priori choose standard functions (e.g., power, trigonometric, exponential, hyperbolic, logarithmic ones, etc.) whose linear combinations can be considered proper. By the principle of tolerable simplicity, the least sufficient number of such functions has to be used. When a priori choosing the coefficients by the arguments of those functions, due to the linearity of the measurement operator (4.6.1) we receive linear equations with unknown factors in the combinations, whose set is usually overdetermined and thus contradictory. The proposed methods are very suitable and quickly lead to quasisolutions. What is more, this brings no increasing but correcting measurement errors.

By many most important standard functions, using the measurement operator (4.6.1) can be replaced with multiplication by a suitable factor. For example, this factor is: 

1 for each linear function; 

sh(0.5nD)/(0.5nD) for exp(ns), sh ns, and ch ns; 

sin(0.5nD)/(0.5nD) for sin ns and cos ns.

For example, by a continuous periodic function p(s) and a suitable scale, the period can be considered to be 2p. The Fourier series [11]

p(s) = 0.5c0 + ån=1¥ (cn cos ns + sn sin ns)

is then uniformly summable and therefore integrable. We receive

p(s) = 0.5c0 + ån=1¥ [sin(0.5nD)/(0.5nD)](cn cos ns + sn sin ns).

The inversion algorithm is now obvious and very simple. Let us first determine the Fourier series 

p(s) = 0.5c0 + ån=1¥ (cn cos ns + sn sin ns)

for the known function p(s) (4.6.1) and then 

p(s) = 0.5c0 + ån=1¥ [0.5nD/sin(0.5nD)](cn cos ns + sn sin ns)

for the unknown function p(s) (4.6.1) by means of the known factors inverted.

Similar ideas are also useful in more complicated cases.

The essence of the Kirsch problem [28] is determining the greatest stress concentration on the boundary of a round hole in a theoretically infinite plate extended in one direction at infinity. The maximum stress holds on two generatrixes of the hole with radius r. But a device best placed on the surface of the hole has a measuring mesh of a nonzero length l on which averaging takes place. To determine the true greatest stress, the stress measured has to be multiplied by the corresponding factor

K = 3/[1 + (2r/l)sin(l/r)].

For a round plate of radius r, which is supported on the boundary and loaded by a one-side pressure uniformly distributed [28], by determining the true greatest stress at the center of the opposite side, a factor 

K = 1/{1 – [l/(2r)]2}

can be analogously used.

If the same plate is fixed on the boundary [28], the factor is

K = 1/{1 – [(1 + m)/(3 + m)][l/(2r)]2}

where m is the Poisson ratio of the plate material.

Analogous formulas are available for a generalized Kirsch problem with two extensions in orthogonal directions, under a uniform pressure in the hole, and by considering the transverse sensitivity of the measuring mesh of the device placed on a side of a plate with taking the device width and distance from the hole into account. In additional, similar formulas are obtained for cylindrical shells [28].





5. Some Applications to Measurement Technology and Corresponding Results






5.1. Mechanics and Optics



The proposed basic concepts and solving methods were extensively used for measuring stresses and strains in spatial solids whose sizes were of the same order and which possibly included concentration areas. This allowed to test an analytic macroelement method [29, 30] with advantages in comparison with the finite-element method. Further the strength and optical properties of circular portholes suitable for any depth in the world ocean, as well as high-pressure vessels, test stands, and other objects in high-pressure engineering [31 – 35] were complexly (multiparametrically) optimized. This resulted in many effective inventions in high-pressure engineering and measurement technology and provided discovering many new phenomena in mechanic systems, e.g., the following ones:

a boundary value problem can limit the degree of a power representation of its pseudosolution also from above; 

the whole problem type can be overdetermined;

continuously varying a system can lead to spasmodical varying its structure;

systems can have critical relations possibly with bifurcations and boundary relations; 

for a system, there can exist a determining parameter and an equivalent one; 

rational control by changing the determining parameter of a system can raise its equivalent parameter by an order;

coincidence of the rational control and the critical relation in a system can depend on this relation;

an equivalent parameter can be uniform if a determining parameter is (a)symmetrically non-uniform.







5.2. Strength Theories 



The proposed principles, concepts, and solving methods were extensively used by analyzing strength data on many solids. Their materials have been different isotropic and anisotropic as well as ductile and brittle ones with equal or unequal strength in tension and compression. Extreme loads have been stationary and arbitrary variable ones of mechanic, thermal, and radiation nature. Object-oriented mathematics allowed to propose transforming stresses and stress processes into relative ones [29]. Using them simplifies many problems in measurement technology to be correctly solved. This is a very promising basis for many engineering areas (aviation, space flight, machine-building, etc.), mechanics, and physics. In particular, general strength theory [36 – 40] has been created as a source to discover many strength laws of nature.

A usual stress depends on the choice of physical dimensions (units), is not numerically invariant by unit transformations, and alone represents no danger degree even by static loading. 

In the stationary case, the proposed stress transformation simply means dividing each stress by the modulus of its limiting value (e.g., by elasticity, plasticity, or failure) with the same sign in the same direction at the same point of the same solid by vanishing all the other stresses and the same remaining loading conditions. By arbitrarily changeable loads, the complete process of each stress alone stationarily indexed is represented by an equidangerous cycle and finally by a stationary vector. The relative stresses always numerically invariant are reciprocal uniaxial reserves, alone show danger degree better than usual reserves, allow additional measurement and investigation possibilities, and open many new ways in discovering mechanical and physical laws of nature.

General strength theory is such an example. It is very hard, expensive, and, all the more, simply impossible to experimentally determine the strength at a point of a spatial solid with all three arbitrarily changeable principal normal stresses (by vanishing all the shearing stresses). The duty of strength criteria is to theoretically determine that strength using measurement data in simple tests (tension, compression, bending, and torsion) with one or two principal stresses only in bars of the same material. But the known strength criteria are applicable only to rare special cases, sometimes have contradictions as well as vague ranges of applicability, and not always bring a suitable equivalent stress. By arbitrarily changeable loads, there are neither applicable strength criteria nor equivalent stress propositions at all. The known strength criteria explain not all important phenomena (e.g., an essential role of hydrostatic stresses), often lose physical sense, contain material parameters with dimensions (units), and cannot lead to laws of nature in principle. Such strength criteria are only some simple special cases of general strength theory represented in the relative stresses with stress transformations independent of both specific strength criteria and this theory itself. It determines the range of applicability of known strength criteria, transforms those into universal ones, and proposes many new laws of nature. These are themselves as always very simple and only by complicated specifying bring results with corresponding complexity like for example the Archimedean law does. This theory naturally extends the physical sense of initial criteria, considers and explains many known phenomena (e.g., an essential role of hydrostatic stresses set by Bridgman) and new ones (nonzero initial states, deviations from Drucker’s postulate, etc.). This theory is very suitable, allows general representing and processing measurement data, reduces time and cost expense, and brings many further advantages of mutual completion of difficultly obtained experimental data on the strength of different materials in spatial stress states under arbitrarily changeable loading. Further this theory proposes many good tools, e.g., an additive and a multiplicative approach [36, 41] to determining true strength reserves additional to known ones in subcritical states of materials. Note that the known reserves are uncertain in principle, alone show real danger degree only in rare special cases of simple loading proportional to a common factor, and otherwise underestimate those often by an order. This all means a further generalization of strength laws of nature from critical solid states to subcritical and supercritical ones.







5.3. Nuclear Physics



The proposed principles, basic concepts, and solving methods were extensively used for processing measurement data on implanting distinct ions into metals with different physical properties. This allowed proposing general implantation theory [42 – 45] with universal estimating and natural discriminating arbitrary implantation doses as well as discovering and explaining many new phenomena in this area.

Implantation doses are usually measured in 1/cm2 and thus depend on the choice of physical units (dimensions). Further distinct ions have unequal sizes. This complicates processing and comparing measurement data for different ions as well as searching for unknown phenomena.

A new basic concept of implantation multiplicity is introduced. This naturally discriminates low, middle, and high implantation doses with orders of 1013, 1015, and 1017 cm-2 by taking real-number values with orders of 0.01, 1, and 100, respectively.

General implantation theory can also be used for strengthening the surfaces of solids extremely loaded and allowed to discover the following phenomena:

existence of a first critical implantation multiplicity;

existence of a second critical implantation multiplicity;

existence of the critical value of implantation energy, whose excess results in the non-equiresistibility of the surface layer of a solid-target;

abrupt supercritical decrease of the resistance of a solid-target;

the coincidence and the common displacement of all the depths of the principal implantation maximums for different particles (ions having diverse sizes, initial energies, etc.).







Conclusions



Traditional mathematics brings key concepts of the numbers, sets, measures, and errors very often insufficient, in particular, for measurement technology. In each concrete (mixed) physical magnitude, no known operation holds. The relative errors of distributions, exactness confidence, and problem contradictoriness are not estimated at all. The known least-square method uniquely applicable in many cases has a very restricted range of applicability and, all the more, of adequacy. Otherwise, it brings false and misleading results that cannot be corrected and improved by the method itself. There are no suitable methods for recovering true distributions by using modulated discrete measurement data.

Object-oriented mathematics by the author within his physical mathematics by the principles of object-oriented thought brings many new key concepts suitable, in particular, for measurement technology. Among them are the hypernumbers, hypersets, quantity operations also holding in concrete (mixed) physical magnitudes, hyperquantities, hypererrors, and reserves estimating and measuring exactness, contradictoriness, and distributions. Even in contradictory problems, the method of the least normed powers, the direct-solution method, as well as the hypererror and reserve equalizing methods give quasisolution approximations improvable by iterations and comparable with one another. Using modulated and inexact discrete measurement data due to the proposed demodulation methods can approximately recover the true continuous space and time distributions of possibly very heterogeneous objects and quickly changeable processes.

The basic concepts and solving methods in object-oriented mathematics were successfully used for analyzing different measurement data in high-pressure engineering, mechanics, optics, and nuclear physics. This allowed to test the analytic macroelement method with advantages in comparison with the finite-element method, to achieve complex optimizing the strength and optical properties of different technical objects, and to propose many inventions also in measurement technology. General strength theory is a source for discovering many strength criteria for any anisotropic solid under arbitrarily changeable extreme loading, which are universal laws of nature. General implantation theory brings the basic concept of implantation multiplicity to naturally discriminate low, middle, and high implantation doses. All this allowed discovering many new phenomena in these areas.

The basic concepts and solving methods in object-oriented mathematics are from the beginning exclusively practice-oriented, effective, universal, and successfully applicable to any measurement technology problem mathematically simulated.

Further developing object-oriented mathematics will bring new results also in the directions of this work.

Dr. Sc. Dissertation
by Himmelsohn L.G.
“Generalization of Analytic Methods for Solving Strength Problems
for Typical Structure Elements in High-Pressure Engineering’’



The dissertation is dedicated to the elaboration of mathematical methods for effective solving urgent strength problems for spatial elastic bodies.

The named methods and solutions as well as the introduced concepts of the generalized least upper and greatest lower bounds on a set, the concept of the complete linear independence of a system, and the methods for determining the relative errors of equalities and pseudosolutions are new in the science. 

The generalization and correction of the least square method have been proposed. 

The general solutions to the harmonic and biharmonic equations in power series have been obtained and applied to stress functions for spatial and axially symmetric elasticity problems in the Papkovich-Neuber and Love forms. For the latter function, the question on the necessity of its biharmonicity to satisfy the equations of equilibrium and continuity has been set and solved positively.

The validity of the results is ensured by using modern approaches and criteria, by methods multivariance and solutions verifiability, by estimating their accuracy, and by comparison them with the known, numeric, and experimental data, the agreement having been achieved.

The methods for solving sets of functional equations, for estimating errors, for typifying spatial body loading diagrams, for individualizing the reserves of the input data of a problem, for correcting measurement errors, the analytic macroelement method, and the methods for the rational control of the stress-strain states and strength of spatial axially symmetric elastic bodies are significant in practice.

By urgency, newness, extent, the scientific level of research, and completeness degree, the work satisfies the modern Dr. Sc. dissertation demands. L. G. Himmelsohn is worthy of the Dr. Sc. degree.

Specialty 01.02.06 – Dynamics, Strength of Machines, Instruments, and Apparatus



In L. G. Himmelsohn’s work, some new analytic methods for solving strength problems as applied to structure elements under high pressure have been elaborated. Their essential distinction is the simplicity of the design formulas obtained, which is of great importance for designing real structures in high-pressure engineering. At the same time, the author uses the complicated mathematical apparatus of functional analysis, which made it possible, to devise generalized analytic methods for determining the stress and strain states of spatial structure elements. The results of applying these methods to specific structures in high-pressure engineering essentially improve their strength and operational performance corroborating the economical efficiency of the investigations carried out.

It should also be noted that, by using the analytic methods elaborated, the author has designed combined plungers, cylinders, and high-pressure vessels working at both industrial enterprises and scientific and technical institutes and defended by many invention certificates. The results presented are published by well known scientific publishing houses.

I consider that L. G. Himmelsohn’s dissertation corresponds to the demands of the Supreme Attestation Commission, and the candidate for a degree is undoubtedly worthy of awarding the degree of Dr. Sc. in Engineering.

I have familiarized myself with all the materials prepared by Leo Gregory Himmelsohn, Ph. D. in Engineering, for the defense of his dissertation “Generalization of Analytic Methods for Solving Strength Problems for Typical Structure Elements in High-Pressure Engineering’’ presented for a Dr. Sc. degree in Engineering and can say the following:

The subject of the dissertation dealing with the strength problems for apparatus connected with high pressure is one of the most complicated strength problems in engineering. Almost all structural elements have dimensions of equal orders in all the directions, i.e., strength problems should be solved for spatial components with complicated boundary conditions, tolerances, assembly accuracy, and other peculiarities. Hence it is clear how complex problems are raised in the dissertation.

The candidate for the degree possesses outstanding grounding in elasticity theory and has thoroughly studied the classical works in general and its parts dealing with thick and thin plates. He compares his propositions and solutions with known similar and close ones and tests the accuracy of his solutions by known and experimental data. The approximate approaches adopted can be useful for solving applied problems in stress, strain, and strength analysis when the finite-element method and other ones cannot give results desired.

The material presented for the defense shows that its author is a very good master in elasticity theory, which is proved by the irreproachableness of the dissertation. The results of the investigations prove their practical benefit and show that the author of the work is a skilled and sufficiently experienced scientist who is able to set and solve the most complicated problems in modern mechanics of deformable solids.

There can be no doubt that the dissertation presented possesses all the characteristics of a modern qualification work, and its author, Leo Gregory Himmelsohn, is entirely worthy of awarding the degree of Dr. Sc. in Engineering.

Monograph “General Strength Theory” by Leo Himmelsohn
“Drukar”, Sumy, 1993, Ukraine



The monograph presents one of the urgent problems of the contemporary strength theory of anisotropic materials. As the field of using composition materials has been lately increased, very often demonstrating record and irreplaceable characteristics, the work seems of great interest and urgent.

As a rule these materials have complex granular, fibrous or schistose structure. At present the theory of their destruction is not well developed and it does not include all the experimental data.

The author considering the given problem uses a completely new approach, namely strength criteria correlation with the maximum strength of the material in the given direction. And the generalized strength criteria correlate with the type of stress state at the given point of the element investigated (the monograph, formula 25).

The suggested generalization fully reflects the peculiarities of anisontropic materials and, in fact, develops the fundamental results that were obtained by other researchers for deformation and destruction of isotropic materials.

The efficiency of the problem under consideration is proved by the author at interpretation of well-known experimental data that were obtained during the experiments on strength of composite materials, and those data cannot be kept within the frame of well-known theoretical schemes (Fig. 1 &amp; 2).

Thus, the generalized strength criteria suggested by Leo Himmelsohn reflect real regularity of static and cycle destruction of the materials that have complex structure; criteria are convenient for usage in practical calculation and they are perspective in the valuation of strength of different constructions, made of up-to-date construction materials.

Monograph “Basic New Mathematics” by Leo Himmelsohn
“Drukar”, Sumy, 1995

The monograph deals with the system of basic mathematical concepts in some mathematical theories and methods that are used in solving the most urgent problems of the present mechanics and mathematical physics.

The author touches upon such general mathematical concepts as objects, operations and sets, and he is trying to summarize their definition. It all resulted in some deep generalization (sets with multiplicities of elements, the new scale of finite and infinite numbers, etc.) that brought to a new approach to solving several tasks. Thus the multiplicities of elements suggested by the author in creating the theory of sets immensely enlarge the scale of finite and even infinite numbers in comparison with non-standard analysis, etc.

In addition to it there is the generalization of some well-known mathematical methods and description of new ways in solving some urgent tasks. The author suggests a generalizing correction to the method of least squares, the error minimean method to correctly determine relative errors and the row (series) methods using the function or system closed concerning the operator, analytic method of macroelements in elasticity theory, etc.

The conclusions in the monograph are formulated in a very short form that makes it sometimes difficult to understand. That is why it is recommended the monograph be published in more detailed way, with more examples illustrating new methods.

In general the monograph contains new ways and approaches of theoretical generalizations, some practical directions for applying the suggested methods and is of great interest for the specialists in algebra, applied mathematics, and mathematical physics and may be a good help for the post-graduates dealing with mathematics and exact sciences.

Monograph &quot;Basic New Mathematics&quot;
by Ph. D. &amp; Dr. Sc. Leo G. Himmelsohn

The author has proposed dozens of concepts and methods, which generalize known ones and are fundamentals of a certain &quot;new mathematics&quot;. Now he calls it &quot;object-oriented mathematics&quot; which deals only with chosen but basic parts of mathematics as its additional alternative: not &quot;instead of&quot; but &quot;together with&quot;.

It is well known that the usual mathematics with its axioms' systems is not a language of science and life whose many urgent problems permit no rigorous but only fuzzy approach. The author consequently uses it by formulating his principles of the new scientific thought and of the introduced mathematics by creating it.

Leo G. Himmelsohn considers also uncountable general operations with any objects and possibly a symbolic intermediate sense, which can lead to an actual final one. In his multielements and general sets generalizing Cantor sets, multisets, and fuzzy sets, elements and their quantities are arbitrary objects. Even if an element quantity is a multiplicity (a pure number) between 0 and 1, it can be also nonfuzzy (e.g. a half an apple). Like numbers, general sets are suitable for many useful operations, and their general quantities as possibly uncountable sums of element quantities are sensitive without absorption also to intersecting infinite sets of different dimensions unlike cardinalities and measures. General numbers as pure general quantities exactly express different infinities and infinitesimals by means of general sets.

Each possibly structured object can be expressed by a general system with quantified elements, general relations between them being introduced. For such variable objects, their possibly critical general states and processes are also considered. A critical parameter reduction leads to a general strength theory for an arbitrarily anisotropic nonequiresistant solid nonstationarily loaded.

On the base of such a hyperanalysis, the author has introduced general estimators for general objects and systems. For example, differently possible events always have positive general probabilities naturally different from each other. Distributions and distribution functions on infinite sets are interpreted in the Lobachevskian geometry.

It is shown that the relative error is indeterminate and unbounded contrary to intuition. An introduced general error correctly applicable to any general objects and systems completely sensitively estimates different inexactness, a general reserve discriminates also exact ones by reliability degree.

For inconsistent problems, it is shown that the unique known applicable least square method loses any sense by noncoincidence of physical units. Its result depends on equivalent transformations of a system of equations by their multiplication by different positive numbers. Such an approximation is paradoxical: the greater an absolute value, the less even an absolute error. The result cannot be specified by the method itself. The author has proposed universal and effective iterative methods optimizing general errors and reserves. Another method corrects the error of taking a mean value by measuring, other ones give general solutions to partial differential equations, general sums of divergent series etc.

The proposed object-oriented mathematics was applied also to ion implantation theory, low, medium, and high doses being naturally discriminated by an introduced multiplicity, some new phenomena being discovered.

The presentation of the monograph is too brief. The author should prepare a whole treatise whose publication could be very interesting and important for the development of pure and applied mathematics inclusive fuzzy one and other sciences.

LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

Dear Sir:

I recommend Professor, Dr. Sc. in Engineering Leo G. Himmelsohn as a prominent scientist in mathematics and physics, the author of a new scientific thought, a new mathematics, a general strength theory, and a general theory of ion implantation. He has 3 scientific monographs and manuals, 30 inventions, and 70 articles.

The new mathematics includes over 70 theories and 30 methods for effective solving many fundamental and applied problems and permits to discover new phenomena and general laws of nature and science.

The general strength theory for any states of any solids under arbitrary loading conditions gives known critical state criteria as its very special cases.

The general theory of ion implantation is proposed by L. G. Himmelsohn and is developed in our collaboration by his theoretical analysis of my experimental data and my long-term experience. His key concept of an implantation multiplicity naturally distinguishes low, medium, and high doses of implantation. His simple and adequate formula gives the expected depth of implanted ions. This theory permits to discover new phenomena:

the existence of the critical specific implantation energy,

the abrupt supercritical decrease of the specific resistance of the surface layer of a solid,

the fuzziness of the boundary between the damaged and the strengthened sublayers of the surface layer of a solid,

the coincidence and the common displacement of the principal maximums depths of implanted ions having diverse sizes and initial energies.

I hope that L. G. Himmelsohn can be useful for you and your Institute as a scientist.

Sincerely yours,

Article &quot;Hyperanalysis: Hypernumbers, Hypersets, and Hyperquantities&quot;
by Ph. D. &amp; Dr. Sc. Leo G. Himmelsohn

The author has proposed so-called hyperanalysis as a fundament of his object-oriented mathematics whose hypernumbers, hypersets, and hyperquantities generalize the respective known mathematical objects.

It is shown that the real numbers cannot express many even bounded pure quantities, e.g. the probability of the random sampling of a certain element of an infinite set. The known attempts to introduce infinitesimals justify such introducing but give no instrument to express every given infinite or infinitesimal quantity, for instance such a probability or distributions and distribution functions on sets of infinite measure. Leo G. Himmelsohn has solved this problem by extending the properties of the operations and relations for finite numbers without absorption to infinite ones and infinitesimals expressed by using infinite cardinals.

The Cantor sets, fuzzy sets, and multisets cannot express many nonstructured collections, e.g. a half an apple and 5 l fuel. For such concrete quantities, there is no suitable mathematical model and no known operation. Set operations with absorption are only restrictedly reversible. The author has introduced hyperoperations such as quantifying which gives hyperelements and hypersets whose quantities together with elements can be any (possibly fuzzy) objects and generalize known multiplicities that can be also nonfuzzy if they are between 0 and 1. The hypersets can express any collection and, like numbers, can be operands by many operations.

The cardinality is sensitive only to non-intersecting finite sets. The measures (probabilities) are sensitive only to a certain dimension and cannot discriminate the empty set and null sets (impossible and differently possible events). The known algebraic operations require at most countable sets of operands. Leo G. Himmelsohn has introduced the hyperquantity of a hyperset as the possibly uncountable sum of the quantities of all the elements of the hyperset. If a hyperquantity is pure then it can be expressed by a hypernumber. Such hyperquantities exactly estimate even the quantity of the elements of any infinite set, naturally vary together with it, and give a universal and even uncountably algebraically additive degree of quantity.

The article sets an unexpected connection between probability theory and non-Euclidean geometry. It is interesting that distributions and distribution functions on the real numbers can be interpreted in the Lobachevskian geometry.

It is important that all the interconnected concepts introduced in the article do not replace usual ones but are alternative and additional. The author answers many difficult questions set by Bolzano and other famous mathematicians and gives different examples of applying his hyperanalysis to many urgent problems that cannot be even considered in the known mathematics. The article can be very useful for researchers not only in pure and applied mathematics but also in other sciences and is recommended for a publication.

Abstract: 

Pre-existing mathematical formulations are generally used for the treatment of new scientific problems. In this note we show that the construction of mathematical structures from open physical, chemical, and biological problems leads to new intriguing mathematics of increasing complexity called iso-, geno-, and hyper-mathematics for the treatment of matter in reversible, irreversible, and multi-valued conditions, respectively, plus anti-isomorphic images called isodual mathematics for the treatment of antimatter. These novel mathematics are based on the lifting of the multiplicative unit of ordinary fields (with characteristic zero) from its traditional value +1 into: (1) invertible, Hermitean, and single-valued units for isomathematics; (2) invertible, non-Hermitean, and single-valued units for genomathematics; and (3) invertible, non-Hermitean, and multi-valued units for hypermathematics; with corresponding liftings of the conventional associative product and consequential lifting of all branches of mathematics admitting a (left and right) multiplicative unit. An anti-Hermitean conjugation applied to the totality of quantities and their operation of the preceding mathematics characterizes the isodual mathematics. Intriguingly, the emerging formulations preserve the abstract axioms of conventional mathematics (that based on the unit +1). As such, the new formulations result to be new realizations of existing abstract mathematical axioms. We then show that the above mathematical advances permit corresponding liftings of conventional classical and quantum theories with a resolution of basic open problems in physics, chemistry, and biology, numerous experimental verifications, as well as new industrial applications.

ABSTRACT
Pre-existing numbers, related mathematics and consequential physical theories are
generally used for the treatment of new scientific problems. In this memoir we outline
the research conducted by various mathematicians, physicists and chemists over the past
two decades who have shown that the inverse approach, the construction of new numbers,
related new mathematics and consequential new physical theories from open physical,
chemical and biological problems, leads to new intriguing formulations of increasing complexity
called iso-, geno- and hyper-mathematics for the treatment of matter in reversible,
irreversible and multi-valued conditions, respectively, plus anti-isomorphic images called
isodual mathematics for the treatment of antimatter.
These novel formulations are based on new numbers characterized by the lifting of
the multiplicative unit of ordinary fields (with characteristic zero) from its traditional
value +1 to: (1) invertible, Hermitean and single-valued units for isomathematics; (2) invertible,
non-Hermitean and single-valued units for genomathematics; and (3) invertible,
non-Hermitean and multi-valued units for hypermathematics; with corresponding liftings
of the conventional associative product and consequential lifting of all branches of mathematics
admitting a (left and right) multiplicative unit. An anti-Hermitean conjugation
applied to the totality of quantities and their operation of the preceding mathematics
characterizes the isodual mathematics.
The above new mathematics are then used for corresponding liftings of Newtonian,
Hamiltonian and quantum mechanics, today known as iso-, geno-, hyper-mechanics for the
description of matter and their isoduals for antimatter, with compatible liftings of geometries
and symmetries, and, inevitable of contemporary relativities. The above new body of
knowledge is also known as hadronic mechanics, superconductivity and chemistry, wherein
conventional Hamiltonians represent conventional, linear, local and potential interactions
among point particles, while generalized units provide an invariant representation of extended,
nonspherical and deformable particles under additional nonlinear, nonlocal and
nonpotential interactions due to deep mutual penetration of wavepackets at short distances.
Whenever the latter effects are ignorable due to large distances, conventional
units, mathematics and relativities are recovered identically.
We finally outline the novel scientific and industrial verifications and applications
permitted by the new mathematics and relativities in physics, chemistry and biology,
including numerous experimental verifications, and applications for new clean energies
and fuels which are prohibited by contemporary mechanics, special relativity and related
mathematics.

1. INTRODUCTION
Customarily, new problems in physics, chemistry, biology and other quantitative sciences
are treated via pre-existing mathematics. Such an approach is certainly valuable at the
initiation of new studies. However, with the advancement of scientific knowledge such an
approach historically lead to serious limitations and controversies due to the insufficiency
of the used mathematics for the problem at hand.
On historical grounds, the above occurrence is illustrated by the fact that the mathematics
so effective for the study of planetary systems (Hamiltonian vector fields, Hamilton-
Jacobi equations, etc.) resulted to be inadequate for the study of the atomic structure. In
fact, the latter mandated the use of a new mathematics, that based on infinite dimensional
Hilbert spaces over a field of complex numbers, which has no application for planetary
mechanics.
Similar occurrences exist in contemporary science due to the continued use for new
scientific problems of pre-existing mathematics proved to be so effective in preceding
scientific problems. This is the case for:
(1) the lack of a classical formulation of antimatter, due to the inapplicability of
conventional mathematics so effective for the classical treatment of matter;
(2) the lack of quantitative studies of nonlocal-integral interactions as occurring in
chemical valence bonds, due to the inapplicability of conventional mathematics because
of its strictly local-differential character;
(3) the lack of representation of the irreversible and multi-valued nature of biological
systems, due to insufficiencies of both conventional mathematics and hypermathematics
as currently formulated; and other cases.
In this memoir we outline research conducted by numerous mathematicians, physicists
and chemists over the past two decades showing that the construction of new mathematics
from open scientific problems does indeed permit new, intriguing scientific horizons with
far reaching implications in mathematics as well as quantitative science in general.
As we shall see, the emerging new mathematics are based on progressive generalizations
of the multiplicative unit +1 into everywhere invertible and sufficiently smooth, but
otherwise arbitrary quantities (such as numbers, matrices or integro-differential operators)
with corresponding generalizations of the associative product, thus implying corresponding
generalizations of all branches of conventional mathematics (hereinafter defined as the
mathematics based on the multiplicative left and right unit +1 over a field of characteristic
zero).
In this memoir we also show that the above new mathematics imply certain liftings
of Newtonian, Hamiltonian and quantum mechanics with corresponding liftings of geometries
and symmetries and, inevitably, of contemporary relativities. In fact, all efforts
outlined in this memoir were aimed at the construction of new mechanics today known as
iso-, geno-, and hyper-mechanics for the description of matter in conditions of increasing
complexity, and corresponding isodual mechanics for the description of antimatter. All
new scientific and industrial applications can then be reduced to a few primitive mechanical
or, more properly, relativity axioms.
4
Alternatively, an objective of this memoir is to show that no truly novel scientific advance
is possible without truly novel mechanics. In turn, no mechanics can be considered
as truly new without new mathematics. Finally, no mathematics can possibly be truly
new without new numbers. This illustrates the reason why, out of the rather vast scientific
studies over three decades reviewed in this memoir, primary efforts were devoted to the
search of new numbers from which new ,mathematics, new relativities and new scientific
and industrial applications uniquely follow.
The reader should be aware that the literature in the topic of this memoir is rather
vast because it encompasses numerous studies in pure mathematics, applications in various
quantitative sciences, several experimental verifications as well as rapidly expanding
new industrial applications. As a result, in this paper we can only review the most fundamental
aspects of the new formulations. A technical knowledge of the new advances can
only be achieved via the study of the quoted literature. To avoid a prohibitive length,
references have been restricted to contributions specifically based on the lifting of the
unit with a compatible lifting of the product. Regrettably, we have to defer to the specialized
literature the treatment of connections with numerous other studies. References
are grouped by main fields indicated with square brackets (e.g., [5]), while individual
references are indicated with curved brackets (e.g., (201)). Except for monographs, proceedings
and reprint volumes, the titles of the individual contributions are not provide to
avoid a prohibitive length, as well as because of their lack of general availability in the
physics literature without an extensive library search.
The reader should be aware that the new mathematics and their applications are still
in their initial stages and so much remains to be done. The author would be grateful
for any comment, as well as for the indication by interested colleagues of mathematical
or or other references in the origination of the new formulations which have escaped his
knowledge.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF ISODUAL MECHANICS FROM CLASSICAL
ANTIMATTER
2.1: The scientific unbalance caused by antimatter. One of the biggest scientific
unbalances of the 20-th century has been the treatment of matter at all possible levels,
from Newtonian to quantum mechanics, while antimatter was solely treated at the level
of second quantization. In particular, the lack of a consistent classical treatment of antimatter
left fundamental open problems, such as the inability to study whether a far away
galaxy or quasar is made up of matter or of antimatter.
It should be indicated that classical studies of antimatter simply cannot be done by
merely reversing the sign of the charge, because of inconsistencies due to the existence of
only one quantization channel. In fact, the quantization of a classical particle with the
reversed sign of the charge leads to a particle (rather than a charge conjugated antiparticle)
with the wrong sign of the charge.
The origin of this scientific unbalance was not of physical nature, and was instead due
to the lack of a mathematics suitable for the classical treatment of antimatter in such a
5

galaxies and quasars are made up of matter or of antimatter.
way to be compatible with charge conjugation at the quantum level. Charge conjugation
is an anti-homomorphism. Therefore, a necessary condition for a mathematics to be
applicable for the classical treatment of antimatter is that of being anti-homomorphic, or,
better, anti-isomorphic to conventional mathematics.
The absence of the needed mathematics is confirmed by the fact that classical treatments
of antimatter require fields, functional analysis, differential calculus, topology, geometries,
algebras, groups, etc. which are anti-isomorphic to conventional formulations.
The absence in the mathematics of the 20-th century of such a mathematics then mandated
its construction as requested by the physical reality here considered (rather than
adapting physical reality to pre-existing mathematics).
2.2: Elements of isodual mathematics. A novel mathematics verifying the above
conditions was proposed by R. M. Santilli in Ref. (11) of 1985 and then developed in
various works (see Refs.(12, 14,15, 54,55,160,161) and [3]).
The fundamental idea is the assumption of a negative-definite, left and right multiplicative
unit, called isodual unit, and denoted Id, where I denotes the conventional
positive-definite unit, I &gt; 0,
Id = ¡I &lt; 0; (2:1)
with corresponding reformulation of the conventional associative product A £ B among
generic quantities A, B (such as numbers, vector fields, operators, etc.) into the form
A£dB = A £ (Id)¡1 £ B; (2:2)
under which Id is the correct left and right multiplicative unit of the theory,
A£dId = Id£dd
A = A; (2:3)
6
for all elements A of the considered set.
More generally, isodual mathematics is given by the image of a given mathematics
admitting a left and right multiplicative unit under the following isodual map
A(x; :::) ! Ad(xd; :::) = ¡Ay(¡xy; :::): (2:4)
when applied to the totality of conventional quantities and their operations, with no exception
of any type. In this paper we cannot possibly review the entire isodual mathematics,
and must restrict ourselves to an elementary review of only the foundations.
DEFINITION 2.1: Let F = F(a;+;£) be a field of characteristic zero representing
real numbers F = R(n;+;£); a = n, complex numbers F = C(c;+;£); a = c, or quaternionic
numbers F = Q(q;+;£); a = q, with conventional associative, distributive and
commutative sum a + b = c 2 F, associative and distributive product a £ b = c 2 F, left
and right additive unit 0, a + 0 = 0 + a = a 2 F, and left and right multiplicative unit
I &gt; 0, a £ I = I £ a = a; 8a; b 2 F. The isodual fields (first introduced in Refs. (11,12))
are rings Fd = Fd(ad;+d;£d) with isodual numbers
ad = ¡ay; (2:5)
associative, distributive and commutative isodual sum
ad +d bd = ¡(a + b)y = cd 2 Fd; (2:6)
associative and distributive isodual product
ad £d bd = ad £ (Id)¡1 £ bd = cd 2 Fd; (2:7)
additive isodual unit
0d = 0; ad +d 0d = 0d +d ad = ad; (2:8)
and isodual multiplicative unit
Id = ¡Iy; ad £d Id = Id £d ad = ad; 8ad; bd 2 Fd: (2:9)
LEMMA 2.1 (12): Isodual fields are fields (namely, isodual field verify all axioms of a
field with characteristic zero).
The above lemma establishes the property (first identified in Refs. (11,12)) that the
axioms of a field do not require that the multiplicative unit be necessary positive-definite,
because it can also be negative-definite. The proof of the following property is equally
simple.
LEMMA 2.2 (12): Fields (of characteristic zero) and their isodual images are antiisomorphic
to each other.
7
Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate the origin of the name ”isodual mathematics.” In fact,
the needed mathematics must constitute a ”dual” image of conventional mathematics,
while the prefix ”iso” is used in its Greek meaning of preserving the original axioms.
It is evident that for real numbers we have nd = ¡n, while for complex numbers we
have cd = (n1 +i£n2)d = ¡n1 +i£n2 = ¡¯c, with a similar formulation for quaternions.
DEFINITION 2.2 (12): A quantity is called isoselfdual when it coincides with its
isodual.
It is easy to verify that the imaginary unit is isoselfdual because
id = ¡¯i = i: (2:10)
As we shall see, isoselfduality is a new symmetry with rather profound implications, e.g.,
in cosmology.
It is evident that, for consistency, all operations of numbers must be subjected to
isoduality. This implies: the isodual powers
(ad)nd
= ad £d ad £d ad::: (2:11)
(n times with n an integer); the isodual square root
ad(1=2)d
= ¡q¡ay
y
; ad(1=2)d £d ad(1=2)d
= ad; 1d(1=2)d
= ¡i; (2:12)
the isodual quotient
ad=dbd = ¡(ay=by) = cd; bd £d cd = ad; etc: (2:13)
An important property for the characterization of antimatter is that isodual fields have
a negative–definite norm, called isodual norm (12)
jadjd = jayj £ Id = ¡(aay)1=2 &lt; 0; (2:14)
where j:::j denotes the conventional norm. For isodual real numbers nd we have the
isodual norm jndjd = ¡jnj &lt; 0 , the isodual norm for for isodual complex numbers
jcdjd = ¡(n21
+ n22
)1=2, etc.
Recall that functional analysis is defined over a field. Therefore, the lifting of fields
into isodual fields requires, for necessary condition of consistency, the formulation of the
isodual functional analysis (54). We here merely recall that
sind µd = ¡sin(¡µ); cosd µd = ¡cos(¡µ); (2:15a)
cosd 2d µd +d sind 2d µd = 1d = ¡1; (2:15b)
the isodual hyperbolic functions
sinhd wd = ¡sinh(¡w); coshd wd = ¡cosh(¡w); (2:16a)
8
coshd 2d wd ¡d sinhd 2d wd = 1d = ¡1; (2:16b)
the isodual logarithm
logd nd = ¡log(¡n): (2:17)
Particularly important is the isodual exponentiation which can be written
edAd
= Id + Ad=d1!d + Ad £d Ad=d2!d + ::: = ¡eAy ; (2:18)
Other properties of the isodual functional analysis can be easily derived by the interested
reader (see also Refs. (14,21,22).
It is little known that the differential and integral calculi are indeed dependent on the
assumed basic unit. In fact, the lifting of I into Id and of F into Fd implies the isodual
differential calculus, first introduced in Ref. (14), which is characterized by the isodual
differentials
ddxd = dx; (2:19)
with corresponding isodual derivatives
@dfd(xd)=d@dxd = ¡@ ¯ f(¡¯x)=@(¡¯x); (2:20)
and other isodual properties interested readers can easily derive. Note that the differential
is isoselfdual.
2.3: Isodual spaces and geometries. Conventional vector and metric spaces are
defined over a field. It is then evident that the isoduality of fields requires, for consistency,
a corresponding isoduality of vector, metric and all other) spaces.
DEFINITION 2.3: Let S = S(x; g;R) be an N–dimensional metric space with realvalued
local coordinates x = fxkg, k = 1; 2; :::;N, nowhere degenerate, sufficiently
smooth, real–valued and symmetric metric g(x; :::) and related line element x2 = (xt £ g £x)£I = (xi £gij £xj)£I 2 R. The isodual spaces, first introduced in Refs. (11,14),
are vector spaces Sd(xd; gd;Rd) with isodual coordinates xd = ¡xt where t denotes
transposed, isodual metric gd(xd; :::) = ¡gt(¡xt; :::), and isodual line element
(xd)2d
= (x2)d = (¡xt)2d = (xd) £d (gd) £d (xtd) £d Id =
= [(¡xj)(¡£)(¡gji)(¡£)(¡xi)](¡£)(¡I) = ¡x2 2 Rd: (2:21)
The isodual Euclidean space Ed(xd; ±d;Rd) is a particular case of Sd when gd
ij = ±d
ij : The
isodual distance on Ed is negative definite and it is given by Dd = ¡D, where D is
the conventional (positive-definite) distance on E. The isodual sphere on a 3-dimensional
isodual space Ed is the perfect sphere with negative radius and expression rd2d = [(xd2d
1 +d
x2d
2 +d x2d
3 ]£d Id = ¡r2 2 Rd. The isodual Minkowskian, isodual Riemannian and isodual
symplectic geometries can be defined accordingly (14,15).
2.4: Isodual Lie theory. Lie’s theory in its conventional formulation in mathematics
or physics can only characterize matter at the classical level, thus preventing the study
9
of antimatter via fundamental tools so familiar for matter, such as symmetries and conservation
laws.
To overcome such an unbalance, R. M. Santilli proposed in the isodual Lie theory
in the original proposal of isoduality (11), whose explicit form is left to the interested
reader. We merely indicate that the isoduality of Lie’s theory were proposed also for the
classification of all possible realizations of abstract simple Lie algebras.
From the above rudiments interested readers can construct the rest of the isodual
mathematics, including: isodual topologies, isodual manifolds, etc. Particularly important
for physical applications is the isodual Lie theory (first introduced in Ref. (11) (see
also (14,22)), including isodual universal enveloping associative algebras, isodual Lie algebras,
isodual Lie groups, isodual symmetries, and isodual representation theory, which
we cannot review here for brevity.
The main physical theories characterized by isodual mathematics can be outlined as
follows.
2.5: Isodual Newtonian Mechanics. To resolve the scientific unbalance between
matter and antimatter indicated earlier, the isodual mathematics has first permitted a
Newtonian characterization of antimatter consistent with all available experimental data
(14,22). Then, isodual mathematics has identified a new quantization channel (which is
distinct from conventional symplectic quantization) leading to an operator formulation
which is equivalent to charge conjugation (14,16,21).
We first have the isodual Newton equations
md £d ddvd
ddtd = Fd(td; xd; vd); vd =
ddxd
ddtd : (2:22)
and related formulations known under the name of isodual Newtonian Mechanics.
2.6: Isodual Hamiltonian Mechanics. The direct analytic representation of the above
equations are permitted by the following isodual action functional (14) (for the case when
the Newtonian force F is representable with a potential, see below for nonhamiltonian
interactions)
±dAd(td; xd) = ±d Z d
(pd £d ddxd ¡d Hd £d ddtd) = 0; (2:23)
which characterizes the following the isodual Hamilton equations (14)
ddxd
ddtd =
@dHd
@dpd = pd;
ddpd
ddtd = ¡
@dHd
@dxd ; (2:24)
with corresponding isodual Hamilton-Jacobi equations
@dAd
@dtd +d Hd = 0;
@dAd
@dxdk ¡d pd
k = 0; k = 1; 2; 3: (2:25)
Again, interested readers are encouraged to verify that the above isodual Hamiltonian
Mechanics does indeed represent correctly all classical experimental data on antimatter.
.
10
2.7: Isodual Quantum Mechanics. The isoduality of the naive (or symplectic) quantization
can be expressed via the elementary map (14,16,21,55) based on the isodual
Planck’s constant ¯hs = Id = ¡1

Therefore, isodual mathematics characterizes the novel isodual quantum mechanics,
also known as the isodual branch of hadronic mechanics, which can be expressed on the
isodual Hilbert space Hd with isodual states jÃ &gt;d= ¡ &lt; Ãdj and isodual inner product

The equivalence of the above operator formulation of antimatter with charge conjugation
has been proved in Refs. (16,21).
2.8: Isodual special relativity. The vast scientific literature on special relativity
throughout the 20-th century is silent on the fact that, classically, it can solely represent
matter, under the belief that classical antimatter can be represented via a mere change of
the sign of the charge without an inspection of the various consequential inconsistencies
identified earlier.
To resolve this impasse, R. M. Santilli proposed in Refs. [3] the isodual special relativity
which is based on the isodual topology (14), the isodual Minkowski space (15), the isodual
Poincar´e symmetry (29) and the isodualities of relativistic dynamics and physical laws
(55). The explicit form of these structures can be easily constructed by the interested
reader via the isodual map (2.4).
We only note that that the change of the sign of elementary charges or, more appropriately,
charge conjugation, are anti-homomorphic maps, while isoduality is an antiisomorphic
map. Therefore, according to special relativity antiparticles exist in the same
spacetime of particles, while, according to isodual special relativity, antiparticles exist in
the isodual spacetime which coexists with, yet it is independent from our spacetime.
11
2.9: Origin of the isodual theory in Dirac’s equation. On historical grounds
it should be indicated that the isodual mathematics and related theory of antimatter
originated from an inspection of the celebrated Dirac equation (6). In fact, its basic unit
displays precisely the negative-definite unit for the antiparticle component, namely, the
isodual unit,
°o = i £ Ã I2£2 02£2
02£2 ¡I2£2 ! = i £ Ã I2£2 02£2
02£2 Id
2£2 ! (2:31)
Similarly, by recalling that Pauli’s matrices are Hermitean, the space components
of Dirac’s gamma matrices exhibit precisely the isodual Pauli’s matrices of antimatter
precisely for the antimatter component of the equation,
(°k) = Ã 02£2 ¾2£2
¡¾2£2 02£2 ! = Ã 02£2 ¡¾d
2£2
¡¾2£2 02£2 !: (2:32)
It then follows that Dirac’s gamma matrices have the new symmetry of being isoselfdual
(Definition 2.2)
°¹ = ¡°¹y = °¹d; (2:33)
and, when interpreted via the isosual mathematics, Dirac’s equation directly describes the
Kronecker product of an electron and a positron
f°¹[p¹ ¡ 2 £ A¹)x)=co] + i £ mg £ dÁ(x) =
= [Ã 0 ¡¾kd
¡¾k 0 !£ (pk ¡ e £ Ak=co)¡
¡i £ Ã I 0
0 Id !£ (p4 ¡ e £ A4=co) + i £ m] £ Ã Á(x)
Ád(x) ! = 0: (2:34)
Finally, the true invariance of Dirac’s equation is not that under the Poincar´e symmetry
alone, as popularly believed until now, but rather under the Poincar´e symmetry and its
isodual
STot = P(3:1) £ Pd(3:1): (2:35)
Note the elimination of the controversial ”hole theory” and second quantization, since
the isodual theory of antimatter holds at the classical level,, let alone that in first quantization,
without excluding, of course, its applicability to second quantization. In particular,
as indicated earlier, negative-energy solutions of Dirac’s equations mandated the ”hole
theory” because referred to positive units, thus being unphycical, while the negativeenergy
solutions of Eq. (2.34) are referred in isodual mathematics to negative units, thus
being fully physical.
Note also the elimination of the additional controversy on the ”four-dimensional irreducible
representation of spin 1/2” because, under the proper interpretation, Dirac’s
gamma matrices solely characterize a two-dimensional representation of spin 1/2, as a
Kronecker product of one representation for matter and its isodual for antimatter. Note
12
the need to eliminate second quantization to admit only two-dimensional irreducible representations
of spin 1/2, as mandated by Lie’s theory.
Regrettably, Dirac was unaware of the fact that a negative unit can indeed be the
correct unit of an appropriate mathematics and, as a consequence, he developed the ”hole
theory” restricting the treatment of antiparticles to the sole level of second quantization.
It is an easy prediction that, in the event the isodual numbers had been discovered prior
at the beginning of the 20-th century (rather than in 1985 (11)), Dirac would never have
proposed his ”hole theory.
2.10: Experimental verifications and applications. It is easy to see that the isodual
theory represents correctly all available classical experimental evidence on antimatter. For
instance, the Coulomb laws for matter with charge q and antimatter with charge qd at
mutual distance r are given by
FMatterObserver = q £ qd=r2; FAntimatterObserver = qd £d q=drd2; (2:30a)
FMatterObserver = q £ q=r2; FAntimatterObserver = qd £d qd=drd2; (2:30b)
and they correctly represent mutual attraction (mutual repulsion) for matter-antimatter,
(matter-matter and antimatter-antimatter) for both matter and antimatter observers,
where F is attractive when having negative value for a matter observer on R, as conventional,
and a positive value for an antimatter observer on Rd, the opposite occurring for
attraction. For additional details, interested reader can inspect Ref. (22).
The equivalence of the isoduality on Hilbert spaces with charge conjugation proved in
Refs. (16,21) establishes that the isodual theory of antimatter with available experimental
data at the operator level too.
Despite its simplicity, the physical, astrophysical and cosmological implications of
isodual mathematics are rather deep. To begin, the isodual map (2.4) implies the change
of the sign not only of the charge, but also of all other physical quantities of matter,
including mass, energy, time, etc. For instance, the energy eigenvalue E of Eqs. (2.9)
has negative values since it is positive in Eq. (2.9), yet computed on Rd. Note that the
measurement of physical quantities with respect to negative definite units resolves the
traditional inconsistencies for negative mass and energy.
In particular, the isodual theory of antimatter recovers the old hypothesis that antiparticles
move backward in time (since they have a negative-definite time) by resolving
the inherent violation of causality which lead to its abandonment in the second half of
the 20-th century. In fact, motion backward in time measured with respect to a negative
unit of time is as causal as the conventional motion forward in time referred to a positive
unit of time.
Most importantly, the isodual theory of antimatter mandates the existence of antigravity
defined as a gravitational repulsion experienced by antimatter in the field of matter and
vice-versa (16,21,22), while resolving the historical objections against antigravity. As an
illustration, the creation of an electron-positron pair is represented by an isoselfdual state
on H£Hd over C£Cd, whose eigenvalues can only be defined over the field of the observer
13
(that is, R for a matte observer and Rd for an antimatter observer), as studied in detail in
Refs. (21,60). Such an occurrence prevents configurations of correlated electron-positron
systems which, for the case of antigravity without the isodual mathematics, could violate
the principle of conservation of the energy (e.g., by obtained blueshifts without applied
force). Other objections against antigravity for antimatter-matter systems are resolved
in similar ways.
J. P. Mills has shown in Ref. (160) that the experimental verification of antigravity
proposed in Ref. (17) can be conducted in a resolutory form with available technology.
The proposed experiment essentially consists of a horizontal vacuum tube of about one
meter in diameter and ten meters in length with internal collimators at one end and
a scintillator at the other end. The release of photons through the collimators would
establish on the scintillator the point of no gravity; the release of electrons would show
at the scintillator a downward shift due to gravity ; and the release of positrons would
show an upward or downward shift on the scintillator depending on whether they are
experiencing antigravity or gravity, respectively. The experiment would be resolutory
because, when the electrons and positrons have very small energy (of the order of electron
Volts), the downward or upward shift of their impact on the scintillator would be visible
to the naked eye. This low energy experiment has been ignored by experimentalists in
favor of other high energy experiments due to the inconsistencies of the prediction of
antigravity when treated with conventional mathematics. It is hoped that, in view of the
resolution of these inconsistencies thanks to isodual mathematics, experimentalists will
reconsider their view and conduct indeed such a fundamental experiment.
Above all, isodual mathematics has fulfilled the primary scope for which it was constructed,
the initiation of quantitative classical studies as to whether far away galaxies and
quasars are made-up of matter or of antimatter. In fact, isodual mathematics predicts
that antimatter emits a new photon, called the isodual ;photon (21), which has experimentally
detectable characteristics different than those of the ordinary photon emitted by
matter, e.g., the isodual photon is repelled by the gravitational field of our Earth, and
has a parity different than that of the ordinary photon. The experimental resolution on
Earth whether light from a far away galaxy or quasar is made up of photons or of isodual
photons would then resolve the open cosmological problem whether the universe is only
made up of matter, or antimatter galaxies and quasars are equally present.
An important application of the isodual theory of antimatter has been developed by
J. Dunning Davies (161) who has constructed the first (and only) known thermodynamics
for antimatter stars. In this way, quantitative cosmological studies on the antimatter
component of the universe are already under way.
3. CONSTRUCTION OF ISOMECHANICS FROM NONLOCAL,
NONLINEAR AND NONPOTENTIAL INTERACTIONS
3.1: The scientific unbalance caused by nonlocal interactions. Another large
scientific unbalance of the 20-th century has been the adaptation of nonlocal-integral systems
to the pre-existing mathematics which is notoriously local-differential.This approach
14
has created serious limitations and controversies which have remained unsolved despite
attempts conducted over three quarter of a century, such as:
(1) the lack of numerically exact representations of chemical valence bonds in molecular
structures;
(2) the historical inability to achieve an exact representation of nuclear magnetic
moments;
(3) the absence of an exact representation of the Bose-Einstein correlation without ad
hoc free parameters to fit data; and other unresolved problems.
In all these cases we have the mutual overlapping/penetration of particles and/or
their wavepackets at distances of the order of 10¡13cm, which conditions are strictly
nonlocal-integral and, as such, they are beyond the exact applicability of the mathematical
structure, let alone physical laws of quantum mechanics.
It is appropriate here to recall that quantum mechanics and its underlying mathematics
permitted a numerically exact representation of all experimental data of the Hydrogen
atom. By contrast, the same mathematics and quantum laws have not permitted an
equally exact representation of the experimental data of the Hydrogen molecule, since a
historical 2% of molecular binding energy has been missed for about one century under the
rigorous applicability of quantum axioms (thus excluding screenings of the Coulomb law
which imply noncanonical/nonunitary transforms, thus exiting the class of equivalence of
the original theory).
Since the sole difference between one isolated Hydrogen atom and two atoms coupled
into the Hydrogen molecule is given by the electron valence bonds, the above occurrence
illustrates the exact validity of quantum mechanics and related mathematics when the
systems can be effectively appropriate as point particles at sufficiently large mutual distances
(as it is the case for the structure of the Hydrogen atom), while the same theory and
related mathematics have a merely approximate character when systems contain interactions
at short distances (as it is the case for the mutual overlapping of the wavepackets
of valence electrons with antiparallel spins).
The insufficiency is due to the fact that conventional mathematics is local-differential
in its structure, thus solely permitting the representation of valence bonds as occurring
between point particles interacting at a distance. This representation is evidently valid
in first approximation because electrons have indeed a point charge. Nevertheless, such
a local-differential representation is insufficient because of the lack of treatment of the
mutual penetration of the electron wavepackets which cannot be consistently reduced to
a finite set of isolated points.
It is then evident that a more adequate treatment of valence bonds in chemistry, as
well as all nonlocal-integral interactions in general, requires a new mathematics which
is partly local-differential (to represent conventional Coulomb interactions) and partly
nonlocal-integral (to represent the overlapping of the wavepackets). Additional physical
requirements establish that the needed mathematics must be nonlinear in the wavefunction,
thus preventing the use of conventional quantum mechanics because nonlinear
Schroedinger’s equations violate the superposition principle with consequential inapplicability
to composite systems (45,46).
15
Figure 2: An illustration of the second scientific unbalance of the 20-th century, the lack of
adequate mathematics for quantitative studies of nonlocal-integral interactions occurring the
in deep overlappings of the wavepackets of electron valence bonds in molecules, as well as, in
general, all interactions of particles ar short distances.
It should be indicated that numerous ”nonlocal interactions” exist in the physical
literature, but they have generally been adapted to be representable with a local potential
in a Hamiltonian (for theoretical and experimental studies on this type of nonlocality
nonlocality, see, e.g., C. A. C. Dreismann (220-223) and references quoted therein).
The interactions occurring in valence bonds are dramatically more general than the
above inasmuch as they occur in the finite volume of wave overlappings which is not reducible
to a finite number of isolated points and they are of nonpotential type because
of contact, zero-range nature, thus prohibiting a consistent representation with a Hamiltonian,
let alone a potential. More specifically, the granting of a potential energy to the
deep wave-overlappings of valence bonds would be the same as granting potential energy
to the resistive force experienced by an extended object moving within a medium.
All in all, one century of failed attempt to achieve an exact representation of molecular
data establish beyond credible doubts that the nonlocal, nonlinear and nonpotential
interactions occurring in valence bonds are beyond the axiomatic structure of quantum
mechanics, thus demanding nonunitary theories as a necessary condition to exit from the
class of unitary equivalence of quantum mechanics.
3.2: Catastrophic inconsistencies of noncanonical-nonunitary theories. Recall
that a crucial feature of quantum mechanics, which permitted its dominance in physical
applications, is the invariance, namely, the preservation of numerical values, physical laws
and mathematical axioms under the time evolution of the theory. Since all quantum time
16
evolutions are expressible via a Hermitean Hamiltonian, the above feature is essentially
expressed by the invariance of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics under
unitary transforms.
In fact, quantum theories are expressible via a Hermitean Hamiltonian H = p2=2m+
V = Hy defined on a Hilbert space H over the field of complex number C with a unitary
time evolution
U(t) £ jÃ(to) &gt;= jÃ(t) &gt;;U £ Uy = Uy £ U = I; U(t) = ei£H£t; (3:1)
which, as such, leaves invariant all basic units by definition,
I ! I0 = U £ I £ Uy = I; (3:2)
the conventional associative product A £ B between two arbitrary quantities A and B
(numbers, matrices, operators, etc.)
A £ B ! U £ (A £ B) £ Uy = (U £ A £ Uy) £ (U £ B £ Uy) = A0 £ B0; (3:3)
and all numerical predictions. To illustrate this important property, suppose that a given
quantum model; predicts the energy of 5 eV according to the familiar equation
H(to) £ jÃ(to) &gt;= 5eV £ jÃ(to) &gt; : (3:4)
Then the value 5 eV is preserved at all subsequent times in view of the unitary invariance
U(t) £ H(to) £ jÃ(to) &gt;= (U £ H £ Uy) £ (U £ Uy)¡1 £ (U £ jÃ &gt;) =
= H(t) £ jÃ(t) &gt;= U(t) £ (5eV £ jÃ(to) &gt;) = 5eV £ jÃ(t) &gt; : (3:5)
The invariance of physical laws and mathematical axioms then follows.
It is evident that no representation of, the interactions occurring the valence bonds,
and other mutual penetrations of particles at short distances, is physically acceptable
unless it achieves the same invariance enjoyed by quantum mechanics. But the interactions
herein considered are assumed to be non-Hamiltonian, thus beingnonunitary by
conception. The difficulties of the task at hand can then be expressed by the following
THEOREM 3.1 (45,46): All formulations with classical noncanonical and operator
nonunitary time evolutions do not have time-invariant numerical predictions, physical
laws and mathematical axioms when formulated via the mathematics of classical and
quantum Hamiltonian mechanics, thus having no known physical or mathematical value.
To illustrate the above theorem, note that, by assumption, the time evolution needed to
represent nonlocal, nonpotential and nonlinear valence bonds has the nonunitary structure
W(t) £ jÁ(to) &gt;= jÃ(t) &gt;;W £Wy 6= I;W(t) 6= ei£H£t: (3:6)
17
It is then easy to see that, when the nonunitary theory is formulated via the mathematics
of unitary theories, it does not admit time-invariant numerical predictions, thus having
no known physical meaning or value (46).
To illustrate this important occurrence, note that nonunitary time evolutions do not
preserve the basic units by conception,
I ! I0 = W £ I £Wy 6= I; (3:7)
where one should keep in mind that a realization of I is given by the basic units of the
Euclidean space I = Diag:(1cm; 1cm; 1cm) expressed in the usual dimensionless form
I = diag:(1; 1; 1):.
Similarly, nonunitarity transforms do not preserve the conventional associative product,
A £ B ! W £ (A £ B) £Wy = (W £ A £Wy) £ (W £Wy)¡1 £ (W £ B £Wy) =
= A0 £ (W £Wy)¡1 £ B0 6= A0 £ B0: (3:8)
It is then easy to verify the lack of invariance of numerical, predictions. In fact,
suppose that the given nonunitary theory also predicts the energy of 5 eV at the initial
time,
H(to) £ jÃ(to) &gt;= 5eV £ jÃ(to) &gt;; (3:9)
and that 15 seconds later
(W £Wy)t=15sec = 1=3: (3:10)
We then have
W £ H(to) £ jÃ(to) &gt;= (W £ H £Wy) £ (W £Wy)¡1 £ (W £ jÃ &gt;) =
= W(t) £ (5eV £ jÃ(to) &gt;); (3:11)
namely,
H(t) £ jÃ(t) &gt;= (W £Wy) £ (5eV jÃ(t) &gt;) = 15eV £ jÃ(t) &gt; : (3:12)
The lack of preservation in time of numerical predictions then implies consequences today
known as ”catastrophic physical inconsistencies,” such as: the lack of applicability of the
theory to measurements (because of the loss of invariant basic units); Lopez’s Lemma
(172,173) (loss of Hermiticity in time with consequential lack of acceptable observables);
violation of causality and probability laws; etc. (45,46,171-175).
The use of conventional mathematics for broader nonunitary theories leads to equally
serious mathematical problems today known as ”catastrophic mathematical inconsistencies.”
Suppose that a nonunitary theories is formulated at a given initial time to on
a metric space defined over the field of real numbers R with basic unit I. But, by
their very definition, nonunitary time evolutions do not leave invariant the basic unit,
I ! I0 = U £ I £ Uy 6= I. Therefore, nonunitary time evolutions do not admit the
original basic unit I at all times t &gt; to, with consequential loss of the base field R. In turn,
18
the loss of the base field implies the inability to properly define the metric space acting on
it, with consequential catastrophic collapse of the entire mathematical structure. Classical
noncanonical theories are afflicted by similar catastrophic mathematical and physical
inconsistencies (45,46,171-175).
It should be recalled that, when facing non-Hamiltonian systems, a rather general
tendency is that of transforming such systems into a form which is (at least locally)
Hamiltonian via the use of Darboux’s theorem of the symplectic geometry or the Lie-
Koening theorem of analytic mechanics (51). Unfortunately, these transformations cannot
be used for the study of valence bonds because:
(i) the system considered are nonlocal (thus implying the inapplicability a priori of
the topologies needed for the quoted theorems);
(ii) Darboux’s transformations are nonlinear, thus implying the impossibility of placing
measuring apparata in the new Darboux’s coordinates; and
(iii) in view of their nonlinearity, Darboux’s transformations cause the loss of the
inertial character of reference frames with consequential loss of Galileo’s and Einstein’s
relativities.
In view of these shortcomings, the only physically acceptable representations are those
occurring in the fixed coordinates of the observer, called direct representations (51). Only
after such a representation is consistently achieved the transformation theory may have
value.
In summary, the representation of chemical bonds as well as other nonlocal interactions
at short distances requires the abandonment of Hamiltonian theories which, in turn,
implies the necessary use of theories whose time evolution is noncanonical at the classical
level and nonunitary at the operator level. Still in turn, such noncanonical/nonunitary
theories require the necessary construction of a new mathematics capable of resolving the
catastrophic inconsistencies reviewed above.
3.3: Elements of isomathematics. The new mathematics specifically constructed
for quantitative invariant treatment of nonlocal, nonpotential and nonlinear interactions
among extended particles under mutual penetration at short distance is today known
under the name of isomathematics, (where the prefix ”iso” also denotes the preservation
of conventional axioms). Isomathematics was first proposed by R. M. Santilli in
Ref. (23) of 1978 and subsequently studied by several mathematicians, theoreticians and
experimentalists (see Refs. [2,4-11]).
The main idea is that, as indicated earlier, valence bonds include conventional localdifferential
Coulomb interactions, plus nonlocal, nonlinear and nonpotential interactions
due to wave-overlappings. The former interactions can be effectively represented with the
conventional Hamiltonian, while the latter interactions can be represented via a generalization
of the basic unit as a condition to achieve invariance (since the unit is the basic
invariant of any theory).
Therefore, the main assumption of isomathematics is the lifting of the conventional
unit of current formulations, generally given by an N-dimensional unit matrix I = Diag.(1,
1, ..., 1) &gt; 0, into a quantity ˆI, called isounit, which possesses all topological properties
19
of I (such a positive-definiteness, same dimensionality, etc.), while having an arbitrary
functional dependence on coordinates x, velocities v, wavefunctions Ã, their derivatives
@xÃ, and any other needed variable (23,51),
I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1) &gt; 0 ! ˆI(x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) = 1= ˆ T(x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) &gt; 0: (3:13)
The conventional associative and distributive product A£B among generic quantities A,
B (such as numbers, vector fields, operators, etc.) is jointly lifted into the more general
form
A £ B ! Aˆ£B = A £ ˆ T £ B; (3:14)
which remains associative and distributive, thus being called isoproduct, under which the
left and right character of I is preserved, i.e.,
I £ A = A £ I = A ! ˆI ˆ£A = Aˆ£ ˆI = A; (3:15):
for all elements A of the set considered.
An example of isounits (hereon assumed to be multiplicative) representing the interactions
due to wave-overlappings of valence bonds is given by
ˆI = eN(Ã)£R dx£Ãy(x)£Ã(x); (3:16)
and illustrates the desired representation of nonlocal, nonlinear and nonpotential interactions.
Another example of isounits is given by
ˆI = Diag:(n21
; n22
; n23
); (3:17)
and illustrates the representation of the actual, extended, generally nonspherical and
deformable shape of the particle considered, in this case, a spheroidal ellipsoid.
The following is another example of isounit representing a relativistic system of extended,
nonspherical and deformable particles under nonlinear, nonlocal and nonpotential
interactions
ˆITot = ¦k=1;2;:::;nDiag:(n2
k1; n2
k2; n2
k3; n2
k4) £ ¡(x; v; Ã; @Ã; (3:18):::);
where ¡ is a function characterized by the considered nonlinear, nonlocal and nonpotential
interactions, and nk4 represents the density of the medium in the interior of the particle
k with the value nk4 = 1 for the vacuum, or, equivalently, the local speed of light within
physical media c = co=nk4, in which case nk4 is the familiar index of refraction and co is
the speed of light in vacuum.
Numerous additional examples of isounits exist in the literature [4-11]. Note that the
features represented by the isounits are strictly outside any representational capability by
the Hamiltonian.

DEFINITION 3.1: Let F = F(a;+;£) be a field as per Definition 2.1. The isofields,
first introduced in Ref. (23) of 1978 (see Ref. (12) for a mathematical treatment) are
rings ˆ F = ˆ F(ˆa; ˆ+; ˆ£) whose elements are the isonumbers
ˆa = a £ ˆI; (3:19)
with associative, distributive and commutative isosum
ˆa ˆ+

= (a + b) £ ˆI = ˆc 2 ˆ F; (3:20)

ˆa = ˆa; (3:22)
andmultiplicative isounit
ˆI = 1= ˆ T &gt; 0; ˆa ˆ£ ˆI = ˆI ˆ£ˆa = ˆa; 8ˆa; ˆb 2 ˆ F; (3:23)
where ˆI is not necessarily an element of F. Isofields are called of the first (second) kind
when ˆI = 1= ˆ T &gt; 0 is (is not) an element of F.
LEMMA 3.1: Isofields of first and second kind are fields (namely, isofields verify all
axioms of a field with characteristic zero).
The above property establishes the fact (first identified in Ref. (12) that, by no means,
the axioms of a field require that the multiplicative unit be the trivial unit +1, because it
can be a negative-definite quantity as for the isodual mathematics, as well as an arbitrary
positive-definite quantity, such as a matrix or an integrodifferential operator.
Needless to say, the liftings of the unit and of the product imply a corresponding lifting
of all conventional operations of a field. In fact, we have the isopowers
ˆaˆn = ˆa ˆ£ˆa ˆ£:::; ˆ£ˆa(ntimes) = an £ ˆI; (3:24)
with particular case
ˆI ˆn = ˆI; (3:25)
the isosquare root
ˆa

the isoquotient
ˆaˆ=
ˆb

the isonorm
ˆj
ˆaˆj = jaj £ ˆI; (3:28)
21
where jaj is the conventional norm; etc.
Despite their simplicity, the above liftings imply a complete generalization of the
conventional number theory particularly for the case of the first kind (in which ˆI 2 F)
with implications for all aspects of the theory. As an illustration, the use of the isounit
ˆI = 1=3 implies that ”2 multiplied by 3” = 18, while 4 becomes a prime number.
An important contribution has been made by E. Trell (143) who has achieved a proof
of Fermat’s Last Theorem via the use of isonumbers, thus achieving a proof which is
sufficiently simple to be of Fermat’s time. A comprehensive study of Santilli’s isonumber
theory of both first and second kind has been conducted by C.-X. Jiang in monograph (68)
with numerous novel; developments and applications. Additional studies on isonumbers
have been done by N. Kamiya et al. (156) and others (see mathematical papers (10) and
proceedings (8)).
The lifting of fields into isofields implies a corresponding lifting of functional analysis
into a form known as isofunctional analysis studied by J. V. Kadeisvili (132-133), A. K.
Aringazin et al. (144) and other authors. A review of isofunctional analysis up to 1995
with various developments has been provided by R. M. Santilli in monographs (54,55).
We here merely recall the isofunctions
ˆ f(ˆx) = f(x £ I) £ ˆI; (3:29)

The conventional differential calculus must also be lifted, for consistency, into the
isodifferential calculus first identified by R. M. Santilli in memoir (14) of 1996, with
isodifferential
ˆ dˆx = ˆ T £ dˆx = ˆ T £ d(x £ ˆI); (3:32)
which, for the case when ˆI does not depend on x, reduces to
ˆ dˆx = dx; (3:33)
the isoderivatives
ˆ@ ˆ f(ˆx)= ˆ@ˆx = ˆI £ [@f(ˆx)=@ˆx]; (3:34)
and other similar properties. The indicated invariance of the differential under isotopy,
ˆ dˆx = dx, illustrates the reason why the isodifferential calculus has remained undetected
since Newton’s and Leibnitz’s times.
3.4: Isotopologies, isospaces and isogeometries. Particularly important for these
notes is the isotopy of the Euclidean topology independently identified by G. T. Tsagas
and D. S. Sourlas (139) and R. M. Santilli (14), as well as the isotopies of the Euclidean,
22
Minkowskian, Riemannian and symplectic geometries, first identified by Santilli in various
works (see Refs. (14,15,29,54,55) and references quoted therein). We cannot possibly
review here these advances for brevity.
We merely mention that any given n-dimensional metric or pseudometric space S(x; m;R)
with basic unit I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1), local coordinates x = (xi); i = 1; 2; ::; n; n £ n-
dimensional metric m and invariant x2 = xi £ mij £ xj 2 R is lifted into the isospaces
ˆ S(ˆx; ˆ m; ˆR) with isocoordinates, isometric and isoinvariant respectively given by
I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1) ! ˆIn£n(x; v; :::) = 1= ˆ T(x; v; :::); (3:35a)
x ! ˆx = x £ ˆI;m ! ˆm = ˆ T(x; v; :::) m; (3:35b)
x2 = xi £ mij £ xj £ I 2 R ! ˆxˆ2 = ˆxi ˆ£ ˆmij ˆ£ ˆxj £ ˆI =
= fxi £ [ ˆ T(x; v; :::) £ m] £ xjg £ ˆI 2 ˆR: (3:35c)
where one should note that ˆm is an isomatrix, namely, a matrix whose elements are
isonumbers (thus being multiplied by ˆI to be in ˆR) and all operation are isotopic (in this
way the calculation of the value of an isodeterminant cancels out all multiplications by ˆI
except the last, thus correctly producing an isonumber).
An inspection of the functional dependence of the isometric ˆm = ˆ T(x; v; :::) £m then
reveals that isospaces ˆ S(ˆx; ˆmˆR) unify all possible spaces with the same dimension and
signature. As an illustration, the isotopy of the 3-dimensional Euyccldiean space includes
as particular case the 3-dimensional Riemannian, Finslerian as well as any other space
with the same dimension and signature (+;+; +) (in view of the positive-definiteness of
ˆI. Broader unifications are possible in the event such positive-definiteness is relaxed.
Since the isotopies preserve the original axioms, the unification of the Euclidean and
Riemannian geometry implies the reduction of Riemannian geometry to Euclidean axioms
on isospaces over isofields. In turn, such a geometric unification has far reaching
implications, e.g., for relativities, grand unifications and cosmologies (see later on).
It should be mentioned that ”deformations” of conventional geometries are rather fashionable
these days in the physical and mathematical literature. However, these deformations
are generally afflicted by the catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1 because,
when the original geometry is canonical, the deformed geometry is noncanonical, thus
losing the invariance needed for consistent applications. The isotopies of conventional
geometries were constructed precisely to avoid such inconsistencies by reconstructing invariance
on isospaces over isofield while having a fully noncanonical structure, as shown
below.
Therefore, for ”deformations” the generalized metric ˆm = ˆ T £m and related invariant
are referred to conventional units and fields R, while for ”isotopies” the same generalized
metric ˆm = ˆ T £ m is referred to a isounit which is the inverse of the deformation of the
metric, ˆI = ˆ T¡1. While the deformed geometry verify axioms different then the original
ones, the lifting of the original metric m by the matrix ˆ T while the basic unit is lifted
by the inverse amount implies the preservation of the original axioms, with consequential
unifications of different geometries.
23
Particularly intriguing are the isotopies of the symplectic geometry, known as isosymplectic
geometry (14) which are based on the following fundamental isosymplectic twoisoform
ˆ dˆpˆ^ ˆ dˆr = ˆ! = dp ^ dr = !; (3:36)
due to the fact that, for certain geometric reasons, the isounit of the variable p in the
cotangent bundle (phase space) is the inverse that of x (i.e., when ˆI = 1= ˆ T is the isounit
for x, that for p is ˆ T = 1=ˆI). The invariance ˆ! = ! provide a reason why the isotopies
of the symplectic geometry have escaped identification by mathematicians for over one
century.
Despite their simplicity, the isotopies of the symplectic geometry have vast implications,
e.g., a broader quantization leading to a structural generalization of quantum
mechanics known as hadronic mechanics, as outlined below.
3.5: Lie-Santilli isotheory and its isodual. As well known, Lie’s theory (4) is based
on the conventional (left and right) unit I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1) of the universal enveloping
associative algebra. The lifting I ! ˆI(x; :::) implies the lifting of the entire Lie theory,
first proposed by R. M. Santilli in Ref. (23) of 1978 and then studied in numerous works
(see, e.g., memoir (14) and monographs (51,54,55)). The isotopies of Lie’s theory are
today known as the Lie-Santilli isotheory following studies by numerous mathematicians
and physicists (see the monographs by D. S. Sourlas and Gr. Tsagas (64), J. V. Kadeisvili
(66), R. M. Falcon Ganfornina and J. Nunez Valdez (67), proceedings [8] and contributions
quoted therein).
Let »(L) be the universal enveloping associative algebra of an N-dimensional Lie algebra
L with (Hermitean) generators X = (Xi), i = 1, 2, ..., n, and corresponding Lie
transformation group G over the reals R. The Lie-Santilli isotheory is characterized by:
(I) The universal enveloping isoassociative algebra ˆ» with infinite-dimensional basis
characterizing the Poincar´e-Birkhoff-Witt-Santilli isotheorem

where the ”hat” on the generators denotes their formulation on isospaces over isofields;

where ˆ w 2 ˆR are the isoparameters; the isorepresentation theory; etc.
The non-triviality of the above liftings is expressed by the appearance of the isotopic
element ˆ T(x; :::) at all levels (I), (II) and (III) of the isotheory. The arbitrary functional
dependence of ˆ T(x; :::) then implies the achievement of the desired main features of the
isotheory which can be expressed by the following:
24
LEMMA 3.2 (14): Lie-Santilli isoalgebras on conventional spaces over conventional
fields are generally nonlocal, nonlinear and noncanonical, but they verify locality, linearity
and canonicity when formulated on isospaces over isofields.
To illustrate the Lie-Santilli isotheory in the operator case, consider the eigenvalue
equation on H over C, H(x; p; Ã; :::) £ jÃ &gt;= E £ jÃ &gt;. This equation is nonlinear in
the wavefunction, thus violating the superposition principle and preventing the study of
composite nonlinear systems, as indicated earlier. However, under the factorization
H(x; p; Ã; :::) = H0(x; p) £ ˆ T(x; p; Ã; :::); (3:40)
the above equation can be reformulated identically in the isotopic form
H(x; p; Ã; :::) £ jÃ &gt;= H0(x; p) £ ˆ T(x; p; Ã; :::) £ jÃ &gt;= H0 ˆ £jÃ &gt;= E £ jÃ &gt;= ˆE ˆ £jÃ &gt;;
(3:41)
whose reconstruction of linearity on isospaces over isofields (called isolinearity (14)) is
evident and so is the verification of the isosuperposition principle with resulting applicability
of isolinear theories for the study of composite nonlinear systems. Similar results
occur for the reconstruction on isospace over isofields of locality (called isolocality) and
canonicity (called isocanonicity).
A main role of the isotheory is then expressed by the following property:
LEMMA 3.3 (29): Under the condition that ˆI is positive-definite, isotopic algebras
and groups are locally isomorphic to the conventional algebras and groups, respectively.
Stated in different terms, the Lie-Santilli isotheory was not constructed to characterize
new Lie algebras, because all Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero are known. On
the contrary, the Lie-Santilli isotheory has been built to characterize new realizations of
known Lie algebras generally of nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical character as needed
for a deeper representation of valence bonds or, more generally, systems with nonlinear,
nonlocal and noncanonical interactions.
The mathematical implications of the Lie-Santilli isotheory are significant. For instance,
Gr. Tsagas (142) has shown that all simple non-exceptional Lie algebras of dimension
N can be unified into one single Lie-Santilli isotope of the same dimension, while
studies for the inclusion of exceptional algebras in this grand unification of Lie theory are
under way In fact, the characterization of different simple Lie algebras, including the
transition from compact to noncompact Lie algebras, can be characterized by different
realizations of the isounit while using a unique form of generators and of structure constants
(see the first examples for the SO(3) algebra in Ref. (23) of 1978 and numerous
others in the quoted literature).
The physical implications of the Lie-Santilli isotheory are equally significant. We
here mention the reconstruction as exact at the isotopic level of Lie symmetries when
believed to be broken under conventional treatment. In fact, R. M. Santilli has proved:
the exact reconstruction of the rotational symmetry for all ellipsoidical deformations of
25
the sphere (12); the exact SU(2)-isospin symmetry under electromagnetic interactions
(28,33); the exact Lorentz symmetry under all (sufficiently smooth) signature-preserving
deformations of the Minkowski metric (26); and the exact reconstruction of parity under
weak interactions (55). R. Mignani (180) has studied the exact reconstruction of the SU(3)
symmetry under various symmetry-breaking terms. In all these cases the reconstruction
of the exact symmetry has been achieved by merely embedding all symmetry breaking
terms in the isounit.
The construction of the isodual Lie-Santilli isotheory for antimatter is an instructive
exercise for interested readers.
The main physical theories characterized by isomathematics are given by:
3.6: Iso-Newtonian Mechanics and its isodual. As it is well known, Newton (1)
had to construct the differential calculus as a necessary pre-requisite for the formulation
of his celebrated equations. Today we know that Newton’s equations can only represent
point-particles due to the strictly local-differential character of the underlying Euclidean
topology. The fundamental character of Newtonian Mechanics for all scientific inquiries is
due to the preservation at all subsequent levels of study (such as Hamiltonian mechanics,
quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, etc.) of:
1) The underlying Euclidean topology;
2) The differential calculus; and
3) The notion of point particle.
By keeping in mind Newton’s teaching, the author has dedicated primary efforts to
the isotopic lifting of the conventional differential calculus, topology and geometries (14)
as a necessary pre-requisite for a structural generalization of Newton’s equations into
a form representing extended, nonspherical and deformable particles under action-at-adistance/
potential as well as contact/nonpotential forces.
The need for such a lifting is due to the fact that point particles cannot experience
contact-resistive forces. This feature has lead to subsequent theories, such as Hamiltonian
and quantum mechanics, which solely admit action-at-a-distance/potential forces among
point particles. Such a restriction is indeed valid for a number of systems, such as planetary
systems at the classical level and atomic systems at the operator level, because the
large distances among the constituents permit an effective point–like approximation of
particles.
However, when interactions occur at short distances, as in the case of electron valence
bonds (Figure 2) or the mutual penetration of the wavepackets of particles in general,
the point-like approximation is no longer sufficient and a representation of the actual,
extended, generally nonspherical and deformable shape of particles is a necessary prerequisite
to admit contact nonpotential interactions.
By recalling the fundamental character of Newtonian mechanics for all of sciences, the
achievement of a consistent representation of the contact interactions of valence electron
bonds at the operator level requires the prior achievement of a consistent Newtonian
representation.
To outline the needed isotopies, let us recall that Newtonian mechanics is formulated
26
on the Kronecker product Stot = St£Sx£Sv of the one dimensional space St representing
time t, the tree dimensional Euclidean space Sx of the coordinates x = (xk
®) (where
k = 1; 2; 3 are the Euclidean axes and ® = 1; 2; :::; n represents the number of particles),
and the velocity space Sv; v = dx=dt.
It is generally assumed that all variables t; x; and v are defined on the same field of
real numbers R. However, the unit of time is the scalar I = 1, while the unit of the
Euclidean space is the matrix I = Diag:(1; 1; 1). Therefore, on rigorous grounds, the
representation space of Newtonian mechanics Stot = S1 £ Sx £ Sv must be defined on
the Kronecker product of the corresponding fields Rtot = Rt £ Rx £ Rv with total unit
ITot = 1 £ Diag:(1; 1; 1)x £ Diag:(1; 1; 1)v.
Newtonian systems requested for the isotopies are given by the so-called closed-isolated
non-Hamiltonian systems (51), namely, systems which are closed-isolated from the rest
of the universe, thus verifying all ten Galilean total conservation laws, yet they admit
internal non-Hamiltonian forces due to contact interactions.
A typical illustration is given by the structure of Jupiter which, when considered as
isolated from the rest of the universe, does indeed verify all Galilean conservation laws,
yet its internal structure is clearly non-Hamiltonian due to vortices with varying angular
momentum and similar internal dissipative effects. In essence, contact nonpotential forces
produce internal exchanges of energy, linear and angular momentum but always in such
a manner to verify total conservation laws.
A Newtonian representation of closed-isolated non-Hamiltonian systems of extended
particles is given by(Ref. (51), page 236)

X ®=1;:::;n
x®KFNSA

X ®=1;:::;n

where: SA (NSA) stands for variational selfadjointness (variational nonselfadjointness),
namely, the verification (violation) of the integrability conditions for the existence of
a potential, and conditions (3.9b), (3.9c) and (3.9d) assure the verification of all ten
Galilean conservation laws (for the total energy, linear momentum, angular momentum,
and uniform motion of the center of mass). The restrictions to FNSA verifying the above
conditions is tacitly assumed hereon.
The isotopies of Newtonian mechanics, also called Newton-Santilli isomechanics (63-
68), requires the use of the isotime ˆt = t £ ˆIt with isounit ˆIt = 1= ˆ Tt and related isofield
ˆR
t, the isocoordinates ˆx = (ˆxk
®) = x £ ˆIx; with isounit ˆIx = 1= ˆ Tx and related isofield ˆRx,
and the isospeeds ˆv = (vk®) = v £ ˆIv with isounit ˆIv = 1= ˆ Tv and related isofield ˆRv.
27
IsoNewtonian Mechanics is then formulated on the Kronecker product of isospaces
ˆ STot = ˆ St £ ˆ Sx £ ˆ Sv over the Kronecker product of isofields ˆRt £ ˆRx £ ˆRv. The isospeed
is the given by

namely, the equations are conceived in such a way to formally coincide with the conventional
equations for selfadjoint forces, FSA = ¡@V=@x; while all nonpotential forces are
represented by the isounits or, equivalently, by the isodifferential calculus. Such a conception
is the only one known which permits the representation of extended particles with
contact interactions which is invariant (thus avoiding the catastrophic inconsistencies of
Theorem 3.1) and achieves closure, namely, the verification of all ten Galilean conservation
laws.
An inspection of Eqs. (3.10) is sufficient to see that iso-Newtonian mechanics reconstructs
canonicity on isospace over isofields, thus avoiding Theorem 3.1. Note that this
would not be the case if nonselfadjoint forces appear in the right hand side of Eqs. (3.10)
as in Eqs. (3.9a).
The verification of all Galilean conservation laws is equally established by a visual
inspection of Eqs. (3.10) since their symmetry, the iso-Galilean symmetry with structure
(3.8), is the Galilean symmetry, only formulated on isospace over isofields (53). By recalling
that conservation laws are represented by the generators of the underlying symmetry,
conventional total conservation laws then follow from the fact that the generator of the
conventional Galilean symmetry and its isotopic lifting coincide.

written

which always admit a solution, since they constitute a system of 6n algebraic (rather than
differential) equations in the 6n + 1 unknowns given by ˆIt, and the diagonal ˆIx and ˆIv.
As an illustration, we have the following equations of motion of an extended particle
with the ellipsoidal shape experiencing a resistive force FNSA = ¡° £ v because moving
within a physical medium
m £ a = ¡° £ v (3:49a)
ˆIv = Diag:(n21

) £ e°£t=m: (3:49b)
Interested readers can then construct the representation of any desired NSA forces (see
also memoir (14) for other examples).
Note the natural appearance of the velocity dependence, as typical of resistive forces.
Note also that the representation of the extended character of particles occurs only in
isospace because, when Eqs. (3.10) are projected in the conventional Newtonian space,
all isounits cancel out and the point characterization of particles is recovered. Note
finally the direct universality of the Newton-Santilli isoequations, namely, their capability
of representing all infinitely possible Newton’s equations in the frame of the observer.
As indicated earlier, Eqs. (3.42) can only describe a system of particles. The construction
of the isodual Newton-Santilli isoequations for the treatment of a system of
antiparticles is left to the interested reader.
We finally indicate that the invariance of closed non-Hamiltonian systems (3.42) is
given by the Galilei-Santilli isosymmetry ˆG(3:1) and their isoduals by ˆGd(3:1) (see Refs.
(52,53) for brevity).
3.7: Iso-Hamiltonian Mechanics and its isodual. Eqs. (3.10) admit the analytic
representation in terms of the following isoaction principle (14)

Note the main result permitted by the isodifferential calculus, consisting in the reduction
of an action functional of arbitrary power in the linear momentum (arbitrary order) to
that of first power in p first order. Since the optimal control theory and the calculus of
variation depend on the first order character of the action functional, the above reduction
has important implications, such as the treatment of extended objects moving within
resistive media apparently for the first time via the optimal control theory, since a first
order conventional action is impossible for the systems considered..
Note that when the isounits are constant, isoaction the isoaction coincides with the
conventional action. This illustrates the apparent reason why the isotopies of the action
principle creeped in un-noticed for over one century.

As it was the case for Eqs. (3.10), iso-Hamiltonian mechanics has been conceived
to coincide at the abstract level with the conventional formulation. Nevertheless, the
following main differences occur:
1) Hamiltonian mechanics can only represent point particles while its isotopic covering
can represent the actual, extended, nonspherical and deformable shape of particles via
the simply identification of isounits (3.11c);
2) Hamiltonian mechanics can only represent a rather restricted class of Newtonian
systems, those with potential forces, while its isotopic covering is directly universal for all
possible (sufficiently smooth) SA and NSA Newtonian systems;
3) All NSA forces are represented by the isounits or, equivalently, by the isodifferential
calculus, thus permitting their invariant description, since iso-Hamiltonian mechanics
clearly reconstructs canonicity on isospaces over isofields.
Iso-Hamiltonian mechanics as outline above can only described closed non-Hamiltonian
systems of particles. The construction of its isodual for antiparticles is an instructive exercise
for interested readers.
3.8: Isotopic Branch of nonrelativistic Hadronic Mechanics and its isodual.
The preservation of the form of Newton’s and Hamilton’s equations has far reaching
implications, since it permit a simple lifting of quantization, resulting in a generalization
of quantum mechanics known under the name of isotopic branch of Hadronic Mechanics
(see memoir (31) for a general review), which permits, apparently for the first time, an
axiomatically consistent and invariant representation of extended particles under linear
and nonlinear, local and nonlocal, and potential as well as nonpotential interactions.
Recall that the conventional naive or symplectic quantization A ! ¡i £ ¯h £ LnÃ is
solely applicable for first-order action functionals A(t; x) and, as such, it is not applicable
to the isoaction ˆ A(ˆt; ˆx) = ˆ A(t; x; p; :::) due to its higher order when formulated on conventional
spaces. Nevertheless, it is easy to show that the following naive isoquantization
30
holds (for ˆ¯h replaced by ˆIx)
ˆ A(ˆt; ˆx) ! ¡ˆi
ˆ£
ˆ Tx ˆ£ ˆLn ˆ Ã(ˆt; ˆx); (3:53)
which, when applied to Eqs. (3.12) permits the map here expressed for the case when ˆIx
is a constant (see Ref. (55) for the general case)

A first important property the reader can easily prove is that iso-Hermiticity coincides
with conventional Hermiticity. Consequently, all quantities which are observable
for quantum mechanics remain observable under isotopies. In particular, it is equally
easy to prove that all Hermitean quantities which are conserved for quantum mechanics
remain conserve under isotopies, again, because the symmetries of Schroedinger’ and
iso-Schroedinger’s equations are isomorphic and their generators coincide.
The above results implies the existence of a new notion of bound state of particles as
the operator image of closed non-Hamiltonian systems (3.9), namely, a bound state admitting
internal Hamiltonian as well as nonlinear, nonlocal and nonpotential interactions
while preserving conventional total conservation laws. Note that these are precisely the
characteristics needed for quantitative studies of electron valence bonds, as well as, more
generally, bound states of particles at shot mutual distances.

Another important property of hadronic mechanics is that, in view of the lack of general
commutativity between ˆH and ˆ T, the iso-Schroedinger and iso-Heisenberg’s equations
have a nonunitary time evolution when formulated on conventional Hilbert spaces over
conventional fields,
j ˆ Ã(t) &gt;= (ei£H£ˆ T£t) £ j ˆ Ã(0) &gt;= U(t) £ j ˆ Ã(0) &gt;;U £ Uy 6= I; (3:57)
However, all nonunitary transforms admit an identical reformulation as isounitary transform
on iso-Hilbert spaces,
U £ Uy 6= I; U = ˆU £ ˆ T1=2; (3:58a)
ˆU
ˆ£
ˆU
y = ˆU y ˆ£
ˆU
= ˆI: (3:58b)
The above property is a necessary condition to exit from the class of equivalence of
quantum mechanics, thus illustrating the nontriviality of the lifting.
Yet another property is that nonlinear Schroedinger’s equations cannot represent composite
systems because of the violation of the superposition principle, while hadronic mechanics
resolves this limitation. In fact,, all nonlinear Schroedinger’ s equations can be
identically rewritten in the isotopic form with the embedding of all nonlinear terms in the
isotopic element,
H(x; p; Ã)jÃ &gt;= H0(x; p) £ ˆ T(x; p; Ã); :::) £ jÃ &gt;= E £ jÃ &gt;; (3:59)
under which linearity, and, therefore, the superposition principle, are trivially reconstructed
in isospace over isofields.
The isoexpectation values of an observable ˆ A on ˆH over ˆ C are given by
&lt; ˆ Ãj ˆ£ ˆ Aˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;
&lt; ˆ Ãjˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt; £ ˆI 2 ˆ C: (3:60)
It is easy to prove that the isoexpectation values coincide with the isoeigenvalues, as in the
conventional case. In particular, the isoexpectation value of the isounit recovers Planck’s
unit
&lt; ˆ Ãjˆ£ ˆI ˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;
&lt; ˆ Ãjˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;
= ¯h = 1: (3:61)
Note also the following invariance of Hilbert’s inner product under isotopy (for the
case when the isotopic element does not depend on the integration variable)
&lt; Ãj £ jÃ &gt; £I ´&lt; Ãj £ ˆ T £ jÃ &gt; £ˆI; (3:62)
which invariance explains why the isotopies of Hilbert spaces remained un-discovered since
Hilbert’s time even though they have the important implication of causing a structural
generalization of the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics. Note that, despite
its simplicity, invariance (3.62) required the prior identification of new numbers, those
with arbitrary unit ˆI.
32
The latter properties establish that the isotopic branch of hadronic mechanics coincides
with quantum mechanics at the abstract, realization-free level. This feature is important
to assure the axiomatic consistency of hadronic mechanics, as well as to clarify the fact
that hadronic mechanics is not a new theory, but merely a novel realization of the abstract
axioms of quantum mechanics.
The isodual isotopic branch of hadronic mechanics for the treatment of antimatter
is given by the image of the theory under map (2.4) and its outline is here omitted for
brevity.
For additional intriguing features of hadronic mechanics, interested readers can inspect
memoir (31) and monograph (55).
3.9: Invariance of isotopic theories. The invariance of the basic axioms and numerical
predictions pf isotopic theories under time as well as other transforms was first achieved
in Refs. (14,31). It can be proved on isospaces over isofields by reformulating any given,
nonunitary transform in the isounitary form,
W £Wy = ˆI;W = ˆW £ ˆ T1=2;W £Wy = ˆW
ˆ£
ˆW
y = ˆW y ˆ£
ˆW
= ˆI; (3:63)
and then showing that the basic isoaxioms are indeed invariant, i.e.,
ˆI ! ˆI0 = ˆW
ˆ£
ˆI ˆ£
ˆW
y = ˆI; (3:64a)
ˆ Aˆ£
ˆB
! ˆW
ˆ£
( ˆ Aˆ£

) ˆ£
ˆW
y =

ˆB
0; etc: (3:64b)
The invariance is ensured by the numerically invariant values of the isounit ˆI and of the
isotopic element ˆ T under nonunitary-isounitary transforms, namely,
ˆI ! ˆI0 = ˆI; ˆ T ! ˆ T0 = ˆ T; ˆ£ ! ˆ£0 = ˆ£: (3:65)
The resolution of the catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1 is then consequential.
The achievement of invariant for classical noncanonical formulations is equivalent to
the preceding nonunitary one and its explicit form is left to the interested reader for
brevity.
3.10: Simple construction of isotheories. A simple method has been identified in
Refs. (14,31) for the construction of the entire isomathematics and its physical applications.
It consists in:
(i) representing all conventional interactions with a Hamiltonian H and all nonhamiltonian
interactions and effects with the isounit ˆI;
(ii) identifying the latter interactions with a nonunitary transform
U £ Uy = ˆI 6= I; (3:66)
33
and
(iii) subjecting the totality of conventional mathematical and physical quantities and
all their operations to said nonunitary transform,
I ! ˆI = U £ I £ Uy = 1= ˆ T; a ! ˆa = U £ a £ Uy = a £ ˆI; (3:67a)
a £ b ! U £ (a £ b) £ Uy = (U £ a £ Uy) £ (U £ Uy)¡1 £ (U £ b £ Uy) = ˆa ˆ£ˆb; (3:67b)

It should be indicated that not all Lie-Santilli isoalgebras can be constructed via
nonunitary transforms of conventional Lie algebras. As an illustration, the classification
of all possible isotopic ˆ SU(2) algebras exhibits eigenvalues different then the conventional
ones, while only conventional eigenvalues are admitted under nonunitary transforms (see
Refs. (28,33) for brevity).
3.11: Isorelativity and its isodual. Special relativity is generally presented by contemporary
academia as providing a descriptions of all infinitely possible relativistic systems
existing in the universe. In Section 2 we have shown that special relativity cannot provide
a consistent classical description of point antiparticles moving in vacuum. The content of
this section establishes that special relativity cannot be exactly valid for extended particles
and antiparticles moving within physical media. In the next section we shall show that
special relativity cannot describe irreversible processes for both matter and antimatter.
Finally, in Section 5 we shall show that the complexity of biological systems is immensely
beyond the rather limited descriptive capacity of special relativity.
Particularly misleading is the widespread statement of the ”universal constancy of the
speed of light” because contrary to known experimental evidence that the speed of light
is a a local variable depending on the medium in which it propagates, with well known
expression c = co=n, where co is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the familiar index
of refraction possessing a rather complex functional dependence on frequencies !, the
density of the medium d, and other variables, n = n(!; d; :::).
For the evident intent of salvaging the desired universality of special relativity, speeds
c &lt; co have been interpreted until recently by reducing the propagation of light within a
physical medium to the propagation of photons in vacuum scattering from atom to atom.
However, such a reduction is not evidently applicable to the propagation within physical
media of radio waves with wavelength of the order of one meter. The same reduction
34
also fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of the dependence of the speed on the
frequency, as visible by the naked eye in Newton’s spectral decomposition of light. In
any case, the reduction of light to photons scattering among atoms has been definitely
disproved by the recent experimental evidence of speeds c &gt; co occurring within special
guides or within media of high density (see Ref. (120) and literature quoted therein).
An illustration of the inapplicability (and not of the ”violation”) of special relativity
within physical media is given by the propagation of light and particles in water, where
the speed of light is of the order of c = 2£co=3 while electrons can propagate with speeds
bigger than c, resulting in the emission of the Cerenkov light. If the local speed of light c
is assumed as the universal invariant, then the propagation of electrons at speeds v &gt; c is
a violation of the principle of causality. If the speed of light in vacuum co is assumed as
the universal invariant in water, there is the violation of the relativistic law of addition
of two speeds of light c because it does not yield the local speed of light c, and there is
the violation of other basic axioms of special relativity (see monograph (55) for additional
problematic aspects).
It should be also indicated that, when applied to the propagation of light and particles
within physical media, special relativity activates the catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem
3.1. This is due to the fact that the transition from the speed of light in vacuum to
that within physical media requires a noncanonical or nonunitary transform. This point
can be best illustrated by using the metric originally proposed by Minkowski, which can
be written ´ = Diag:(1; 1; 1;¡c2
o ). Then, the transition from co to c = co=n in the metric
can only be achieved via a noncanonical or nonunitary transform
´ = Diag:(1; 1; 1;¡c2
o ) ! ˆ´ = Diag:(1; 1; 1;¡co=n2) = U £ ´ £ Uy; (3:68a)
U £ Uy = Diag:(1; 1; 1; 1=n2) 6= I: (3:68b)
An invariant resolution of the above inconsistencies and limitations has been provided
by the lifting of special relativity into a new formulation today known as isorelativity, or
Lorentz-Poincar´e-Einstein-Santilli isorelativity, where the term ”isorelativity” stands to
indicate that the principle of relativity applies on isospacetime over isofields, and not on
its projection on ordinary spacetime. Also, the additional characterization of ”special”
is redundant because, as review below, isorelativity achieves a geometric unification of
special and general relativities. In this section we outline the isotopies of special relativity,
while the inclusion of classical and quantum gravity is done in Section 3.13.
Isorelativity was first proposed by R. M. Santilli in Ref. (26) of 1983 via the first
invariant formulation of iso-Minkowskian spaces and related iso-Lorentz symmetry. The
studies were then continued in: Ref. (11) of 1985 with the first isotopies of the rotational
symmetry; Ref. (28) of 1993 with the first isotopies of the SU(2)-spin symmetry; Ref. (29)
of 1993) with the first isotopies of the Poincar´e symmetry; and Ref. (33) of 1998 with the
first isotopies of the SU(2)-isospin symmetries, Bell’s inequalities and local realist. The
studies were then completed with memoir (15) of 1998) presenting a comprehensive formulation
of the iso-Minkowskian geometry, including its formulation via the mathematics of
the Riemannian geometry (such iso-Christoffel’s symbols, isocovariant derivatives, etc.).
35
Numerous independent studies on isorelativity are available in the literature (see, e.g.,
Refs. (63-68) and [8-11]), such as: Aringazin’s proof (192) of the direct universality
of the Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry for all infinitely possible spacetimes with
signature (+;+;+;¡); Mignani’s exact representation (118) of the large difference in
cosmological redshifts between quasars and galaxies when physically connected; the exact
representation of the anomalous behavior of the meanlifes of unstable particles with speed
by Cardone et al (110,11); the exact representation of the experimental data on the Bose-
Einstein correlation by Santilli (112) and Cardone and Mignani (113); the invariant and
exact validity of the iso-Minkowskian geometry within the hyperdense medium in the
interior of hadrons by Arestov et al. (120); the first exact representation of molecular
features by Santilli and Shillady (125,126); and numerous others.
Evidently we cannot review isorelativity in the necessary details to avoid a prohibitive
length. Nevertheless, to achieve minimal self-sufficiency of this presentation, it is important
to outline at least its main structural lines.
The central notion of isorelativity is the lifting of the basic unit of the Minkowski space
and of the Poincar´e symmetry, I = Diag:(1; 1; 1; 1), into a 4 £ 4-dimensional, nowhere
singular and positive-definite matrix ˆI = ˆI4£4 with an unrestricted functional dependence
on local spacetime coordinates x, speeds v, frequency !, wavefunction Ã, its derivative
@Ã, etc.,
I = Diag:(1; 1; 1) ! ˆI(x; v; !; Ã; @Ã; :::) = 1= ˆ T(x; v; !; Ã; @Ã; :::) &gt; 0: (3:69)
Isorelativity can then be constructed via the method of Section 3.10, namely, by assuming
that the basic noncanonical or nonunitary transform coincides with the above isounit
(where the diagonalization is permitted by its Hermiticity)
U £ Uy = ˆI = Diag:(g11; g22; g33; g44); g¹¹ = g¹¹(x; v; !; Ã; @Ã; :::) &gt; 0; ¹ = 1; 2; 3; 4;
(3:70)
and then subjecting the totality of quantities and their operation of special relativity to
the above transform.
Let M(x; ´;R) be the Minkowski space with local coordinates x = (x¹), metric
´ = Diag:(1; 1; 1;¡1) and invariant x2 = (x¹ £ ´¹º £ xº
£I 2 R. The fundamental space
of isorelativity is the Minkowski isospace (26,15) and related topology (14), ˆM (ˆx; ˆ´; ˆR)
characterized by the dual lifting of the basic unit (and related field) and the inverse lifting
of the metric as per rules (3.35)
I = Diag:(1; 1; 1; 1) ! U £ I £ Uy = ˆI = 1= ˆ T; (3:71a)
´ = Diag:(1; 1; 1;¡1) £ I ! (Uy¡1 £ ´ £ U¡1) £ ˆI = ˆ´ =
= ˆ T £ ´ = Diag:(g11; g22; g33;¡g44) £ ˆI; (3:71b)
with consequential isotopy of the basic invariant
x2 = (x¹ £ ´¹º £ xº
£I 2 R !
36
! U £ x2 £ Uy = ˆxˆ2 = (ˆx¹ ˆ£ ˆm¹º £ xº
£I 2 R; (3:72)
whose projection in conventional spacetime can be written
ˆxˆ2 = [x¹ £ ˆ´¹º(x; v; !; Ã; @Ã; :::) £ xº
] £ ˆI; (3:73)
The nontriviality of the above lifting is illustrated by the fact that Minkowski-Santilli
isospaces include as particular spaces all possible spacetimes, such as the Riemannian,
Finslerian, non-Desarguesian and any other space with the signature (+;+;+;¡). Moreover,
the iso-Minkowskian metric ˆ´ depends explicitly on the local coordinates. Therefore,
the Minkowski-Santilli isogeometry requires for its formulation the isotopy of all tools of
the Riemannian geometry, such as the iso-Christoffel symbols, isocovariant derivative, etc.
(see for brevity Ref. (15)). Despite that, one should keep in mind that, in view of the
positive-definiteness property (34.79), the Minkowski-Santilli isogeometry coincides at the
abstract level with the conventional Minkowski geometry, thus having a null isocurvature
(because of the basic mechanism of deforming the metric ´ by the amount ˆ T(x; :::) while
deforming the basic unit of the inverse amount ˆI = 1= ˆ T).
It should be also noted that, following the publication in 1983 of Ref. (26), numerous
papers on ”deformed Minkowski spaces” have appeared in the physical and mathematical
literature (generally without a quotation of their origination in Ref. (29)). These
”deformations” are formulated via conventional mathematics and, consequently, they all
suffer of the catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1. By comparison, isospaces are
formulated via isomathematics and, therefore, they resolve the inconsistencies of Theorem
3.1, as shown in Section 3.9. This illustrates the necessity of lifting the basic unit and
related field jointly with any noncanonical lifting of canonical metrics.
Let P(3:1) be the conventional Poincar´e symmetry with the well known ten generators
J¹º; P¹ and related commutation rules. The second basic tool of isorelativity is
the Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry ˆ P(3:1) which can be constructed via the isotheory of
Section 3.5, resulting in the isocommutation rules (26,29)
[J¹ºˆ;J®¯] = i £ (ˆ´º® £ J¯¹ ¡ ˆ´º® £ J¯º ¡ ˆ´nu¯ £ J®¹ + ˆ´¹¯ £ J®º); (3:74a)
[J¹ºˆ;P®] = i £ (ˆ´¹® £ Pº ¡ ˆ´º® £ P¹); [P¹ˆ;P º] = 0; (3:74b)
. where we have followed the general rule of the Lie-Santilli isotheory according to which
isotopies leave observables unchanged (since Hermiticity coincides with iso-Hermiticity)
and merely change the operations among them.
Isorelativistic kinematics is then based on the following two iso-invariants:
Pˆ2 = P¹ ˆ£P¹ = P¹ £ ´¹º £ Pº = Pk £ gkk £ Pk ¡ p4 £ g44 £ P4; (3:75a)
Wˆ2 = W¹ ˆ£W¹;W¹ = ˆ²¹®¯½ ˆ£J®¯ ˆ£P½: (3:75b)
Since ˆI &gt; 0, it is easy to prove Lemma 3.3, namely, that the Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry
is isomorphic to the conventional symmetry. It then follows that the isotopies
37
increase dramatically the arena of applicability of the Poincar´e symmetry, from the sole
Minkowskian spacetime to all infinitely possible spacetimes.
To understand the physical, chemical and biological applications outline in this paper,
the reader should be aware that all ”particles” considered hereon are assumed to
be ”isoparticles”, that is, irreducible isorepresentation of the Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry,
namely, particles are assumed to be extended, generally nonspherical and deformable
under Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian interactions.
Since any interaction imply a renormalization of physical characteristics, it is evident
that the transition form particles to isoparticles, that is. from motion in vacuum to
motion within physical media, implies an alteration (called isorenormalization) of all the
intrinsic characteristics, such as rest energy, magnetic moment, charge, etc. As we shall
see in Section 3.14, such isorenormalization have permitted the first exact numerical
representation of nuclear magnetic moments which had resulted to be impossible for
quantum mechanics despite about 75 years of attempts.
The explicit form of the Poincar´e-Santilli isotransforms leaving invariant line element
(3.73) are given by:
(1) The isorotations ˆO(3) : ˆx0 = ˆ&lt;(ˆµ) ˆ£ˆx; ˆµ = µ £ ˆIµ 2 ˆRµ (11) which, for isorotations
in the (1, 2) isoplane, are given by
x10 = x1 £ cos[µ £ (g11 £ g22)1=2] ¡ x2 £ g22 £ g¡1
11 £ sin[µ £ (g11 £ g22)1=2]; (3:76a)
x20 = x1 £ g11 £ g¡1
22 £ sin[µ £ (g11 £ g22)1=2] + x2 £ cos[µ £ (g11 £ g22)1=2]: (3:76b)
For the general expression in three dimensions interested reader can inspect Ref. (55) for
brevity.
Note that, since ˆO (3) is isomorphic to O(3), Ref. (11) proved that, contrary to a
popular belief throughout the 20-th century, the rotational symmetry remains exact for
all possible signature-preserving (+,+,+) deformations of the sphere, of course, when
treated with the appropriate mathematics.
The above reconstruction of the exact rotational symmetry can be geometrically visualized
by the fact that all possible signature-preserving deformations of the sphere are
perfect spheres in isospace called isosphere. This is due to the fact that ellipsoidical deformations
of the semiaxes 1k ! 1=n2
k are compensated on isospaces over isofields by the
inverse deformation of the related unit 1k ! n2
k. Therefore, by recalling structure (3.35)
of the isoinvariant, on iso-Euclidean space we have the perfect isosphere ˆrˆ2 = ˆr2
1 + ˆr2
2 + ˆr2
3
with exact ˆO(3) symmetry while its projection on the conventional Euclidean space is the
ellipsoid r2
1=n21
+ r2
2=n22
+ r2
3=n23
with broken O(3) symmetry.
(2) The Lorentz-Santilli isotransforms ˆO(3:1) : ˆx0 = ˆ¤(ˆv; :::) ˆ£ ˆx; ˆv = v £ ˆIv 2 ˆRv
(26,29) which, for the case of isorotation in the (3; 4) isoplane, can be written
x10 = x1; (3:77a)

For the general expression interested readers can inspect Ref. (55).
Ref. (26) proved that, contrary to another popular belief throughout the 20-th century,
the Lorentz symmetry remains exact for all possible signature preserving (+,+,+,1)
deformations of the Minkowski space, of course, when treated with the appropriate mathematics.
The above exact reconstruction of the Lorentz symmetry can be geometrically visualized
by noting that the light cone x23
¡ c2
o £ t2 = 0 can only be formulated in vacuum
while within physical media we have the generic hyperboloid r2
3 ¡ c2
o £ t2=n2(!; :::) = 0.
However, it is an instructive exercise for interested readers to prove that the isolight cone
(that is, the light cone on isospace over isofields) is the perfect cone ˆr2
3 ¡ c2
o £ ˆt = 0
with the exact symmetry ˆO(3:1) while its projection on conventional space is given by
r2
3 ¡ c2
o £ t2=n2(!; :::) = 0 with broken Lorentz symmetry.
(3) The isotranslations ˆ T (4) : ˆx0 = ˆ T (ˆa; :::)ˆ] £ x = ˆx + ˆ A(ˆa; x; :::); ˆa = a £ ˆIa 2 ˆRa
which can be written
x¹0 = x¹ + A¹(a; :::); (3:78a)
A¹ = a¹(g¹¹ + a® £ [g;i¹ˆ;P®]=1! + :::); (3:78b)
where there is no summation on the ¹ indices.
Note that the isotranslations are highly nonlinear (thus non-inertial) in conventional
spacetime although they are isolinear (thus inertial) in isospace. This illustrates the reason
why conventional notion of relativity are solely applicable in spacetime, thus illustrating
the reason of the name ”isorelativity.”
(4) The novel isotopic invariance ˆI : ˆx0 = ˆ wˆ£ ˆx = w £ ˆx; ˆI0 = w £ ˆI, where w is a
constant (29),
ˆI ! ˆI0 = ˆ wˆ£ ˆI = w £ ˆI = 1= ˆ T0; (3:79a)
ˆxˆ2 = (x¹ £ ˆ´¹º £ xº
) £ ˆI ´ ˆx0ˆ2 = [x¹ £ (w¡1 £ ˆ´¹º) £ xº
] £ (w £ ˆI); (3:79b)
Therefore, the Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry can be written
ˆ P(3:1) = ˆO (3:1) ˆ£ ˆ T (4) ˆ£ ˆI (3:80)
thus having eleven (rather than ten) dimensions with parameters µk; vk; a¹;w; k = 1; 2; 3; ¹ =
1; 2; 3; 4; the 11-th dimension being characterized by invariant (3.78). Note that, contrary
39
to popular beliefs, the conventional Poincar´e symmetry is also eleven dimensional since
invariance (3.78) also holds for conventional spacetime.
The simplest possible realization of the above formalism for isorelativistic kinematics
can be outlined as follows (see Section 3.13 for the isogravitational realization). The
first application of isorelativity is that of providing an invariant description of locally
varying speeds of light propagating within physical media. For this purpose a realization of
isorelativity requires the knowledge of the density of the medium in which motion occurs.
The simplest possible realization of the fourth component of the isometric is then given
by the function g44 = n24
(x; !; :::) normalized to the value n4 = 1 for the vacuum (note
that the density of the medium in which motion occur cannot be described by special
relativity). Representation (3.68) then follows with invariance under ˆ P(3:1).
In this case the quantities nk; k = 1; 2; 3; represent the inhomogeneity and anisotropy
of the medium considered. For instance, if the medium is homogeneous and isotropic
(such as water), all metric elements coincide, in which case
ˆI = Diag:(g11; g22; g33; g44) = n24
£ Diag:(1; 1; 1; 1); (3:81a)
ˆxˆ2 =
x2
n24
£ n24
£ I ´ x2; (3:81b):
thus confirming that isotopies are hidden in Minkowskian axioms, and this may be a
reason why they have nog been discovered until recently.
Next, isorelativity has been constricted for the invariant description of systems of extended,
nonspherical and deformable particles under Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian
interactions. Practical applications then require the knowledge of the actual shape of
the particles considered, here assumed for simplicity as being spheroidal ellipsoids with
semiaxes n21
; n22
; n23
. Note that them minimum number of constituents of a closed non-
Hamiltonian system is two. In this case we have shapes represented with n®k; ® =
1; 2; ; :::; n. Applications finally require the identification of the nonlocal interactions,
e.g., whether occurring on an extended surface or volume. As an illustration, two spinning
particles denoted 1 and 2 in condition of deep mutual penetration and overlapping of
their wavepackets (as it is the case for valence bonds), can be described by the following

where N is a constant. Note the nonlinearity in the wavefunctions, the nonlocal-integral
character and the lack of representation of all the above features via a Hamiltonian.
From the above examples interested readers can then represent any other closed non-
Hamiltonian systems.

The third important part of isorelativity is given by the following isotopies of conventional
relativistic axioms which, for the case of motion along the third axis, can be
written (29):
ISOAXIOM I. The projection in our spacetime of the maximal causal invariant speed
is given by:
VMax = co £
g1=2
44
g1=2
33
= co
n3
n4
=
c
n3
: (3:83)
This isoaxioms resolves the inconsistencies of special relativity recalled earlier for particles
and electromagnetic waves propagating in water. In fact, water is homogeneous and
isotropic, thus requiring that g44 = g33 = 1=n2, where n is the index of refraction. In this
case the maximal causal speed for a massive particle is co as experimentally established,
e.g., for electrons, while the local speed of electromagnetic waves is c = co=n., as also
experimentally established.
Note that such a resolution requires the abandonment of the speed of light as the
maximal causal speed for motion within physical media, and its replacement with the
maximal causal speed of particles. It happens that in vacuum these two maximal causal
speeds coincide. However, even in vacuum the correct maximal causal speed remains that
of particles and not that of light, as generally believed. At any rate, physical media are
generally opaque to light but generally not to particles. Therefore, the assumption as
the maximal causal speed as that of light which cannot propagate within the medium
considered would be evidently vacuous.
It is an instructive exercise for the interested readers to prove that the maximal causal
speed of particles on isominkowski space over an isofield remains co.
ISOAXIOM II. The projection in our spacetime of the isorelativistic addition of speeds
within physical media is given by:
vTot =
v1 + v2
1 + v1£g33£v2
co£g44£co
=
v1 + v2
1 + v1£n24
£v2
co£n23
£co
(3:84)
We have again the correct occurrence that the sum of two maximal causal speeds in water,
Vmax = co£(n3=n4), yields the maximal causal speed in water, as the reader is encouraged
to verify. Note that the such a result is impossible for special relativity. Note also that
the isorelativistic sum of two speeds of lights in water, c = co=n, does not yield the speed
of light in water, thus confirming that the speed of light within physical media, assuming
that they are transparent to light, is not the fundamental maximal causal speed.
ISOAXIOM III. The projection in our spacetime of the isorelativistic laws of dilation
of time to and contraction of length `o and the variation of mass mo with speed are given
by:
t = ˆ° £ to; ` = ˆ°¡1 £ `o;m = ˆ° £ mo: (3:85)
41
Note that in water these values coincide with the relativistic one as it should be since
particles such as the electrons have in water the maximal causal speed c0. Note again the
necessity of avoiding the interpretation of the local speed of light as the maximal local
causal speed. Note that the mass diverges at the maximal local causal speed, but not at
the local speed of light..
ISOAXIOM IV. The projection in our spacetime of the iso-Doppler law is given by
(for 90o angle of aberration):
! = ˆ° £ !o: (3:86)
This isorelativistic axioms permits an exact, numerical and invariant representation of the
large differences in cosmological redshifts between quasars and galaxies when physically
connected. In this case light simply exit the huge quasar chromospheres already redshifted
due to the decrease of the speed of light, rather than the speed of the quasars (118).
Isoaxiom IV also permits a numerical interpretation of the internal blue- and red-shift
of quasars due to the dependence of the local speed of light on its frequency. Finally,
Isoaxiom IV predicts that a component of the predominance toward the red of sunlight
at sunset is of iso-Doppler nature in view of the bigger decrease of the speed of light at
sunset as compared to the same speed at the zenith (evidently because of the travel within
a comparatively denser atmosphere).
ISOAXIOM V. The projection in our spacetime of the isorelativistic law of equivalence
of mass and energy is given by:
E = m £ c2
o £ g44 = m £
c2
o
n24
: (3:87)
Among various applications, Isoaxiom V removes any need for the ”missing mass”
in the universe. This is due to the fact that all isotopic fits of experimental data agree
on values g44 À 1 within the hyperdense media in the interior of hadrons, nuclei and
stars (55,120). As a result, Isoaxiom V yields a value of the total energy of the universe
dramatically bigger than that believed until now under the assumption of the universal
validity of the speed of light in vacuum. For other intriguing applications, e.g., for the rest
energy of hadronic constituents, we refer the interested reader to monographs (55,61).
The isodual isorelativity for the characterization of antimatter can be easily constructed
via the isodual map of Section 2, and its explicit study is left to the interested reader for
brevity.
3.12: Isorelativistic Hadronic Mechanics and its isodual. The isorelativistic extension
of nonrelativistic hadronic mechanics is readily permitted by the Poincar´e-Santilli
isosymmetry. In fact, iso-invariant (3.75a) implies the following iso-Gordon equation on
ˆH
over ˆ C
ˆp¹ ˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;= ¡ˆi
ˆ£
ˆ@¹j ˆ Ã &gt;= ¡i £ ˆIº

ˆc4) ˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;= (ˆ´®¯ £ @® £ @¯ + m2
o £ c4) £ j ˆ Ã &gt;= 0: (3:88b)
42
The linearization of the above second-order isoinvariant into the iso-Dirac equation
has been studied in detail in Ref. (29) as well as by several other authors (although
generally without the use of isomathematics, thus losing the invariance). By recalling
the correct structure (2.34) of Dirac’s equation as the Kronecker product of a spin 1/2
massive particle and its antiparticle, the iso-Dirac’s equation is formulated on the total
isoselfadjoint isospace and related isosymmetry
ˆM
Tot = [ ˆM orb(ˆx; ˆ´; ˆR) £ ˆ Sspin(2)] £ [ ˆM dorb(ˆxd; ˆ´d; ˆRd) £ ˆ Sdspin(2)] = ˆM dT ot; (3:89a)
ˆ STot = ˆ P(3:1) £ ˆ Pd(3:1) = ˆ SdT ot; (3:89b)
and can be written (29)
[ˆ°¹ ˆ£(ˆp¹ ¡ ˆe ˆ£ ˆ A¹) +ˆi
ˆ£
ˆm] ˆ £jÁ(x) &gt;= 0; (3:90a)
ˆ°¹ = g¹¹ £ °¹ £ ˆI (3:90b)
where the °’s are the conventional Dirac matrices. Note the appearance of the isometric
elements directly in the structure of the gamma matrices and their presence also when
the equation is projected in the conventional spacetime.
A realization via the iso-Dirac equation of the Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry with
isocommutators (3.74) is given by (29)
J¹º = (Sk;Lk4); P¹; (3:91a)
Sk = (ˆ²kij ˆ£ˆ°i ˆ£ˆ°j)=2;Lk4 = ˆ°k ˆ£ ˆ°4=2; P¹ = ˆp¹ (3:91b)
The notion of ”isoparticle” can be best illustrated with the above realization because it
implies that,in the transition from motion in vacuum (as particles have been solely detected
and studied until now) to motion within physical media, particles generally experience the
alteration, called ”mutation,” of all intrinsic characteristics, as illustrated by the following
isoeigenvalues which are implied by isocommutation rules (3.74),
ˆ Sˆ2 ˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;=
g11 £ g22 + g22 £ g33 + g33 £ g11
4 £ j ˆ Ã &gt;; (3:92a)
ˆ S3 ˆ £j ˆ Ã &gt;=
(g11 £ g22)1=2
2 £ j ˆ Ã &gt; : (3:92b)
The mutation of spin then implies a necessary mutation of the intrinsic magnetic
moment which is given by (29)
˜¹ = (
g33
g44
)1=2 £ ¹; (3:93)
where ¹ is the conventional magnetic moment for the same particle when in vacuum. The
mutation of the rest energy and of the remaining characteristics has been identified before
via the isoaxioms.
The construction of the isodual isorelativistic hadronic mechanics is left to the interested
reader by keeping in mind that the iso-Dirac equation is isoselfdual as the conventional
equation.
43
To properly understand the above results, one should keep in mind that the mutation
of the intrinsic characteristics of particles is solely referred to the constituents of a
hadronic bound state under condition of mutual penetration of their wavepackets (such as
one hadronic constituent) under the condition of recovering conventional characteristics
for the hadronic bound state as a whole (the hadron considered), much along the original
Newtonian subsidiary constrains on non-Hamiltonian forces, Eqs. (3.42b)-(3.42d).
The reader should also keep in mind that, at this kinematical level prior to the introduction
of gravity, g44 = 1=n24
represent the density of the medium in which motion
occurs, normalized to the value g44 = 1; n4 = 1 for the vacuum. Also, the inhomogeneity
of the medium is represented by the functional dependence of its density, e.g., from the
radial distance r and other variables, g44 = g44(r; :::). The anisotropy of the medium is
represented by g33, e.g., for the case of the spheroidal ellipsoid for which g11 = g22 6= g33.
Finally, isotopic invariance (3.79) implies the capability of rescaling the radius of a
sphere. Therefore, for the case of the perfect sphere we can always have g11 = g22 = g33 =
g44 in which case the magnetic moment is not mutated. These results recover conventional
classical knowledge according to which the alteration of the shape of a charged and spinning
body implies the necessary alteration of its magnetic moment.
It should be also stressed that the above mutations violate the unitary condition when
formulated on a conventional Hilbert spaces, with consequential catastrophic inconsistencies.
As an illustration, the violation of causality and probability law has been established
for all eigenvalues of the angular momentum M different than the quantum spectrum
M2 £ jÃ &gt;= `(` + 1) £ jÃ &gt;; ` = 0; 1; 2; 3; ::: . As a matter of fact, these inconsistencies
are the very reason why the mutations of internal characteristics of particles for
bound states at short distances could not be admitted within the framework of quantum
mechanics.
By comparison, hadronic mechanics has been constructed precisely to recover unitarity
on iso-Hilbert spaces over isofields, thus permitting an invariant description of internal
mutations of the characteristics of the constituents of hadronic bound states, while recovering
conventional features for states as a whose.
As we shall indicate at the end of this section, far from being mathematical curiosities,
the above mutations imply basically new structure models of hadrons, nuclei and stars,
with consequential, new clean energies and fuels. These new advances were prohibited by
quantum mechanics precisely because of the preservation of the intrinsic characteristics
of the constituents in the transition from bound states at large mutual distance, for which
no mutation is possible, to the bound state of the same constituents in condition of
mutual penetration, in which case mutations have to be admitted in order to avoid the
replacement of a scientific process with unsubstantiated personal beliefs one way or the
other.
The best illustration of the iso-Dirac equation is, therefore, that for which it was
constructed (30), to describe the transition for the electron in the hydrogen atom, to the
same electron when compressed in the hyperdense medium in the interior of the proton,
namely, to achieve a quantitative and invariant representation of the synthesis of the
neutron according to Rutherford as a ”hydrogen atom compressed in the core of a star.”
44
If special relativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and the conventional Dirac equation
are assumed to be exactly valid also for the motion of the electron within the hyperdense
medium in the interior of the proton, the neutron cannot be a bound state of a
proton and an electron at short distances, thus mandating the assumption of undetectable
constituents which cannot be produced free, as well known.
One of the most important results of hadronic mechanics has been the proof at the
nonrelativistic (214) and relativistic level (30) that a hadronic bound state of an isoprotons
and an isoelectron represents all characteristics of the neutron, including its rest energy,
spin, charge, parity, charge radius, anomalous magnetic moment and spontaneous decay.
The societal implications of the above alternative are such to require the surpassing
of traditional academic interests on pre-established doctrines. In fact, no new energy
is conceivably possible under the assumption of the exact validity within a hadron of
the Minkowski geometry, the special relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics, with
consequential hadronic constituents which cannot be produced free. On the contrary,
the assumption that isorelativity within the hyperdense medium inside hadrons implies
that the hadronic constituents are indeed produced free in the spontaneous decay and,
therefore, they can indeed be stimulated to decay, thus implying basically new energies
(58).
3.13: Isogravitation, iso-grand-unification and isocosmology. There is no doubt
that the classical and operator formulations of gravitation on a curved space has been
the most controversial theory of the 20-th century because of an ever increasing plethora
of problematic aspects which have remained basically unresolved due to the lack of their
acknowledgment, let alone their resolution, by leading research centers in the field (see,
for instance, H. E. Wilhelm (220) and references quoted therein).
One of the reason why special relativity in vacuum has a majestic axiomatic consistence
is its invariance under the poincar´e symmetry. Recent studies have shown that
the formulation of gravitation on a curved space or, equivalently, rathe formulation of
gravitation based on as ”covariance,” is necessarily noncanonical at the classical level
and nonunitary at the operator level, thus suffering of all catastrophic inconsistencies of
Theorem 3.1 (45,46). These catastrophic inconsistencies can only be resolved via a new
conception of gravity based on a universal invariance, rather than covariance.
Additional studies have identified profound axiomatic incompatibilities between gravitation
on a curved space and electroweak interactions. These incompatibilities have resulted
to be responsible for the lack of achievement of an axiomatically consistent grand
unification since Einstein’s times (32,35,37), among which we mention:
1) Electroweak theories are based on invariance while gravitation is not;
2) Electroweak theories are flat in their axioms while gravitation is not; and
3) Electroweak theories are bona fide field theories, thus admitting positive and negative
energy solutions, while gravitation can only admit positive energies.
No knowledge of isotopies can be claimed without a knowledge that isorelativity has
been constructed also to resolve at least some of the controversies on gravitation. The
fundamental requirement is the abandonment of the formulation of gravity on a Rieman-
45
nian space and its formulation instead on an iso-Minkowskian space (15) via the following
basic steps:
I) Factorization of any given Riemannian metric g(x) into a nowhere singular and
positive-definite 4 £ 4 matrix ˆ T(x) times the Minkowski metric ´,
g(x) = ˆ Tgrav(x) £ ´; (3:94)
II) Assumption of the inverse of ˆ Tgrav as the fundamental unit of the theory,
ˆIgrav(x) = 1= ˆ Tgrav(x); (3:95)
III) Submission of the totality of the Minkowski space and relative symmetries to the
noncanonical/nonunitary transform
U(x) £ Iy(x) = ˆIgrav: (3:96)
The above procedure yields the isominkowskian spaces and related geometry ˆM (ˆx; ˆ´; ˆR),
(15), resulting in a new conception of gravitation, called isogravity, with the following main
features (15,32,35,37,55):
i) Isogravity is characterized by a universal symmetry (and not a covariance), the
Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry ˆ P(3:1) for the gravity of matter with isounit ˆIgrav(x) with
the isodual isosymmetry ˆ Pd(3:1) for the gravity of antimatter, and the isodual symmetry
ˆ P(3:1) £ ˆ Pd(3:1) for the gravity of matter-antimatter systems;
ii) All conventional field equations, such as the Einstein-Hilbert and other field equations,
can be identically formulated via the Minkowski-Santilli isogeometry since the latter
preserves all the tools of the conventional Riemannian geometry, such as the Christoffel’s
symbols, covariant derivative, etc. (15);
iii) Isogravitation is isocanonical; at the classical level and isounitarity at the operator
level, thus resolving the catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1;
iv) An axiomatically consistent operator version of gravity always existed and merely
creeped in un-noticed through the 20-th century because gravity is embedded where nobody
looked for, in the unit of relativistic quantum mechanics, and it is given by isorelativistic
hadronic mechanics as in Eqs. (3.88) and (3.90).
v) The basic feature permitting the above advances is the abandonment of curvature for
the characterization of gravity (namely, curvAture characterized by metric g(x) referred
to the unit I) and its replacement with isoflatness, namely, the verification of the axioms
of flatness in isospace, while preserving conventional curvature in its projection on conventional
spacetime (or, equivalently, curvature characterized by the g(x) = ˆ Tgrav(x) £ ´
referred to the isounit ˆIgrav(x) in which case curvature becomes null due to the interrelation
ˆIgrav(x) = 1= ˆ Tgrav(x)) (15).
A resolution of numerous controversies on classical formulations of gravity then follow
from the above main features, such as: the resolution of the century old controversy on
the lack of existence of consistent total conservation laws for gravitation on a Riemannian
space (which controversy is resolved under the universal ˆ P(3:1) symmetry by mere visual
46
verification that the generators of the conventional and isotopic Poincar´e symmetry are
the same, since they represent conserved quantities in the absence and in the preserve
of gravity); the controversy on the fact that gravity on a Riemannian space admits a
well defined ”Euclidean,” but not ””Minkowskian” limit (which controversy is trivially
resolved by isogravity via the limit ˆIgrav(x) ! I); and others.
A resolution of the controversies on quantum gravity can be seen from the property
that relativistic hadronic mechanics is a quantum formulation of gravity whenever
ˆ T = ˆ Tgrav which is as axiomatically consistent as the conventional relativistic quantum
mechanics because the two formulations coincide, by construct, at the abstract,
realization-free level. As an illustration, whenever ˆ Tgrav = Diag:(g11; g22; g33; g44), the
iso-Dirac equation (3.90) provides a direct rtepresentation of the conventional electromnagnetic
interactions experienced by an electron, represented by the fevot potential A¹,
plus gravitational interactions represented by the isogamma matrices.
Once curvature is abandoned in favor of the broader isoflatness, the axiomatic incompatibilities
existing between gravity and electroweak interactions are resolved because:
isogravity possesses, at the abstract level, the same Poincar´e invariance of electroweak
interactions; isogravity can be formulated on the same flat isospace of electroweak theories;
and isogravity admits positive and negative energies in the same way as it occurs
for electroweak theories. An axiomatically consistent iso-grand-unification then follows
(32,35).
Note that the above grand-unification requires the prior geometric unification of the
special and general relativities, which is achieved precisely by isorelativity and its underlying
iso-Minkowskian geometry. In fact, special and general relativities are merely
differentiated in isospecial relativity by the explicit realization of the unit. In particular,
black holes are now characterized by the zeros of the isounit (55)
ˆIgrav(x) = 0: (3:97)
The above formulation recovers all conventional results on gravitational singularities, such
as the singularities of the Schwarzschild’s metric, since they are all described by the
gravitational content ˆ Tgrav(x) of g(x) = ˆ Tgrav(x) £ ´, since ´ is flat.
This illustrates again that all conventional results of gravitation, including experimental
verifications, can be reformulated in invariant form via isorelativity.
Moreover, the problematic aspects of general relativity mentioned earlier refer to the
exterior gravitational problem. Perhaps greater problematic aspects exist in gravitation on
a Riemannian space for interior gravitational problems, e.g., because of the lack of characterization
of basic features, such as the density of the interior problem, the locally varying
character of gravitation, etc. These additional problematic aspects are also resolved by
isospecial relativity due to the unrestricted character of the functional dependence of the
isometric which therefore permits a direct geometrization of the density, local; variation
of the speed of light, etc.
The cosmological implications are also intriguing. In fact, isorelativity permits a new
conception of cosmology based on the universal invariance ˆ P(3:1)£ ˆ Pd(3:1) in which there
is no need for the ”missing mass” (as indicated earlier), time and the speed of light become
47
local variables, and the detected universe has a dimension considerably smaller than that
currently believed (because some of the cosmological redshift is due to the decrease of the
speed of light in chromospheres, rather than speed of quasars). Also, at the limit case
of equal distribution of matter and antimatter in the universe, isocosmology predicts that
the universe has identically null total energy, identically null total time, and identically
null other physical characteristics, thus permitting mathematical studies of its creation
(because of the lack of singularities at its formation).
3.14: Experimental verifications and scientific applications. Nowadays, isotopies
in general, and the isotopic branch of hadronic mechanics in particular, have clear experimental
verifications in classical physics, particle physics, nuclear physics, chemistry,
superconductivity, biology and cosmology, among which we quote the following representative
verifications:
? The first and only known optimization of the shape of extended objects moving
within resistive media via the optimal control theory (14) following the first achievement of
the universality of the isoaction (3.50) for all possible resistive forces; ? The axiomatically
correct formulation of special relativity in terms of the proper time by T. Gill and his
associates (202)-(206);
? The first identification of the connection between Lie-admissibility and supersymmetries
by Adler (211);
? The proof by Aringazin (192,197) of the ”universality” of Isoaxiom III, namely,
its capability of admitting as particualr cases all available anomalous time dilations via
different expensions in terms of different quantities and with different truncatiuons;
? The exact representation of the anomalous behavior of the meanlives of unstable
particles with speed by Cardone et al (110,11) that to Isoaxioms III of isorelativity;

medium in the interior of hadrons by Arestov et al. (120);

Santilli (2.17) thanks to incoherence between the external and internal Hilbert spaces;
? The proof by Jannussis and Mignani (186) of the convergence of isotopic perturbative
series when conventionally divergent based on the property for all isotopic elements used
in actual models ˆ T ¿ 1, thus implying that perturbative expansions which are divergent
when formulated with the conventional associative product A £ B become convergent
when re-expressed in terms of the isoassociative product Aˆ£B = A £ ˆ T £ B;
? The initiation by Mignani (182) of a nonpotential-nonunitary scattering theory reformulated
by Santilli (55) as isounitary on iso-Hilbert spaces over isofields, thus recovering
causality and propability laws for the first known description ofscattering among extended
particles with consequential contact-nonpotential inetractions;
? The first and only known exact and invariant representation by Santilli (114,115) of
nuclear magnetic moments and other nuclear characteristics thanks to interior mutation of
type (3.93), which representation has escaped quantum mechanics for about one century;
48
? The first and only known model by Animalu (170) and Animalu and Santilli (116)
of the Cooper pair in superconductivity with an attractive force between the two identical
electrons in excellent agreement with experimental data;
? The exact representation via isorelativity by Mignani (118) of the large difference in
cosmological redshifts between quasars and galaxies when physically connected;
? The exact representation by Santilli (117) of the internal blue- and red-shift of
quasar’s cosmological redshift;
? The elimination of the need for a missing mass in the universe by Santilli (34) thanks
to isoaxiom V.
Additional important applications of isotopies have been studied by by A. O. E. Animalu,
A. K. Aringazin, R. Aslaner, C. Borgi, F. Cardone, J. Dunning-Davies, F. Eder,

These studies are too numerous to be effectively reviewed in this memoir.
Above all, hadronic mechanics achieved the main objective for which it was built: the
first exact and invariant representation from unadulterated first axiomatic principles of
all experimental data of the hydrogen, water and other molecules by R. M. Santilli and
D. D. Shillady (125,126) (see also the comprehensive treatment in monograph (59)). The
representation was achieved via the use of nonrelativistic hadronic mechanics based on
the simple isounit (3.16) in which, as one can see, there are no free parameters for ad hoc
fits of experimental data, but only a quantitative description of wave-overlappings, with
isorelativistic extension characterized by isounit (3.82).
It should be noted that, whether in valence coupling or not, electrons repel each other.
Also, the total electric or magnetic forced between neutral atoms are identically null,
while exchange, van der Waals and other forces of current use in chemistry are basically
insufficient to represent the strength of molecular bonds (59). Studies (125,126) achieved
the first and only known strongly attractive force between pairs of identical electrons in
singlet coupling at short distance, and proved to originate from nonlocal, nonlinear and
nonpotential interactions due to deep overlappings of electron’s wavepackets in singlet
coupling (where the word ”strongly” it is not evidently referred to strong interactions).
The birth of this new, nonpotential, strongly attractive force between particles in conditions
of mutual penetration then implies new structure models of hadrons, nuclei and
stars (see below).
As it is well known, the exact representation of molecular data had escaped about
one century of attempts via conventional chemistry, because the missing 2% originated
precisely from the nonlocal-integral, nonlinear and nonpotential interactions due to deep
overlapping of the wavepackets of the valence electrons (Figure 2) which are beyond any
descriptive capacity of quantum mechanics.
As it is also well known, improved representations of molecular data have required
the ”screening of the Coulomb potential,” which screening cannot be qualified as char-
49
acterizing a ”quantum” theory since the quantum of energy only exists for the pure
Coulomb potential. In any case, screened Coulomb potentials are nonunitary images of
the Coulomb law, thus being particular cases of the nonunitary/isounitary structure of
hadronic mechanics and chemistry (59).
The achievement of a deeper understanding of molecular bonds has far reaching scientific
implications. In fact, it confirms that nonlocal, nonlinear and non potential interactions
exist in all interior problems at large, such as the structure of hadrons, nuclei and
stars, and imply basically new structure models in which the constituents are isoparticles
(irreducible representation of the Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry), rather than conventional
particles in vacuum.
The original proposal to build hadronic mechanics (38) of 1978 included the proof that
all characteristics of the ¼o meson can be represented in an exact and invariant way via
a bound state of one iso-electron ˆe¡ and its antiparticle ˆe+ under conditions of mutual
penetration within 10¡13cm,
¼o = (ˆe¡; ˆe+)HM; (3:98)
the ¼§ meson can be represented via a bound state of three isoelectrons,
¼§ = (ˆe¡; ˆe§; ˆe+)HM; (3:99)
and the remaining mesons can be similarly identified as hadronic bound states of massive
isoparticles produced free in the spontaneous decays with the lowest mode.
Following the prior achievement of the isotopies of the SU(2) spin (28), Ref. (214) of
1990 achieved for the first time the exact and invariant representation of all characteristic
of the neutron as a nonrelativistic hadronic bound state of one isoproton and one
isoelectron according to Rutherford’s original conception of the neutron,
n = (ˆp+; ˆe¡)HM; (3:100)
while the relativistic extension was reached in Ref. (30), jointly with the first isotopies
of Dirac’s equation. Subsequently, it was easy to see that all unstable baryons can be
considered as hadronic bound states of massive isoparticles, again those generally in the
spontaneous decays with the lowest modes.
Compatibility of the above new structure models of hadrons with ordinary massive
constituents and SU(3)-color theories was achieved via the assumption that quarks are
composite, a view first expressed by Santilli (225) in 1981), and the use of hypermathematics
(see Section 5) with different units for different hadrons (31). This approach
essentially yields the hyperrealization ˆ SU(3) in which composite hyperquarks are characterized
by the multivalued isounit with isotopic element ˆ T = ( ˆ Tu; ˆ Td; ˆ Ts), resulting in
hypermultiplets of mesons, baryons, etc.
The compatibility of this hypermodel with conventional theories is established by the
isomorphism between conventional SU(3) and the hyper- ˆ SU(3), the latter merely being
a broader realization of the axioms of the former. The significance of this hypermodel
is illustrated by the fact that all perturbative series which are divergent for SU(3) are
turned into convergent forms because ˆ Tu; ˆ Td; ˆ Ts ¿ 1 under which, as indicated earlier, all
50
divergent perturbative series expressed in terms of the conventional product A£B become
convergent when re-expressed in terms of the hytperproduct A £ ˆ T £ B. Compatibility
with the structure model of hadrons with ordinary massive constituents is evident from
the fact that quarks result to be composed of ordinary massive isoparticles.
It should be recalled that none of the above hadronic models are possible for quantum
mechanics, e.g., because the representation of the rest energies of hadrons would require
”positive binding energies”(since, unlike similar occurrences in nuclear physics, the rest
energy of bound states (3.98)-(3.100) is much bigger than the sum of the rest energies of
the constituents. Such ”positive binding energies are prohibited by quantum mechanics
because Schroedinger’s equation become inconsistent. These and other objections were
resolved by the covering hadronic mechanics due to the isorenormalizations (also called
mutations) of the rest energies and other features of the constituents caused by nonlocal,
nonlinear and nonpotential interactions.
Predictably, the reduction of the neutron to a bound state of an isoproton and an isoelectron
permitted a new structure model of nuclei as hadronic bound states of isoprotons
and isoelectron (113,114), with the conventional quantum models based on protons and
neutron remaining valid in first approximation. The new isonuclear model permitted the
first known understanding of the reason why the deuteron ground state has spin 1 since
it is a three-body system for hadronic mechanics,
D = (ˆp+; ˆe¡; ˆp+)HM; (3:101)
thus admitting 1 as the lowest possible angular momentum, while the ground state of
the deuteron quantum mechanics, D = (p+; no)QM should have spin zero since it is a two
body system. The isonuclear model also permitted the interpretation of other features
that had remained unexplained in nuclear physics for about one century such as why the
correlation among nucleons is restricted to pairs only.
In particular, the old process of keep adding potentials to the nuclear force without
ever achieving an exact representation of nuclear data has been truncated by hadronic
mechanics, due to a component of the nuclear force which is nonlocal, nonlinear and nonpotential
originating from the mutual penetration of the charge distribution of nucleons
established by nuclear data (such as the ratio between nuclear volumes and the sum of
the volume of the nucleon constituents).
The reduction of neutron stars and other astrophysical bodies to isoprotons and isoelectrons
is then consequential.
3.15: Industrial applications to new clean energies and fuels. In closing, it should
be indicated that the studies on isotopies have long passed the level of pure scientific
relevance, because they now have direct industrial applications fort new clean energies
and fuels so much needed by our contemporary society.
As an illustration at the particle level, the synthesis of the neutron from one
proton and one electron according to Rutherford, Eq. (3.100), has been experimentally
confirmed by C. Borghi et al. (123) to occur also at low energies, although under a number
of conditions studied in monograph (58), and additional tests are under way.
51
Once Rutherford’s original conception of the neutron is rendered acceptable by hadronic
mechanics, the electron becomes a physical constituent of the neutron (although in a mutated
state). In this case, hadronic mechanics predicts the capability of stimulating the
decay of the neutron via photons with suitable resonating frequencies and other means,
thus implying the first known form of ”hadronic energy” (58) (that is, energy originating
in the structure of hadrons, rather than in their nuclear aggregates), which has already
been preliminarily confirmed via an experiment conducted by N. Tsagas et al (124) (see
monograph (58) for scientific aspects and the web site www.betavoltaic.com for industrial
profiles).
As an illustration at the nuclear level, hadronic mechanics predicts a basically
new process for controlled nuclear syntheses which is dramatically different than both the
”hot” and the ”cold” fusions, and which is currently also under industrial development,
which condition prohibits its disclosure in this memoir.
As an illustration at the molecular level, the deeper understanding of the structure
of molecules has permitted the discovery and experimental verifications in Ref.s (27) (see
also the studies by Aringazin and his associates in Refs. (128-1130) and monograph (59))
of the new chemical species of magnecules consisting of clusters of individual atoms, dimers
and molecules under a new bond originating from the electric and magnetic polarization
of the orbitals of atomic electrons.
In turn, the new species of magnecules has permitted the industrial synthesis of new fuels
without hydrocarbon structure, whose combustion exhaust resolves the environmental
problems of fossil fuels by surpassing current exhaust requirement by the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency without catalytic converter or other exhaust purification
processes (see monograph (59) for scientific profiles and the web site www.magnegas.com
for industrial aspects).
4. CONSTRUCTION OF GENOMECHANICS FROM IRREVERSIBLE
PROCESSES
4.1: The scientific unbalance caused by irreversibility. As it is well known, physical,
chemical or biological systems are called irreversible when their images under time
reversal, t ! ¡t, are prohibited by causality and other laws, as it is the case for nuclear
transmutations, chemical reactions and organisms growth. Systems are called reversible
when their time reversal images are as causal as the original ones, as it is the case for
planetary and atomic structures when considered isolated from the rest of the universe
(see reprint volume (81) on irreversibility and vast literature quoted therein).
Yet another large scientific unbalance of the 20-th century has been the treatment
of irreversible systems via mathematical and physical formulations of reversible systems
which are themselves reversible, resulting in serious limitations in virtually all branches
of science. The problem was compounded by the fact that all used formulations were
essentially of Hamiltonian type, with the awareness that all known Hamiltonians are
reversible (since all known potential interactions are reversible).
52
This third scientific unbalance was dismissed by academicians with vested interests in
reversible theories with unsubstantiated statements, such as ”irreversibility is a macroscopic
occurrence which disappears when all bodies are reduced to their elementary constituents.”
The underlying belief is that mathematical and physical theories which are so
effective for the study of one electron in a reversible orbit around a proton are tacitly
assumed to be equally effective for the study of the same electron when in irreversible
motion in the core of a star with the local nonconservation of energy, angular momentum,
etc. These academic beliefs have been disproved by the following:
THEOREM 4.1 (224): A classical irreversible system cannot be consistently decomposed
into a finite number of elementary constituents all in reversible conditions and,
vice-versa, a finite collection of elementary constituents all in reversible conditions cannot
yield an irreversible macroscopic ensemble.
The occurrence established by the above theorems dismiss all nonscientific conversations
which have occurred on irreversibility in the 20-th century, and identify the real
scientific needs, the construction of formulations which are structurally irreversible, that
is, irreversible for all known reversible Hamiltonians, and are applicable at all levels of
study, from Newtonian mechanics to second quantization.
4.2: The forgotten legacy of Newton, Lagrange and Hamilton. It should be indicated
that the above scientific unbalance existed only in the 20-th century becauseNewton’s
equations (1) are generally irreversible since, as recalled in the preceding section, Newton’s
force F(t; x; v) can be decomposed into the sum of variationally selfadjoint and
nonselfadjoint components (48,51)
m® £ ak® = FSA

k® ; (4:1a)
FSA = ¡@V=@x; FNSA 6= ¡@V=@x; k = 1; 2; 3; ® = 1; 2; :::; n: (4:1b)
It is evident that, since all known FSA are reversible, in Newtonian mechanics irreversibility
originates in the contact nonpotential forces FNSA.
In a way fully aligned with Newton’s teaching, Lagrange (2) and Hamilton (3) formulated
their celebrated analytic equations in terms of a function, today called the Lagrangian
L(x; v) and the Hamiltonian H(x; p), representing FSA, plus external terms
representing precisely the contact nonpotential forces FNSA,

Figure 3: An illustration via sea shells growth of the third scientific unbalance of the 20-th
century, the lack of a structurally irreversible mathematics (that is, a mathematics whose basic
axioms are not invariant under time reversal) for quantitative representations of irreversible
processes. The unbalance is due to the fact that all formulations used until now are of Hamiltonian
type, while all known Hamiltonians and their background mathematics are reversible, thus
implying the study of irreversible systems via fully reversible formulations.

Since all known Lagrangians and Hamiltonians are reversible in time, according to the
teaching of Lagrange and Hamilton, irreversibility is characterized, again, by the external
terms representing contact zero-range interactions among extended particles.
At the beginning of the 20-th century, Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s external terms were
truncated, resulting in analytic equations

which are fully reversible.
54
The above occurrence was due to the successes of the truncated analytic equations for
the representation of planetary and atomic structures, resulting in their use for virtually
all scientific inquiries of the 20-th century. In turn, the assumption of the truncated
analytic equations as the ultimate formulation of science implied the scientific unbalance
under consideration here because planetary and atomic structures are fully reversible,
thus lacking sufficient generalities for all of nature.
4.3: Catastrophic inconsistencies of formulations with external terms. More recent
studies (23,38) have shown that the true Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s equations (those
with external terms) cannot be used in applications due to a number of insufficiencies,
such as:
(1) the lack of invariant numerical predictions in accordance with Theorem 3.1 (due
to their evident noncanonical character);
(2) the lack of characterization of any algebra by the brackets of the time evolution,
let alone the loss of all Lie algebras, because brackets (A;H; FNSA) of Eqs. (4.3) violate
the right distributive and scalar laws as necessary to characterize an algebra commonly
understood in contemporary mathematics since they are triple systems);
(3) the lack of a topology suitable to represent contact nonpotential interactions among
extended particles since the topology of conventional Hamiltonian formulation is strictly
local-differential, thus solely characterizing point particles; and other limitations.
The only resolution of these problematic aspects known to this author was the construction
of the novel structurally irreversible mathematics indicated earlier. Stated in
different terms, the manifestly inconsistent reduction of irreversible macroscopic systems
to elementary particles in reversible conditions was due, again, to insufficiencies of the
used mathematics.
It should be noted that the isomathematics of the preceding section is also reversible
in time because the isounit is Hermitean, thus lacking the mathematical characterization
of time reversal, and confirming the need of constructing of a broader mathematics
specifically suited to represent irreversibility.
4.4: Initial versions of irreversible mathematics. The achievement of a structurally
irreversible mathematics resulted to be a long scientific journey due to the need of achieving
invariance under irreversible conditions. The first studies can be traced back to Ref.
(8) of 1967 which presented the first known parametric deformation of Lie algebras with
product
(A;B) = p £ A £ B ¡ q £ B £ A =
= v £ (A £ B ¡ B £ A) + w £ (A £ B + B £ A) =
= v £ [A;B] + w £ fA;Bg; (4:6)
where p, q, and p § q are non-null parameters, v = p + q;w = q ¡ p, and A, B are
Hermitean matrices.
55
The studies continued with the first known presentation in Ref. (38) of the operator
deformations of Lie algebra with product
(Aˆ;B) = A £ P £ B ¡ B £ Q £ A =
= (A £ T £ B ¡ B £ T £ A) + (A £W £ B + B £W £ A) =
= [Aˆ;B] + fAˆ;Bg; T +W = P;W ¡ T = Q; (4:7)
where P, Q and P § Q are nowhere singular matrices.
On historical grounds, the above deformations were introduced in Refs. (8,38) as realizations
of Albert’s Lie-admissible and Jordan-admissible products (7), namely, products
whose antisymmetric and symmetric parts are Lie and Jordan, respectively,
(Aˆ;B) ¡ (Bˆ;B) = 2 £ [Aˆ;B] = Lie; (4:8a)
(Aˆ;B) + (Bˆ;A) = 2 £ (Aˆ;B) = Jordan: (4:8b)
Note, however, that the Lie and Jordan algebras attached to brackets (Aˆ;B) are not
conventional because of their broader isotopic nature [4].
The transition from the parameter to the operator deformations of Lie algebras was
mandatory because all time evolution which can be characterized by the former brackets
are nonunitary. Therefore, the reader can easily verify that the application of a nonunitary
transform to the parametric deformations leads to the operator ones,
i £ dA=dt = (A;B);A(t) = U £ A(0) £ Uy;U £ Uy 6= I; (4:9a)
U £ (A;B) £ Uy = (A0ˆ;B0)0; (4:9b)
A0 = U £ A £ Uy;B0 = U £ B £ Uy; (4:9c)
T = v £ (U £ Uy)¡1;W = w £ (U £ Uy)¡1: (4:9d)
Operator deformations (4.7) (rather than the parametric deformations (4.6)) are promising
for the representation of irreversibility because they are no longer totally anti-symmetric
(as it is the case for Lie brackets) and, therefore, they can indeed represent nonconservation
as needed in irreversible processes. Moreover, operator deformations (4.7) are
universal in the sense of admitting as particular cases all infinitely possible algebras as
currently known in mathematics (those characterized by a bilinear product), including
Lie, Jordan, Kac-Moody, supersymmetric and all other possible algebras. Finally, the
joint Lie- and Jordan-admissibility is preserved by any additional nonunitary transforms,
Z £ (Aˆ;B) £ Zy = A0 £ P0 £ B0 ¡ B0 £ Q0 £ A0 = (A0ˆ; ˆB)0; (4:10a)
Z £ Zy 6= I;A0 = Z £ A £ Zy;B0 = Z £ B £ Zy (4:10b)
P0 = Zy¡1 £ P £ Z¡1;Q0 = Zy¡1 £ Q £ Z¡1; (4:10b)
thus confirming that brackets (Aˆ;B) characterize the most general possible algebras.
56
Nevertheless, all parametric and operator deformations are afflicted by the catastrophic
mathematical and physical inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1 because of the lack of invariance
of the deformation parameters P ! P0 6= P;Q ! Q0 6= Q (or, equivalently, of the
product).
During the last two decades of the 20-th century, the physical and mathematical
literature saw an explosion of contributions in Lie deformations which continues to this
day, although generally without a quotation of their origination in Refs. (8,23,38), without
a quotation of their Lie- and Jordan-admissible content (7), and, above all, without a
quotation of the rather vast literature on their catastrophic inconsistencies (see, Refs.
(171-175) and memoir (46) and literature quoted therein). By contrast, by the mid 1980’s
this author had abandoned the study of Lie deformations according to their original
formulations (8,23,38) because of said catastrophic inconsistencies.
4.5: Elements of genomathematics. A breakthrough occurred with the discovery,
apparently done for the first time by R. M. Santilli in Ref. (12) of 1993, that the axioms
of a field also hold when the ordinary product of numbers a £ b is ordered to the right,
a &gt; b, or, separately, ordered to the left, a &lt; b. In turn, such an order permitted the
construction of two generalized units, called genounits to the right and to the left
I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1) ! ˆI&gt;(t; x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) = 1= ˆ T&gt;(t; x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) &gt; 0; (4:11a)
I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1) !&lt;&gt; ˆI(t; x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) = 1=&lt; ˆ T(t; x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::); (4:11b)
ˆI&gt; = (&lt; ˆI)y; (4:11c)
with corresponding ordered genoproducts to the right and to the left
A £ B ! A &gt; B = A £ ˆ T&gt; £ B; (4:12a)
A £ B !! A &lt; B = A £&lt; T £ B; (4:12b)
A &gt; B = (B &lt; A)y; (4:12c)
under which the left and rights character of the genounits is preserved,
I £ A = A £ I = A ! ˆI&gt; &gt; A = A &gt; ˆI&gt; = A; (4:13a)
I £ A = A £ I = A !&lt; ˆI &lt; A = A &lt;&lt; ˆI = A; (4:13b):
for all (Hermitean elements A, B, of the considered set. Examples of genounits and
genoproducts will be provided shortly.
In this way, the ordering ”&gt;” can describe motion forward in time while the ordering
”&lt;” can describe motion backward in time, with interconnecting Hermitean (or transposed)
conjugation. This approach permitted the embedding of irreversibility in the most
fundamental quantities, the basic units and operations, thus assuring ab initio the construction
of a structurally irreversible mathematics, today known as genomathematics, as
summarized below.
57
DEFINITION 4.1: Let F = F(a;+;£) be a field as per Definition 2.1. The forward
genofields (first introduced in Ref. (12) of 1993) are rings ˆ F&gt; = ˆ F&gt;(ˆa&gt;; ˆ+&gt;;&gt;) with
forward genonumbers
ˆa&gt; = a £ ˆI&gt;; (4:14)
associative, distributive and commutative forward genosum
ˆa&gt; ˆ+&gt;ˆb&gt; = (a + b) £ ˆI&gt; = ˆc&gt; 2 ˆ F&gt;; (4:15)
associative and distributive forward genoproduct
ˆa&gt; &gt; ˆb&gt; = ˆa &gt; £ˆ T&gt; £ˆb&gt; = ˆc&gt; 2 ˆ F; (4:16)
additive forward genounit
ˆ0
&gt; = 0; ˆa&gt; ˆ+&gt;ˆ0&gt; = ˆ0&gt; ˆ+&gt;ˆa&gt; = ˆa&gt; 2 ˆ F&gt;; (4:17)
and multiplicative forward genounit
ˆI&gt; = 1= ˆ T&gt;; ˆa&gt; &gt; ˆI&gt; = ˆI&gt; &gt; ˆa&gt; = ˆa&gt; 2 ˆ F&gt;; 8ˆa&gt;; ˆb&gt; 2 ˆ F&gt;; (4:18)
where ˆI&gt; is a complex-valued non-Hermitean, or real-value non-symmetric, everywhere
invertible quantity generally outside F. The backward genofields &lt; ˆ F(&lt;ˆa;&lt; ˆ+;&lt;), their elements,
units and their operations are given by the Hermitean conjugate (or transposed)
of the corresponding quantities and their operations in ˆ F&gt;(ˆa&gt;; ˆ+&gt;; ˆ£&gt;), e.g.,
&lt; ˆI = (ˆI&gt;)y; etc: (4:19)
LEMMA 4.1: Forward and backward genofields are fields with characteristic zero
(namely, they verify all axioms of said fields).
In Sect. 2 we pointed out that the conventional product ”2 multiplied by 3” is not
necessarily equal to 6 because, depending on the assumed unit and related product, it
can be ¡6. In Section 3 we pointed out that the same product ”2 multiplied by 3” is
not necessarily equal to +6 or ¡6, because it can also be equal to an arbitrary number,
or a matrix or an an integrodifferential operator. In this section we point out that ”2
multiplied by 3” can be ordered to the right or to the left, and yield different numerical
results for different orderings, ”2 &gt; 3 6= 2 &lt; 3, all this by continuing to verify the axioms
of a field per each order (12).
Once the forward and backward fields have been identified, the various branches of
genomathematics can be constructed via simple compatibility arguments, resulting in the
genofunctional analysis, genodifferential calculus, etc (14,54,55). We have in this way the
genodifferentials and genoderivatives
ˆ d&gt;x = ˆ T&gt;
x £ dx;
ˆ@&gt;
ˆ@&gt;x
= ˆI&gt;
x £
@
@x
; etc: (4:20)
58
Particularly intriguing are the genogeometries (loc. cit.) because they admit nonsymmetric
metrics, such as the genoriemannian metrics
g&gt;(x) = ˆ T&gt;(x) £ ´; (4:21)
where ´ is the Minkowski metric and ˆ T&gt;(x) is a real-values, nowhere singular, 4 £ 4
nonsymmetric matrix, while bypassing known inconsistencies since they are referred to
the nonsymmetric genounit
ˆI&gt; = 1= ˆ T&gt;: (4:22)
In this way, genogeometries are structurally irreversible and actually represent irreversibility
with their most central geometric notion, the metric.
4.6: Lie-Santilli genotheory and its isodual. Particularly important for this note
is the lifting of Lie’s theory permitted by genomathematics, first identified by R. M.
Santilli in Ref. (23) of 1978, and today knows as the Lie-Santilli genotheory [7,8], which
is characterized by:
(1) The forward and backward universal enveloping genoassociative algebra ˆ»&gt;;&lt; ˆ», with
infinite-dimensional basis characterizing thePoincar´e-Birkhoff-Witt-Santilli genotheorem
ˆ»&gt; : ˆI; ˆXi; ˆXi &gt; ˆXj ; ˆXi &gt; ˆXj &gt; ˆXk; :::; i · j · k; (4:23a)
&lt; ˆ» : ˆI; ˆXi; ˆXi &lt; ˆXj ; ˆXi &lt; ˆXj &lt; ˆXk; :::; i · j · k; (4:23b)
where the ”hat” on the generators denotes their formulation on genospaces over genofields
and their Hermiticity implies that ˆX &gt; =&lt; ˆX = ˆX ;
(2) The Lie-Santilli genoalgebras characterized by the universal, jointly Lie-and Jordanadmissible
brackets (4.7),
&lt; ˆL&gt; : ( ˆXiˆ; ˆXj) = ˆXi &lt; ˆXj ¡ ˆXj &gt; ˆXi = ˆ Ck
ij ˆ£
ˆX
k; (4:24)
although now formulated in an invariant form (see below);
(3) The Lie-Santilli genotransformation groups
&lt; ˆG&gt; : ˆ A( ˆ w) = (ˆeˆi ˆ£ ˆX
ˆ£
ˆ w
&gt; ) &gt; ˆ A(ˆ0) &lt; (&lt;ˆe¡ˆi
ˆ£
ˆ wˆ£
ˆX
) =
= (ei£ ˆX £ˆ T&gt;£w) £ A(0) £ (e¡i£w£&lt; ˆ T£ ˆX ); (4:25)
where ˆ w&gt; 2 ˆR&gt; are the genoparameters; the genorepresentation theory, etc.
The mathematical implications of the Lie-Santilli genotheory are significant because
of the admission as particular cases of all possible algebras, as well as because, when
computed on the genobimodule &lt; ˆ»£ˆ»&gt; Lie-admissible algebras verify all Lie axioms, while
deviations from Lie algebras emerge only in their projection on the bimodule &lt;» £ »&gt; of
the conventional Lie theory. This is due to the fact that the computation of the left action
A &lt; B = A £&lt; ˆ T £ B on &lt; ˆ» (that is, with respect to the genounit &lt; ˆI = 1=&lt; ˆ T) yields
the save value as the computation of the conventional product A£B on &lt;» (that is, with
59
respect to the trivial unit I), and the same occurs for the value of A &gt; B on ˆ»&gt;. In this
way, thanks to genomathematics, Lie algebras acquire a towering significance in view of
the possibility of reducing all known algebras to primitive Lie axioms.
The physical implications of the Lie-Santilli genotheory ar equally significant. In fact,
Noether’s theorem on the reduction of conservation laws to primitive Lie symmetries
can be generalized to the reduction of, this time, nonconservation laws to primitive Lie-
Santilli genosymmetries. As a matter of fact, this reduction was the very first motivation
that suggested the construction of the genotheory in memoir (23) (see also monographs
(49,50)). The reader can then foresee similar liftings of all remaining physical aspects
treated via Lie algebras.
The construction of the isodual Lie-Santilli;i genotheory is an instructive exercise for
readers interested in learning the new methods.
The physical theories characterized by genomathematics can be summarized as follows.
4.7: Geno-Newtonian Mechanics and its isodual. Recall that, for the case of isotopies,
the basic Newtonian systems are given by those admitting nonconservative internal
forces restricted by certain constraints which verify total conservation laws (closed non-
Hamiltonian systems). For the case of the genotopies under consideration here, the basic
Newtonian systems are the conventional nonconservative systems (4.1) without subsidiary
constraints (open non-Hamiltonian systems). In this case irreversibility is characterized
by nonselfadjoint forces, as indicated earlier.
The forward geno-Newtonian mechanics and its isodual is a generalization of Newtonian
mechanics for the description of motion forward in time of the latter systems via
a structurally irreversible mathematics. The new mechanics is characterized by (14):
the forward genotime ˆt&gt; = t £ ˆI&gt;
t with (nowhere singular and non-Hermitean) forward
time genounit ˆI&gt;
t = 1= ˆ T&gt;
t 6= ˆI&gt;y t , related forward time genospace ˆ S&gt;
t over the forward
time genofield ˆR&gt;
t ; the forward genocoordinates ˆx&gt; = x £ ˆI&gt;
x with (nowhere singular
non-Hermitean) forward coordinate genounit ˆI&gt;
x = 1= ˆ T&gt;
x 6= ˆI&gt;y x with forward coordinate
genospace ˆ S&gt;
x and related forward coordinate genofield ˆR&gt;
x ; and the forward genospeeds
ˆv&gt; = ˆ d&gt;ˆx&gt;= ˆ d&gt;ˆt&gt; with (nowhere singular and non-Hermitean) forward speed genounit
ˆI&gt;
v = 1= ˆ T&gt;
v 6= ˆI&gt;y v with related forward speed genospace ˆ S&gt;
x and forward speed genofield
ˆR
&gt;
v . Note that, to verify the condition of non-Hermiticity, the time genounits should be
at least complex valued, and the same then occurs for the other genounits.
The representation space is then given by the Kronecker product
ˆ S&gt;
Tot = ˆ S&gt;
t £ ˆ S&gt;
x £ ˆ S&gt;

with total genounit
ˆI&gt;
tot = ˆI&gt;
t £ hatI&gt;
x £ ˆI&gt;
v : (4:28)
The basic equations are given by the forward geno-Newton equations, also known
as Newton-Santilli genoequations, first proposed in memoir (14) via the genodifferential
60
calculus, also known as forward Newton-Santilli genoequations [8-11]

The backward geno-Newton equations is characterized by backward genounits can be obtained
via transpose conjugation of the forward formulation.
As one can see, the representation of Newton’s equations is done in a way similar to
the isotopic case, the main difference being that the basic unit is now no longer symmetric.
Note that in Newton’s equations the nonpotential forces are part of the applied force F,
while in the geno-Newton equations nonpotential forces are represented by the forward
genounits, or, equivalently, by the forward genodifferential calculus, in a way essentially
similar to the case of isotopies. The main difference is that isounits are Hermitean, thus
implying the equivalence of forward and backward motions, while genounits are non-
Hermitean, thus implying irreversibility.
Note also that the topology underlying Newton’s equations is the conventional, Euclidean,
local-differential topology which, as such, can only represent point particles.
By contrast, the topology underlying the geno-Newton equations is the Santilli-Sourlas-
Tsagas genotopology (14,139) for the representation of extended, nonspherical and deformable
particles via forward genounits, e.g., of the diagonal type
ˆI&gt; = Diag:(n21
; n22
; n23
; n2
4) £ ¡&gt;(t; x; v; :::); (4:30)
where n2
k; k = 1; 2; 3 represents the semiaxes of an ellipsoid, n24 represents the density
of the medium in which motion occurs (with more general nondiagonal realizations here
omitted for simplicity), and ¡&gt; represents contact interactions occurring for the motion
forward in time.
The construction of the isodual image of the above geno-Newtonian mechanics is
instructive to understand the difference between isoduality and motion backward in time.
4.8: Geno-Hamiltonian mechanics and its isodual. The most effective setting to
introduce real-valued and non-Hermitean (thus non-symmetric) genounits is in the 6ndimensional
forward genocotangent bundle (geno-phase-space) with local genocoordinates
and their conjugate

2 )T ; k = 1; 2; 3; ® = 1; 2; :::; n; ¹; ½ = 1; 2; :::6n; (4:31a)
where the superscript T stands for transposed, with nowhere singular, real-valued and
non-symmetric genometric and related invariant
ˆ±&gt; = ±6n£6n £ ˆ T&gt;
1 6n£6n; (4:32a)
ˆa&gt;¹ &gt; ˆR&gt;
¹ = ˆa&gt;½ £ ˆ T&gt;¯
1½ £ ˆR &gt;
¯ = a½ £ ˆI&gt;¯
2½ £ R¯: (4:32b)
61
In this case we have the following genoactionprinciple (14)
ˆ±&gt; ˆ A&gt; = ˆ±&gt; ˆ Z &gt;
[ ˆR&gt;
¹ &gt;a ˆ d&gt;ˆa&gt; ¡ ˆH &gt; &gt;t ˆ d&gt;ˆt&gt;] =

1º (t; x; p; :::) £ d(a¯ £ ˆI&gt;º
1¯ ) ¡ H £ dt] = 0; (4:33)
where the second expression is the projection on conventional spaces over conventional
fields and we have assumed for simplicity that the time genounit is 1.
It is easy to prove that the above genoprinciple characterizes the following forward
geno-Hamilton equations, also called forward Hamilton-Santilli genoequations (originally
proposed in Ref. (23) of 1978 with conventional mathematics and in ref. (14) of 1996
with genomathematics; see also Refs. (28,51,52,55))

where !¹º is the conventional Lie tensor and, consequently, S¹º is Lie-admissible in the
sense of Albert (7).
As one can see, the important consequence of genomathematics and its genodifferential
calculus is that of turning the triple system (A;H; FNSA) of Eqs. (4.3) in the bilinear
form (Aˆ;B) of brackets (4.35a),m thus regaining the existence of a consistent algebra in
the brackets of the time evolution, for which central purpose genomathematics was built
(since the multiplicative factors represented by K are fixed for each given system). The
invariance of such a formulation will be proved shortly.
62
It is easy to verify that the above identical reformulation of Hamilton’s historical
time evolution (4.3) correctly recovers the time rate of variations of physical quantities in
general, and that of the energy in particular,

It is easy to show that genoaction principle (4.33) characterizes the following Hamilton-
Jacobi-Santilli genoequations

¹ ) = (ˆp&gt;
k®; ˆ0); (4:37b)
which confirm the property (crucial for genoquantization as shown below) that the genoaction
is indeed independent of the linear momentum.
Note the direct universality of Eqs. (4.33) for the representation of all infinitely possible
Newton equations (4.1) (universality) directly in the fixed frame of the experimenter
(direct universality). Note also that, at the abstract, realization-free level, Geno-Hamilton
equations (4.34) coincide with Hamilton’s equations without external terms, yet represent
those with external terms. The latter are reformulated via genomathematics as the only
known way to achieve invariance while admitting a consistent algebra in the brackets of
the time evolution (38). Therefore, genohamilton equations (4.34) are indeed irreversible
for all possible reversible Hamiltonians, as desired. The origin of irreversibility rests in
the contact nonpotential forces according to Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s teaching. Note
finally that the extension of Eqs. (4.9) to include nontrivial genotimes implies a major
broadening of the theory we cannot review for brevity (14,55).
The above geno-Hamiltonian mechanics requires, for completness, three additional
formulations, the backward geno-Hamiltonian mechanics for the description of matter
moving backward in time, and the isoduals of both the forward and backward mechanics
for the description of antimatter. The construction of these additional mechanics is lefty
to the interested reader.
4.9: Genotopic Branch of Hadronic Mechanics and its isodual. A simple genotopy
of the naive or symplectic quantization applied to Eqs. (4.37) yields the genotopic branch
of hadronic mechanics defined on the forward genotopic Hilbert space ˆH&gt; with forward
genoinner product &lt; ˆ Ãj &gt; j ˆ Ã &gt; £ˆI&gt; 2 ˆ C&gt;. The resulting genotopy of quantum mechanics
is characterized by the forward geno-Schroedinger equations (first formulated in Refs.
(42,179) via conventional mathematics and in Ref. (14) via genomathematics)

with conjugate backward equations obtained via Hermitean conjugation.
Note the crucial independence of isoaction ˆ A&gt; in principle (4.33) from the linear momentum,
as expressed by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Santilli genoequations (4.37). In fact, such
independence assures that genoquantization yields a genowavefunction solely dependent
on time and coordinates, ˆ Ã&gt; = ˆ Ã&gt;(t; x). Other geno-Hamiltonian mechanics do not verify
such a condition, thus implying genowavefunctions with an explicit dependence also on
linear momenta, ˆ Ã&gt; = ˆ Ã&gt;(t; x; p) which violate the abstract identity of quantum and
hadronic mechanics andwhose treatment in any case is beyond our operator knowledge at
this writing.
The complementary geno-Heisenberg equations are given by in their finite and infinitesimal
forms (first formulated in Ref. (38) via conventional mathematics and in Ref. (14)
via genomathematics)
ˆ A(ˆt) = (ˆeˆi
ˆ£
ˆH

&gt; ) &gt; ˆ A(ˆ0) &lt; (&lt;ˆe¡ˆi

(ˆxiˆ;ˆpj) = i £ ±i
j £ ˆI&gt;; (ˆxiˆ;ˆxj) = (ˆpiˆ;ˆpj) = 0; (4:39c)
where time has no arrow, since Heisenberg’s equations are computed at a fixed time.
The genoexpectation values of an observable for the forward motion ˆ A&gt; are then given
by
&lt; ˆ Ãj &gt; ˆ A&gt; &gt; j ˆ Ã &gt;
&lt; ˆ Ãj &gt; j ˆ Ã &gt; £ ˆI&gt; 2 ˆ C&gt; (4:40)
In particular, the genoexpectation values of the genounit recover the conventional Planck’s
unit,
&lt; ˆ Ãj &gt; ˆI&gt; &gt; j ˆ Ã &gt;
&lt; ˆ Ãj &gt; j ˆ Ã &gt;
= I; (4:41)
thus confirming that the genotopies are ”hidden” in the abstract axioms of quantum
mechanics much along the celebrated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument.
Note that geno-Hermiticity coincides with conventional Hermiticity. As a result, all
quantities which are observable for quantum mechanics remain observable for the above
formulation. However, unlike quantum mechanics, physical quantities are generally nonconserved,
as it must be the case for the energy,
ˆi
&gt; &gt;
ˆ d&gt; ˆH &gt;
ˆ d&gt;ˆt&gt;
= ˆH £ (&lt; ˆ T ¡ ˆ T&gt;) £ ˆH : (4:42):
64
Therefore, the genotopic branch of hadronic mechanics is the only known formulation
permitting nonconserved quantities to be Hermitean, thus being observability. In fact, since
they are Hamiltonian, other formulation attempt to represent nonconservation, e.g., by
adding an ”imaginary potential” to the Hamiltonian. In this case the Hamiltonian is non-
Hermitean and, consequently, the nonconservation of the energy cannot be an observable.
besides, said ”nonconservative models” with non-Hermitean Hamiltonians are nonunitary
and are formulated on conventional spaces over conventional fields, thus suffering all the
catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1. For additional aspects of genomechanics
interested readers may consult Refs. [2,5].
4.10: Invariance of genotheories. Recall that a fundamental Axiomatic feature of
quantum mechanics is the invariance under its time evolution of numerical predictsions
and physical law, which invariance is due to the unitary structure of the theory. However,
quantum mechanics is reversible and can only represent conventional conservation laws.
As indicated earlier, the representation of irreversibility and nonconservation require
the use of nonunitary time evolutions which, however, are afflicted by the catastrophic
inconsistencies of Theorem 3.1.
The only resolution of such a basic impasse known to this author has been the achievement
of invariance under nonunitarity and irreversibility via the use of genomathematics,
provided that such genomathematics is applied to the totality of the formalism to avoid
evident inconsistencies caused by mixing different mathematics for the selected physical
problem.
Such an invariance was first achieved by R. M. Santilli in Ref. (44) of 1997 can be
illustrated by reformulating any given nonunitary transform in the genounitary form
U = ˆU £ ˆ T&gt;1=2;W = ˆW £ ˆ T&gt;1=2; (4:43a)
U £Wy = ˆU &gt; ˆW y = ˆW y &gt; ˆU = ˆI&gt; = 1= ˆ T&gt;; (4:43b)
and then showing that genounits, genoproducts, genoexponentiations, etc., are indeed
invariant under the above genounitary transform in exactly the same way as conventional
unit, products, exponentiations, etc. are invariant under unitary transforms,
ˆI&gt; ! ˆ I&gt;0 = ˆU &gt; ˆI&gt; &gt; ˆW y = ˆI&gt;; (4:44a)
ˆ A &gt; ˆB ! ˆU &gt; (A &gt; B) &gt; ˆW y =
= ( ˆU £ ˆ T&gt; £ A £ T&gt; £ ˆW y) £ ( ˆ T&gt; £Wy)¡1 £ ˆ T&gt;£
£( ˆU £ ˆ T&gt;)¡1 £ ( ˆU £ T&gt; £ ˆ A £ T&gt; £ ˆW &gt;) =
= ˆ A0 £ ( ˆU £ ˆ T&gt; £ ˆW y)¡1 £ ˆB = ˆ A0 £ ˆ T&gt; £ B0 = ˆ A0 &gt; ˆB 0; etc: (4:44b)
from which all remaining invariances follow, thus resolving the catastrophic inconsistencies
of Theorem 3.1.
Note the numerical invariance of the genounit ˆI&gt; ! ˆ I&gt;0 = ˆI&gt;, of the genotopic
element ˆ T&gt; ! ˆ T&gt;0 = ˆ T&gt;, and of the genoproduct &gt;!&gt;0=&gt; which are necessary to have
invariant numerical predictions.
65
4.11: Simple construction of genotheories. As it was the case for the isotopies, a
simple method has been identified in Ref. (44) for the construction of genotheories from
any given conventional, classical or quantum formulation. It consists in identifying such
genounits as the product of two different nonunitary transforms
U £ Uy 6= 1;W £Wy 6= 1;U £Wy = ˆI&gt;;W £ Uy =&lt; ˆI = (ˆI&gt;)y; (4:45)
and subjecting the totality of quantities and their operations of conventional models to
said dual transforms,
I ! ˆI&gt; = U £ I £Wy; I !&lt; ˆI = W £ I £ Uy; (4:46a)
a ! ˆa&gt; = U £ a £Wy = a £ ˆI&gt;; a !&lt; ˆa = W £ a £ Uy =&lt; ˆI £ a; (4:46b)
a£b ! ˆa&gt; &gt; ˆb&gt; = U£(a£b)£W&gt; = (U£a£Wy)£(U£Wy)¡1£(U£b£Wy); (4:46c)
@=@x ! ˆ@&gt;= ˆ@&gt;ˆx&gt; = U £ (@=@x) £Wy = ˆI&gt; £ (@=@x); (4:46d)
&lt; Ãj £ jÃ &gt;!&lt;&lt; Ãj &gt; jÃ&gt; &gt;= U £ (&lt; Ãj £ jÃ &gt;) £Wy; (4:46e)
H £ jÃ &gt;! ˆH &gt; &gt; jÃ&gt; &gt;= (U £ H £Wy) £ (U £Wy)¡1 £ (U £ Ã &gt;); etc: (4:46f)
As a result, any given conventional, classical or quantum model can be easily lifted into
the above genotopic form.
Note that the above construction implies that all conventional physical quantities
acquire a well defined direction of time. For instance, the correct genotopic formulation
of energy, linear momentum, etc., is given by
ˆH
&gt; = U £ H £Wy; ˆp&gt; = U £ p £W&gt;; etc:; (4:47)
and this explains the reason for having represented in this section energy, momentum and
other quantities with their arrow of time &gt;. Such an arrow can indeed be omitted for
notational simplicity, but only after the understanding of its existence.
4.12: Genorelativity. Another important implication of genomathematics is the construction
of yet another lifting of special relativity, this time intended for the invariant
characterization of irreversible classical and quantum processes, today known as genorelativity.
This new relativity is characterized by the genotopies of: the background Euclidean
topology (14); the Minkowski space (15); the Poincar´e symmetry (29); the physical laws;
etc. The geno-Galilean case is treated in monographs (52,53) which appeared prior to the
advent of the genodifferential calculus(14). The relativistic case is oulined in Rdf. (29).
Regrettably, we cannot review genorelativity in details to avoid a prohibitive length.
For the limited scope of this presentation it is sufficient to indicate that genospecial relativity
can be constructed either from the isospecial relativity indicated in the preceding
section via the lifting of the isounits into nonsymmetric forms, or by subjecting conventional
special relativity to the dual noncanonical or nonunitary transform,ms as in Eqs.
(4.45) and (4.46).
66
4.13: Experimental verifications and applications. The experimental validity of
genotheories in classical mechanics is established by the direct representation of all nonconservative
and irreversible Newtonian systems by Geno-Hamilton equations via a simple
algebraic calculation of the term K in Eqs. (4.34c).
The experimental validity of genotheories in particle physics is established by the fact
that all dissipative nuclear models represented via imaginary potentials in the Hamiltonian
and other nonunitary theories can be identically reformulated in terms of the genotopic
branch of hadronic mechanics, while preserving the representation of experimental data
identically.
Above all, genomathematics and its related formulations have indeed achieve the objective
for which they were built, namely, an invariant representation of irreversibility at
all levels, from Newton to quantum mechanics. Such an objective can be achieved via the
following main rules:
(i) Identify the classical origin of irreversibility in the contact nonpotential forces
among extended particles, much along the historical teaching of Newton (1), Lagrange
(2) and Hamilton (3);
(ii) Represent said nonpotential forces via real-valued, nowhere singular, non-symmetric
genounits and construct a mathematics which is structurally irreversible for all reversible
Hamiltonians in the sense indicated earlier;
(iii) Achieve identical reformulation (4,34) of Hamilton’s equations with external terms
with a consistent algebra in the brackets of the time evolution of Lie-admissible type
according to Albert (7);
(iv) Complement the latter mechanics with the underlying genosymplectic geometry,
permitting the mapping of the classical formulations into operator formulations preserving
said Lie-admissible character; and
(v) Identify the origin of irreversibility in the most elementary layers of nature, such
as elementary particles in their irreversible motion in the interior of stars.
Note that a requirement for the above rules is the nonconservation of the energy and
other physical quantities, which is readily verified by the geno-Hamilton equations (4.34)
due to the lack of anti-symmetric character of brackets (A;B) of the time evolution.
An important application of genomechanics has been done by J. Ellis et al. (122)
who have shown that its Lie-admissibility provides an axiomatically consistent, direct
representation of irrebersibility in interior quasares structures.
In closing, it is hoped that Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s legacy of representing irreversibility
with the external terms in their analytic equations is seriously considered
because it implies covering theories with momentous advances in mathematics and all
quantitative sciences.

5. CONSTRUCTION OF HYPERMECHANICS FROM BIOLOGICAL
SYSTEMS
5.1: The scientific unbalance caused by biological systems. In this author’s
opinion, by far the biggest scientific unbalance of the 20-th century has been the treatment
of biological systems (herein denoting DNA, cells, organisms, etc.) via the mathematics
developed for inanimate matter.
The unbalance is due to the fact that conventional mathematics and related formulations,
such as quantum mechanics, are inapplicable for the treatment of biological systems
for various reasons. To begin, biological events, such as the growth of an organism, are
irreversible. Therefore, any treatment of biological systems via conventional reversible
mathematics and related physical formulations cannot pass the test of time. Quantum
mechanics is ideally suited for the treatment of the structure of the Hydrogen atom or of
crystals. These systems are represented by quantum mechanics as being ageless. Recall
also that quantum mechanics is unable to treat deformations because of incompatibilities
with basic formulations, such as the group of rotations. Therefore, the rigorous application
of quantum mechanics to biological structures implies that all organisms from cells
to humans are perfectly rigid and eternal.
5.2: The multivalued complexity of biological systems. Even after achieving
the invariant formulation of irreversibility outlined in the preceding section, it was easy
to see that the underlying genomathematics remains insufficient for in depth studies of
biological systems. Recent studies conducted by C. R. Illert (56) have pointed out that
the shape of sea shells can certainly be represented via conventional mathematics, such
as the Euclidean geometry. However, the latter is inapplicable for a representation of the
growth in time of sea shells. Computer simulations have shown that the imposition to sea
shell growth of conventional geometric axioms (e.g., those of the Euclidean or Riemannian
geometries) implies the lack of proper growth, as expected because said geometries are
strictly reversible, while the growth of sea shells is strictly irreversible.
The same studies by C. R. Illert (loc. cit.) have indicated the need of a mathematics
which is not only structurally irreversible, but also multi-dimensional. As an example,
C. R. Illert achieved a satisfactory representation of sea shells via the doubling of the
Euclidean reference axes, namely, a geometry which appears to be six-dimensional.
A basic problem in accepting such a view is the lack of compatibility with our sensory
perception. In fact, when holding sea shells in our hands, we can fully perceive their
shape as well as their growth with our three Eustachian tubes. In particular, our senses
are sufficiently sensitive to perceive deviations from the Euclidean space, as well as for
the possible presence of curvature.
These occurrences pose a rather challenging problem, the achievement of a representation
of the complexity of biological systems via the most general possible mathematics
which is: (1) is structurally irreversible (as in the preceding section); (2) admits the deformation
theory; (3) is invariant under the time evolution; (4) is multi-dimensional; and,
last but not least, (5) is compatible with our sensory perception.
68
Figure 4: An illustration of the fourth scientific unbalance of the 20-th century, the representation
of biological structures (including cells, organisms and their functions) via a mathematics
which is not only Hamiltonian and reversible, but also single valued, while said biological systems
require a mathematics which is not only nonhamiltonian and irreversible, but also multi-valued,
as illustrated by the growth of a sea shell which, besides not being representable with a Hamiltonian
and being irreversible, requires the doubling of all Euclidean reference axes.
A search in the mathematical literature revealed that a mathematics verifying all the
above five requirements did not exist and had to be constructed from the main features of
biological systems. As an example, hyperstructures in their current formulations (see Ref.
(96) lack a well defined left and right generalized unit even under their weak equalities,
they are not structurally irreversible, and lack invariance, thus not being suitable for
applications in biology.
5.3: Elements of hypermathematics. After numerous trials and errors, a yet broader
mathematics verifying the above five conditions was identified by R. M. Santilli in Ref.
(14) (see also Refs. (13,47) monograph (57)); it is today known under the name of
hypermathematics; and it is characterized by the following hyperunits here expressed for
the lifting of the Euclidean unit
I = Diag:(1; 1; 1) ! ˆI&gt;(t; x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) = Diag:(ˆI&gt;
1 ; ˆI&gt;
2 ; ˆI&gt;
3 ) =
= Diag:[(ˆI&gt;
11; ˆI&gt;
12; :::; ˆI&gt;
1m); (ˆI&gt;
21; ˆI&gt;
22; :::; ˆI&gt;
2m); (ˆI&gt;
31; ˆI&gt;
32; :::; ˆI&gt;
3m)] = 1= ˆ T&gt;;
I = Diag:(1; 1; :::; 1) !&lt; ˆI(t; x; v; Ã; @xÃ; :::) = Diag:(&lt; ˆI1;&lt; ˆI2;&lt; ˆI3) =
= Diag:[(&lt; ˆI11;&lt; ˆI12; :::;&lt; ˆI1m); (&lt; ˆI21;&lt; ˆI22; :::;&lt; ˆI2m);&lt; (ˆI31;&lt; ˆI32; :::;&lt; ˆI3m)] = 1=&lt; ˆ T;
ˆI&gt; = (&lt; ˆI)y; (5:1)
69
with corresponding ordered hyperproducts to the right and to the left as in Eqs. (4.3) and
identifies as in Eqs. (4.4) expressed in terms of ordinary equalities and operations. A
further broadening is then permitted by weak operations.
As one can see, the above mathematics is not 3m-dimensional, but rather it is 3-
dimensional and m-multi-valued. Such a feature permits the increase of the reference
axes, e.g., for m = 2 we have the six axes used by C. R. Illert (loc cit.), while achieving
compatibility with our sensory perception because at the abstract, realization-free level
the hypermathematics characterized by hyperunit (5.1) is indeed 3-dimensional.
The various branches of hypermathematics (hypernumbers, hyperspaces, hyperalgebras,
etc.) can be constructed via mere compatibility arguments with hyperunit (5.1) (see
monograph (57) for brevity. The isodual hypermathematics can be constructed via the
use of map (2.4).
A main difference of hypermathematics with the preceding formulations is that in
the latter the product of two numbers is indeed generalized but single-valued, e.g., 2 &gt;
3 = 346:765. By comparison, in hypermathematics the product of two numbers yields,
by conception, a set of values, e.g., 2 &gt; 3 = (12:678; 341:329; 891:556; :::). Such a feature
appears to be necessary for the representation of biological systems because the association
of two atoms in a DNA (mathematically representable with the hypermultiplication) can
yeld a large variety of different organs. This feature serves to indicate that the biological
world has a complexity simply beyond our imagination at this time, and that the study
of biological problems, such as understanding the DNA code via numbers dating back to
biblical times, is manifestly insufficient.
An important application of hyperformulations has already been indicated in Section
3.14, the achievement of compatibility between structure models of hadrons with ordinayr
massive particles as constituents in mutated conditions, and the SU(3)-color models of
classification, which compatibility is permitted by the assumption that quarks are composite,
thus admitting an hyperstructure with mutivalued hyperunits.
5.4: The complexity of hypertime and hyperrelativity for biological systems.
The reader should be aware that the complexity of biological structures requires the
use of hypermathematics as well as its isodual, e.g., for quantitative interpretations of
bifurcations. In fact, a quantitative interpretation of bifurcations, e.g., in sea shells,
requires four different hypertimes and their isoduals, as indicated below.
In turn, this is sufficient to illustrate the departure from conventional notions of a
relativity suitable for quantitative studies on biological systems, known as hyperrelativity
and its isodual (57). In fact, such new relativity requires the most general notion of
numbers, those with a multi-valued hyperunits characterized by an ordered, yet unlimited
number of non-Hermitean elements, with consequential most general possible geometries
and mechanics, plus their isoduals. This results in an ordered, yet unlimited variety
of spaces and their isoduals all coexisting in our three-dimensional Euclidean space, plus
corresponding, equally co-existing varieties of time. There is little doubt that such features
imply dramatic departures from the simplicity, thus insufficiency, of special relativity.
An illustration of the complexity of hyperformulations and corresponding hyperrelativ-
70
ity is given by the four different notions of hypertime which are needed for the description
of complex biological processes, such as bifurcations in seashells, all in a coexisting form
and each having a multi-valued character: motion forward in future time ˆt&gt;; motion
backward in past time &lt;ˆt; motion forward from past time &lt;ˆtd; and motion backward from
future time ˆt&gt;d. The necessity of these four directions in time also illustrates the need of
the isodual map.
5.5: Eric Trell’s hyperbiological structures. A new conception of biological systems,
which constitute a truly fundamental advance over rather simple prior conceptions, has
been recently proposed by Erik Trell (see Ref. (164) and contributions quoted therein).
It is based on representative blocks which appear in our space to be next to each other,
thus forming a cell or an organism, while having in reality hypercorrelations, thus having
the structure of hypernumbers, hypermathematics and hyperrelativity, with consequential
descriptive capacities immensely beyond those of pre-existing, generally single-valued and
reversible biological models. Regrettably, we cannot review Trell’s new hyperbiological
model to avoid an excessive length, and refer interested readers to the original literature
(164).

Figure 5: A schematic view of the main advances outlined in this memoir, from which all applications
uniquely follow, a progressive generalization of ”mathematics” (here referred to the
conventional formulation with left and right multiplicative unit defined over a field of characteristic
zero) for the description of matter in conditions of increasing complexity and methodological
needs, and their anti-isomorphic isoduals for corresponding progressive descriptions of antimatter.
The last line illustrates the lack of final character of mathematics and, therefore, of scientific
theories.
5.6: The lack of final character of all scientific theories. Main works of art, such as
Michelangelo’s Piet´a, remain unsurpassed with the passing of time. By comparison, scientific
theories, including mathematics, have a limited value in time, because, no matter
how advanced and valid a given formulation may appear to be, the discovery of its structural
generalizations is only a matter of time. Such a fate also holds for all generalized
formulations outline in this memoir. In fact, the further broadening of hyperrelativity via
71
the so-called weak operations is already within mathematical reach (13), the only missing
elements being future discoveries sufficient to motivate their use.

I. INTRODUCTION Studies initiated in the late 1970's under the support of the Department of Energy at Department of Mathematics of Harvard University by the theoretical physicists Ruggero Maria Santilli have indicated that current mathematical knowledge is generally dependent on the assumption of the simplest conceivable unit e which assumes either the numerical value e = +1, or the n-dimensional unit form e = diag. (1, 1, . . . , 1).

Systematic studies were then initiated for the reformulation of contemporary mathematical structures with respect to a generalized unit E of the same dimension of the original unit e (e.g., an nxn matrix) but with an arbitrary functional dependence on a local chart r, its derivatives with respect to an independent variable (e.g., time t) v = dr/dt, a = dv/dt, and and any other needed variable, 

(1) e -&gt; E = E(t, e, v, a, . . . ), 
under the conditions of being everywhere invertible and admitting e as a particular case.
Jointly, the conventional associative product axb among generic quantities a, b (e.g., numbers, vector fields, operators, etc.) is lifted into the form 

(2) axb -&gt; a*b = axTxb, T = 1/E, 
where T is fixed, and axT , Txb are the original associative products, in which case the quantity E = 1/T is indeed the correct left and right unit of the new theory, E*a = a*E = a for all elements a of the original set. To achieve consistency, the dual liftings 
(3) e -&gt; E(t, r, v, a, ... ), ab -&gt; a*b = axTxb, E = 1/T, 
must be applied to the totality of the original mathematical structure. 
By conception and construction, the new formulations are locally isomorphic to the original ones for all positive-definite generalized units E &gt; 0. As a result, maps (3) do not yield &quot;new mathematical axioms&quot;, but only &quot;new realizations&quot; of existing mathematical axioms and, for this reason, they were called &quot;isotopic&quot; in the Greek meaning of being &quot;axiom-preserving&quot;.

When E is no longer Hermitean (e.g., it is nowhere singular and real-valued but non-symmetric), then we have the general loss of the original axioms in favor of more general axioms (see below for examples) and, for this reason maps (3) were called &quot;genotopic&quot; from the Greek meaning of being &quot;axiom inducing&quot;. In this case we have two different units &lt;E = 1/R and E&gt; = 1/S, generally interconnected by the conjugation &lt;E = (E&gt;)Ý with corresponding ordered products to the left and to the right, 

(4a) &lt;E = 1/R, a&lt;b = AxRxb, 
(4b) E&gt; = 1/S, a&gt;b = AxSxb, R = SÝ. 

Additional classes of mathematical structures occur when the generalized units are multivalued, or subjected to anti-isomorphic conjugation (see below). 

The new lines of mathematical inquiries emerged from these studies imply novel formulations of: number theory, functional analysis, differential geometries, Lie’s theory, topology, etc. For example, ordinary numbers and angles, conventional and special functions and transforms, differential calculus, metric spaces, enveloping algebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups, representation theory, etc., must be all reformulated under isotopies for the generalized product a*b = axTxb in such a way to admit E(t, r,v, a, ... ) = 1/T as the new left and right unit, and a more general setting occurs under genotopies. 

To illustrate the nontriviality of these .liftings it is sufficient here to recall that Lie's theory with familiar product [A, B] = AxB -- BxA (where A, B are vector fields on a cotangent bundle or Hermitean operators on a Hilbert space, and AxB, BxA are conventional associative products), is linear, local-differential and potential-Hamiltonian, thus possessing clear limitations in its applications. 

The isotopies and genotopies of Lie's theory , called Lie-Santilli isotheory and genotheory, respectively, include the corresponding liftings of universal enveloping algebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups, transformation and representation theories, etc. and are based on the following corresponding generalized products first proposed by Santilli in 1978 

(5a) [A, B]* = A*B - B*A = AxT(t, r, ...)xB - BxT[t, r,...)xA, T = TÝ, 
(5b) (A, B) = A&lt;B - B&gt;A = AxR(t, r, ...)xB - BxS(t, r, ...)xA, R = SÝ, 

where product (5a) is &quot;axiom preserving&quot; in the sense of preserving the original Lie axioms, while product (5b) is &quot;axiom-inducing&quot; in the sense of violating Lie's axioms in favor of the more general axioms of Albert's Lie-admissible algebras (a generally nonassociative algebra U with abstract elements a, b, c, and product ab is said to be Lie-admissible when the attached antisymmetric algebra U_, which is the same vector space as U equipped with the product [a, b]U = ab - ba, is Lie). 
As expected, the theories with products (5a) and (5b) have been proved to provide an effective characterization of nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian systems of increasing complexity (the former applying for stable-reversible condiions, and the latter for open-irreversible conditions, see the next Web Page 19). Their consistent treatment requires corresponding new mathematics, called iso- and genlo-mathematics, respectively. For instance, it would be evidently inconsistent to define an algebra with generalized unit E(t, r, ...) = EÝ over a conventional field of numbers with trivial unit e = +1, and the same happens for functional analysis, differential calculus, geometries, etc. 

The studies initiated by Santilli were continued by numerous scholars including Gr. Tsagas, D. S. Sourlas, J. V. Kadeisvili, H. C. Myung, S. Okubo, S. I. Vacaru, B. Lin, D. Rapoport-Campodonico, R. Ohemke, A. K. Aringazin, M. Nishioka, G. M. Benkart, A. Kirukhin, J. Lohmus, J. M. Osborn, E. Paal, L. Sorgsepp, N. Kamiya, P. Nowosad, D. Juriev, C. Morosi, L. Pizzocchero,R.Aslander, S. Keles,and other scholars. A comprehensive list of contributions in related fields up to 1984 can be find in Tomber's Bibliography in Nonassociative Algebras, C. Baltzer et al., Editors, Hadronic Press, 1984. A bibliography on more recent contributions can be found in the monograph by J. Lohmus, A. Paal and L. Sorgsepp, Nonassociative Algebras in Physics, 1994, Hadronic Press (see Advanced Titles in Mathematics in this Web Site).

The mathematical nontriviality of the above studies is also illustrated by the fact that, at a deeper analysis, isotopies and genotopies imply the existence of SEVEN DIFFERENT LIFTINGS of current mathematical structures with a unit, each of which possess significant subclasses, as per the following outline: 

1) ISODUAL MATHEMATICS. It is characterized by the so-called isodual map, first introduced by Santilli in 1985 (see [I-1] for a recent account), given the lifting of a generic quantity a (a number, vector-field, operator, etc.) into its anti-Hermitean form 

(6) a -&gt; isod(a) = - aÝ,

which must also be applied, for consistency, to the totality of the original structure. This implies that the isodualities of conventional mathematics, called isodual mathematics, have a &quot;negative-definite unit&quot; and related new product, according to the liftings 
(7) e = 1 -&gt; E = - 1, axb -&gt; a*b = (-bÝ)x(-1)x(-aÝ) = - bÝxaÝ. 
The above maps permitted the identification of new numbers with negative unit -1 (see Problem 1 below). In turn, the identification of new numbers permitted the identification of new spaces, algebras, geometries, etc. Note that in this first lifting the unit remains the number 1 and only changes its sign.
Since the norm of isodual numbers is negative-definite, isodual mathematics has resulted to be useful for a novel representation of antimatter (see Page 19). 

The visitor should be aware that contemporary mathematics appears to be inapplicable for a physically consistent representation of antimatter at the CLASSICAL level, with corresponding predictable shortcomings at the particle level. In fact,we only have today one type of quantization, e.g., the symplectic quantization. As a result, the operator image of contemporary mathematical treatments of antimatter does not yield the needed charge conjugate state. At any rate, the map from matter to antimatter must be anti-automorphic (or, more generally,anti-isomorphic), as it is the case for charge conjugation in second quantization. 

The only known map verifying these conditions at all levels of treatment is Santilli's isodual map (6). This yields a novel classical representation of antimatter with a corresponding novel isodual quantization which does indeed yield the correct charge conjugate state of particles (see Web Page 19). Thus, the isodual mathematics resolves the historical lack of equivalence in the treatment between matter and antimatter according to which the former is treated at all levels, from classical mechanics to quantum, field theories, while the latter was treated only at the level of second quantization. 

To understand the implications, the visitor should keep in mind that contemporary mathematics does not appear to be applicable for an effective treatment of antimatter, thus requiring its reconstruction in an anti-isomorphic form. 

2, 3) ISOTOPIC MATHEMATICS AND ITS ISODUAL. The isotopic mathematics or isomathematics for short [I-1] is today referred to formulations for which the generalized unit E, called isounit, has a nontrivial functional dependence and it is Hermitian, E = E(t, r, v, ...) = EÝ. An important case is the Lie-Santilli isotheory with basic isoproduct (5a). 

The isodual isotopic mathematics is the image of the isomathematics under maps (6) and therefore has the unit isod(E) = -EÝ = -E. 

These structures have been classified by the theoretical physicist J. V. Kadeisvili in 1991 into: 

CLASS I, when E is positive-definite (isotopies),
CLASS II when E is negative definite (isodualities),
CLASS III, given by the union of Classes I and II,
CLASS IV, including the preceding classes plus null values of E (or singular values of T), and
CLASS V, when E is arbitrary, e.g., a step-function or a distribution.

At this writing only Classes I, II and III have been preliminarily studied, while the remaining Classes IV and V are vastly unknown. 
4, 5) GENOTOPIC MATHEMATICS AND ITS ISODUAL. The isotopies were proposed in 1978 as particular cases of the broader genotopies [I-1], which are characterized by two different generalized units &lt;E = 1/R and E&gt; = 1/S for the genomultiplication to the left and to the right according to Eqs. (4). The resulting genotopic mathematics, or genomathematics for short, is given by a duplication of the isomathematics, one for ordered products to the left and the other to the right. 

The isodual genomathematics is the isodual image of the preceding one, and it is characterized by the systematic application of map (6) to each of the left and right genomathematics. 

In an evening seminar delivered at ICM94 Santilli proved that the genotopies can also be axiom-preserving and can therefore provide a still broader realization of known axioms. The proof was presented for product (5b) which, when considered on ordinary spaces and fields with the conventional unit e, is known to verify Albert’s axiom of Lie-admissibility. The same product was proved to verify the Lie axiom when each of the two terms A&lt;B and B&gt;A is computed in the appropriate genoenvelope and genofield with the corresponding genounit. 

6, 7) HYPERSTRUCTURAL MATHEMATICS AND ITS ISODUAL. At the IBR meeting on multivalued hyperstructures held at the Castle Prince Pignatelli in August 1995, the mathematician Thomas Vougiouklis and R. M. Santilli presented a new class of hyperstructures, those with well defined hyperunits characterized by hyperoperations. A subclass of the latter hyperstructures important for applications is that with hyperunits characterized by ordered sets of non-Hermitean elements, 

(8a) &lt;E = {&lt;A, &lt;B, ...} = 1/R = {1/R1, 1/R2, ...}, 
(8b) E&gt; = {A&gt;, B&gt;, ... } = 1/S = {1/S1, 1/S2, ...}, 

with corresponding multivalued hypermultiplications a&lt;b = axRxb and a&gt;b = axSxb. The latter structures evidently permit a third layer of generalized formulations which are also axiom-preserving when treated with the appropriate hypermathematics. The isodual hypermathematics is the isodual image of the above hypermathematics and is therefore itself multivalued. 
Needless to say, the above studies are in their first infancy and so much remains to be done.

The material of this Web Page is organized following the guidelines of memoir [I-1] according to which there cannot be really new applications without really new mathematics, and there cannot be really new mathematics without new numbers. We shall therefore give utmost priority to the lifting of numbers according to the above indicated seven different classes. All remaining generalized formulations can be constructed from the novel base fields via mere compatibility arguments. 

We shall then study the novel spaces and geometries which can be constructed over the new fields because geometries have the remarkable capability of reducing the ultimate meaning of both mathematical and physical structures to primitive, abstract, geometric axioms.

We shall then study: the generalized functional analysis which can be constructed on the preceding structures, beginning from Kadeisvili’s new notions of continuity; the all fundamental Lie-Santilli theory; the underlying novel Tsagas-Sourlas integro-differential topology; and other aspects. 

Only primary references with large bibliography are provided per each section. Subsequent calls to references of preceding sections are indicated with [I-1], [II-1], etc.

II: OPEN RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 

Prepared by the IBR staff.
PROBLEM II.1: STUDIES ON THE ISODUAL NUMBER THEORY 
DEFINITION II.1: Let F = F(a,+,x) be a conventional field of (real R, complex C or quaternionic Q) numbers a with additive unit 0, multiplicative unit e = 1, sum a+b and product axb. Santilli’s isodual field [II-1] isodF = isodF(isoda, isod+,isodx) is a ring of elements isoda = -aÝ, called isodual numbers, with isodual sum (isoda)isod+(isodb) = (-aÝ-bÝ) and isodual multiplication (isoda)isodx(isodb) = (-aÝ)(-1)(-bÝ) = -(aÝ)(bÝ) under which the additive unit is isisod0 = 0 and the multiplicative unit is isode = -e = -1.
LEMMA II-1 [II-1]: The isodual field is a field (i.e., it verifies all axioms of a field).

PROPOSITION II-1 [loc. cit.]: The map F -&gt; isodF is anti-isomorphic.

PROPOSED RESEARCH II-1: Study the isodual number theory, including theorems on prime, factorization, etc.

SIGNIFICANCE: Isodual numbers have a negative norm, thus being useful to represent antimatter.

PROBLEMS II-2/II-3: STUDIED IN ISOFIELD THEORY AND ITS ISODUAL 
DEFINITION II-2: Let F = F(a,+,x) be a conventional field of (real R, complex C or quaternionic Q) numbers a with additive unit 0, multiplicative unit e = 1, sum a+b and product axb. Santilli’s isofields [II-1] F* = F*(a*,+*,x*) are rings of elements a* =axE called isonumbers, where a is an element of F, axE is the multiplication in F, and E = 1/T is a well behaved, everywhere invertible, Hermitean and positive-definite quantity (e.g., a matrix, vector field, operator, etc. of Kadeisvili’s Class I) generally outside the original field F, equipped with the isotopic sum a*+*b* = (a+b)xE and product a*x*b* = a*xTxb* = (axb)xE, with additive unit 0* = 0 and multiplicative unit E, called isounit. Santilli’s isodual isofields isodF*(isoda*,isod+*,isodx*) are the anti-Hermitean images of F* under the isodualities of the elements of F* and all its operations.
LEMMA II-2 [II-2]: Isofields verify all axioms of a field (including closure under the combined associative and distributive laws). The lifting F -&gt; F* is therefore an isotopy.

PROPOSITION II-2 (ref.[II-1], p. 284): When E is an element of the original field F (e.g., an ordinary real number for F = R), the isofield F*(a,+*,x*) is also a field (i.e., closure occurs for conventional numbers a without need to use the isonumbers a* = axE).

PROPOSED RESEARCH II-2: Formulate the real isonumber theory: 1) with a basic unit given by an arbitrary, positive, real number E = n &gt; 0; and 2) under isoduality to a negative-definite unit isodE = -n &lt; 0. These problems can be studied via the simplest possible class of Santilli isofields R*(a,+*,x*) and their isoduals isodR*(isoda,isod+*,isodx*) in which the elements a are not lifted, as per Proposition II.2 above. The study implies the re-inspection of all conventional properties of number theory in order to ascertain which one is dependent on the selected unit. As an example, it is known that the notion of prime depends on the selected unit [II-1] because, e.g., the number 4 becomes prime for the isounit E = 3.

SIGNIFICANCE: An important advance of memoir [II-1] is that the axioms of a field need not to be restricted to the simplest possible unit +1 dating back to biblical times, because they equally hold for arbitrary units. This basic property has far reaching implications. In mathematics the property implies the lifting of all structures defined on numbers; in physics the broadening of the unit implies basically novel applications (See the subsequent Web Page 19 on Open Research Problems in Physics); and in biology it implies a structural revision of current theories (see the subsequent Web Page 20 on Open Research Problems in Biology).

PROBLEM II-4/II-5: STUDIES ON GENONUMBERS THEORY AND ITS ISODUAL 
DEFINITION II-3: Let F = F(a,+,x) be a conventional field of (real, complex C or quaternionic Q) numbers a with additive unit 0, multiplicative unit e = 1, sum a+b and product axb. Santilli’s genofields to the right [II-1] F&gt; = F&gt;(a&gt;,+&gt;,x&gt;) are rings of elements a&gt; = axE&gt; called genonumbers, where a is an element of F, axE&gt; is the multiplication in F, and E&gt; = 1/S is a well behaved, everywhere invertible and non-Hermitean quantity generally outside F, equipped with all operations ordered to the right, i.e., the ordered genosum to the right (a&gt;)+&gt;(b&gt;) = (a+b)xE&gt;, the ordered genoproduct to the right (a&gt;)&gt;(b&gt;) = (a&gt;)xSx(b&gt;) = (axb)xE&gt;, etc., conventional additive unit to the right 0&gt; = 0 and generalized (left and right) unit E&gt; for the multiplication to the right called genounit. Santilli’s genofields to the left &lt;F(&lt;a,&lt;+,&lt;) are rings with genonumbers &lt;a = &lt;Exa, all operations ordered to the left, such as genosum (&lt;a)&lt;+(&lt;b) = &lt;Ex(a+b), genoproduct (&lt;a)&lt;(&lt;b) = &lt;Ex(axb), etc., with genoadditive unit to the left &lt;0 = 0 and multiplicative genounit to the left &lt;E = 1/R which is generally different than that the right. The isodual left and right genofields are the isodual images of the left and right genofields.
REMARKS: In the definition of fields and isofields there is no ordering of the multiplication in the sense that in the products axb and a*b one can either select a multiplying b from the left , a&gt;b or b multiplying a from the right a&lt;b, because a&gt;b = a&lt;b (even for non-commutative fields such as quaternions). A genofield requires that all multiplications and related operations (e.g., division, etc.) be ordered EITHER to the right OR to the left because now, e.g., for a commutative field F = R or C, we have the properties a&gt;b = b&gt;a and a&lt;b = b&lt;a, but in general a&gt;b ‚ a&lt;b. Note that in each case the genounit is the left and right unit because (E&gt;)&gt;(a&gt;) = (a&gt;)&gt;(E&gt;) = a&gt; for all possible a&gt;.

LEMMA II-3 [II-1]: Each individual genofield to the right F&gt; or to the left &lt;F is a field. Thus each lifting F -&gt; F&gt; and F -&gt; &lt;F is an isotopy.

PROPOSITION II-3 [II-1]: When E&gt; and &lt;E are elements of an ordinary field F, each genofield F&gt;(a,+&gt;,x&gt;) and &lt;F(a,&lt;+,&lt;x) is a field.

PROPOSED RESEARCH II-4/II-5: Formulate the number theory with 1) a basic unit given by a positive real number E&gt; = n in which all operations are ordered to the right; 2) formulate the same theory under an ordering to the left with a different positive-definite genounit &lt;E = b; 3) construct the isoduals of both theories. These problems can be studied via the simplest possible class of Santilli genofields F&gt;(a,+&gt;,x&gt;) and &lt;F(a,&lt;+,&lt;x) in which the elements are not lifted, as per Proposition II-3 above. The study implies the re-inspection of all conventional properties of the isonumber theory.

SIGNIFICANCE: Another significant advance of memoir [II-1] is that the axioms of a field, not only do not need the restriction to the unit +1, but the operations can be all restricted to be EITHER to the right OR to the left. This simple property has additional far reaching mathematical, physical and biological implications. In mathematics, it implies a dual lifting of all isotopic structures. In physics it implies an axiomatic representation of the irreversibility of the physical world via the most fundamental mathematical notion, the unit. In fact, operations ordered to the right can represent motion forward in time, while operations ordered to the left can represent motion backward in time. 

Irreversibility is then reduced to the differences between E&gt; and &lt;E or, equivalently, between a&gt;b and a&lt;b. The inclusion of the isodualities implies the capability to represent all possible four different motions in time: motion forward to future time E&gt;, motion backward to past time &lt;E, motion forward from past time isod(&lt;E), and motion backward from future time isod(E&gt;). In theoretical biology, Santilli’s genonumbers are the foundation of the first known consistent mathematical representation of the irreversibility of biological structures. The addition of isoduality then permits the mathematical representation of certain bifurcations in biology whose treatment is simply beyond conventional mathematics.

PROBLEM II-6/II-7: STUDIES IN HYPERNUMBER THEORY AND ITS ISODUAL 
Repeat the studies of Problem II-4/II-5 but for the case when the genounits to the right and to the left and given by an ordered set of nonhermitean invertible elements equipped, first, with conventional and, then, with hyperoperations.

III: OPEN PROBLEM IN GEOMETRIES 

Prepared by the IBR staff.
PROBLEM III.1: STUDIES IN ISODUAL GEOMETRIES 
DEFINITION III-1: Let S = S(r,g,R) be a conventional n-dimensional metric or pseudo-metric space with local chart r, nowhere singular, real-valued and symmetric metric g and invariant (rt)xgxr (where rt denotes transposed of r) over a conventional field R = R(a,+,x) of real numbers. Santilli’s isodual spaces isodS = isodS(isodr,isodg,isodR) is the vector space with local chart isodr = -r, isodual metric isodg = -g and isodual invariant (isodrt)x(isodg)x(isodr) = [(rt)xgxr](isode) on isodR. Isaodual geometries are the geometries on isodual spaces, thus based on negative-definite units. 
PROPOSITIONS III-1 [I-1]: Isodual spaces are anti-isomorphic to the original space. 

PROPOSED RESEARCH III-1: Study the isodual Euclidean, isodual Minkowskian, isodual Riemannian, isodual symplectic and other isodual geometries, including the isodual calculus, the isodual sphere (i.e., the sphere with negative radius), the isodual light cone, etc. [I-1]. 

SIGNIFICANCE: Isodual geometries are fundamental for the recent isodual representation of antimatter, e.g., to characterize the shape of an antiparticle with negative units.

PROBLEMS III-2/III-3: STUDIES ON ISOGEOMETRIES AND THEIR ISODUALS 

DEFINITION III-2: Let S = S(r,g,R) be a conventional n-dimensional metric or pseudo-metric space with local chart r, nowhere singular, real-valued and symmetric metric g and invariant (rt)xgxr (where rt denotes transposed) over a conventional real field R = R(a,+,x). Santilli’s isospaces [I-1] S*(r*,G*,R*) are vector spaces with local isocoordinates r* = rxE, isometric G* = g*xE = TxgxE and isoinvariant (r*t)*G*r* = [(rt)x(g*)xr]xE over an isofield R* = R*(a*,+*,x*) with a common isounit E = 1/T of Kadeisvili Class I. Santilli’s isogeometries [III-1] are the geometries of isospaces. The isodual isospaces and isodual isogeometries are the corresponding images under isoduality [I-1,III-1].
LEMMA III-2 [I-1,III-1]: Isospaces S*(x*,G*,F*) are locally isomorphic to the original space S(x,g,F). The lifting S -&gt; S* is therefore an isotopy.

Proof. Each component of the metric g is lifted by the corresponding element of T, while the unit is lifted by the corresponding inverse amount E = 1/T, thus preserving the original geometric axioms.q.e.d. 

PROPOSITION III-3 [III-2]: The axioms of the Euclidean geometry in n-dimension admit as particular cases all possible well behaved, real-valued, symmetric and positive-definite metrics of the same dimension. 

REMARKS.To be consistently defined, Santilli’s isogeometries require the isotopies of the totality of the mathematical aspects of the original geometry, all formulated for a common isounit E with the same dimension of the isospace. This requires, not only the isotopies of fields and vector spaces, but also those of all other aspects. 

PROBLEM III-2/III-3: 
Provide a mathematical formulation of Santilli’s isoeuclidean, isominkowskian, isoriemannian, isosymplectic and other isogeometries and their isoduals which have been only preliminarily studied for physicists in ref. [III-1]. 
SIGNIFICANCE: The mathematical and physical implications are significant indeed. Mathematically, the studies permit advances such as: the unification of all geometries of the same dimension into one single isotope; the admission under the Riemannian axioms of metric with arbitrary, nonlinear, integro-differential dependence in the velocities and other variables; the representation of nonhamiltonian vector-fields in the local chart of the observer (see the alternative to Darboux’s theorem, ref. [I-1], p. 63 motivated by the fact that, in view of their nonlinearity, Darboux’s transforms cannot be used in physics because the transformed frames cannot be realized in experiments and, in any case, they violate the axioms of Galilei’s and Einstein’s special relativity due to their highly noninertial character). Physically, the studies permit truly basic advances, such as the first quantitative research on the origin of the gravitational field, a geometric unification of the special and general relativity via the isominkowskian geometry in which the isometric is a conventional Riemannian metric, a novel operator formulation of gravity verifying conventional quantum axioms; and other advances (see Web Pages 19 and 20).

PROBLEMS III-4/III-5: STUDIES ON GENOGEOMETRIES AND THEIR ISODUALS 
DEFINITION III-3: Let S = S(r,g,R) be a conventional n-dimensional metric or pseudo-metric space with local chart r, nowhere singular, real-valued and symmetric metric g and invariant (rt)xgxr over a conventional real field R = R(a,+,x). Santilli’s n-dimensional genospaces to the right [I-1] S&gt;(r&gt;,G&gt;,R&gt;) are vector spaces with local genocoordinates to the right r&gt; = rxE&gt;, genometric G&gt; = (g&gt;)x(E&gt;) = SxgxE&gt;, genoinvariant (r&gt;t)&gt;(G&gt;)(r&gt;) = [(rt)x(g&gt;)xr]xE&gt; over the genofield R&gt; = R&gt;(a&gt;,+&gt;,x&gt;), common genounit to the right E&gt; = 1/S given by an everywhere invertible, real-valued, non-symmetric nxn matrix, and all operations ordered to the right. Santilli’s genogeometries [III-1] are the geometries of genospaces. The isodual genospaces and isodual genogeometries are the corresponding images under isoduality [I-1,III-2]. Santilli’s n-dimensional genospaces to the left [I-1] &lt;S(&lt;r,&lt;+,&lt;R) are genospaces over genofields with all operations ordered to the left and a common nxn-dimensional genounit to the left &lt;E = 1/R which is generally different than that to the right E&gt; = 1/S. Genogeometries to the left and their isoduals are the geometries over the corresponding genospaces.
LEMMA III-3: Genospaces to the right S&gt; and, independently, those to the left &lt;S, are locally isomorphic to the original spaces S. Proof. The original metric g is lifted in the form g -&gt; Sxg, but the unit is lifted by the inverse amount I -&gt; E = 1/S, thus preserving the original axioms. q.e.d.

PROPOSED RESEARCH: Provide a mathematical formulation of Santilli’s genoeuclidean, genominkowskian, genoriemannian, genosymplectic and other genogeometries to the left, their corresponding forms to the right and their isoduals which have been preliminarily studied in ref. [III-1] for physicists.

SIGNIFICANCE: Another important aspect of memoir [I-1] is that the Riemannian axioms do not necessarily need a symmetric metric because the metrics can also be nonsymmetric with structure g&gt; = Sxg, S nonsymmetric, provided that the geometry is formulated on an isofield with isounit given by the INVERSE of the nonsymmetric part, E = 1/S, and the same occurs for the left case. This property has permitted the first quantitative studies on irreversibility of interior gravitational problems via the conventional Riemannian axioms, as it occurs in the physical reality, e.g., the irreversibility of the structure of Jupiter or of a collapsing star, for which purpose the genogeometries were constructed in the first place [III-1].

PROBLEMS III-6/III-7: STUDIES ON HYPERGEOMETRIES AND THEIR ISODUALS 
Extend the studies of the genogeometries to the right and to the left to the case when the corresponding genounits are given by an ordered set of invertible, real-valued and nonsymmetric nxn elements, first, with ordinary operations and then with hyperoperations. 
The existence of these geometries has been only indicated in ref. [I-1] without any detailed treatment.

IV: OPEN RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS 

Conventional and special functions and transforms and functional analysis at large are dependent on the assumed basic unit. As an example, a change of the two-dimensional unit of the Gauss plane implies a change in the very definition of angles and trigonometric functions, and the same happens for hyperbolic functions, Fourier, Laplace and other transforms, Dirac and other distributions, etc.
To be operational, the seven classes of novel mathematical methods of the preceding sections require seven corresponding generalized forms of functional analysis, which are here recommended for study in a progressive way, beginning with the simplest possible case of isoduality.

Mathematical work done to date in these new topics has been rather limited. We here mention: Santilli has preliminarily studied the structure of the seven forms of differential calculus [I-1], isotrigonometric and isohyperbolic functions, the isofourier transforms and few other aspects {III-1]; Kadeisvili [IV-1,2] has studied basic definitions of isocontinuity and its isodual and reinspected some of the studies in the field; H. C. Myung and R. M. Santilli [IV-3] studied the isotopies of the Hilbert space, Dirac delta distributions and few other notions; A. K. Aringazin, D. A. Kirukhin and R. M. Santilli [IV-4] have studied the isotopies of Legendre, Jacobi and Bessel functions and their isoduals; M. Nishioka [IV-5] studied the Dirac-Myung-Santilli isodelta distribution (see [III-1] for a review up to 1995).

V. STUDIES ON THE LIE-SANTILLI ISO-, GENO- AND HYPER-THEORIES AND THEIR ISODUALS 

Prepared by the IBR staff
PROBLEM V-1: STUDIES ON THE ISODUAL LIE THEORY 
DEFINITION V-1: Let L be an n-dimensional Lie algebra with ordered Hermitean basis X = {A,B, ...} = XÝ, conventional commutator [A, B] = AxB - BxA (where AxB is conventionally associative) over a field F (of characteristics zero). A Lie-Santilli isodual algebra [I-1] isodL is the image of L under the isodual map (5), thus including isodual generators isodX = -XÝ = -X, isodual commutator isod[A, B] = (isodA)isodx(isodB) - (isodB)isodx(isodA) = - [A, B], etc., all defined on an iusodualF with negative-definite unit E = -Diag. (1, 1, ..., 1), and norm. 
LEMMA V-1 [I-1]: IsodL is anti-isomorphic to L. 

PROPOSED RESEARCH V-1: Reformulate Lie's theory (enveloping associative algebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups, transformation and representation theories, etc.) for the Lie-Santilli isodual theory with an n-dimensional negative-definite unit E = - Diag(1, 1, ... 1). 

SIGNIFICANCE: Isodual symmetries characterize antiparticles.

PROBLEM V-2/V-3: STUDIES ON LIE-SANTILLI ISOTHEORY AND ITS ISODUAL 
DEFINITION V-2: Let U(L) be the enveloping associative algebra of a Lie algebra L with infinite-dimensional basis (Poincare’-Birkhoff-Witt theorem) 1, X, (Xi)x(Xj )(i ¾ j), .. and conventional exponentiation expA = 1 + A/1! + AxA/2! + ...over a field F. Santilli’s universal enveloping isoassociative algebra U*(L) of L [V-1] of Class I is characterized by the isotopies of the Poincare’-Birkhoff-Witt theorem) with infinite-dimensional isobasis 
(9) E, X, (Xi)*(Xj) (i ¾ j), ..., 


where the isounit E = 1/T is of Kaidesvilki Class I (positive-definite) has the same dimension of the representation at hand and A*B = AxTxB, with base isofield F* characterized by the same isounit E of U*(L). The isodual isoassociative envelope is the image of U* under isoduality.
REMARKS. The conventional exponentiation is no longer applicable for U*(L) and must be replaced by the isoexponentiation 

(10) isoexpA = E + A/1! + A*A/2! + ... = {exp(AxT)}xE = Ex{exp(TxA)}. 


The symbol U*(L) rather than U*(L*) is used to indicate that the basis X of L is unchanged under isotopy and merely redefined in isospace,thus X* = X. This is the most significant case on physical grounds because generators of Lie symmetries represent quantities such as energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, etc. which, as such, cannot be changed. Only the operations defined in them can be changed.
Since Lie’s theory leaves invariant its basic unit, the functional dependence of the isounit E is left unrestricted and, therefore, can depend on an independent variable t (say time), local chart r of the carrier space, its derivatives v = dr/dt, a = dv/dt and any other needed variable, E = E(t, r, v, a, ...) = 1/T. The nontriviality of the Lie-santilli isotheory can therefore be seen up-front because it implies the appearance of a nonlinear, integro-differential element T in the EXPONENT of the group structure, Eq. (10).

DEFINITION V-3. Let L be an n-dimensional Lie algebra as per Definition V-1. A Lie-Santilli isoalgebra [V-1] L* of Class I is the algebra homeomorphic to the antisymmetric algebra [U*(L)]- of U*(L). It can be defined as an isovector space with the same ordered basic X* = X of L equipped with the isoproduct 

(11) [A, B]* = A*B - B*A = AxT(t, r, v, a, ...)xB - BxT(t, r, v, a, ...)xA 


REMARKS. Lie-Santilli isoalgebras verify the conventional Lie axioms (anti-commutativity of the product and Jacobi identify), only formulated in isospace (that is, with respect to the isoassociative produce A*B) over the isofield F*. 
LEMMA V-3 [III-1]: Lie-Santilli isoalgebras are left and right isolinear, i.e., they verify the left linearity conditions on L* as an isovector space over F*, 

(12a) {[(a*)*A* + (b*)*B*, C*]* = (a*)*[A*,B*]* + (b*)*[B*, C*]* 

(12b) [(A*)*B*, C*] = (A*)*[B*, C*]* + [A*, C*]*(B*) 


and corresponding right conditions. Isoalgebras L* are isolocal (in the sense of being everywhere local-differential except at the isounit E) and isocanonical (in the sense of admitting a canonical structure in isospace, see [III-1] for brevity). 
DEFINITION V-4: Let G be an n-dimensional connected Lie transformation group r’ = K(w)xr on a space S(r,F), where w are the parameters in F, verifying the usual conditions (differentiability of the map GxS -&gt; S, invariance of the basic unit e = I, and linearity), as well as the conditions to be derived from the Lie algebra L via exponentiation 

(13a) Q(w) = {exp(ixXxw)} x Q(0) x {exp(-ixwxX)} 

(13b) i [Q(dw) - Q(0) ] / dw = QxX - XxQ = [ Q, X]. 


A connected Lie-Santilli isotransformation group [V-1] G* of Class I is the set of isotransforms 
(14) r*’ = Q*(w*)] * (r*) = [Q*[w*)] x T(t, r, v, a, ...) x r 


on a Class I isospace S*(r*,F*), where now the isoparameters w* = wxE belong to F*, which verifies the usual conditions in their isotopic form (Kadeisvili’s isodifferentiability of the isomap (G*)*S* -&gt; S*, invariance of the isounit E, and isolinearity), as well as the conditions to be derivable from the Lie-Santilli isoalgebra L* [V-1] 
(15a) Q*(w*) = {isoexp[i(X*)*(w*)]} * [Q*(0)] * {isoexp[-i(w*)*(X*)]} = 

= { exp (i X x T x w) } x Q*(0) x { exp(-iwTX) }, 

(15b) i [Q*(dw*) - Q*(0) ] / dw* = (Q*) *(X*) - (X*) * (Q*) = [ Q*, X*]* 


with isogroup laws [V-1] 
(16) [Q*(w*)]*[Q*(w*’)] = Q*(w* + w*’] , [Q*(w*)]*[Q*(-w*)] = Q*(0*) = E 


The isodual Lie-Santilli isogroups isodG* are the isodual image of G* under map (5). 
LEMMA V-3 [V-1]: Lie-Santilli isoenvelopes U*, isoalgebras L* and isogroup G* are locally isomorphic to the original structures U, L, and G, respectively for all possible positive-definite isounit E (not so otehrwise). The liftings 

(17) U -&gt; U*, L -&gt; L* and G -&gt; G* 


are therefore isotopies. 
PROPOSED RESEARCH V-2: Conduct mathematical studies on the Lie-Santilli isotheory of Class I and its isodual with particular reference to: the isostructure theory; the isorepresentation theory; and related aspects. 

REMARKS. At the abstract, realization-free level, isoenvelopes U*, isoalgebras L* and isogroups G* coincide with the conventional envelopes U, algebras L and groups G, respectively, by conception and construction for all positive-definite isounits E (not necessarily so otherwise). This illustrates the insistence by Santilli in indicating that the isotopies do not produce new mathematical structures, but only new realizations of existing abstract axioms. 


As a result of the, the isorepresentation theory of U, L and G on isospaces over isofields is expected to coincide with the conventional representations of the original structures U, L and G on conventional spaces over conventional fields. The aspect of the isorepresentation theory which is important for applications is the PROJECTION of the isorepresentation on conventional spaces. Stated differently, Lie’s theory admits only one formulation, the conventional one. On the contrary, the covering Lie-Santilli isotheory admits two formulations, one in isospace over isofield and one given by its projection on conventional spaces over conventional fields. 

The latter are important for applications, e.g., because the physical space-time is the conventional Minkowski space, while the isominkowski space is a mathematical construction. As a result, the isorepresentation theory of the Poincare’-Santilli isosymmetry [V-4] on isominkowski space over isofields is expected to coincide with that of the conventional symmetry on the conventional Minkowski space over the conventional field of real numbers. The mathematically and physically significant aspects are given by the PROJECTION of the isorepresentation on the conventional Minkowski space-time. 

SIGNIFICANCE: The isotheory characterizes all infinitely possible, well behaved, arbitrarily nonlinear, nonlocal-integral and nonhamiltonian, classical and operator systems by reducing them to identical isolinear, isolocal and isocanonical forms in isospaces over isofields, thus permitting a significant simplification of notoriously complex structures. 

PROPOSED RESEARCH V-3: Study the Lie-Santilli isotheories of Classes III (union of Class I with positive-definite and II with negative definite isounits E), Class IV (Class III plus null isounit E) and Class V arbitrary isounits E, including discontinuous realzioations). As a particular case unify all simple Lie algebras of the same dimension in Cartan's classification into one single isoalgebra of the same dimension of Class III, whose study has been initiated by Tsagas and Sourlas [V-4].

REMARK 1. In his original proposal on the isotopies of Lie's theory of 1978 (see the references inn [V-1]), Santilli proved the loss at the abstract level of all distinction between compact and noncompact Lie algebras of the same dimension provided that the isounit has an arbitrary positive- or negative-definite signature (Class III). This was illustrated via the algebra of the rotation group in three dimension O(3). When its conventional generators X1, X2, X3 (the components of the angular momentum) are equipped with the isounit E = Diag. (+1, +1., -1) and isoproduct (11) they characterize the noncompact O(2.1) algebra. The isoalgebra O*(3) with the fixed generators X1, X2, X3 equipped with isoproduct (11) and a isotopic element T of Class III therefore unifies all simple Lie algebras of dimension 3. This result has been proved to hold also for all orthogonal and unitary algebras, and it is expected to hold for all possible Lie algebras, including the exceptional ones. 

REMARK 2. As indicated in the subsequent Web Page 19, the zeros of the isounit represent gravitational singularities. The study of the Lie-Santilli theory of Class IV is therefore important for applications. No study in on record at this writing in this field which requires the prior study of numbers, spaces, geometries, etc., whose units can be psoitive, negative as wel as null. No study is also on record on the isotoppies of Class V.

IMPORTANT NOTE. Visitors of this page should be aware that the treatment of the isoproduct [A, B]* = AxTxB - BxTxA on conventional spaces over conventional fields is not invariant under the group action and, as such, it has no known physical value. In fact, when realized on a Hilbert space over a conventional field, isogroups G* are characterized by nonunitary transforms WWÝ ‚ I. As a result, the base unit of a conventional treatment of the isoproduct [A, B]* is not left invariant by the isogroup, I -&gt; I’ = WxIxWÝ ‚ I, and, consequently, the isoproduct itself is not invariant, [A, B]* -&gt; Wx[A, B]*xWÝ = A’xT’xB’ - B’xT’xA’, where T’ = (WÝ to -1)xTx(W to -1) ‚ T. The loss of the traditional invariance of Lie’s theory then implies the lack of meaningful applications. 

On the contrary, when treated via the isotopic mathematics, that is, formulated on isospaces over isofields, the isoproduct [A, B]* is fully invariant. For instance, by considering again the operator realization, the originally nonunitary structure of G* is turned into identical isounitary forms, i.e., we can write W = (W*)x(square root of T) for which WxWÝ = (W*)*(W*Ý) = (W*Ý)*(W*) = E, in which vase the base isounit E of the isofield is invariant, E -&gt; E’ = (W*)*E*(W*Ý) = (W*)*(W*Ý) = E, and the isoproduct is consequently invariant, (W*)*[A, B]*x(W*Ý) = A’xTxB’ - B’xTxA’, where one should note that T is numerically preserved. The above occurrence illustrate the necessity of using Santilli’s isonumbers and isospaces for meaningful applications.

PROBLEM V-4/V-5: STUDIES ON LIE-SANTILLI GENOTHEORY AND ITS ISODUAL 
HISTORICAL NOTE: Lie algebras are &quot;nonassociative&quot; in the sense that their product [A, B] = AxB - BxA is nonassociative. Yet their representations are reduced to those of their universal enveloping associative algebras U(L) with product AxB because of the homeomorphism between L and the attached antisymmetric algebra U(L)-.
In 1948 the American mathematician A. A. Albert (Trans. Amer. Mat. Soc. Vol. 64, p. 552, 1948) introduced the notion of Lie-admissible algebras (presented in Sect. I and called the First Condition of Lie-admissibility). The formulation was done within the context of nonassociative algebras, in which context they have been studied by various mathematicians until recently. Also, Albert was primarily interested in the &quot;Jordan content&quot; of a given &quot;nonassociative&quot; algebra and, for this reason, he studied the product (a, b) = pxaxb + (1-p)xbxa, where p is a real parameter, which admits the commutative Jordan product for p = 1/2. 

In 1967 Santilli (Nuovo Cimento Vol 51, p. 570, 1967) was the first physicist to study Lie-admissible algebras. He noted that Albert's definition did not admit Lie algebras in their classification and, for this reason, the algebras had limitations in physical applications. He therefore introduced a new notion of Lie-admissibility which is Albert's definition plus the condition of admitting Lie algebras in their classification (this is called the Second Condition of Lie-admissibility). In particular, Santilli studied the product (a,b) = pxaxb - qxbxa, where p, q, and p+or-q are non-null parameters, which does indeed admit the conventional Lie product as a (nondegenerate) particular case, and which constitutes the first formulation in scientific record of the &quot;deformations&quot; of Lie algebras of the contemporary physical literature (see the next Web Page 19). 

In 1978 Santilli (Hadronic J. Vol. 1, p. 574, 1978) notes his Second Condition of Lie-admissibility was still insufficient for physical applications because Lie-admissibility implies &quot;nonunitary&quot; time evolutions under which the &quot;parameters&quot; p and q become &quot;operators&quot;. He therefore introduced a more general definition of Lie-admissibility which is Albert's definition plus the conditions that the attached antisymmetric algebra is Lie-isotopic, rather than Lie, and the algebras admit conventional Lie algebras in their classification (this is the Third Condition of Lie-admissibility, also called Albert-Santilli Lie-admissibility, or General Lie-admissibility). 

In this way, Santilli introced the product (A, B) = AxRxB - BxSxA, Eq.s (5b), where R, S, and R+or-S are fixed and nonull vector-fields, matrices, operators, etc. for which the attached antisymmetric algebra is the isotopic form [A,B] = (A, B) - (B, A) = AxTxB - BxTxA, T = R+S, while admitting of the conventional Lie product for R+S = 1. The product (A, B) is also the first on scientific records of the so-called &quot;quantum groups&quot; of the contemporary physical literature. The same product, being neither totally antisymetric nor totally symmetric, includes as particular cases supersymmetric and other generalizations of the Lie product (see the next Web Page 19). 

In the same memoir of 1978, Santilli reduced the study of the Lie-admissible product (A, B) = AxRxB - BxSxA to its two isoassociative envelopes AxRxB and BxSxA, that is, he reduced the representation theory of the nonassociative product (A, B) to that of its two, right and left envelopes with &quot;isoassociative&quot; product AxRxB and BxSxA [V-5], in essentially the same way as the study of the Lie product [A, B] = AxB - BxA is reduced to that of the associative ones AxB and BxA.

The terms Santilli's Lie-admissible theory or genotheory are referred to the latter context, that is, to a dual left and right lifting of Lie's theory (enveloping associative lagebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups, representation theory, etc.). 

The tool which permitted this formulation is that of a bi-representation (split-null extension) [V.5]. The main point is that bi-modular Lie-admissible structures are contained in the structure of CONVENTIONAL Lie’s groups. In fact, Eq.s (13) can be written [V-1] 

(18a) Q(w) = {exp(ixXxw)} &gt; Q(0) &lt; {exp(-ixwxX)} 
(18b) i [Q(dw) - Q(0) ] / dw = W &lt; X - X &gt; W 

where &gt; means conventional modular-associative “action to the right” and &lt; “action to the left”. The bi-modular character is trivial in Lie’s case because the action of a conventional Lie group from the left is minus the transpose action from the right. 
An important observation of Ref. [V-1] is that group structure (18) can also be written in a non-trivial bi-modular form characterized, first, by the isotopic modular actions to the right and to the left and, then, their differentiation into genotopic forms. To put it bluntly, a bimodular Lie-admissible structure is already contained in the conventional structure of Lie groups. It merely remained un-noticed until 1978. In fact, the modular associative product to the right can be realized via the right genoassociative algebra U&gt; with product A&gt;B = AxSxB and that to the left via the left genoassociative algebra &lt;U with product A&lt;B = AxRxB with corresponding genounits to the right and left E&gt; = 1/S and &lt;E = 1/R. Eq.s (18) then yield Santilli’s Lie admissible theory [V-1] 

(19) Q(w) = {exp&gt;(ixXxw)} &gt; Q(0) &lt; {exp&lt;(-ixwxX)} = 
= {[exp(ixXxSxw)]xE&gt;} x S x Q(0) x R x { (19 i [Q(dw) - Q(0) ] / dw = Q &lt; X - X &gt; Q = 

= Q x R x X - X x S x Q = (Q, X) 

In this way the representation theory of the Lie-admissible algebra with nonassociative product (A, B) is first reduced to a bi-representation theory on {&lt;U, U&gt;} and then shown to admit a Lie-admissible group structure in a way fully parallel to the conventional Lie case. 
In an evening seminar delivered at ICM94 Santilli completed his Lie-admissible theory by showing that the algebra with Product (A, B) = AxRxB - BxSxA does indeed verify the Lie axioms (antisymmetry and Jacobi law), provided that the terms A&lt;B and B&gt;A are represented in their respective genoenvelopes &lt;U and U&gt;over corresponding genofields &lt;F and . 

To understand better how the Lie-admissible product (A, B) = AxRxB - BxSxA, with R different than S, can be antisymmetric, recall that conventional Lie algebra admit one single realization, that on conventional spaces and fields (read: with respect to the trivial unit I = Diag.(1, 1, ...1)); the isoalgebras admit instead a dual realization, that on isospaces over isofield (read: with respect to the isounit E) as well as the projection on conventional spaces over conventional fields (read: with respect to the conventional unit I); for the genoalgebras we have essentially the a similar occurrence, namely, they can be computed on the right and left genospaces over right and left genofields (read: right and left genounits E&gt; and &lt;E), in which case the product (A, B) verifies the Lie axioms, or it can be computed in its projection in conventional spaces and fields (read: with respect to the conventional unit I), in which case the product (A, B) is manifestly non-Lie. 

Equivalently, the Lie character of the product (A, B) = A&lt;B - B&gt;A on genospaces over genofields can be seen from the fact that the lifting of the associative envelope AxB -&gt; A&gt;B = AxSxB is compensated by an INVERSE lifting of the unit I -&gt; E&gt; = 1/S, thus preserving the original structure (i.e., U and U&gt; are isomorphic), and the same occurs for the right product (i.e., U and &lt;U are also isomorphic). Thus, at the abstract, realization-free level, the product (A, B) verifies the anti-commutative law and the Jacobi law 

(20a) (A, B){&lt;S,S&gt;} = -(B, A){&lt;S, S&gt;} 
(20b) ((A, B), C){&lt;S, S&gt;} + ((B, C), A){&lt;S, S&gt;} + ((C, A), B){&lt;S, S&gt;} = 0. 

PROPOSED RESEARCH V-4 : Study the Lie-admissible theory and its isodual with particular reference to: the genostructure theory, the transition from the genoalgebras to related genogroups; the representation theory; etc. 
SIGNIFICANCE: Lie algebras are the algebraic counterpart of conventional geometries; Lie-Santilli isoalgebras are the algebraic counterpart of the isogeometries; and, along similar lines, genoalgebras are the algebraic counterpart of the genogeometries. The conventional, modular representation theory of Lie algebras characterize particles in linear, local, canonical and reversible conditions; the isomodular representation theory of Lie-Santilli isoalgebras characterize particles in nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical but still reversible conditions; the bi-modular representation theory of the genoalgebras characterizes particles in nonlinear, nonlocal, noncanonical as well as irreversible conditions, such as a neutron in the core of a neutron star. The most advanced definition of “particle” in physics, admitting all other as particular case, including those characterized by string and supersymmetric theories, is a bi-isomodular representation of the Lie-admissible covering of the Poincare’ symmetry.

PROBLEMS V-6/V-7: STUDIES ON THE LIE-SANTILLI HYPERTHEORY AND ITS ISODUAL 
A further advance of the recent memoir [I-1] is that the genounits E&gt; and &lt;E can be ordered sets of nonhermitean quantities under ordinary operations, in which case the Lie-admissible theory becomes multivalued yet still preserving the original Lie axioms at the abstract level. A form of hyper-Lie theory defined via hyperoperations was also introduced by Santilli and Vougiouklis in ref. [II-2]. 
PROPOSED RESEARCH V-5: Study the multivalued realization of the Lie-admissible theory, first, with ordinary operations, and then with hyperoperations. 

SIGNIFICANCE: Besides the evident mathematical significance, multi-valued spaces have already seen their appearance in cosmology, and their need in biology is now established in view of the complexity of biological systems.

'''blini''' (singular blin; in Russian, блин[ы]) are small [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Russia|Russian]] [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], typically topped with [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or [[Cookbook:Caviar|caviar]].

The following recipe makes 20-25 blini.

== Ingredients ==
*1.3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) of wheat [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] of [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*5 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==

#Dissolve the yeast in 3 cups of warm (80-95 degrees Fahrenheit) milk. Add half a tablespoon of sugar, tablespoon of salt, egg yolk and molten butter.
#Stir, then add half the flour and knead the dough.
#Cover the pan with the dough with cloth or towel and leave it in a warm place for 1.5-2 hours, or until the volume of the dough is doubled.
#Mix in the rest of the milk, which must be heated to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, then add the rest of flour and sugar. Pour in well-whipped egg white.
#Knead the dough again and leave it until it rises.
#Heat an oiled frying pan. With a large ladle pour the dough (it should be liquid) in the center so it makes a circle.
#When the bottom of the blin is ready (the edges of the blin have separated from the pan and are pointing upwards), turn it over.
#After it is ready, put the blin on a large plate and start making the next one.

== Hyperbolic Functions ==
=== Definitions ===
The hyperbolic functions are defined in analogy with the trigonometric functions:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sinh x = \frac{1}{2} (e^x-e^{-x})&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\cosh x = \frac{1}{2} (e^x+e^{-x})&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\tanh x = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}=\frac{\sinh x}{\cosh x}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The reciprocal functions csch, sech, coth are defined from these functions:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{\rm csch} x = \frac{1}{\sinh x}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;{\rm sech} x = \frac{1}{\cosh x}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\coth x = \frac{1}{\tanh x}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Some simple identities ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\cosh^2 x - \sinh^2 x = \frac{}{}1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1 - \tanh^2 x = \frac{}{}\operatorname{sech}^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sinh 2x = \frac{}{}2\sinh x\cosh x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cosh 2x = \frac{}{}\cosh^2 x+\sinh^2 x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Derivatives of hyperbolic functions===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sinh x = \cosh x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \cosh x = \sinh x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \tanh x = \operatorname{sech}^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{cosech} x = -\operatorname{cosech} x \operatorname{coth}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{sech} x = -\operatorname{sech} x\tanh x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{coth} x = -\operatorname{cosech}^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

===Principal values of the main hyperbolic functions===
There is no problem in defining principal braches for sinh and tanh because they are injective. We choose one of the principal branches for cosh.
&lt;center&gt;
Sinh: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, Cosh: &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty]\to [1,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, Tanh: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\to (-1,1)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Inverse hyperbolic functions===
With the principal values defined above, the definition of the inverse functions is immediate:

&lt;/center&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}\sinh ^{-1}: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}\cosh^ {-1}: [1,\infty]\to [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}\tanh^{-1}: (-1,1)\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
We can define cosech&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, sech&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and coth&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; similarly.

We can also write these inverses using the logarithm function,

:&lt;math&gt;\sinh^{-1}z = \ln (z+\sqrt{z^2+1})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cosh^{-1}z = \ln (z+\sqrt{z^2-1})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tanh^{-1}z = \ln \sqrt{\frac{1+z}{1-z}}&lt;/math&gt;

These identities can simplify some integrals.

===Derivatives of inverse hyperbolic functions===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{sinh}^{-1} x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{cosh}^{-1} x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{tanh}^{-1} x = \frac{1}{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}|x| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{cosech}^{-1} x = -\frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{1+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}x\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{sech}^{-1} x = -\frac{1}{x\sqrt{1-x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}0&lt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \operatorname{coth}^{-1} x = \frac{1}{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}|x| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

|title=Definition: Taylor series
|text=
A function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''analytic''' if it can be represented by the an infinite power series

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} c_n(x-a)^{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Taylor expansion''' or '''Taylor series''' representation of a function, then, is

&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^{n}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
Here, &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:Factorial|factorial]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^n(a)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[w:Derivative|derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
If this series converges for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;(a-r,a+r)&lt;/math&gt; and the sum is equal to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''analytic'''. To check whether the series converges towards &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, one normally uses estimates for the remainder term of [[w:Taylor's_theorem|Taylor's theorem]]. A function is analytic if and only if a [[w:Power_series|power series]] converges to the function; the coefficients in that power series are then necessarily the ones given in the above Taylor series formula.

If &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, the series is also called a '''Maclaurin series'''.

The importance of such a power series representation is threefold. First, differentiation and integration of power series can be performed term by term and is hence particularly easy. Second, an analytic function can be uniquely extended to a [[w:Holomorphic function|holomorphic function]] defined on an open disk in the [[w:Complex_number|complex plane]], which makes the whole machinery of [[w:Complex analysis|complex analysis]] available. Third, the (truncated) series can be used to approximate values of the function near the point of expansion.

[[image:Expinvsq5.svg|Around zero, the function looks very flat.|201px]]
&lt;small&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;f(z)=e^{-1/z^2}&lt;/math&gt; is not analytic: the Taylor series is 0, although the function is not.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Note that there are examples of [[w:Infinitely_often_differentiable_function|infinitely often differentiable function]]s &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; whose Taylor series converge, but are ''not'' equal to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, for the function defined piecewise by saying that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{Bmatrix} 0, x = 0\\ e^{-1/x^2}, x \neq 0 \end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, all the derivatives are zero at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, so the Taylor series of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is zero, and its [[w:Radius_of_convergence|radius of convergence]] is infinite, even though the function most definitely is not zero.  This particular pathology does not afflict [[w:Complex_number|complex]]-valued functions of a complex variable.  Notice that &lt;math&gt;f(z)=e^{-1/z^2}&lt;/math&gt; does not approach 0 as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 along the imaginary axis.

Some functions cannot be written as Taylor series because they have a [[w:Singularity_(mathematics)|singularity]]; in these cases, one can often still achieve a series expansion if one allows also negative powers of the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; see [[w:Laurent_series|Laurent series]]. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(z)=e^{-1/z^2}&lt;/math&gt; ''can'' be written as a Laurent series.

The [http://www.math.jmu.edu/~jim/picard.html Parker-Sockacki theorem] is a recent advance in finding Taylor series which are solutions to [[w:Differential_equations|differential equations]].  This theorem is an expansion on the [[w:Picard_iteration|Picard iteration]].

===Derivation===
Suppose we want to represent a function as an infinite power series, or in other words a polynomial with infinite terms of degree &quot;infinity&quot;. Each of these terms are assumed to have unique coefficients, as do most finite-polynomials do. We can represent this as an infinite sum like so:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x)={c_0}(x-a)^0+c_1(x-a)^1+c_2(x-a)^2+c_3(x-a)^3+\cdots+c_n(x-a)^n+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of convergence and &lt;math&gt;c_0,c_1,c_2,c_3,...,c_n,...&lt;/math&gt; are coefficients. Next, with summation notation, we can efficiently represent this series as 

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n(x-a)^n&lt;/math&gt;

which will become more useful later. As of now, we have no schematic for finding the coefficients other than finding each one in the series by hand. That method would not be particularly useful. Let us, then, try to find a pattern and a general solution for finding the coefficients. As of now, we have a simple method for finding the first coefficient. If we substitute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; then we get

&lt;math&gt;f(a)=c_0&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is useful, but we still would like a general equation to find any coefficient in the series. We can try differentiating with respect to x the series to get

&lt;math&gt;
{f}'(x)=c_1(x-a)^{0}+2c_2(x-a)^{1}+3c_3(x-a)^{2}+4c_4(x-a)^3+\cdots+nc_n(x-a)^{(n-1)}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

We can assume &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are constant. This proves to be useful, because if we again substitute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we get

&lt;math&gt;{f}'(a)=c_1&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that the first derivative has one constant term (&lt;math&gt;c_1(x-a)^0=c_1&lt;/math&gt;) we can find the second derivative to find &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;. It is

&lt;math&gt;
{f}''(x)=2c_2+(2\times3)c_3(x-a)^1+(3\times4)c_4(x-a)^2+\cdots+(n)(n-1)c_n(x-a)^{(n-2)}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

If we again substitute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;{f}''(a)=2c_2&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;'s initial exponent was 2, and &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;'s initial exponent was 1. This is slightly more enlightening, however it is still slightly ambiguous as to what is happening. Going off the previous examples, if we differentiate again we get

&lt;math&gt;
f'''(x)=(2\times3)c_3(x-a)^0+(2\times3\times4)c_4(x-a)^1+(3\times4\times5)c_5(x-a)^2+\cdots+(n)(n-1)(n-2)c_n(x-a)^{n-3}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; we, again, that

&lt;math&gt;f'''(a)=(2\times3)c_3&lt;/math&gt;

By now, the pattern should be becoming clearer. &lt;math&gt;(n)(n-1)(n-2)&lt;/math&gt; looks suspiciously like &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;. And indeed, it is! If we carry this out &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times by finding the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th derivative, we find that the multiple of the coefficient is &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;. So for some &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt;, for any integer &lt;math&gt;n\geq0&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;n!\times c_n=\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(a)&lt;/math&gt;

Or, with some simple manipulation, more usefully,

&lt;math&gt;c_n=\frac{f^n(a)}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f^0(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^1(x)=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; and so on. With this, we can find any coefficient of the &quot;infinite polynomial.&quot; Using the summation definition for our &quot;polynomial&quot; given earlier,

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n(x-a)^n&lt;/math&gt;

we can substitute for &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; to get

&lt;math&gt;
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^n(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the definition of any Taylor series. But now that we have this series, how can we derive the definition for a given analytic function? We can do just as the definition specifies, and fill in all the necessary information. But we will also want to find a ''specific'' pattern, because sometimes we are left with a great many terms simplifying to 0.

First, we have to find &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Because we are now deriving our own Taylor Series, we can choose anything we want for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, but note that not all functions will work. It would be useful to use a function that we can easily find the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th derivative for. A good example of this would be &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;. With &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; chosen, we can begin to find the derivatives. Before we begin, we should also note that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is essentially the &quot;offset&quot; of the function along the x-axis, because this is also essentially true for any polynomial. With that in mind, we can assume, in this particular case, that the offset is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;. With that in mind, &quot;zero-th&quot; derivative or the function itself would be

&lt;math&gt;\sin(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

If we plug that in to the definition of the first term in the series, again noting that &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, we get

&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0!}(x)^0=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the first term of the series is 0, because anything multiplied by 0 is 0. Take note that not all Taylor series start out with a zero term. Next, to find the next term, we need to find the first derivative of the function. Remembering that the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; we get that

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dx}\sin(0)=\cos(0)=1
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that our second term in the series is 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1!}(x)^{1}=x&lt;/math&gt;

Next, we need to find the third term. We repeat this process.

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\sin(0)=-\sin(0)=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)=-\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We continue with

&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{2!}(x)^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

The fourth term:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^3}{dx^3}\sin(0)=-\cos(0)=-1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{3!}(x)^3=\frac{-x^3}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

Repeating this process we can get the sequence

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{0}{0!}(x)^0, \frac{1}{1!}(x)^{1}, \frac{0}{2!}(x)^2, \frac{-1}{3!}(x)^3, \frac{0}{4!}(x)^4, \frac{1}{5!}(x)^{5}, \frac{0}{6!}(x)^{6}, \frac{-1}{7!}(x)^7...
&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

&lt;math&gt;
0, x, 0, \frac{-x^3}{6}, 0, \frac{x^5}{120}, 0, \frac{-x^7}{5040}...
&lt;/math&gt;

Because we are ultimately dealing with a series, the zero terms can be ignored, giving use the new sequence

&lt;math&gt;
x, \frac{-x^3}{6}, \frac{x^5}{120}, \frac{-x^7}{5040}...
&lt;/math&gt;

There is a pattern here, however it may be easier to see if we take the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator:

&lt;math&gt;
1, -1, 1, -1...
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
1!, 3!, 4!, 5!...
&lt;/math&gt;

And for the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; part of the terms, we have the sequence

&lt;math&gt;
x, x^3, x^5...
&lt;/math&gt;

By this point, at least for the denominator and the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; part, the pattern should be obvious. It is, for the denominator

&lt;math&gt;
(2n+1)! = \mathrm{denom}_n
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; term:

&lt;math&gt;
x^{2n+1} = \mathrm{xterm}_n
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the numerator may not be as obvious, but it follows this pattern:

&lt;math&gt;
(-1)^n
&lt;/math&gt;

With all of these things discovered, we can put them together to find the rule for the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th term of the sequence:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}=\mathrm{sumterm}_n
&lt;/math&gt;

And so our Taylor (Maclaurin) series for &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is


&lt;math&gt;
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}
&lt;/math&gt;

(x_1-a_1)^{n_1}\cdots (x_d-a_d)^{n_d}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== History ===

The Taylor series is named for mathematician [[w:Brook Taylor|Brook Taylor]], who first published the power series formula in 1715.

===Constructing a Taylor Series===

Several methods exist for the calculation of Taylor series of a large number of functions. One can attempt to use the Taylor series as-is and generalize the form of the coefficients, or one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series (such as those above) to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying [[w:Integration_by_parts|integration by parts]]. The use of [[w:Computer_algebra_system|computer algebra systems]] to calculate Taylor series is common, since it eliminates tedious substitution and manipulation.

====Example 1====
Consider the function
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\ln{(1+\cos{x})} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
for which we want a Taylor series at 0. 

We have for the natural logarithm
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(1+x) = \sum^{\infin}_{n=1} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} x^n = x - {x^2\over 2}+{x^3 \over 3} - {x^4 \over 4} + \cdots \quad\mbox{ for } \left| x \right| &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
and for the cosine function
:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = \sum^{\infin}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} = 1 -{x^2\over 2!}+{x^4\over 4!}- \cdots \quad\mbox{ for all } x\in\mathbb{C}. &lt;/math&gt;
We can simply substitute the second series into the first. Doing so gives
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1 -{x^2\over 2!}+{x^4\over 4!}-\cdots\right)-{1\over 2}\left(1 -{x^2\over 2!}+{x^4\over 4!}-\cdots\right)^2 +{1\over 3}\left(1 -{x^2\over 2!}+{x^4\over 4!}-\cdots\right)^3-\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Expanding by using [[w:Multinomial_coefficient|multinomial coefficient]]s gives the required Taylor series. Note that cosine and therefore &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are even functions, meaning that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;, hence the coefficients of the odd powers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^7&lt;/math&gt; and so on have to be zero and don't need to be calculated. 
The first few terms of the series are
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(1+\cos x)=\ln 2-{x^2\over 4}-{x^4\over 96}-{x^6\over 1440} -{17x^8\over 322560}-{31x^{10}\over 7257600}-\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
The general coefficient can be represented using [[w:Faà_di_Bruno's_formula|Faà di Bruno's formula]].  However, this representation does not seem to be particularly illuminating and is therefore omitted here.

====Example 2====
Suppose we want the Taylor series at 0 of the function
: &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\frac{e^x}{\cos x}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
We have for the exponential function
: &lt;math&gt;e^x = \sum^\infty_{n=0} {x^n\over n!} =1 + x + {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^3 \over 3!} + {x^4 \over 4!} +\cdots &lt;/math&gt;
and, as in the first example,
: &lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^4 \over 4!} - \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
Assume the power series is
: &lt;math&gt;{e^x \over \cos x} = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Then multiplication with the denominator and substitution of the series of the cosine yields
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} e^x &amp;= (c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \cdots)\cos x\\
&amp;=\left(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + c_4x^4 + \cdots\right)\left(1 - {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^4 \over 4!} - \cdots\right)\\
&amp;=c_0 - {c_0 \over 2}x^2 + {c_0 \over 4!}x^4 + c_1x - {c_1 \over 2}x^3 + {c_1 \over 4!}x^5 + c_2x^2 - {c_2 \over 2}x^4 + {c_2 \over 4!}x^6 + c_3x^3 - {c_3 \over 2}x^5 + {c_3 \over 4!}x^7 +\cdots \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Collecting the terms up to fourth order yields
: &lt;math&gt;=c_0 + c_1x + \left(c_2 - {c_0 \over 2}\right)x^2 + \left(c_3 - {c_1 \over 2}\right)x^3+\left(c_4+{c_0 \over 4!}-{c_2\over 2}\right)x^4 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Comparing coefficients with the above series of the exponential function yields the desired Taylor series
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{e^x}{\cos x}=1 + x + x^2 + {2x^3 \over 3} + {x^4 \over 2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mike Storm. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mike Storm~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Integrating PHP==
There are quite a few ways that PHP is used. Following are a few methods that PHP can be called.

==Forms==

Forms are, by far, the most common way of interacting with PHP. As we mentioned before, it is recommended that you have knowledge of [[HTML|HTML]], and here is where we start using it. If you don't, just head to the [[HTML|HTML Wikibook]] for a refresher.

===Form Setup===

To create a form and point it to a PHP document, the HTML tag &lt;form&gt; is used and an action is specified as follows:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
  &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;action.php&quot;&gt;
      &lt;!-- Your form here --&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Once the user clicks &quot;Submit&quot;, the form body is sent to the PHP script for processing. All fields in the form are stored in the variables $_GET or $_POST, depending on the method used to submit the form. 

The difference between the GET and POST methods is that GET submits all the values in the URL, while POST submits values transparently through HTTP headers. A general rule of thumb is '''if you are submitting sensitive data, use POST'''. POST forms usually provide more security.

Remember $_GET and $_POST are superglobal arrays, meaning you can reference them anywhere in a PHP script. For example, you don't need to call ''global $_POST'' or ''global $_GET'' to use them inside functions.

===Example===

Let's look at an example of how you might do this.

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;!-- Inside enterlogin.html --&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Login&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;login.php&quot;&gt;
   Please log in.&lt;br/&gt;
   Username: &lt;input name=&quot;username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   Password: &lt;input name=&quot;password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;input name=&quot;submit&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{|
| This form would look like the following:
|
{| style=&quot;font: 12pt Times Roman, Times New Roman, serif; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px;&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Please log in.
|-
| Username:
| style=&quot;width: 10em; border: solid 1px black; color: white; background-color: white&quot; | &amp;hellip;
|-
| Password:
| style=&quot;width: 10em; border: solid 1px black; color: white; background-color: white&quot; | &amp;hellip;
|-
|
| style=&quot;border: solid 4px; border-bottom-color: darkgray; border-top-color: #eee; border-right-color: darkgray; border-left-color: #eee; background-color: #ccc; text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot; | submit
|}
|}

And here's the script you'd use to process it (login.php):

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?php
  // Inside enterlogin.html
  if($_POST['username'] == &quot;Spoom&quot; &amp;&amp; $_POST['password'] == &quot;idontneednostinkingpassword&quot;)
  {
   echo(&quot;Welcome, Spoom.&quot;);
  }
  else
  {
   echo(&quot;You're not Spoom!&quot;);
  }
 ?&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Let's take a look at that script a little closer.

 if($_POST['username'] == &quot;Spoom&quot; &amp;&amp; $_POST['password'] == &quot;idontneednostinkingpassword&quot;)

As you can see, $_POST is an array, with keys matching the names of each field in the form. For backward compatibility, you can also refer to them numerically, but you generally shouldn't as this method is much clearer. And that's basically it for how you use forms to submit data to PHP documents. It's that easy.

==PHP from the Command Line==

Although PHP was originally created with the intent of being a web language, it can also be used for commandline scripting (although this is not common, because simpler tools such as the bash scripting are available). 

===Output===

You can output to the console the same way you would output to a webpage, except that you have to remember that HTML isn't parsed (a surprisingly common error), and that you have to manually output newlines. The typical hello world program would look like this: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?php
   print &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
 ?&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Notice the newline character at the end-of-line - newlines are useful for making your output look neat and readable.

===Input===

PHP has a few special files for you to read and write to the command line. These files include the stdin, stdout and stderr files. To access these files, you would open these files as if they were actual files using fopen, with the exception that you open them with the special php:// &quot;protocol&quot;, like this: $fp = fopen(&quot;php://stdin&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);

To read from the console, you can just read from stdin. No special redirection is needed to write to the console, but if you want to write to stderr, you can open it and write to it: $fp = fopen(&quot;php://stderr&quot;,&quot;w&quot;);

Bearing how to read input in mind, we can now construct a simple commandline script that asks the user for a username and a password to authenticate himself.

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?php
   $fp = fopen(&quot;php://stdin&quot;,&quot;r&quot;); 
   
   print &quot;Please authenticate yourself\n&quot;;
   print &quot;Username: &quot;;
   // rtrim to cut off the \n from the shell
   $user = rtrim(fgets($fp, 1024));
   print &quot;Password: &quot;;
   // rtrim to cut off the \n from the shell
   $pass = rtrim(fgets($fp, 1024));
   if (($user==&quot;someuser&quot;) &amp;&amp; ($pass==&quot;somepass&quot;)) {
    print &quot;Good user\n&quot;;
    // ... do stuff ...
  } else die(&quot;Bad user\n&quot;);
  fclose($fp);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note that this script just serves as an example as to how to utilise PHP for commandline programming - the code contained here demonstrates a very poor way to authenticate a user or to store a password. Remember that your PHP scripts are readable by others!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a game? ==
It's a good question, and a common question, one that you can spend a great deal of time arguing over. The definition, conscious or not, will influence how one decides to design a game. So it makes sense to begin there.

There are multiple ways we could define a game, with varying ranges of inclusiveness. The essential problem with most definitions, however, is that they only work when one looks at certain types of games or players.

First, let's state some things we can be certain of:
-Games exist only by being played; they are ''interactive''.
-Between one and an infinite number of players may participate, depending on the game.
-Some games are generally considered more entertaining than others, and some players prefer certain games to others.

The '''Competition definition''' holds that games are entirely about players competing against each other, to be the first or the best at something, or in the case of a solitaire game, to overcome the challenge presented to him through the gameplay. This is a reasonable definition for many games, and can be stretched even to very simple games such as Catch, where the only gameplay involved is tossing a ball or other object to the other players. The competition in Catch would be the players versus the ball and the environment; the player holding the ball must try to successfully throw it to the other player, and the other player must try to catch the ball without missing or dropping it. There is a deliberate attempt to make the game challenging; the players could hand the ball off to one another but they never choose to do so.

But what about something even simpler and less rule-based than Catch? Could we call building blocks a game to play? We do say that one &quot;plays&quot; with them. For the Competition definition, we would have to come up with some sort of competition that the player has between himself and the blocks, or his mind.

The player does have a ''challenge'' in building structures of his own devising, in coming up with architecture that won't collapse. But neither the blocks nor his mind are trying to hinder him in this goal. They are both tools, assisting him. The blocks have the property of being weighted and prone to gravity, and the mind is not going to assist him perfectly through every step of the process, but these are properties of the objects, not active attempts to foil him. Unlike in the case of Catch, where the players wish to be challenged, someone building blocks is interested in using his tools purely to a productive advantage.

So if you consider building blocks to be a game, then the Competition definition fails. It should be noted, though that many designers consider them and derivative items(Legos, Simcity, etc.) to be toys rather than games.

(The challenge in the game makes the game. Building blocks is playing in a different form, driven by personal targets to create the outcome. A game has set rules, and usually has a beginning, middle and an end, whereas playing mostly starts and ends at your own will without rules controlling the way you manipulate or use your play things. Playing is 100% down to you. A game is set out to be played in a particular manner.)

== Games in History ==
The earliest known games are board games such as Go and Nine Men's Morris. Sports records show that athletic gaming existed in ancient times as well.

Up until the industrial age, newly designed games were not well-known, if they existed. But a lot of the games and sports played today were invented or had modern rules drawn during the 19th century. Baseball, basketball and football (both the American and international games) are examples of sports that grew up in that period. While some evolution of the rules has taken place since then, they largely resemble the same games played today. New board games like the game of Goose also started appearing at this time. These changes may be most easily attributed to a combination of improved transportation, communication, and manufacturing; with a more mobile society, popular games could easily spread throughout the world, and games with specialized equipment could be built in larger numbers.

The next 'big wave' came with the 1950s and 60s, with the newly developing American consumer society. In this period both flashier and more complex games started appearing. Of special note was the increasing complexity of war games that continued into the 70s, that eventually branched off into the role-playing game.

Of course, during the same time frame video games were just being born. As far back as the 1950s the use of electronics, and especially computers, as a medium for entertainment had been considered or experimented with by academics and enthusiastic students. By the 1970s, they were ready to be mass marketed, first with Pong and variations thereof, then in a series of arcade games such as Canyon Bomber and Lunar Lander, and at about the same time with the Atari 2600 VCS(Video Computer System). These very early video games are notable because of their originality. They were made by and for an inexperienced gaming population, something very different from what is seen today. And most of them found success, being neither copycat imitators nor rushed, uninspired &quot;genre&quot; pieces.

Today, the technology has advanced greatly. No longer just a few rules with simple graphics and sound effects, most modern video games attempt to be virtual reality experiences that engage their players by conveying settings and stories in a visceral manner, combining the techniques of the cinema with gameplay rules to make settings seem realistic. They are produced at great expense and risk; the amount of content needed to achieve an impact competitive with other games has grown astronomically large. 

Indeed, one of the more interesting developments in gaming has been the added significance of the 'storyline'. Back when the prime requirement of a video game was to reproduce the playability factor associated with the traditional board game, the inclusion of a background to the events taking place in the game was a manual filler at best. However, with the evolution of gaming technology bringing us ever closer to a fully convincing visual representation of an 'imagined reality', there is now a huge emphasis on the way in which the story unravels around the user's interactions. Any modern action or adventure game that wants to stand a chance out there now requires strong script writing, a solid plot with the occasional twist, and if they're really pushing the boat out, multiple endings/outcomes based on choices made by the user throughout the game. The makers of these games not only want to create a fully interactive cinematic experience, but also one that stands a good chance of winning an Oscar.

Future games may break the boundaries of the screen and common input devices and use methods of input and output that we can hardly imagine today.

The problem with today's game market is that because of the money involved most new games are similar to old tried and tested formulas. The sad fact is that originality is lost, the big players no longer want to risk their money on original ideas.


== The Gameplay Experience ==
Perhaps more important than what the game is, is what the player gets out of the game. That's what a &quot;gameplay experience&quot; is - it encompasses the whole range of player thoughts and feelings during play. Some games try to be more engaging than others, and they may come from different angles. But whether the game is just a component of a larger event(a party, for example) or an event in itself, the experience, rather than the production values or quantity of gameplay, is the measure of what makes the game effective.

(Overall the gaming experience is the most important thing, although the target at the end of the game can enhance the play, take gambling for example, the thought of winning money at the end of the game heightens the playing experience. Matthew Eggins)

(The gaming experience is all about immersion, to believe in a small way you are connected, and can affect the events that are unraveling before you.  Whether you are snowboarding down a mountain, playing god or shooting your way through mindless zombies, you are connected with the virtual world. It is your journey through that world that is as; if not more important than the end finale. Luke Angell)

(The emotions you are put through in a game also play a big part in the gaming experience, if for example you are playing a game based on a film, you take the emotions conjured up during that film into the game, whether it be fear or a feeling of being invincible for example, you therefore become even further immersed, possibly more so than someone who may not have seen the film. James Crossett)

=== Social Games ===

Social games, used to pass time or as an excuse to drink or as a way of demonstrating status, among other things, are usually simple enough to grasp quickly, or can be played with little concentration over gossip.

=== Challenging Games ===

Challenging games are focused on the presentation of increasingly difficult problems for the player(or players) to solve. Sports are examples of challenging games because they try to test the limits of human abilities; this is why professional leagues can be sold as entertainment for spectators.

=== Virtual Realities ===

Modern game design, especially [[Video Game Design|video game design]], has grown increasingly interested in conveying immersive worlds that players can become deeply involved in. Virtual reality is the most appropriate term for this path of design, which is concerned not so much with the storyline or actual realism as it is with making the setting and action as convincing as possible.

=== Addiction ===
Despite the wonderful benefits games offer as diversions, spending too much time, to the neglect of normal life duties, and social development with direct contact with others can and often does happen.  The line between Addiction and a strong enjoyment of games is real, although the addict will rarely admit which side he (or she) is on.  There are many resources to help the addict.

== What is a video game? ==
A video game is a specific type of software that runs on hardware, a computer or video game console. That hardware platform requires at least some memory (that can be in several forms), some processing capacity and ways to interact with a display and some method with which a player can control the game.

When you get right down to it, that is what a video game is. It's '''interactive media'''. The ''player'' presses, clicks, or types something and then the game will respond according to some established rules. The elements of communication, therefore, are vital. Video Games are interactive video art pieces. In simpler terms; a video game is just another way to have fun and express creativity.

While definitions are nice and simple, in order to efficiently understand video game design, you really need to know the mechanics behind it all. We will not go into that in depth just yet, but realize that it requires programming, graphic design, sound design, music composition, and so much more. 

Since the development of the first video game in 1931, the video game industry has grown on a kind of exponential curve. There were a few bumps in the road, but the industry has come to the point where it is taking in over $7 billion dollars annually. Salaries for people in the video game industry range from $32k to $200K. And a single video game can sell from $10 to almost $100.

Of all the things, it is not anything without a player, that is the participating audience of this interactive media.

== After playing ==
Games will train and educate people, providing new skills and knowledge they can use outside of the game.
''An example is readily found in flight simulators, but even arcade racing games will train the player to manage more complex situations'' 
They will leave the player in an emotional and intellectually changed state. This can be a profound change (anger, catharsis, even love)or a superficial one. 
The relevance of these is different for each game and must play a role in game-design. ''In general designers will try to provide a catharsis at the end of each game, an happy ending.''
But more importantly the player will take away an updated concept of the game itself. This will not just be static knowledge, for example maps of the game or the pros and cons of combos. The player will also gain dynamic knowledge, going over the gameplay in his head, replaying rather than analyzing the game.
This after game experience is more relevant to game-design as it creates a slower, more profound feedback loop into the game. ''For example a puzzle game is changed when the gamer can pause or replay after a night's rest. Another example has a player planning his rpg character upgrades and coming back to the game anxious to obtain them.''

A last important issue is the relevance of the world to the game. People  can come away from a game curious, and learn more about outside game issues that will then influence later gameplay. 
''For example a tactical tank simulation designed with real world combat in mind can be cracked by studying real world combat.''
Social contact will provide them with info that will also influence later gameplay. Players will visit walkthroughs or discuss tactics with friends.
And don't forget that the player will predict these matters while playing.
''For example, a hardcore gamer will not readily plunge into a children's pony-combing game if he has to tell his friends later on.''
Tying in the player after he stops playing can make or break a game. Ultimately you want the player to come back.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article will describe you how to create a brushed metal effect.
[[Image:Filtershurl.png|thumb|256px|right|The Hurl filter can be found by going to ''Filters &gt; Noise &gt; Hurl''.]]

===Step 1===

[[image:metaleffect1.png|256px|thumb|left|Effect of first step.]]

First, we fill the canvas using the hurl filter (''Filters &gt; Noise &gt; Hurl'').  Set Randomization (%) to 100. 

This will do the same thing as the Scatter RGB filter (''Filters &gt; Noise &gt; Scatter RGB'') with all channels (Red, Green, and Blue) set to 1.0, However, Scatter RGB has slightly more options, and if you turn off Independent RGB in the settings dialogue, may allow you to skip the desaturation step.

===Step 2===

Then, apply a motion blur to the image (''Filters &gt; Blur &gt; Motion Blur...'')  with an angle of 0 and a length of about 50.
Change the angle to 180 and repeat the effect.  Why?  Notice how the right edge of the final image isn't nice and
brushed looking?  Doing it in both directions will smooth this out.  You may have to adjust the length setting
so as not to &quot;overblur&quot;.

[[Image:Filtersmotionblur.png|thumb|256px|right|The Motion Blur filter can be found by going to ''Filters &gt; Blur &gt; Motion Blur''.]]

[[Image:metaleffect2.png|thumb|256px|left|Effect of second step.]]

Alternatively, you can use the Gaussian Blur filter (''Filters &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur''). Just click the chain icon and turn the vertical value down and adjust the horizontal value until you are satisfied. This effect will not leave a side of the image left unblurred and may have an even more satisfying final result with proper adjustment.

===Step 3===
This is the shortest step. Now we only need to desaturate the image. Go to ''Colours &gt; Desaturate'' and press Lightness, although Luminosity may sometimes look better.

[[image:metaleffect3.png|thumb|256px|right|Effect of third step.]]

Apply cropping / tiling / brightness / lighting filters to suit. Cropping may not be necessary if you've used the Gaussian Blur approach as opposed to the Motion Blur approach.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
These solutions were not written by the author of the rest of the book. They are simply the answers I thought were correct while doing the exercises. I hope these answers are useful for someone and that people will correct my work if I made some mistakes
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===How big is infinity? exercises===
#The number of even numbers is the same as the number of natural numbers because both are countably infinite. You can clearly see the one to one correspondence. (E means even numbers and is not an official set like N)
:'''E''' &amp;nbsp; '''N'''
: 2 &amp;nbsp; 1
: 4 &amp;nbsp; 2
: 6 &amp;nbsp; 3
: 8 &amp;nbsp; 4
2. The number of square numbers is also equal to the number of natural numbers. They are both countably infinite and can be put in one to one correspondence. (S means square numbers and is not an official set like N)
:'''S''' &amp;nbsp; '''N'''
: 1 &amp;nbsp; 1
: 4 &amp;nbsp; 2
: 9 &amp;nbsp; 3
: 16 &amp;nbsp; 4
3. The cardinality of even numbers less than 100 is not equal to the cardinality of natural numbers less than 100. You can simply write out both of them and count the numbers. Then you will see that cardinality of even numbers less than 100 is 49 and the cardinality of natural numbers less than 100 is 99. Thus the set of natural numbers less than 100 is bigger than the set of even numbers less than 100. The big difference between infinite and finite sets thus is that a finite set can not be put into one to one correspondence with any of its subsets, while an infinite set can be put into one to one correspondence with at least one of its subsets.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Each part of the sum is answered below
:&lt;i&gt;infinity + 1 = infinity&lt;/i&gt;
:You can prove this by taking a set with a cardinality of 1, for example a set consisting only of the number 0. You simply add this set in front of the countably infinite set to put the infinite set and the inifinite+1 set into one to one correspondence.
::'''N''' &amp;nbsp; '''N+1'''
:: 1 &amp;nbsp; 0
:: 2 &amp;nbsp; 1
:: 3 &amp;nbsp; 2
:: 4 &amp;nbsp; 3
:&lt;i&gt;infinity + A = infinity&lt;/i&gt; (where A is a finite set)
:You simply add the finite set in front of the infinite set like above, only the finite set doesn't need to have a cardinality of one anymore.
:&lt;i&gt;infinity + C = infinity&lt;/i&gt; (where C is a countably infinite set)
:You take one item of each set (infinity or C) in turns, this will make the new list also countably infinite.

===Is the set of rational numbers bigger than N? exercises===
1. To change the matrix from Q' to Q the first step you need to take is to remove the multiple entries for the same number. You can do this by leaving an empty space in the table when gcd(topnr,bottomnr)&amp;ne;1 because when the gcd isn't 1 the fraction can be simplified by dividing the top and bottom number by the gcd. This will leave you with the following table.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp;  &amp; \\\frac{2}{1} &amp;  &amp; \frac{2}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp; &amp; \\\frac{3}{1} &amp; \frac{3}{2} &amp;  &amp; \cdots\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now we only need to add zero to the matrix and we're finished. So we add a vertical row for zero and only write the topmost element in it (0/1) (taking gcd doesn't work here because gcd(0,a)=a) This leaves us with the following table where we have to count all fractions in the diagonal rows to see that Q is countably infinite.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{0}{1} &amp; \frac{1}{1} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp;  &amp; \\ &amp; \frac{2}{1} &amp;  &amp; \frac{2}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; \frac{3}{1} &amp; \frac{3}{2} &amp;  &amp; \cdots\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
2. To show that &lt;math&gt; \infty \times \infty = \infty &lt;/math&gt; you have to make a table where you put one infinity in the horizontal row and one infinity in the vertical row. Now you can start counting the number of place in the table diagonally just like Q' was counted. This works because a table of size AxB contains A*B places.

===Are there even bigger infinities? exercises===
#You have to use a method to map the coordinates in a plain onto a point on the line and the other way around, like the one described in the text. This method shows you that for every number on the line there is a place on the plain and for every place on the plain there is a place on the line. Thus the number of points on the line and the plain are the same.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oh nice, very good work. Actually this chapter of the book was not written by me. Maybe you can contribute in a greater capacity. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:40, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I will try to put up all the answers to the exercises. I already have 90% of the answers on a notebook for the matrices and generators chapters. [[User:Mmartin|Mmartin]] 18:15, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Oh really! Great work. Actually how did you find the material in this book? Hard or not too hard? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 03:31, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::I found the material in the book usually not too difficult to understand as long as you read all the text very carefully  and sometimes make some extra calculation to make sure you understand it. The only real problem I've had so far is that I didn't know the method of partial fractions. Another problem was that I couldn't follow the last part of the matrices chapter about Diagonalization at all. Although I am of course not an average high school student because I have already had an introduction course to cryptography on a university. [[User:Mmartin|Mmartin]] 08:30, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)


:::Ok, thanks for the feedback. I will not be able to start work on the method of partial fractions anytime soon so you might like to ask a friend for that. As for the diagonalization part, it's perhaps the most difficult part to follow i must agree, cos it requires a train of thoughts to understand it properly, i hope some examples will help. I will try to explain it better. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 07:22, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/big&gt;

==What is AROS all about?==

For the Wikipedia description look [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Research_Operating_System here]
For a detailed description look [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros_User_Docs#What_exactly_is_AROS.3F here]

==What is the legal status of AROS?==

European law says that it is legal to apply reverse engineering techniques to gain interoperability. It also says that it is illegal to distribute the knowledge gained by such techniques. It basically means that you are allowed to disassemble or resource any software to write something which is compatible (for example, it would be legal to disassemble Word to write a program which converts Word documents into ASCII text).

There are of course limitations: you are not allowed to disassemble the software if the information you would gain by this process can be obtained by other means. You must also not tell others what you learned. A book like &quot;Windows inside&quot; is therefore illegal or at least of dubious legality.

Since we avoid disassembling techniques and instead use common available knowledge (which includes programming manuals) which don't fall below any NDA, the above doesn't apply directly to AROS. What counts here is the intention of the law: it is legal to write software which is compatible with some other software. Therefore we believe that AROS is protected by the law.

Patents and header files are a different issue, though. We can use patented algorithms in Europe since European law doesn't allow patents on algorithms. However, code that uses such algorithms that are patented in the USA could not be imported to the USA. Examples of patented algorithms in AmigaOS include screen dragging and the specific way menus work. Therefore we avoid implementing these features in exactly the same way. Header files on the other hand must be compatible but as different as possible from the original.

To avoid any trouble we applied for an official ok from Amiga Inc. They are quite positive about the effort but they are very uneasy about the legal implications. We suggest that you take that fact that Amiga Inc did not send us any cease and desist letters as a positive sign. Unfortunately, no legally sound agreement has been made yet, besides good intentions on both sides.

==Can't you implement feature XYZ?==

Well,:

   1. If it was really important, it probably would be in the original OS. ;-)
   2. Why don't you do it yourself and send a patch to us?

The reason for this attitude is that there are plenty of people around who think that their feature is the most important and that AROS has no future if that feature is not built in right away. Our position is that AmigaOS, which AROS aims to implement, can do everything a modern OS should do. We see that there are areas where AmigaOS could be enhanced, but if we do that, who would write the rest of the OS? In the end, we would have lots of nice improvements to the original AmigaOS which would break most of the available software but worth nothing, because the rest of the OS would be missing.

Therefore, we decided to block every attempt to implement major new features in the OS until it is more or less completed. We are getting quite close to that goal now, and there have been a couple of innovations implemented in AROS that aren't available in AmigaOS.

==How compatible is AROS with AmigaOS?==

Very compatible, it let's you run AROS (on your classic amiga hardware if you like) and let's you run both aros and most classic amiga programs, games, and demos, as long as they are compatible, see compatibility list [http://www.natami.net/knowledge.php?b=1&amp;note=46622 here]. 

'''binaries:''' We expect that AROS will run existing software on the 68k family Amiga hardware without problems. On other hardware, the existing software can be run through integrated Amiga emulation (&quot;emumiga&quot; or &quot;Janus-UAE&quot;), or the code must be recompiled (see below).

'''sourcecode:''' Porting programs from AmigaOS to AROS is currently mostly a matter of a recompilation, with the occasional tweak here and there. There are of course programs for which this is not true, but it holds for most modern ones. We will offer a preprocessor which you can use on your code which will change any code that might break with AROS and/or warn you about such code. See [[Aros/Developer/Porting_software]] for more on porting software to AROS.

===Why are you only aiming for compatibility with 3.1?===

Well, to be honest this is a misconception.  The base development is aimed at implementing the apis used in &quot;atleast&quot; AmigaOS v3.1.  However along the way it has been necessary to revise the plans somewhat where amigaos3.1 didnt support the necessary functionality.  The end result is a feature set somewhere in between OS3.1 and 3.9 however 3.1 is still used as the _base_ of our goals.

There are other developments which do not fit into this framework since they don't involve either OS's apis - such as hidds and the relevant technologies to implement and support them.

To this end developers are pretty free to improve on the underlying AmigaOS technologies so long as they can still support existing AmigaOS functionality and APIS with very little to no effort.

==What hardware architectures is AROS available for?==

Currently AROS is available in a quite usable state as native and hosted (under Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD) for the i386 architecture (i.e. IBM PC AT compatible clones) and hosted (Linux and NetBSD) for the m68k architecture (e.g. the Amiga, Atari and Macintosh) and hosted on top of ARM Linux distributions. There are ports under way at varying degrees of completeness to SUN SPARC (hosted under Solaris) and Palm compatible handhelds (native).

===Will there be a port of AROS to PPC?===

There is a port on the Sam-440 board made by [http://msaros.blogspot.com/ Michael Schulz] and another port to EFIKA 5200B.

Furthermore, a Linux-PPC hosted AROS exists already.

==Why are you using Linux and X11?==

We use Linux and X11 to speed up development. For example, if you implement a new function to open a window you can simply write that single function and don't have to write hundreds of other functions in layers.library, graphics.library, a slew of device drivers and the rest that that function might need to use.

The goal for AROS is of course to be independent of Linux and X11 (but it would still be able to run on them if people really wanted to), and that is slowly becoming a reality with the native versions of AROS. We still need to use Linux for development though, since good development tools haven't been ported to AROS yet.

==Why does autorepeat stop working in X11 after running AROS?==

This is a long-standing bug in AROS. Run the following command after having quit AROS to enable autorepeat again:

&gt; xset r on

==How do you intend to make AROS portable?==

One of the major new features in AROS compared to AmigaOS is the HIDD (Hardware Independent Device Drivers) system, which will allow us to port AROS to different hardware quite easily. Basically, the core OS libraries do not hit the hardware directly but instead go through the HIDDs, which are coded using an object oriented system that makes it easy to replace HIDDs and reuse code.

==Why do you think AROS will make it?==

We hear all the day from a lot of people that AROS won't make it. Most of them either don't know what we are doing or they think the Amiga is already dead. After we explained what we do to the former, most agree that it is possible. The latter make more problems. Well, is Amiga dead right now? Those who are still using their Amigas will probably tell you that it isn't. Did your A500 or A4000 blow up when Commodore went bankrupt? Did it blow up when Amiga Technologies did?

The fact is that there is quite little new software developed for the Amiga (although Aminet still chugs along quite nicely) and that hardware is also developed at a lower speed (but the most amazing gadgets seem appear right now). The Amiga community (which is still alive) seems to be sitting and waiting. And if someone releases a product which is a bit like the Amiga back in 1984, then that machine will boom again. And who knows, maybe you will get a CD along with the machine labeled &quot;AROS&quot;. :-)

==What do I do if AROS won't compile?==

Please post a message with details (for example, the error messages you get) on the AROS User mailing list or become a developer and subscribe to the AROS Developer list and post it there, and someone will try to help you.

==Will AROS have memory protection, SVM, RT, ...?==

This is a heavily discussed subject, some people say yes others no - only time will tell....

==Can I become a beta tester?==

Sure, no problem. In fact, we want as many beta testers as possible, so everyone is welcome! We don't keep a list of beta testers though, so all you have to do is to download AROS, test whatever you want and send us a report.

==What is the relation between AROS and UAE?==

UAE is an Amiga emulator, and as such has somewhat different goals than AROS. UAE wants to be binary compatible even for games and hardware hitting code, while AROS wants to have native applications. Therefore AROS is much faster than UAE, but you can run more software under UAE.

We are in loose contact with the author of UAE and there is a good chance that code for UAE will appear in AROS and vice versa. For example, the UAE developers are interested in the source for the OS because UAE could run some applications much faster if some or all OS functions could be replaced with native code. On the other hand, AROS could benefit from having an integrated Amiga emulation.

Since most programs won't be available on AROS from the start, Fabio Alemagna has ported UAE to AROS so you can run old programs at least in an emulation box.

==What is the relation between AROS and Haage &amp; Partner?==

Haage &amp; Partner used parts of AROS in AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9, for example the colorwheel and gradientslider gadgets and the SetENV command. This means that in a way, AROS has become part of the official AmigaOS. This does not imply that there is any formal relation between AROS and Haage &amp; Partner. AROS is an open source project, and anyone can use our code in their own projects provided they follow the license.

==What is the relation between AROS and MorphOS?==

The relationship between AROS and MorphOS is basically the same as between AROS and Haage &amp; Partner. MorphOS uses parts of AROS to speed up their development effort; under the terms of our license. As with Haage &amp; Partner, this is good for both the teams, since the MorphOS team gets a boost to their development from AROS and AROS gets good improvements to our source code from the MorphOS team. There is no formal relation between AROS and MorphOS; this is simply how open source development works.

==What programming languages are available?==

Most development for AROS is done using ANSI C by crosscompiling the sources under a different OS, e.g. Linux, FreeBSD or NetBSD.

* C/C++ via native included gcc/g++ (initially by Fabia Alemagna) or Murks! IDE or crosscompilig under a different OS (Linux, Windows)
* Python is a scripting language which has become quite popular, because of its nice design and features (object-oriented programming, module system, many useful modules included, clean syntax, ...). 
* Regina is a portable ANSI compliant REXX interpreter. The goal for the AROS port is to be compatible with the ARexx interpreter for the classic AmigaOS.
* False can be classified as an exotic language, so it will most likely not be used for serious development, although it can be lots of fun. :-)
* Lua
* PortablE is a open source implementation of Amiga E, written from scratch in E and able to self-compile. Can be found at http://cshandley.co.uk/portable
* Ruby
* Basic4SDL (b4sdl)

see [[Aros/Developer/Docs|AROS Developer Docs]] for more

==Why is there no m68k emulator in AROS?==

To make old Amiga programs run on AROS, we have ported UAE to AROS. AROS' version of UAE will probably be a bit faster than other versions UAE since AROS needs less resources than other operating systems (which means UAE will get more CPU time), and we'll try to patch the kickstart ROM in UAE to call AROS functions which will give another small improvement. Of course, this only applies to the native flavors of AROS and not the hosted flavors.

But why don't we simply implement a virtual m68k CPU to run software directly on AROS? Well, the problem here is that m68k software expects the data to be in big endian format while AROS also runs on little endian CPUs. The problem here is that the little endian routines in the AROS core would have to work with the big endian data in the emulation. Automatic conversion seems to be impossible (just an example: there is a field in a structure in the AmigaOS which sometimes contains one ULONG and sometimes two WORDs) because we cannot tell how a couple of bytes in RAM are encoded.

==What is Zune?==

In case you read on this site about Zune, it's simply an open-source reimplementation of MUI, which is a powerful (as in user- and developer-friendly) object-oriented shareware GUI toolkit and de-facto standard on AmigaOS. Zune is the preferred GUI toolkit to develop native AROS applications. As for the name itself, it means nothing, but sounds good. Zune is also a handheld MP3-player / multimedia hardware product from Microsoft, but is in no way related to AROS' Zune.

====Overview====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Research_Operating_System AROS] uses several custom development tools in its build-system to aid developers by providing an easy means to generate custom makefiles for amigaos like components.

The most important ones are:

* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#MetaMake MetaMake]: A make supervisor program. It can keep track of targets available in makefiles available in subdirectories a certain root directory. A more in depth explanation is given below. 
      
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#GenMF GenMF]: (generate makefile) A macro language for makefiles. It allows to combine several make rules into one macro which can simplify writing makefiles. 
      
* Several AROS specific tools that will be explained more when appropriate during the rest of this documentation. 


====MetaMake====
=====Introduction=====

MetaMake is a special version of make which allows the build-system to recursively build &quot;targets&quot; in the various directories of a project, or even another project.

The name of the makefile's used is defined in the MetaMake [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#Usage_and_configuration_files config file] and defaults to mmakefile for AROS - so we shall use this name to donate MetaMake Makefiles from here on in.

MetaMake searches directory tree's for mmakefiles - and, for each it finds, process's the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#metatargets metatargets].  

You can also specify a program which converts &quot;source&quot; mmakefiles (aptly named mmakefile.src) into proper mmakefile's before MetaMake will be invoked on the created mmakefile.



======MetaTargets======

MetaMake uses normal makefile syntax but gives a special meaning to a comment line that start with #MM. This line is used to define so called metatargets.

There exist three ways of defining a metatarget in a makefile:


======Real MetaTargets======

    '''#MM metatarget : metaprerequisites'''
        
        This defines a metatarget with its metaprerquisites:
        
        When a user asks to build this metatarget, first the metaprerequisites
        will be build as metatargets, and afterwards the given metatarget.
      
        This form also indicates that in this makefile also a makefile target
        is present with the same name.
        
    '''#MM'''
    '''metatarget : prerequisites'''
        
        This form indicates that the make target on the next line is also a
        metatarget but the prerequisites are not metaprerequisites:
        
        The line for the definition of a metatarget can be spread over several
        lines if one ends every line with the character and starts the next
        line with #MM.

======Virtual MetaTargets======


    '''#MM- metatarget : metaprerequisites'''
        
        This is the same definition as for Real MetaTarget's - only now no
        &quot;normal&quot; make target is present in the makefile with the same name as
        the metatarget:



=====How MetaMake works=====

MetaMake is run with a metatarget to be built specified on the command line.

MetaMake will first build up a tree of all the mmakefiles present in a directory and all subdirectories (typically from the aros source base directory) - and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#Autogenerating_mmakefile's autogenerate] them where applicable. While doing this it will process the mmakefiles and build a tree of all the defined metatargets and their dependencies.

Next it will build all the dependencies (metaprerequisites) needed for the specified metatarget - and finally the metatarget itself.

''metaprerequisite are metatarget's in their own rite - and are processed in the same fashion so that dependancies they have are also fulfilled.''

For each metatarget, a walk through of all the directories is done - and in every mmakefile where [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#Real_MetaTarget's Real MetaTarget's] are defined, make is called with the name of the target as a &quot;make target&quot;.


======Exported variables======

When MetaMake calls normal make, it also defines two variables...
   
   $(TOP) contains the value of the rootdirectory.
   $(CURDIR) contains the path relative to $(TOP).

======Autogenerating mmakefile's======

Another feature of MetaMake is automatic generation of mmakefile's from a source mmakefile's.

When the directory tree is scanned for mmakefiles, ones with a .src suffix that are newer then any present mmakefile are processed using a specified script that regenerate's the mmakefile from the source mmakefile. The called script is defined in the configuration file.

=====Examples=====

The next few examples are taken from the AROS project.

======Example 1: normal dependencies======

      #MM contrib-regina-module : setup linklibs includes contrib-regina-includes

This example says that in this makefile a contrib-regina-module is present that has to be build but the before building this metatarget first the metatargets setup, linklibs, ... has to be build; e.g. that the includes linklibs etc. have to be present before that this module can be build.

======Example 2: metatarget consisting of submetatargets======

      #MM- contrib-freetype : contrib-freetype-linklib \
      #MM      contrib-freetype-graph \
      #MM      contrib-freetype-fonts \
      #MM      contrib-freetype-demos

Here actually is said that the contrib-freetype metatarget consists of building linklib, graph, fonts and demos of freetype. If some extra work needs to be done in the makefile where this metatarget the definition can start with '#MM ' and a normal make target 'contrib-freetype' has to be present in the makefile.

Also the use of the line continuation for the metatarget definition is shown here.

======Example 3: Quick building of a target======

      #MM workbench-utilities : includes linklibs setup-clock-catalogs
      #MM
      workbench-utilities-quick : workbench-utilities

When a user executes MetaMake with workbench-utilities as an argument, make will be called in all the directories where the metaprerequisites are present in the makefile. This can become quite annoying when debugging programs. When now the second metatarget workbench-utilities-quick is defined as shown above only that target will be build in this directory. Of course the user has then to be sure that the metatargets on which workbench-utilities depend are up-to-date.

=====Usage and configuration files=====

Usage: &lt;code&gt;mmake [options] [metatargets]&lt;/code&gt;

To build mmake, just compile &lt;code&gt;mmake.c.&lt;/code&gt; It doesn't need any other files.

mmake looks for a config file &lt;code&gt;mmake.config&lt;/code&gt; or .mmake.config in the current directory for a file in the environment variable &lt;code&gt;$MMAKE_CONFIG&lt;/code&gt; or a file &lt;code&gt;.mmake.config&lt;/code&gt; in the directory &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt;.

This file can contain the following things:

;      #
:            This must be the first character in a line and begins a comment.
:            Comments are completely ignored my mmake (as are empty lines).
      
;      text=&quot;[&lt;name&gt;]&quot;
:            This begins a config section for the project name. You can build
:            targets for this project by saying name.target.
      
;      maketool &lt;tool options...&gt;
:            Specifies the name of the tool to build a target. The default is
:            make &quot;TOP=$(TOP)&quot; &quot;CURDIR=$(CURDIR)&quot;.
      
;      top &lt;dir&gt;
:            Specifies the root directory for a project. You will later find
:            this config option in the variable $(TOP). The default is the
:            current directory.
      
;      defaultmakefilename &lt;filename&gt;
:            Specifies the basename for makefiles in your project. Basename means
:            that mmake will consider other files which have this stem and an
:            extension, too. See the items to generate makefiles for details.
:            The default is Makefile.
      
;      defaulttarget &lt;target&gt;
:            The name of the default target which mmake will try to make if you
:            call it with the name of the project alone. The default is all.
      
;      genmakefilescript &lt;cmdline...&gt;
:            mmake will check for files with the basename as specified in
:            defaultmakefilename with the extension .src. If such a file is found,
:            the following conditions are checked: Whether this file is newer than
:            the makefile, whether the makefile doesn't exist and whether the file
:            genmakefiledeps is newer than the makefile. If any of these is true,
:            mmake will call this script the the name of the source file as an extra
:            option and the stdout of this script will be redirected to
:            defaultmakefilename. If this is missing, mmake will not try to
:            regenerate makefiles.
      
;      genmakefiledeps &lt;path&gt;
:            This is the name of a file which is considered when mmake tries to
:            decide whether a makefile must be regenerated. Currently, only one
:            such file can be specified.
      
;      globalvarfile &lt;path&gt;
:            This is a file which contains more variables in the normal make(1)
:            syntax. mmake doesn't know about any special things like line
:            continuation, so be careful not to use such variables later (but
:            they don't do any harm if they exist in the file. You should just
:            not use them anywhere in mmake).
      
;      add &lt;path&gt;
:            Adds a nonstandard makefile to the list of makefiles for this
:            project. mmake will apply the standard rules to it as if the
:            defaultmakefilename was like this filename.
      
;      ignoredir &lt;path&gt;
:            Will tell mmake to ignore directories with this name. Try ignore
:            CVS if you use CVS to manage your projects' sources.

:Any option which is not recognised will be added to the list of known variables (ie. foo bar will create a variable $(foo) which is expanded to bar).
Example

Here is an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
      # This is a comment
      # Options before the first [name] are defaults. Use them for global
      # defaults
      defaultoption value
      
      # Special options for the project name. You can build targets for this
      # project with &quot;mmake name.target&quot;
      [AROS]
      
      # The root dir of the project. This can be accessed as $(TOP) in every
      # makefile or when you have to specify a path in mmake. The default is
      # the current directory
      top /home/digulla/AROS
      
      # This is the default name for Makefiles. The default is &quot;Makefile&quot;
      defaultmakefilename makefile
      
      # If you just say &quot;mmake AROS&quot;, then mmake will go for this target
      defaulttarget AROS
      
      # mmake allows to generate makefiles with a script. The makefile
      # will be regenerated if it doesn't exist, if the source file is
      # newer or if the file specified with genmakefiledeps is newer.
      # The name of the source file is generated by concatenating
      # defaultmakefilename and &quot;.src&quot;
      genmakefilescript gawk -f $(TOP)/scripts/genmf.gawk --assign &quot;TOP=$(TOP)&quot;
      
      # If this file is newer than the makefile, the script
      # genmakefilescript will be executed.
      genmakefiledeps $(TOP)/scripts/genmf.gawk
      
      # mmake will read this file and every variable in this file will
      # be available everywhere where you can use a variable.
      globalvarfile $(TOP)/config/host.cfg
      
      # Some makefiles must have a different name than
      # defaultmakefilename. You can add them manually here.
      #add compiler/include/makefile
      #add makefile
&lt;/source&gt;
A metatarget look like so: project.target. Example: AROS.setup. If nothing is specified, mmake will make the default target of the first project in the config file. If the project is specified but no target, mmake will make the default target of this project.

====GenMF====
=====Introduction=====

Genmf uses two files for generating a makefile. First is the macro definition file and finally the source makefile where these macro's can be used.

      * This syntax example assumes you have AROS' sources (either from SVN or downloaded
        from the homesite).  Assuming 'genmf.py' is found in your $PATH and that $AROSDIR
        points to location of AROS' sources root (e.g. /home/projects/AROS or alike).
        
            [user@localhost]# genmf.py $AROSDIR/config/make.tmpl mmakefile.src mmakefile
        
        This creates a mmakefile from the mmakefile.src in the current directory.

In general the % character is used as the special character for genmf source makefiles.


After ./configure i run the make command and that halts with an error from within the genmf.py script that is cannot find some file. the files that are fed to the genmf.py script seem to be lines in the /tmp/genmfxxxx file. the problem is that the lines are not created right. so when the lines are fed to the genmf.py script it cannot handle it.

Metamake creates tmpfiles:
 ./cache.c:    strcpy(tmpname, &quot;/tmp/genmfXXXXXX&quot;);

Metamake actually calls genmf.py to generate the genmf file. It is located in  bin/$(arch)-$(cpu)/tools

MetaMake uses time stamps to find out if a mmakefile has changed and needs to be reparsed. For mmakefiles with dynamic targets we would have to avoid that time stamp comparison.

This is I think only the case if the metarules would change depending on an external config file without that the mmakefile itself changes.

But this reminds me another feature I had in mind for mmake. I would make it possible to have real files as prerequisites of metatargets. This is to avoid that make is called unnecessary in directories. I would introduce a special character to indicate if a metatarget depends on a file, let's take @ and have the following rule
&lt;pre&gt;
__MM__ ::
    echo bar : @foo
&lt;/pre&gt;
This would indicate that for this mmakefile metatarget 'bar' only has to
be build if file foo changes. So if mmake wants to build metatarget
'bar' if would only call make if file foo in the same directory as the
mmakefile has changed.

This feature would also be able to indicate if the metarules have to be
rebuild, I would allocate the special __MM__ metatarget for it. By
default always the implicit metarule would be there:
&lt;pre&gt;
__MM__ ::
    echo __MM__ : @mmakefile
&lt;/pre&gt;
But people could add config files is needed:
&lt;pre&gt;
__MM__ ::
    echo __MM__ : @mmconffile
&lt;/pre&gt;


Does MetaMake really do variable substitution?  Yes, have a look in the var.c file.

The generated mmakefile for Demos/Galaxy still has #MM- demo-galaxy : demo-galaxy-$(AROS_TARGET_CPU)
and I think the substitution is done later by Gnu/Make.

No, for gmake it is just a comment line; it does not know anything about mmake. And it also the opposite case; mmake does not know anything about gmake it just all the lines starting with #MM.
So the next thing does not what you think it does in a gmake file: 

&lt;pre&gt;
ifeq ($(target), )
#MM includes : includes-here
else
#MM $(target) : includes-here
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

mmake will see both lines as just ignores the if statement !
It will complain if it does not know target. That is on of the main reasons I proposed the above feature.

The main feature of mmake is that is allows for modular directory structure you can add or delete directories in the build tree and metamake will automatically update the metarules and the build itself to the new situation. For example it would allow to checkout only a few subdirectories of the ports directory if one wants to work on one of the programs there.




=====Macro definition=====

A macro definition has the following syntax:

      %define macroname option1[=[default][\A][\M]] option2[=[default][\A][\M]] ...
      ...
      %end

macroname is the name of the macro. option1, option2, ... are the arguments for the macro. These options can be used in the body of this template by typing %(option1). This will be replaced be the value of option1.

The macro can be followed by a default value. If no default value is specified an empty string is taken. Normally no space are allowed in the default value of an argument. If this is needed this can be done by surrounding the value with double quotes (&quot;).

Also two switches can be given:

      \A
            Is the switch to always need a value for this. When the macro is
            instantiated always a value need to be assigned to this argument.
      
      \M
            Is the switch to turn on multi words. This means that all the words
            following this argument will be assigned to this argument. This also
            means that after the use of such an argument no other argument can be
            present because it will become part of this argument.

=====Macro instantiation=====

The instantiation of the macro is done by using the '%' character followed by the name of the macro to instantiate (without a round brackets around it):

      %macro_name [option1=]value [option2=]value

Two ways are possible to specify value for arguments to a macro:

      value
            This will assign the value to the argument defined as the first argument
            to this macro. The time this format is used it will be assigned to the
            second argument and so on.
      
      option1=value
            This will assign the given value to the option with the specified name.

When giving values to arguments also double quotes need to be used if one wants to include spaces in the values of the arguments.

Macro instantiation may be used inside the body of a macro, even macro's that will only be defined later on in the macro definition file.

==AROS Build-System usage==

====AROS Build-System configuration====

Before the build-system can be invoked via make - you will need to run &quot;./configure&quot; to set up the environment for your chosen target platform

i.e. 

./configure --target=pc-i386

This causes the configure script to perform the following operations ...

====AROS mmakefile.src High-Level Macros====

'''Note''' : In the definition of the genmf rules sometimes mmake variables are used as default variables for an argument (e.g. dflags=%(cflags)). This is not really possible in the definition file but is done by using text that has the same effect.

'''Building programs'''

There are two macro's for building programs. One macro [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#.25build_progs %build_progs] that will compile every input file to a separate executable and one macro [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/BuildSystem#.25build_prog %build_prog] that will compile and link all the input files into one executable.

=====%build_progs=====

This macro will compile and link every input file to a separate executable and has the following definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
%define build_progs mmake=/A files=/A \
      objdir=$(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR) targetdir=$(AROSDIR)/$(CURDIR) \
      cflags=$(CFLAGS) dflags=$(BD_CFLAGS$(BDID)) ldflags=$(LDFLAGS) \
      uselibs= usehostlibs= usestartup=yes detach=no
&lt;/source&gt;

With the following arguments:

;      mmake=/A
:            This is the name of the metatarget that will build the programs.
      
;      files=/A
:            The basenames of the C source files that will be compiled and
:            linked to executables. For every name present in this list an
:            executable with the same name will be generated.
      
;      objdir=$(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR)
:            The directory where the compiled object files will be put.
      
;      targetdir=$(AROSDIR)/$(CURDIR)
:            The directory where the executables will be placed.
      
;      cflags=$(CFLAGS)
:            The flags to add when compiling the .c files. By default the
:            standard AROS cflags (the $(CFLAGS) make variables are taken.
:            This also means that some flags can be added by assigning these
:            to the USER_CFLAGS and USER_INCLUDES make variables before
:            using this macro.
      
;      dflags=%(cflags)
:            The flags to add when doing the dependency check. Default is
:            the same as the cflags.
      
;      ldflags=$(LDFLAGS)
:            The flags to use when linking the executables. By default the
:            standard AROS link flags will be used.
      
;      uselibs=
:            A list of static libraries to add when linking the executables.
:            This is the name of the library without the lib prefix or the .a
:            suffix and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags
:            for the C compiler.
      
:            By default no libraries are used when linking the executables.
      
;      usehostlibs=
:            A list of static libraries of the host to add when linking the
:            executables. This is the name of the library without the lib prefix
:            or the .a suffix and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags
:            for the C compiler.
      
:            By default no libraries are used when linking the executables.
      
:      usestartup=yes
:            Use the standard startup code for the executables. By default this
:            is yes and this is also what one wants most of the time. Only disable
:            this if you know what you are doing.
      
;      detach=no
:            Wether the executables will run detached. Defaults to no.

=====%build_prog=====

&lt;pre&gt;
seems that the %build_prog macros is currently alway producing stripped binaries, even in debug build. To workaround this problem, I need to define TARGET_STRIP in the following way:

TARGET_STRIP := $(STRIP)

%build_prog mmake=&quot;egltest&quot; progname=&quot;egltest&quot; files=&quot;$(EGL_SOURCES) peglgears&quot; uselibs=&quot;GL galliumauxiliary&quot;

Can someone with enough knowledge please fix the macro so that it produces unstripped binaries for debug builds again
&lt;/pre&gt;

This macro will compile and link the input files to an executable and has the following definition:

      %define build_prog mmake=/A progname=/A files=%(progname) asmfiles= \
            objdir=$(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR) targetdir=$(AROSDIR)/$(CURDIR) \
            cflags=$(CFLAGS) dflags=$(BD_CFLAGS$(BDID)) ldflags=$(LDFLAGS) \
            aflags=$(AFLAFS) uselibs= usehostlibs= usestartup=yes detach=no

With the following arguments:

      mmake=/A
            This is the name of the metatarget that will build the program.
      
      progname=/A
            The name of the executable.
      
      files=
            The basenames of the C source files that will be compiled and linked
            into the executable. By default just the name of the executable
            is taken.
      
      asmfiles=
            The assembler files to assemble and include in the executable. By
            default no asm files are included in the executable.
      
      objdir=$(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR)
            The directory where the compiled object files will be put.
      
      targetdir=$(AROSDIR)/$(CURDIR)
            The directory where the executables will be placed.
      
      cflags=$(CFLAGS)
            The flags to add when compiling the .c files. By default the standard
            AROS cflags (the $(CFLAGS) make variable) are taken. This also means
            that some flags can be added by assigning these to the USER_CFLAGS
            and USER_INCLUDES make variables before using this macro.
      
      dflags=%(cflags)
            The flags to add when doing the dependency check. Default is the
            same as the cflags.
      
      aflags=$(AFLAGS)
            The flags to add when compiling the asm files. By default the standard
            AROS aflags (e.g. $(AFLAGS)) are taken. This also means that some
            flags can be added by assigning these to the SPECIAL_AFLAGS make
            variable before using this macro.
      
      ldflags=$(LDFLAGS)
            The flags to use when linking the executable. By default the
            standard AROS link flags will be used.
      
      uselibs=
            A list of static libraries to add when linking the executable. This
            is the name of the library without the lib prefix or the .a suffix
            and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags for the C compiler.
      
            By default no libraries are used when linking the executable.
      
      usehostlibs=
            A list of static libraries of the host to add when linking the
            executable. This is the name of the library without the lib prefix
            or the .a suffix and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags
            for the C compiler.
      
            By default no libraries are used when linking the executable.
      
      usestartup=yes
            Use the standard startup code for the executables. By default this
            is yes and this is also what one wants most of the time. Only disable
            this if you know what you are doing.
      
      detach=no
            Wether the executable will run detached. Defaults to no.

=====%build_linklib=====
'''Building static linklibraries'''

Building link libraries is straight forward. A list of files will be compiled or assembled and collected in a link library into a specified target directory.

The definition of the macro is as follows:

      %define build_linklib mmake=/A libname=/A files=&quot;$(basename $(wildcard *.c)) \
            asmfiles= cflags=$(CFLAGS) dflags=%(cflags) aflags=$(AFLAGS) \
            objdir=$(OBJDIR) libdir=$(LIBDIR)

With the meaning of the arguments as follows:

      mmake=/A
            This is the name of the metatarget that will build the linklib.
      
      libname=/A
            The base name of the library to generate. The file that will be
            generated will be called lib%(libname).a
      
      files=$(basename $(wildcard *.c))
            The C files to compile and include in the library. By default all
            the files ending in .c in the source directory will be used.
      
      asmfiles=
            The assembler files to assemble and include in the library. By
            default no asm files are included in the library.
      
      cflags=$(CFLAGS)
            The flags to use when compiling the .c files. By default the
            standard AROS cflags (e.g. $(CFLAGS)) are taken. This also means
            that some flags can be added by assigning these to the USER_CFLAGS
            and USER_INCLUDES make variables before using this macro.
      
      dflags=%(cflags)
            The flags to add when doing the dependency check. Default is the
            same as the cflags.
      
      aflags=$(AFLAGS)
            The flags to add when compiling the asm files. By default the standard
            AROS aflags (e.g. $(AFLAGS)) are taken. This also means that some
            flags can be added by assigning these to the SPECIAL_AFLAGS make
            variable before using this macro.
      
      objdir=$(OBJDIR)
            The directory where to generate all the intermediate files. The
            default value is $(OBJDIR) which in itself is by default equal to
            $(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR).
      
      libdir=$(LIBDIR)
            The directory to put the library in. By default the standard lib
            directory $(LIBDIR) will be used.

=====%build_module=====

Building modules consists of two parts. First is a macro to use in mmakefile.src files. Another is a configuration file that describes the contents of the module.

======The mmakefile.src macro======

This is the definition header of the build_module macro:

      %define build_module mmake=/A modname=/A modtype=/A            \
            conffile=%(modname).conf files=&quot;$(basename $(wildcard *.c))&quot; \
            cflags=$(CFLAGS) dflags=%(cflags) objdir=$(OBJDIR)           \
            linklibname=%(modname) uselibs=

Here is a list of the arguments for this macro:

      
      mmake=/A
            This is the name of the metatarget that will build the module.
            Also a %(mmake)-quick and %(mmake)-clean metatarget will be defined.
      
      modname=/A
            This is the name of the module without the suffix.
      
      modtype=/A
            This is the type of the module and corresponds with the suffix of
            the module. At the moment only library, mcc, mui and mcp are
            supported. Support for other modules is planned in the future.
      
      conffile=%(modname).conf
            The name of the configuration file. Default is modname.conf.
      
      files=&quot;$(basename $(wildcard *.c))&quot;
            A list of all the C source files without the .c suffix that contain
            the code for this module. By default all the .c files in the current
            directory will be taken.
      
      cflags=$(CFLAGS)
            The flags to use when compiling the .c files. By default the
            standard AROS cflags (e.g. $(CFLAGS)) are taken. This also means
            that some flags can be added by assigning these to the USER_CFLAGS
            and USER_INCLUDES make variables before using this macro.
      
      dflags=%(cflags)
            The flags to add when doing the dependency check. Default is the
            same as the cflags.
      
      objdir=$(OBJDIR)
            The directory where to generate all the intermediate files. The
            default value is $(OBJDIR) which in itself is by default equal
            to $(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR).
      
      linklibname=%(modname)
            The name to be used for the static link library that contains
            the library autoinit code and the stubs converting C stack calling
            convention to a call off the function from the library functable
            with the appropriate calling mechanism. These stubs are normally
            not needed when the AROS defines for module functions are not disabled.
      
            There will always be a file generated with the name
      
                  $(LIBDIR)/lib%(linklibname).a
      
            .. and by default linklibname will be the same as modname.
      
      uselibs=
            A list of static libraries to add when linking the module. This is
            the name of the library without the lib prefix or the .a suffix
            and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags for the C compiler.
      
            By default no libraries are used when linking the module.

======The module configuration file======

The module configuration file is subdived in several sections. A section is defined with the following lines:

      ## begin sectionname
      ...
      ## end sectionname

The interpretation of the lines between the ##begin and ##end statement is different for every section. The following sections are defined:

      
      * config
      
            The lines in this section have all the same format:
      
                  optionname string
      
            with the string starting from the first non white space after
            optionname to the last non white space character on that line.
      
            A list of all the options available:
      
            basename
      
                  Followed by the base name for this module. This will be used
                  as a prefix for a lot of symbols. By default the modname
                  specified in the makefile is taken with the first letter
                  capitalized.
      
            libbase
      
                  The name of the variable to the library base in. By default
                  the basename will be taken with Base added to the end.
      
            libbasetype
      
                  The type to use for the libbase for use internally for the
                  library code. E.g. the sizeof operator applied to this type
                  has to yield the real size of the object. Be aware that it
                  may not be specified as a pointer. By default
                  'struct LibHeader' is taken.
      
            libbasetypeextern
      
                  The type to use for the libbase for code using the library
                  externally. By default 'struct Library' is taken.
      
            version
      
                  The version to compile into the module. This has to be
                  specified as major.minor. By default 0.0 will be used.
      
            date
      
                  The date that this library was made. This has to have the
                  format of DD.MM.YYYY. As a default 00.00.0000 is taken.
      
            libcall
      
                  The argument passing mechanism used for the functions in
                  this module. It can be either 'stack' or 'register'. By
                  default 'stack' will be used.
      
            forcebase
      
                  This will force the use of a certain base variable in the
                  static link library for auto opening the module. Thus it
                  is only valid for module that support auto opening. This
                  option can be present more than once in the config section
                  and then all these base will be in the link library. By default
                  no base variable will be present in the link library.
      
      * cdef
      
            In this section all the C code has to be written that will declare
            all the type of the arguments of the function listed in the
            function. All valid C code is possible including the use of #include.
      
      * functionlist
      
            In this section all the functions externally accessible by programs.
      
            For stack based argument passing only a list of the functions has to
            be given. For register based argument passing the names of the
            register have to be given between rounded brackets. If you have
            function foo with the first argument in D0 and the second argument
            in A0 it gives the following line in in the list:
      
                  foo(D0,A0)

=====%build_module_macro=====
'''Building modules (the legacy way)'''

Before the %build_module macro was developed already a lot of code was written. There a mixture of macro's was usedin the mmakefile and they were quite complicated. To clean up these mmakefiles without needing to rewrite too much of the code itself a second genmf macro was created to build modules that were written using the older methodology. This macro is called build_module_macro. For writing new modules people should consider this macro as depricated and only use this macro when the %build_module doesn't support the module yet they want to create.

======The mmakefile.src macro======

This is the definition header of the build_module_macro macro:

      %define build_module_macro mmake=/A modname=/A modtype=/A \
            conffile=%(modname).conf initfile=%(modname)_init \
            funcs= files= linklibfiles= cflags=$(CFLAGS) dflags=%(cflags) \
            objdir=$(OBJDIR) linklibname=%(modname) uselibs= usehostlibs= \
            genfunctable= genincludes= compiler=target

Here is a list of the arguments for this macro:

      mmake=/A
            This is the name of the metatarget that will build the module.
            It will define that metatarget but won't include any metaprerequisites.
            If you need these you can add by yourself with an extra
            #MM metatargets : ... line. Also a %(mmake)-quick and
            %(mmake)-clean metatarget will be defined.
      
      modname=/A
            This is the name of the module without the suffix.
      
      modtype=/A
            This is the type of the module and corresponds with the suffix
            of the module. It can be one of the following : library gadget
            datatype handler device resource mui mcc hidd.
      
      conffile=%(modname).conf
            The name of the configuration file. Default is modname.conf.
      
      funcs=
            A list of all the source files with the .c suffix that contain the
            code for the function of a module. Only one function per C file
            is allowed and the function has to be defined using the
            AROS_LHA macro's.
      
      files=
            A list of all the extra files with the .c suffix that contain the
            extra code for this module.
      
      initfile=%(modname)_init
            The file with the init code of the module.
      
      cflags=$(CFLAGS)
            The flags to add when compiling the .c files. By default the
            standard AROS cflags (the $(CFLAGS) make variables are taken.
            This also means that some flags can be added by assigning these
            to the USER_CFLAGS and USER_INCLUDES make variables before using
            this macro.
      
      dflags=%(cflags)
            The flags to add when doing the dependency check. Default is the
            same as the cflags.
      
      objdir=$(OBJDIR)
            The directory where to generate all the intermediate files. The
            default value is $(OBJDIR) which in itself is by default equal
            to $(GENDIR)/$(CURDIR).
      
      linklibname=%(modname)
            The name to be used for the static link library that contains the
            library autoinit code and the stubs converting C stack calling
            convention to a call off the function from the library functable
            with the appropriate calling mechanism. These stubs are normally
            not needed when the AROS defines for module function are not disabled.
      
            There will always be a file generated with the name :
      
                  $(LIBDIR)/lib%(linklibname).a
      
            ... and by default linklibname will be the same as modname.
      
      uselibs=
            A list of static libraries to add when linking the module. This
            is the name of the library without the lib prefix or the .a suffix
            and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags for the C compiler.
      
            By default no libraries are used when linking the module.
      
      usehostlibs=
            A list of static libraries of the host to add when linking the module.
            This is the name of the library without the lib prefix or the .a
            suffix and without the -l prefix for the use in the flags for the
            C compiler.
      
            By default no libraries are used when linking the module.
      
      genfunctable=
            Bool that has to have a value of yes or no or left empty. This
            indicates if the functable needs to be generated. If empty the
            functable will only be generated when funcs is not empty.
      
      genincludes=
            Bool that has to have a value of yes or no or left empty. This
            indicates if the includes needs to be generated. If empty the
            includes will only be generated for a library, a gadget or a device.
      
      compiler=target
            Indicates which compiler to use during compilation. Can be either
            target or host to use the target compiler or the host compiler.
            By default the target compiler is used.

======The module configuration file======

For the build_module_macro two files are used. First is the module configuration file (modname.conf or lib.conf) and second is the headers.tmpl file.

The modules config file is file with a number of lines with the following syntax:

      
      name &lt;string&gt;
      
            Init the various fields with reasonable defaults. If &lt;string&gt; is
            XXX, then this is the result:
      
                  libname         xxx
                  basename        Xxx
                  libbase         XxxBase
                  libbasetype     XxxBase
                  libbasetypeptr  XxxBase *
      
            Variables will only be changed if they have not yet
            been specified.
      
      libname &lt;string&gt;
      
            Set libname to &lt;string&gt;. This is the name of the library
            (i.e. you can open it with &lt;string&gt;.library). It will show up
            in the version string, too.
      
      basename &lt;string&gt;
      
            Set basename to &lt;string&gt;. The basename is used in the AROS-LHx
            macros in the location part (last parameter) and to specify defaults
            for libbase and libbasetype in case they have no value yet. If
            &lt;string&gt; is xXx, then libbase will become xXxBase and libbasetype
            will become xXxBase.
      
      libbase &lt;string&gt;
      
            Defines the name of the library base (i.e. SysBase, DOSBase,
            IconBase, etc.). If libbasetype is not set, then it is set
            to &lt;string&gt;, too.
      
      libbasetype &lt;string&gt;
      
            The type of libbase (with struct), i.e. struct ExecBase,
            struct DosLibrary, struct IconBase, etc.).
      
      libbasetypeptr &lt;string&gt;
      
            Type of a pointer to the libbase. (e.g. struct ExecBase *).
      
      version &lt;version&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;
      
            Specifies the version and revision of the library. 41.0103
            means version 41 and revision 103.
      
      copyright &lt;string&gt;
      
            Copyright string.
      
      define &lt;string&gt;
      
            The define to use to protect the resulting file against double
            inclusion (i.e. #ifndef &lt;string&gt;...). The default is _LIBDEFS_H.
      
      type &lt;string&gt;
      
            What kind of library is this ? Valid values for &lt;string&gt;
            are: device, library, resource and hidd.
      
      option &lt;string&gt;...
      
            Specify an option. Valid values for &lt;string&gt; are:
      
            o noexpunge
      
                  Once the lib/dev is loaded, it can't be removed from

            You can specify more than one option in a config file and more
            than one option per option line. Separate options by space.

======The header.tmpl file======

Contrary to the %build_module macro for %build_module_macro the C header information is not included in the configuration file but an additional files is used with the name headers.tmpl. This file has different section where each of the sections will be copied in a certain include file that is generated when the module is build. A section has a structure as follows:

      ##begin sectionname
      ...
      ##end sectionname

With sectionname one of the following choices:

      * defines
      * clib
      * proto

=====%build_archspecific=====
'''Compiling arch and/or CPU specific files'''

In the previous paragraph the method was explained how a module can be build with the AROS genmf macro's. Sometimes one wants to replace certain files in a module with an implementation only valid for a certain arch or a certain CPU.
The macro definition

Arch specific files are handled by the macro called %build_archspecific and it has the following header:

      %define build_archspecific mainmmake=/A maindir=/A arch=/A files= asmfiles= \
            cflags=$(CFLAGS) dflags=%(cflags) aflags=$(AFLAGS) compiler=target

And the explanation of the argument to this macro:

      mainmmake=/A
            The mmake of the module from which one wants to replace files
            or to wich to add additional files.
      
      maindir=/A
            The directory where the object files of the main module are stored.
            The is only the path relative to $(GENDIR). Most of the time this
            is the directory where the source files of the module are stored.
      
      arch=/A
            The architecture for which these files needs to be build. It can
            have three different forms ARCH-CPU, ARCH or CPU. For example when
            linux-i386 is specified these files will only be build for the
            linux port on i386. With ppc it will be build for all ppc processors
            and with linux it will be build for all linux ports.
      
      files=
            The basenames of the C source files to replace add to the module.
      
      asmfiles=
            The basenames of the asm source files to replace or add to the module.
      
      cflags=$(CFLAGS)
            The flags to add when compiling the .c files. By default the standard
            AROS cflags (the $(CFLAGS) make variables are taken. This also means
            that some flags can be added by assigning these to the USER_CFLAGS
            and USER_INCLUDES make variables before using this macro.
      
      dflags=%(cflags)
            The flags to add when doing the dependency check. Default is the
            same as the cflags.
      
      aflags=$(AFLAGS)
            The flags to add when assembling the asm files. By default the
            standard AROS cflags (the $(AFLAGS) make variable) are taken. This
            also means that some flags can be added by assigning these to the 
            SPECIAL_AFLAGS make variable before using this macro.
      
      compiler=target
            Indicates which compiler to use during compiling C source files.
            Can be either target or host to use the target compiler or the
            host compiler. By default the target compiler is used.

=====%rule_archalias=====
'''Code shared by different ports'''

A second macro called %rule_archalias allows to create a virtual architecture. And code for that virtual architecture is shared between several architectures. Most likely this is used for code that uses an API that is shared between several architecture but not all of them.

The macro has the following header:

:%define rule_archalias mainmmake=/A arch=/A alias=/A

With the following arguments

:mainmmake=/A
::The mmake of the module from which one wants to replace files, or
::which to add additional files to.
    
:arch=/A
::The arch one wants to make alias from.
    
:alias=/A
::The arch one wants to alias to.

Examples

1. This is an extract from the file config/linex/exec/mmakefile.src that replaces the main init.c file from exec with a linux specialized one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
%build_archspecific \
      mainmmake=kernel-exec maindir=rom/exec arch=linux \
      files=init compiler=host
&lt;/source&gt;
2. For the dos.library some arch specific files are grouped together in the unix arch. The following lines are present in the several mmakefiles to make this possible

In config/linux/mmakefile.src:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
%rule_archalias mainmmake=kernel-dos arch=linux alias=unix
&lt;/source&gt;
In config/freebsd/mmakefile.src:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
%rule_archalias mainmmake=kernel-dos arch=freebsd alias=unix
&lt;/source&gt;
And finally in config/unix/dos/mmakefile.src:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
%build_archspecific \
            mainmmake=kernel-dos maindir=rom/dos \
            arch=unix \
            files=boot \
            compiler=host
&lt;/source&gt;


====AROS mmakefile.src Low-Level Macros====



===Libraries===

A simple library that uses a custom suffix (.wxt), and returns TRUE in its init function, however the Open code never gets called - and openlibrary fails? (the init function does get called though..) 
With a conf file with no ##functionlist section I get the error: In readref: Could not open (null) 

Genmodule tries to read a ref file when no ##functionlist section is available. After adding a dummy function to the conf file it worked for me. Take care: haven't added any flags which avoids creating of header files and such. How to deal with library base pointers in plug-ins when you call library functions. 

use only one function -&gt; called to make the &quot;plugin&quot; register all its hooks with wanderer. 
Iterate through the plugin directory, and for each file ending &quot;.wxt&quot;, create an internal plugin structure in which i store the pointer to the libbase of the OpenLibrary'd plugin.  After enumerating the plugins, iterate the list of plugin structs and call the single library function which causes them to all register with wanderer. had been using some of the struct library fields (lib_Node.ln_Name was the culprit). 

We should remove the dos.c, intuition.c, etc. files with hardcoded version numbers from autoinit and replace them with -ldos -lintuition inside gcc specs file. This would avoid starting programs on older versions of libraries. If an older version suffice some __xxx_version global can be defined in the program code to enable this. We could also provide based on the info you described below exec_v33 exec_v45 link libraries that would also make sure no function of a newer version is used. A very clean solution to get the desired effect. 

-noarosc mentions checking the spec file to find out about it but there is nothing in the specs file related. 
This was added to disabled automatic linking of arosc to all libraries. It was used in the build_library macro - check V0. Automatic linking of arosc.library which had per task context to other libraries which had global context was a very bad thing. &quot;C standard library&quot; objects belonging to global context library were allocated on opening task context. When the task exited and global context library not, global context library was using &quot;freed&quot; memory. 

A note to any of you wanting to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.10, or any distribution that uses gcc 4.7.
There is an issue (bug? misfeature?) in gcc 4.7 where the '-specs /path/to/spec/override' is processed *after* gcc checks that it has been passed valid arguments.
This causes gcc to fail with the error:

''gcc-4.7: error: unrecognized command line option &quot;-noarosc&quot;''

when it is used to link programs for the x86 and x86_64 targets if you are using the native host's compiler (for example, when compiling for linux-x86_64 hosted). Please use gcc-4.6 (&quot;export CC=gcc-4.6&quot;) for hosted builds until further notice (still valid as of March 2013).


====Per task====

There are other things for which arosc.library needs to be per task based: autoclosing of open files and autofreeing of malloced memory when a programs exits; a per task errno and environ variable that can be changed by calling library functions. 


regina.library does also do that by linking with arosc_rel. It needs some more documentation to make it usable by other people. You can grep aroscbase inside the regina source code to see where it is used. regina.library and arosc.library are per task libraries. Each time regina.library is opened it also opens arosc.library and it then gets the same libbase as the program that uses regina.library. 

By linking with arosc_rel and defining aroscbase_offset arosc.library functions called from regina.library will be called with the arosc libbase stored in it's own libbase, and the latter is different for each task that has opened regina.library. 

The AROS_IMPORT_ASM_SYM of aroscbase in the startup section of regina.conf assures that the arosc.library init functions are called even if the programs that uses regina.library does not use an arosc.library function itself and normally would not autoopen it. 


Problem is that both bz2 and z library use stdio functions. The arosc.library uses the POSIX file descriptors which are of type int to refer to files. The same file descriptor will point to different files in different tasks. That's why arosc.library is a pertask library. FILE * pointer internally have a file descriptor stored that then links to the file. 

Now bz2 and z are using also stdio functions and thus also they need a different view for the file descriptors depending in which program the functions are called from. That's why bz2 and z become also pertask libraries. 

it breaks POSIX compatibility to use a type other than int for file descriptors. Would a better solution be to assign a globally unique int to each file descriptor, and thus avoid the need to make arosc.library a per-task library? far simpler solution - all DOS FileHandles and FileLocks are allocated from MEMF_31BIT. Then, we can be assured that their BPTRs fit into an int. 

&lt;pre&gt;
int open(const char *path, int flags, int mode)
{
   BPTR ret;
   ULONG rw = ((flags &amp; O_READ) &amp;&amp; !(flags &amp; O_WRITE)) ? MODE_OLDFILE
: MODE_NEWFILE;
   ret = Open(path, rw);
   if (ret == BNULL) {
       IoErr_to_errno(IoErr());
       return -1;
   }
   return (int)(uintptr_t)ret;

}

void close(int fd)
{
  Close((BPTR)(uintptr_t)fd);
}

static inline BPTR ftob(int fd)
{
   return (fd == 0) ? Input() :
          (fd == 1) ? Output() :
          (fd == 2) ? ErrorOutput() :
          (fd &lt; 0) ? BNULL :
          ((BPTR)(uintptr_t)fd);
}

int read(int fd, void *buff, size_t len)
{
  int ret;
  ret = Read(ftob(fd), buff, len);
  if (ret &lt; 0)
    IoErr_to_errno(IoErr());
  return ret;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

you will most likely kill the 64-bit darwin hosted target. AFAIR it has 0 (zero) bytes of memf_31bit memory available. 


Must modules which are using pertask libraries be implemented itself as pertask library? 
Is it a bug or feature that I get now the error about missing symbolsets handling. 
You will now see more verbose errors for missing symbol sets, for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
Undefined symbol: __LIBS__symbol_set_handler_missing
Undefined symbol: __CTORS__symbol_set_handler_missing
&lt;/pre&gt;

By linking with jpeg and arosc, instead of jpeg_rel and arosc_rel, it was pulling in the PROGRAM_ENTRIES symbolset for arosc initialization. Since jpeg.datatype is a library, not a program, the PROGRAM_ENTRIES was not being called, and some expected initialization was therefore missing. 

It is the ctype changes that is causing the problem. This code now uses ADD2INIT macro to add something to initialization of the library. As you don't handle these init set in your code it gives an error. 
You can for now use -larosc.static -larosc or implement init set handling yourself. 

The move to ctype handling is that in the future we may want to have locale handling in the C library so toupper/tolower may be different for different locales. This was not possible with the ctype stuff in the link lib. Ideally in the source code sqlite3-aros.c whould be replaced with sqlite3.conf and genmodule would be called from makefile-new 



*strongly* recommend that you *not* use %build_module_simple for pertask/peropener libraries for now. There is a PILE of crap that genmodule needs to do *just*exactly*right* to get them to work, and that pile is still in flux at the moment. 

Use %build_module, and add additional initialization with the ADD2*() family of macros. 

If you insist on %build_module_simple, you will need to link explicitly with libautoinit.  

To handle per-task stuff manually:
&lt;pre&gt;
  LibInit:
     you will need to call AllocTaskStorageSlot() to get a task
storage slot,  save that in your global base
  LibExpunge:
     FreeTaskStorageSlot() the slot
  LibOpen:
     and use SetTaskStorageSlot() to put your task-specific data in
the task's slot
  LibClose:
     Set the task's storage slot to NULL
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can get the task-specific data in one of your routines, using GetTaskStorageSlot(). 

if you're not using the stackcall API, that's the general gist of it. 

would recommend that you use the static libraries until the pertask/peropener features have stabilized a bit
more. You can always go back to dynamic linking to pertask/peropen libs later. 

You should be able to use arosc.library without needing to be pertask. Things gets more complicated if code in library uses file handles, malloc, errno or similar things. 

Is the PROGRAM_ENTRIES symbolset correct for arosc initialization then, or should it be in the INIT set? 
If so move the arosc_startup.c to the INIT set. 


Think about datatypes. Zune (muimaster.library) caches datatype objects. Task A may be the one triggering NewDtObject(). Task B may be the one triggering DisposeDTObject(). 

NewDTObject() does OpenLibrary of say png.datatype. DisposeDTObjec() does CloseLibrary of say png.datatype. 

If png.datatype usees some pertask z.library that's a problem, isn't it? 
As png.datatype is not per opener and is linked with arosc there should only be a problem when png.datatype is expunged from memory not when opened or closed. It will also use the arosc.library context from the task that calls the Init function vector of png.datatype and it will only be closed when the Expunge vector is called. 




====relbase====

 stackcall/peropener 

* library.conf: relbase FooBase -&gt; rellib foo
* rellib working for standard and peropener/pertask libraries 
* &lt;proto/foo.h&gt; automatically will use &lt;proto/foo_rel.h&gt; if 'rellib foo' is used in the libraries .conf
* &quot;uselibs&quot; doesn't need to manually specify rellib libraries 


arosc_rel.a is meant to be used from shared libraries not from normal programs. Auto-opening of it is also not finished, manual work is needed ATM. 


z_au, png_au, bz2_au, jpeg_au, and expat_au now use the relbase subsytem. The manual init-aros.c stub is no longer needed. Currently, to use relative libraries in your module, you must: 

# Enable 'options pertaskbase' in your library's .conf
# Add 'relbase FooBase' to your library's .conf for each relative library you need. 
# Make sure to use the '&lt;proto/foo_rel.h&gt;' headers instead of '&lt;proto/foo.h&gt;'
# Link with 'uselibs=foo_rel'



can't find a valid way to implement peropener libraries with 'stack' functions without a real ELF dynamic linker (ie ld-linux.so). The inherent problem is determining the where the 'current' library base is when a stack function is called. 

(In the following examples, assume stack.library is a peropener library, and StackFunc() is a stack style function in that library. plugin.library uses stack.library) 

Example 1 - Other libraries doing weird things behind your back
&lt;pre&gt;
  extern struct Library *StackBase;  /* set up by autoinit */

  void foo(void)
  {
      struct Library *PluginBase;

      StackFunc();  // Called with expected global StackBase
      PluginBase = OpenLibrary(&quot;plugin.library&quot;,0);
      /* Note that plugin.library did an OpenLibrary() of &quot;stack.library&quot;.
       * In the current implementation, this now sets the taskslot of
       * stack.library to the new per-opener stack.library base.
       */
      StackFunc();  // Unexpectly called with the new stack.library base!!!
      CloseLibrary(PluginBase);
      /* The CloseLibrary() reset the taskslot to the old base */
      StackFunc();   // Back to the old base
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ok, to fix that issue, let's suppose we use a stub wrapper that sets the taskslot to the (global) library base. 
This was no problem with old implementation. StackBase was passed in the scratch register StackFunc() each time it was called. This base was then used. 

Example 2 - Local vs Global bases
&lt;pre&gt;
  extern struct Library *StackBase;  /* set up by autoinit */

  void bar(void)
  {
      StackBase(); // Called as expected

      {
        struct Library *StackBase = OpenLibrary(&quot;stack.library&quot;);

        StackBase(); // WTF! linklib wrapper used *global* StackBase, not local one!

        CloseLibrary(StackBase);
      }

      StackBase();  // Works as expected
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hmm. Ok, that behavior is going to be a little weird to explain to developers. I don't see the need to support local bases. 

Example 3 - Callback handlers
&lt;pre&gt;
  extern struct Library *StackBase;  /* set up by autoinit */

  const struct handler {
    void (*dostack)(void);
  } handler = { .dostack = StackFunc };

  void bar(void)
  {
     /* Who knows what base this is called with?
      * It depends on a number of things, could be the global StackBase,
      * could be the most recently OpenLibrary()'d stack.library base.
      */
     handler-&gt;dostack();
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;


Function pointers to functions in a peropener library may be a problem but is it needed ? 

All in all, until we have either 
# a *real* ELF shared library subsystem 
or 
# real use case for peropener libraries. C split arosstdc.library is peropener base. Reasoning is that you
may sometimes want to do malloc in a library that is not freed when the Task that happened to call function is exiting. Let's say picture caching library that uses ported code which internally uses malloc. If you have a pertask library the malloc will allocate memory on the Task that currently is calling the library and this memory
will disappear when this task quits (should do free() prior exit). Before your change the caching library could just link with libarosstdc.a (and not libarosstdc_rel.a) and it worked. 

idea could be to either link(*) or unlink(**) the malloc to a given task, depending on from where it is called (within library or not). 
No, the whole point is to have the malloced memory _not_ to be attached to a task so a cached image can be used from different tasks even if the first task already died.  




====static====


call the static link library for the static version for the few shared libraries that need it different, like
libz_static.a Ideally all code should just work with the shared library version. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Module          Link Library           uselibs=
----------      ------------           --------------
Foo.datatype =&gt; libfoo.datatype.a   =&gt; foo.datatype

Foo.library  =&gt; libfoo.a            =&gt; foo

foo (static) =&gt; libfoo.static.a     =&gt; foo.static


And the 'misc static libs' (libamiga.a libarossupport.a, etc)

libmisc.a    =&gt; libmisc.a           =&gt; misc
&lt;/pre&gt;

usestartup=no and the '-noarosc' LDFLAG both imply arosc.static (it doesn't hurt to link it, and if you really want arosc.library, that will preempt arosc.static) 

Again this will make -lz not link with the shared library stubs. IMO uselibs=z should use shared library by default.

 'uselibs=&quot;utility jpeg.datatype z.static arossupport&quot;' method.


if there's a dynamic version of a library, it should always be used: static linking of libraries should be discouraged for all the usual reasons, e.g. the danger of embedding old bugs (not just security holes), bloat etc. Don't see the need for a -static option (or any other way to choose between static and dynamic libraries).

===Makedepend===

AROS build system generates for each .c file a .d file where the includes are listed. The .c is recompiled when any of the includes changes. Remember that AROS is an OS in development so we often do/did changes to the core header files. If this makedepend was not done programs would not be rebuilt if changes are made to AROS libraries or other core code. OK, so it's basically creating the dependencies of the .o 



===mmakefile===

We do get an error from it, so something is in fact going wrong. But what is?

Probably a hacky mmakefile so that include file is not found during makedepend but is found during compilation or maybe a wrong dependency so it is not guaranteed that the include file is there during
makedepend. And I do think it would be better if the build would stop when such an error occurs. 



===configuration files===

We are talking about configuration files for modules like this: rom/graphics/graphics.conf. 

I have been thinking about similar things, but first I would like to convert our proprietary .conf format to xml. Manually writing file parsings is so passe :) 

Uhh.. I have no objection to using a 'standard' parser, but I have to vote no on XML *in specific*. 

JSON or YAML (summaries of both are on Wikipedia) are available would be better choices, since they are much more human readable, but semantically equivalent to XML. 

I agree that xml is not the easiest format to edit in a text editor and is quite bloated. From the other side it has ubiquituous in scripting and programming language and in text editors and IDEs. I also like that the validity of a xml file can be checked through a schema file and that it also can be a guide for the editor. There are also tools to easily convert xml files based on this schema etc.  It does not matter what format it is in but it should take as much coding away from the (genmodule) programmer. 

Another improvement over XML could be the inclusion of literal code. Currently some literal code snippets are included in .conf file and in XML they would need some character encoding. How is this for [http://json.org/example.html JSON] or [http://beust.com/weblog/2010/08/15/yaml-the-forgotten-victim-of-the-format-wars/ YAML] ? 

YAML supports UniCode internally.  I don't know how well that could be ported to AROS though since it seems AROS doesn't have UniCode support yet.  JSON is based on JavaScript notation and YAML 1.2 can import JSON files as it implemented itself as a complete super-set of JSON.  YAML's only 1.2 implementation is in C++ using CMake as a build script creator.  If we use the C implementation of libYaml, it's only YAML 1.1 compliant and loses the backward compatibility to JSON. 

Any data languages can be checked against a scheme; it's mostly a matter of writing out the schemes to check against. You can but my questions if the tools exists. From the second link you provided: &quot;There are a couple of downsides to YAML: there are not a lot of tools available for it and it’s also not very easy to validate (I am not aware of anything similar to a DTD or a schema)&quot;. I find validation/syntax checking as important as human readability. Syntax checking is in the parsing in all four cases. The validation the XML can do is whether it conforms to the parsing and whether it conforms to a specific scheme. YAML and JSON are specifically intended for structured data, en I guess my example is too, so the equivalent XML scheme would check whether the content was correctly structured for structured data. The other three don't need that as anything they parse is by definition structured data.

All four have the same solution: They are all essentially tree builders, and you can walk the tree to see if each node conforms to your content scheme. The object is to use a defined schema/DTD for the files that are describing a library. Text editors that understand schemas can then let you only add fields that are valid by the schema. So this schema let everyone validate a XML if it is a valid XML library description file; they can use standard tools for that. 

AFAICS JSON and YAML parsers only validate if the input file is a valid JSON/YAML file, not that it is a valid JSON/YAML library description file. AFAICS no such tools exist for these file formats. 




===ETask Task Storage===

 __GM_* functions

&lt;pre&gt;
  __GM_BaseSlot: externally visible slot ID (for the AROS_RELLIBFUNCSTUB() assembly routines)

  __GM_SetBase_Safe: Set (and reallocate) task storage

    Static function, only called in a library's InitLib() and OpenLib() code.

  __GM_GetBase_Safe: Get task storage slot

    This is the 'slow' version of __GM_GetBase(), which calls Exec/GetTaskStorageSlot(). Returns NULL if the
    slot does not exist or is unallocated. 

  __GM_GetBase: Get task storage slot (unsafe)

    This is the 'fast' version of __GM_GetBase(), which does not need to perform any checking. This function
    is provided by the CPU specific AROS_GM_GETBASE() macro (if defined). The fallback is the same           
    implementation as __GM_GetBase_Safe 

  __AROS_GM_GETBASE: Fast assembly 'stub' for getting the relbase

    Designed to be used in the AROS_RELLIBFUNCSTUB() implementation.

    Does not do any sanity checking. Guaranteed to be run only if (a) InitLibrary() or OpenLibrary() has
    already been called in this ETask context or (b) this ETask is a child of a parent who has opened
    the slot's library.

    I can generate implementations of this for arm, m68k, and i386, but I want the location of TaskStorage
    to be agreed upon before I do that work and testing. 

    AROS_GM_GETBASE(): Generates a C function wrapper around the fast stub.
&lt;/pre&gt;


 Genmodule no longer has to have internal understanding of where the TaskStorage resides. All of that knowledge is now in exec.library and the arch/*-all/include/aros/cpu.h headers.



Location of the TaskStorage slots

It was important to me that the address of the ETask does not change. For example, it would be pretty bad if code like this broke:
&lt;pre&gt;
    struct ETask *et = FindTask(NULL)-&gt;tc_UnionETask.tc_ETask;
    ...
    UnzipFile(&quot;foo.zip&quot;);  &lt;= opens z_au.library, slots reallocated
    ..
    if (et-&gt;Parent) {   &lt;= ARGH! et was freed!
       ....
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, I wanted to minimize the number of places that need to be modified if the TaskStorage location needed to be moved (again). 


et_TaskStorage is automatically resized by Exec/SetTaskStorageSlot() as needed, and a new ETask's et_TaskStorage is cloned from its parent, if the parent was also an ETask with et_TaskStorage. 
What I wanted to say here is that some overhead may be acceptable for SetTaskStorageSlot() if properly documented. E.g. to not call the function in time critical paths. 

You clone Parent TaskStorage when creating a subtask as before. This may be acceptable if it is documented that a
slot allocated in the parent may not be valid in child if it is allocated in parent after the child has been created. For other use cases think it acceptable to have to be sure that in a Task first a SetStorageSlot() has to be done before getting the value.

===Auto generation of oop.library===

updated genmodule to be capable of generating interface headers from the foo.conf of a root class, and have tested it by updating graphics.hidd to use the autogenerated headers. 

Hopefully this will encourage more people to use the oop.library subsystem, by making it easier to create the necessary headers and stubs for an oop.library class interface. 

Note that this is still *completely optional*, but is encouraged.

Plans to extend this to generating Objective C interfaces in the future, as well as autoinit and relbase functionality. 

This allows a class interface to be defined, and will create     a header file in $(AROS_INCLUDES)/interface/My_Foo.h, where 'My_Foo' is the interface's &quot;interfacename&quot;. In the future, this could be extended to generate C++ pure virtual class headers, or Objective C protocol headers. 

The header comes complete with aMy_Foo_* attribute enums, pMy_Foo_* messages, moMy_Foo method offsets, and the full assortment of interface stubs. 

To define a class interface, add to the .conf file of your base class: 

&lt;pre&gt;
     ##begin interface
     ##begin config
     interfaceid my.foo
     interfacename My_Foo
     methodstub myFoo         # Optional, default to interfacename
     methodbase MyFooBase
     attributebase MyFooAttrBase
     ##end config

     ##begin attributelist
     ULONG FooType   # [ISG] Type of the Foo
     BOOL IsBar      # [..G] Is this a Bar also? &lt;- comments are preserved!
     ##end attributelist

     ##begin methodlist
     VOID Start(ULONG numfoos)  # This comment will appear in the header
     BOOL Running()
     .skip 1 # BOOL IsStopped() Disabled obsolete function
     VOID KillAll(struct TagItem *attrList)
     ##end methodlist
     ##end interface
&lt;/pre&gt;





===Documentation===

It would be nice if we could just upload to diff (maybe as zip file) and then the patching is automatically done.

If you have a local copy of the whole website, you can update only the file(s) that are changed with a rsync-type script (maybe rsync itself works for the purpose).

The AROS build system

arch/common is for drivers where it is difficult to say to which CPU and/or arch they belong: for example a graphics driver using the PCI API could as well run inside hosted linux as on PPC native. 

Then it's  arch-independent code and it should be in fact outside of arch. Currently they are in workbench/devs/drivers. Can be discussed, but  looks  like  it's  just a matter of being used up to a particular location. At least no one changed this. 

Even if it's not specific to a particular platform, the code in arch/common is hardware dependent, whereas the code in rom/ and workbench/ is supposed to be non-hardware-specific. This has been discussed before
when you moved other components (e.g. ata.device) from arch/common to rom/devs. IIRC you accepted that that move was inappropriate in retrospect (but didn't undo it). 

Having said that, arch/all-pc might be a good place for components shared between i386-pc and x86_64-pc such as the timer HIDD. On further inspection it seems that most drivers are already in workbench/hidds.  





====Introduction====

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Research_Operating_System AROS] build system is based around GNU toolchain. This means we use gcc as our compiler, and the build system needs a POSIX environment to run. 

Currently AROS has been successfully build using the following environments:
* Linux, various architectures and distributions. This has been, for a long time, a primary development platform. Most of our nightly builds are running under Linux.
* MacOS X (more technically known as Darwin).
* Cygwin, running Windows.
* MinGW/MSYS, running Windows (both 32-bit and 64-bit version of MinGW was tested).


From these two Windows environments, MinGW is the preferred one, because of significantly faster (compared to Cygwin) operation. There's, however, a known problem: if you want to build native port, GRUB2 can't be built. Its own build system fails is currently incompatible with MinGW, and will fail. You can work around it if you use --with-bootloader=none argument when configuring AROS. This will disable building the primary bootloader. You can perfectly live with that if you already have GRUB installed.



Running on a host whose binary format is different from ELF (i. e. Darwin and Windows), requires you to use native AROS-targeted crosstoolchain. It can be built together with AROS, however using a standalone preinstalled toolchain significantly shortens the build time and saves up your drive space. A pretty good set of prebuilt toolchains for Darwin and Windows can be obtained from [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/cross AROS Archives].

Cross-compiling a hosted version of AROS requires you, additionally, to have the second crosstoolchain, targeted to what will be your host. For example if you're building Windows-hosted AROS under Linux, you'll need Windows-targeted crosstoolchain. Because of this, building a hosted version is best to be done on the same system it will run on.

In the past, configure found e.g. i386-elf-gcc etc. on the path during a cross-compile without passing special options. I'd like to retain that capability. That *should* still work if you pass in --disable-crosstools. 

Remember, --enable-crosstools is the default now - and it would be silly to use the external crosstools is AROS is just going to build its own anyway. 

For the kernel tools though, yes, I definitely agree. Let me know if you have a system where the kernel tool type isn't detected properly. 



Making use of threaded builds (make -j X)? if not it might be worth using. 
Please don't; vps is a virtual machine also running some web sites. I don't want to fully starve the rest that is running on that machine. I appreciate what you are saying - but without info on the virtualised hardware cant really comment. How many &quot;cores&quot; does the vm have? if it has &gt;2, don't see why adding an additional thread (make -j 2) should cause any noticeable difference to the web services it also hosts? 


26 February 2012, configure has been restructured, to generate three sets of *_*_{cc,as,objdump,...} definitions. 

If we are building crosstools: 

orig_target_* - AROS built toolchain (in bin/{host}/tools/crosstools/....) 

aros_kernel_* - External toolchain, if --with-kernel-tool-prefix, or the architecture configure it as such 
                (ie hosted archs) Otherwise, it points to the orig_target_* tools 

aros_target_* - AROS target tools (in bin/{host}/tools/${target_tool_prefix}-* 

If we are *not* building crosstools: (--disable-crosstools, or --with-crosstools=...) 

aros_kernel_* - External toolchain (required, and configure should be checking for it!) 

orig_target_* - Points to aros_kernel_* 

aros_target_* - AROS target tools (in bin/{host}/tools/${target_tool_prefix}-* 



modified collect-aros to mark ABIv1 ELF files with EI_OSABI of 15 (AROS) instead of 0 (generic Unix). 
For now, I'm going to hold off on the change to refuse to load ABIv0 files (with EI_OSABI of 0) until I can get some more testing done (since dos/internalloadseg_elf.c is reused in a few places). 

A separate change to have ABIv0 refuse to load ABIv1 applications will need to be made. 
The patch to have ABIv1 refuse to load ABIv0 applications will come in the near future. 





===Custom tools===

 ../$srcdir/configure&quot; --target=linux-i386 --enable-debug=all --with-portssources=&quot;$curdir/$portsdir 

Always use the 'tools/crosstools' compiler to build contrib/gnu/gcc. AFAIK this was the previous solution, using TARGET_CC override in mmakefile... 

the host toolchain should only be used for compiling the tools (genmodule, elf2hunk, etc), and for the bootstrap (ie AROSBootstrap on linux-hosted and grub2 for pc-*). To be exact, the 'kernel' compiler is used for compiling GRUB2, and probably AROSBootstrap too. This is important when cross-compiling. 

How about we invert the sense of --enable-crosstools? We make it '--disable-crosstools', and crosstools=yes is on by default? That way we can support new arch bringup (if we don't have working crosstools yet), but 'most people' won'' have to deal with the issues of, say, having C compiled with (host) gcc 4.6.1, but C++ compiled with (crosstools) gcc 4.2 


 add-symbol-file boot/aros-bsp-linux 0xf7b14000
 add-symbol-file boot/aros-base 0xf7b6a910

There's &quot;loadkick&quot; gdb command now which does this auomatically. Btw, don't use add-symbol-file. Use &quot;loadseg &lt;address&gt;&quot;. 



You need to run as you have a stale config.

 $ ./config.status --recheck &amp;&amp; ./config.status




In the end I would like to get rid of the mmakefile parsing by mmake.
What I would like to put in place is that mmake calls the command:
'make -f mmakefile __MM__' and it parses the output of that command.
The mmakefile would the be full of statements like:
&lt;pre&gt;
__MM__ ::
    echo metatarget : prerequisite1 prerequisite2
&lt;/pre&gt;
This could be generated by genmf macros or gmake functions.

I think this approach would give some advantages:
&lt;pre&gt;
 The parsing code in mmake would become simpler:
  * No need to discard non-#MM lines or at least reduce it significantly
  * No need for line continuation handling
  * No need for variable substitution
 Rule generation in mmakefile would become more flexible. To generate
  the output one could use all facilities provided by gmake: if
  statements, functions, complex variable substitutions.
  For example: providing arch specific or configuration dependent rules
  would become much easier.
 This architecture would be much easier to extend to other make(-like)
  tools like cmake, scons, ... This would for example allow to
  gradually convert out genmf+gmake build system to a scons based one.
  External code coudld choose their prefered method: the AROS SDK would
  support several systems.
&lt;/pre&gt;


Would like to express the following 'build all libraries I depend on' concept in Metamake: 

&lt;pre&gt;
MODULE=testmod
USELIBS=dos graphics utility

$(MODULE)-linklib: core-linklibs $(addsuffix -includes,$(USELIBS))
$(addsuffix -linklib,$(USELIBS))
&lt;/pre&gt;

At the moment it not possible as mmake is a static scanner and does not support loops or function like $(addsuffix ...). Look in the AROS dev maillist for a thread called 'mmake RFC' (in Aug 2010) describing my idea. If you look at the svn log of tools/MetaMake there is r34165 'Started to write a function which calls the _MM_ target in a mmakefile. ...' 

Can see this breaking because it wont know which &quot;parent&quot; metatarget(s) to invoke to build the prerequisites based on the object files / binaries alone, unless you add a dependancy on the (relevant) metatarget for every binary produced. i.e it would be like doing &quot;make &lt;prerequisites-metatarget&gt;-quick&quot; for the prerequisite. Yes, each module target would get an extra linklib-modulename target. (not linklib-kernel-dos, just linklib-dos, for example).

mmake at the moment only knows about metatargets and metadependencies. It does not handle real files or knows when something is old or new. Therefore it always has to try all metadependencies and make will find out if it is up to date or needs to be rebuilt. This can be changed to also let mmake dependencies on real files (e.g. the .c files for a shared library); remember when something was last build and check if files have changed. But this won't be a small change. IS there some way we can pass info about the file types in the &quot;files=&quot; parameter, so that the macros can automatically pass the files to the necessary utility macros?  


&lt;pre&gt;
CFILES := example1
CPPFILES := example2
ASMFILES := example3

%build_prog mmake=foo-bar \
    progname=Example
files=&quot;c'$(CFILES)',cpp'$(CPPFILES)',asm'$(ASMFILES)'&quot;
targetdir=$(AROS_TESTS) \
    uselibs=&quot;amiga arosc&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;



IMO uselibs= should only be needed when non-standard libraries are used. In my ABI V1 I even made a patch to remove all standard libs from the uselibs= statement. I do plan to submit this again sometime in the future. And there should not be a need to add these libs to uselibs=. linklibs that are standardly linked should be build by the linklibs-core  metatarget. %build_module takes care of the linklinbs-core dependency. Currently a lot of linklibs are not dependent of this metatarger because a lot of the standard libs autoopened by libautoinit.a. TBH, I also find it a bit weird. Standard libraries don't need -lXXX, because they &quot;link&quot; via proto files, right? 

They are (currently) only used for the linklibs-&lt;foo&gt; dependency autogeneration. 
Was under the impression you wanted to move all the per-library autoinit code back to the specific libraries? 
Yes to avoid the current mismatch between versions in libautoinit and libxxx.a. 


for %build_prog and some others so it might seem logical to add another cppfiles
But then we might need to add dfiles, modfiles or pfiles for the D language, Modula-2 and Pascal as well in the future so your idea about adding it all to the files parameter in one way or another seems to be more future proof to me. 

Personally, I'd prefer to let make.tmpl figure it all out from the extensions, even though it'd be a large changeset to fix all the FILES=lines.  

&lt;pre&gt;
FILES = foobar.c \
        qux.cpp \
        bar.S \
        xyyzy.mod

%build_prog mmake=foo-bar
    progname=Example files=&quot;$(FILES)&quot; \
    targetdir=$(AROS_TESTS) uselibs=&quot;frobozz&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;


By the way: what are the 'standard libraries'? 
That is to be discussed. I would include almost all libs in our workbench/libs and rom/ directories unless there is a good reason not to use it as a standard linklib. mesa will always require -lGL to be passed because AROSMesaGetProcAddress is only present in linklib. Also nobody will write code #include &lt;proto/mesa.h&gt;. All code will have #include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; 



working on minimal-version autoopening, to enhance binary compatibility with m68k and PPC AOS flavors. 
To be clear I like the feature you are implementing, I don't like it that programmers have to specify a long list of libs to uselibs= all the time. 



Does this give the programmer a way to specify that he'll need more than the minimum for a function? 
For example, one aspect of a function may have been buggy/unimplemented in the first version. If that aspect is used, a version is needed that supports it properly. 

Yes, in the library.conf file, you would use:

foo.conf
&lt;pre&gt;
...
.version 33
ULONG FooUpdate(struct Foo *foo)
ULONG FooVersion()
# NOTE: The version 33 FooSet() didn't work at all!
#       It was fixed in version 34.
.version 34
ULONG FooSet(struct Foo *foo, ULONG key, ULONG val)
.version 33
ULONG FooGet(struct Foo *foo, ULONG key)
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then, if you use FooSet(), you'll get version 34 of the library, but if your code never calls FooSet(), you'll only OpenLibrary() version
33. 

OpenLibrary requiring version 34 in one case and 37 in the other, depending on whether I needed that specific NULL-handling aspect of FooSet(). How will this work with otherwise automatic determination of minimum versions? 

Uh... You'll have the handle library loading yourself, then:

&lt;pre&gt;
APTR Foo;

if (IAmOnABrokenA1000()) {
   Foo = OpenLibrary(&quot;foo.library&quot;,34);
} else if (TheA3000ReallyNeedsVersion37()) {
   Foo = OpenLibrary(&quot;foo.library&quot;,37);
} else {
   /* Put your hands in the air like you just don't care! */
   Alert(AT_DeadEnd);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
 




=====Syntax of the makefile=====

Where do I need to make the changes to add 'contrib' to the amiga-m68k build process? 
You need to study scripts in /AROS/scripts/nightly/pkg and get some knowledge from them. Neil can probably give you better explanation. Contrib

Zune is an object-oriented GUI toolkit. It is nearly a clone (at both API and Look&amp;Feel level) of MUI, a well-known Amiga shareware product by Stefan Stuntz. Therefore MUI developers will feel at home here, while others will discover the concepts and qualities that Zune shares with MUI.

The programmer has a much easier time to design its GUI: no need for hardcoded values, Zune is font-sensitive, and adapts to any window size due to its layout system. He/she mostly needs to only specify the semantic of its GUI to Zune, which will arrange the low-level details automatically. 

Zune is based on the [http://library.morphzone.org/Short_BOOPSI_Overview BOOPSI] system, the framework inherited from AmigaOS (TM) for object-oriented programming in C. Zune [[Aros/Developer/Zune/Classes|classes]] does not derive from existing BOOPSI gadget classes; instead, the Notify class (base class of the Zune hierarchy) derives from the BOOPSI root class. 

* Many AROS GUI components (windows, requesters, gadgets, images) are now programmed in an object-oriented way, using the BOOPSI/Zune toolkit. 
* Every such component is created as an object, not as a pointer to a system structure. That means no more filling structures with data. 
* Objects are manipulated using methods and by passing tags via the SetAttrs() function. 

Creating Prefs from scratch with using our Zune Prefs classes. 

A good introduction to the BOOPSI system is the Chapter 12, &quot;BOOPSI - Object-oriented Intuition&quot; on-line [http://gega.homelinux.net/AmigaDevDocs/lib_12.html here]. Here BOOPSI NewObject() has been replaced by MUI_NewObject(), DisposeObject() becomes MUI_DisposeObject(), etc



==Prerequisites==

Some knowledge of [http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_concepts_of_object_oriented_programming OOP] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming object-oriented programming] is more than welcome. 

Knowing AROS APIs and concepts like [[Aros/Developer/Docs/Libraries/Intuition|taglists]] and BOOPSI is essential. As Zune is a MUI clone, all the documentation pertaining to MUI is applicable to Zune. In particular, the latest available MUI developer kit and MUI autodocs can be found at [http://main.aminet.net/dev/mui/mui38dev.lha here]. In this LHA archive, 2 documents are warmly recommended:

 '''MUIdev.guide''', the MUI programmer documentation
 and
 '''PSI.c''' source code, demonstrating Zune practices like OOP and dynamic object creation 




==Zune basics and conventions==

MUI (= Zune) sticks a prefix on the start to signify what is being access/changed:

* MUIA_ attribute 
* MUIM_ method 
* MUIV_ special values


==BOOPSI Primer/Concepts==

===Class===
A class is defined by its name, its parent class and a dispatcher.

'''name''': either a string for the public classes, so that they may be used by any program in the system, or none if its a private class used only by a single application. 

'''parent class''': all BOOPSI classes are forming a hierarchy rooted at the class aptly named rootclass. It allows each subclass to implement its own version of specific parent operation, or to fall back on the one provided by its parent. Also known as base class or super class. 

'''dispatcher''': it gives access to all operations (called methods) provided by this class, ensuring that each operation is handled by the proper code or passed to its super class. 

BOOPSI type for a class is Class * also known as IClass.

===Object===
An object is an instance of class: each object has its specific data, but all objects of the same class share the same behavior. An object has several classes if we count the parents of its true class (the most derived one) up to the rootclass.

BOOPSI type for an object is Object *. It has no field you can directly access.

When a Zune object is created and destroyed several methods are called:
&lt;pre&gt;
OM_NEW
MUIM_Setup
MUIM_AskMinMax
[ window is opened here ]
MUIM_Show
MUIM_Draw
MUIM_Hide
[ window is closed here ]
MUIM_Cleanup
OM_DISPOSE
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the documentation says that something is only valid between setup and cleanup it means that the first place where you can use it is the setup method and you aren't allowed to use it after cleanup.

===Attribute===
An attribute is related to the instance data of each object: you can not access these data directly, you can only set or get the attributes provided by an object to modify its internal state. An attribute is implemented as a Tag (ULONG value or'ed with TAG_USER).

GetAttr() and SetAttrs() are used to modify an object's attributes.

Attributes can be one or more of the following:

Initialization-settable (I) : the attribute can be given as parameter at the object creation. 

Settable (S) : You can set this attribute at any time (or at least, not only creation). 

Gettable (G) : You can get the value of this attribute.

===Method===
A BOOPSI method is a function which receives as parameters an object, a class and a message:

object: the object you act on 

class: the considered class for this object. 

message: contains a method ID which determines the function to call within a dispatcher, and is followed by its parameters. 

To send a message to an object, use DoMethod(). It will use the true class first. If the class implements this method, it will handle it. Else it will try its parent class, until the message is handled or the rootclass is reached (in this case, the unknown message is silently discarded).

Summary, before a method can act on an object, it needs a BOOPSI message 
&lt;pre&gt;
    Function                     BOOPSI Method

    NewObject()                  OM_NEW
    DisposeObject()              OM_DISPOSE
    SetAttrs()/SetGadgetAttrs()  OM_SET
    GetAttr()                    OM_GET
&lt;/pre&gt;


==BOOPSI Examples==
Let's see basic examples of this OOP framework:

Getting an attribute
We'll query a MUI String object for its content:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void f(Object *string)
{
    IPTR result;
    
    GetAttr(string, MUIA_String_Contents, &amp;result);
    printf(&quot;String content is: %s\n&quot;, (STRPTR)result);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Object * is the type of BOOPSI objects. 
IPTR must be used for the type of the result, which can be an integer or a pointer. An IPTR is always written in memory, so using a smaller type would lead to memory corruption! 
Here we query a MUI String object for its content: MUIA_String_Contents, as any other attribute, is a ULONG (it's a Tag) 
Zune applications use more often the get() and XGET() macros instead:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
get(string, MUIA_String_Contents, &amp;result);

result = XGET(string, MUIA_String_Contents);
&lt;/source&gt;
Setting an attribute
Let's change the content of our string:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
SetAttrs(string, MUIA_String_Contents, (IPTR)&quot;hello&quot;, TAG_DONE);
&lt;/source&gt;
Pointers parameters must be casted to IPTR to avoid warnings. 
After the object parameter, a taglist is passed to SetAttrs and thus must end with TAG_DONE. 
You'll find the set() macro useful:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
set(string, MUIA_String_Contents, (IPTR)&quot;hello&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
But it's only with SetAttrs() that you can set several attributes at once:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
SetAttrs(string,
         MUIA_Disabled, TRUE,
         MUIA_String_Contents, (IPTR)&quot;hmmm...&quot;,
         TAG_DONE);
&lt;/source&gt;
Calling a method
Let's see the most called method in a Zune program, the event processing method called in your main loop:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
result = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_Application_NewInput, (IPTR)&amp;sigs);
&lt;/source&gt;
Parameters are not a taglist, and thus don't end with TAG_DONE. 
You have to cast pointers to IPTR to avoid warnings.

==&quot;Hello world&quot; example sourcecode==

[http://www.aros.org/documentation/developers/zune/images/hello.png Screenshot 'Hello World']


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

        MUI_DisposeObject(app);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;



===Remarks/General===
We don't manually open libraries, it's done automatically for us.

===GUI creation===
We use a macro-based language to easily build our GUI. A Zune application has always 1 and only 1 Application object:

:   &lt;code&gt;app = ApplicationObject,&lt;/code&gt;

An application can have 0, 1 or more Window objects. Most often a single one:

:       &lt;code&gt;SubWindow, wnd = WindowObject,&lt;/code&gt;

Be nice, give a title to the window:

:           &lt;code&gt;MUIA_Window_Title, &quot;Hello world!&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;

A window must have 1 and only 1 child, usually a group. This one is vertical, that means that its children will be arranged vertically:

:           &lt;code&gt;WindowContents, VGroup,&lt;/code&gt;

A group must have at least 1 child, here it's just a text:

:              &lt;code&gt; Child, TextObject,&lt;/code&gt;

Zune accepts various escape codes (here, to center the text) and newlines:

:                  &lt;code&gt; MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;\33cHello world!\nHow are you?&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;

An End macro must match every xxxObject macro (here, TextObject):

:                   &lt;code&gt;End,&lt;/code&gt;

Let's add a second child to our group, a button! With a keyboard shortcut o indicated by an underscore:

:               &lt;code&gt;Child, but = SimpleButton(&quot;_Ok&quot;),&lt;/code&gt;

Finish the group:

:               &lt;code&gt;End,&lt;/code&gt;

Finish the window:

:           &lt;code&gt;End,&lt;/code&gt;

Finish the application:

:       &lt;code&gt;End;&lt;/code&gt;

So, who still needs a GUI builder? :-)

===Error handling===

If any of the object in the application tree can't be created, Zune destroys all the objects already created and application creation fails. If not, you have a fully working application:
&lt;code&gt;
:   if (app != NULL)
:   {
:       ...&lt;/code&gt;

When you're done, just call MUI_DisposeObject() on your application object to destroy all the objects currently in the application, and free all the resources:

&lt;code&gt;:       ...
:       MUI_DisposeObject(app);
:   }&lt;/code&gt;



===Notifications===
[http://library.morphzone.org/Event_Driven_Programming,_Notifications Notifications] are the simplest way to react on events. The principle? We want to be notified when a certain attribute of a certain object is set to a certain value:

:        DoMethod(wnd, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Window_CloseRequest, TRUE,

Here we'll listen to the MUIA_Window_CloseRequest of our Window object and be notified whenever this attribute is set to TRUE. So what happens when a notification is triggered? A message is sent to an object, here we tell our Application to return MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit on the next event loop iteration:

:                 (IPTR)app, 2,
:                 MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);

As we can specify anything we want here, we have to tell the number of extra parameters we are supplying to MUIM_Notify: here, 2 parameters.

For the button, we listen to its MUIA_Pressed attribute: it's set to FALSE whenever the button is being released (reacting when it's pressed is bad practice, you may want to release the mouse outside of the button to cancel your action - plus we want to see how it looks when it's pressed). The action is the same as the previous, send a message to the application:

:        DoMethod(but, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Pressed, FALSE,
:                 (IPTR)app, 2,
:                 MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);


===Opening the window===
Windows aren't open until you ask them to:

:        set(wnd, MUIA_Window_Open, TRUE);

If all goes well, your window should be displayed at this point. But it can fail! So don't forget to check by querying the attribute, which should be TRUE:

:        if (XGET(wnd, MUIA_Window_Open))


===Main loop===
Let me introduce you my lil' friend, the ideal Zune event loop:

:        ULONG sigs = 0;

Don't forget to initialize the signals to 0 ... The test of the loop is the MUIM_Application_NewInput method:

:        ...
:        while((LONG) DoMethod(app, MUIM_Application_NewInput, (IPTR)&amp;sigs)
:              != MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)

It takes as input the signals of the events it has to process (result from Wait(), or 0), will modify this value to place the signals Zune is waiting for (for the next Wait()) and will return a value. This return value mechanism was historically the only way to react on events, but it was ugly and has been deprecated in favor of custom classes and object-oriented design.

The body of the loop is quite empty, we only wait for signals and handle Ctrl-C to break out of the loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    {
    if (sigs)
        {
        sigs = Wait(sigs | SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
        if (sigs &amp; SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
             break;
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;



===Conclusion===

This program gets you started with Zune, and allows you to toy with GUI design, but not more.



==Notification actions==


Notification allows you to respond to events your application/gui or any other object might cause.  Due to the attribute and method based nature of Zune, and a few special attributes, most applications can be almost completely automated through the use of Notification(s).

As seen in hello.c, you use MUIM_Notify to call a method if a certain condition happens. If you want your application to react in a specific way to events, you can use one of these schemes:

* Set An attribute.  You can automate the passing of values from gadgets,
::etc to other gadgets.  Setting values may also trigger other notification
::events.
      
* Invoke a method, for example:    
::'''MUIM_Application_ReturnID:''' you can ask your application to return an
:: arbitrary ID on the next loop iteration, and check for the value in
:: the loop. This is the dirty old way of doing things.
      
:: '''MUIM_CallHook,''' to call a standard Amiga callback hook: this is an
::average choice, not object-oriented but not that ugly either.
      
::'''custom method:''' the method belongs to one of your custom class. It 
::is the best solution as it supports object-oriented design in
::applications. It needs you to create custom classes so it may not 
::the easiest for beginners or people in a hurry.


==Zune Examples/Tutorials==

*Being an AmigaOS3.x MUI clone, all AmigaOS3.x MUI code serves as example code for using AROS Zune.

*MUI example sourcecode &quot;PSI.c&quot;, found in [http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/aminet/dev/mui/mui38dev.lha MUI3.8 developer archive]

*[http://code.google.com/p/guidetoamigacompatibleprogramming/source/browse/#svn/trunk/english Shinkuro's] Cross-Platform Guide gives information about compatible programming on Amiga-related platforms (Amiga, AROS, MorphOS) and [http://guidetoamigacompatibleprogramming.googlecode.com/svn-history/r6/trunk/english/CAP_4.txt MUI]

*AROS itself contains lots of Zune examples. Download AROS sources and AROS contrib sources archives, take a look at the sourcecode of Zune programs. A good starting point are the Zune test programs, located in the SYS:Tests/Zune folder of AROS' binary distributions (e.g. the nightly build) - their sources can be found in the &quot;test/Zune&quot; folder of the AROS source archive.

(Note: Information at that site is a little outdated, but still very helpful.) (2011-10-31: utilitybase.com currently down.)

==Tools==

===MUIBuilder===

A [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/guitool native build] and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/muibuilder/ sourceforge svn repository] has been started and [[Aros/Developer/ZuneFurther]] documentation can be read. v3 is W.I.P. so it is not recommended for now. 

This [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=5578&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=52900#forumpost52900 thread] discussed using the m68k build and [http://www.mazze-online.de/files/mbtest.zip diff] file which modifications were necessary to make it build-able under AROS. 

Summary
* added &quot;#define MUI_OBSOLETE&quot; to get some deprecated but needed defines
* changed/added some #include
* changed variable name Object to obj because Object is a type
* changed the Hook for the callback function
* last not least: added main.c which calls the functions to open/close the GUI.

Just go ahead and create your GUIS under any version of AROS or under amiga 68k version and do some modifications (which would be necessary for MorphOS/AmigaOS3/AmigaOS4, too). 

===ChocolateCastle===

The [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/guitool binary] which makes creating MUI classes and applications easier. Programmers using this system often avoid writing custom classes, being discouraged by a lot of boring and schematical typing. A significant part of a typical custom class may be generated automatically. This is usually 2 to 5 kB of source code. Automating this work speeds programming up and helps avoiding simple typing errors.

In Spanish, possessives are used much less frequently than in English when relating to body parts and [[Spanish/Vocabulary/Prendas de vestir|clothes]].

Le duele la cabeza = ''his/her head aches''
&lt;br&gt;
Mírame a los ojos = ''look at my eyes''
&lt;br&gt;
Tienes rota la camisa = ''your shirt is torn''

A sentence like “le duele su cabeza” sounds artificial. However, probably due to badly translated television movies, you can hear “dame tu mano” instead of  “dame la mano” (''give me your hand'').

:(d)&lt;math&gt; S = 3 - 4z + 4z^2 - 4z^3 + 4z^4 - 4z^5 + ...  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; z(S+1) =     4z - 4z^2 + 4z^3 - 4z^4 + 4z^5 - ...  &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; S+z(S+1) = 3 &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; S+zS+z = 3 &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; (1+z)S = 3 - z &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; S = \frac{3 - z}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

2.

====Linear Recurrence Relations exercises====
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
This section only contains the incomplete answers because I couldn't figure out where to go from here.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
1. 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; 2x_{n-1}&amp; - &amp;1; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 1\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Let G(z) be the generating function of the sequence described above.
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = x_0 + x_1z + x_2z^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-2z)G(z) = x_0 + (x_1-2x_0)z + (x_2-2x_1)z^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-2z)G(z) = 1 - z - z^2 - z^3 - z^4 - ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-2z)G(z) = 1 - z( 1 + z + z^2 + ...)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-2z)G(z) = 1-\frac{z}{1-z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-2z)G(z) = \frac{1-2z}{1-z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{1}{1-z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_n = 1&lt;/math&gt;

2. 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
3x_n &amp;=&amp; -4x_{n-1}&amp; + &amp; x_{n-2}; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 2 \\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Let G(z) be the generating function of the sequence described above.
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = x_0 + x_1z + x_2z^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(3+4z-z^2)G(z) = 3x_0 + (3x_1+4x_0)z + (3x_2+4x_1-x_0)z^2 + (3x_3+4x_2-x_1)z^3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(3+4z-z^2)G(z) = 3x_0 + (3x_1+4x_0)z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(3+4z-z^2)G(z) = 3 + 7z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{3 + 7z}{-z^2+4z+3} &lt;/math&gt;

3. Let G(z) be the generating function of the sequence described above.
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = x_0 + x_1z + x_2z^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-z-z^2)G(z) = x_0 + (x_1-x_0)z + (x_2-x_1-x_0)z^2 + (x_3-x_2-x_1)z^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1-z-z^2)G(z) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{1}{1-z-z^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{-1}{z^2+z-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:We want to factorize &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2+z-1&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;(z- \alpha)(z- \beta)&lt;/math&gt; , by the converse of factor theorem, if (z - p) is a factor of f(z), f(p)=0.
:Hence &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; are the roots of the quadratic equation &lt;math&gt;z^2+z-1=0&lt;/math&gt;
:Using the quadratic formula to find the roots:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} , \beta=-\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:In fact, these two numbers are the faomus golden ratio and to make things simple, we use the greek symbols for golden ratio from now on.
:Note:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{-1}{(z-\phi)(z+\Phi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:By the method of partial fraction:
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}(z+\Phi)} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}(z-\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{1}{\Phi\sqrt{5}(\frac{z}{\Phi}+1)} - \frac{1}{\phi\sqrt{5}(\frac{z}{\phi}-1)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{1}{\Phi\sqrt{5}(1- -\phi z)} + \frac{1}{\phi\sqrt{5}(1-\Phi z)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{\phi}{\sqrt{5}} \times (-\phi)^n + \frac{\Phi}{\sqrt{5}} \times \Phi^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{\Phi^{n+1} - (-\phi)^{n+1}}{\sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Further Counting exercises===
1.
We know that 
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - z)^2} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty {i+1 \choose i}z^i = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)z^i &lt;/math&gt;
therefore
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 + z)^2} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)(-1)^iz^i &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;T_k = (-1)^k(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;a + b + c = m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - z)^3} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty {i+2 \choose i}z^i&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;T_k = {i+2 \choose i}&lt;/math&gt;

===*Differentiate from first principle* exercises===
1. 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1} {(1 - (z + h))^2}-\frac{1} {(1 - z)^2} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1}{h}\frac{(1 - z)^2-(1 - (z + h))^2} {(1 - z - h)^2(1 - z)^2} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1}{h}\frac{z^2-2z+1-(z + h)^2+2(z+h)-1} {(1 - z - h)^2(1 - z)^2} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1}{h}\frac{z^2-2z+1-z^2-h^2-2zh+2z+2h-1} {(1 - z - h)^2(1 - z)^2} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1}{h}\frac{-h^2-2zh+2h} {(1 - z - h)^2(1 - z)^2} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{-h-2z+2} {(1 - z - h)^2(1 - z)^2} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-2z+2} {(1 - z)^4} =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-2} {(1 - z)^3}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, thanks a lot for your help in the German textbook, especially [[German: Appendix 7]]. When I created the page, I was hoping to get people to add to that page bit by bit, not completely write a list of names. I changed the format a bit to make it smaller, but otherwise, you did a great job. I look forward to seeing your contributions in this German textbook and using the names in the appendix ''you'' wrote. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:46, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:By the way, thanks for your work on [[German:Beginner Lesson 3]]. It's good to have someone else actually writing content. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:57, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I'm perfectly OK with you putting your name on [[German: Contributors]]. You wrote enough in lesson 3 and appendix 7 to be worthy of mentioning. My part of the contributors page isn't that clear: I'm not actually teaching anyone German outside of this site, but rather using my past German classes to decide how to teach Level I. 

'Dieser-forms' are dieser, diese, dieses, diesen, etc. I was going to teach how to say &quot;This soup tastes delicious.&quot;, or &quot;This bread tastes bad.&quot; I was also hoping to incorporate jeder-forms (the same thing) and, going along with last lesson, to say 'every day', 'every week', etc. I had to wait till this lesson because those are in accusative case. I was also going to introduce stuff like &quot;&lt;u&gt;Der&lt;/u&gt; ist für mich.&quot; This lesson is going to be the largest lesson to date. Thanks for getting that started. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 15:10, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Guido. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Guido~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

=== Range of Data ===
The '''range''' of a sample (set of data) is simply the maximum possible difference in the data, i.e. the difference between the maximum and the minimum values. A more exact term for it is &quot;'''range width&quot;''' and is usually denoted by the letter R or w. The two individual values (the max. and min.) are called the '''&quot;range limits&quot;'''. Often these terms are confused and students should be careful to use the correct terminology.

For example, in a sample with values 2 3 5 7 8 11 12, the range is 11 (|12|-|2|+1=11) and the range limits are 2 and 12. 

The range is the simplest and most easily understood measure of the dispersion (spread) of a set of data, and though it is very widely used in everyday life, it is too rough for serious statistical work. It is not a &quot;robust&quot; measure, because clearly the chance of finding the maximum and minimum values in a population depends greatly on the size of the sample we choose to take from it and so its value is likely to vary widely from one sample to another. Furthermore, it is not a satisfactory descriptor of the data because it depends on only two items in the sample and overlooks all the rest. A far better measure of dispersion is the standard deviation (''s''), which takes into account all the data.  It is not only more robust and &quot;efficient&quot; than the range, but is also amenable to far greater statistical manipulation. Nevertheless the range is still much used in simple descriptions of data and also in quality control charts.

The '''mean range''' of a set of data is however a quite efficient measure (statistic) and can be used as an easy way to calculate ''s''. What we do in such cases is to subdivide the data into groups of a few members, calculate their average range, &lt;math&gt;\bar{R} &lt;/math&gt; and divide it by a factor (from tables), which depends on n. In chemical laboratories for example, it is very common to analyse samples in duplicate, and so they have a large source of ready data to calculate ''s''.

:&lt;math&gt;s= \frac {\bar{R}}k &lt;/math&gt;              

(The factor k to use is given under standard deviation.)

For example: 
If we have a sample of size 40, we can divide it into 10 sub-samples of n=4 each.
If we then find their mean range to be, say, 3.1, the standard deviation of the parent sample of 40 items is appoximately 3.1/2.059 = 1.506. 

With simple electronic calculators now available, which can calculate ''s'' directly at the touch of a key, there is no longer much need for such expedients, though students of statistics should be familiar with them.

Do you not source things in wikibooks?  Methinks this is not the best.

:  '''Agreed''' and I also think comments should be signed either by the author or by a bot.   Does anyone know why wikibooks has different standards to wikipedia?

==Avignon Papacy==

I'm thinking this should be split into multiple sections in some fashion... that's a somewhat large lump of text to read.

I'm going to try this format for now, and will be expanding on the papal paragraphs at some point. I also added a bit on the black death and spoke about french control of their land after the 100 years.

==Hundred Years War==

I expanded the HYW section a little bit.

==John Wycliff(e)==
I see from some research that there's some debate as to the correct spelling of his name; however, I suggest that the writers of this text pick one, as it's inconsistent within this module and the next. -[[User:Byaina|Byaina]] 17:27, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

== Dealing with bias - NPOV ==

In line with comments above re Sources,  I am concerned about how the Neutral Point of View issue (see: NPOV https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) is dealt with on Wikibooks.  Without a requiremet for both sources and a NPOV I cannot see how these books will not come to merely either reflect one bias or become incoherent.  

For instance, in this Introduction it is stated that:
:''&quot;The turn of the first millennium saw renewed growth and activity, '''as''' kings and cities consolidated their authority and began to repopulate lands left empty by Rome's decline.&quot;''
This cause-effect conclusion seems to be belied by the next sentence which notes that over the previous century saw:
:''&quot;Warmer weather after 900 allowed more land to be brought into food production.&quot;''
It seems reaonable to conclude that the cause of the renewed growth was climatic not political.  
A further possible interpretation, that this growth and activity was due to technology is then given:
:''&quot;This was aided by the arrival in Europe of the horse collar from Asia, which increased crop yields by allowing plows to be drawn by horse, rather than by slower oxen.&quot;. '' 
We are then informed that:
:''&quot;'''Despite''' many local wars and disputes between knights, the High Middle Ages, from 1000-1250, saw growing populations and prosperity&quot;''
However I understand that warfare in these times was generally limited, with battles being formal affairs not total warfare involving civilian populations.

I am left with the impression that the narrative of the book is more important than the facts.  While the repository of facts provided is helpful in a sense these are available through wikipedia, generally without the interpretative narrative.  The result seems to me to be to encourage the distribution and acceptance of a vanilla history that supports the status quo of the culture distributing it.  If that is not the objective then I suggest the minimum standards of the sister project be applied here too.

Trigger systems are apparently found only in conlangs, inspired by the applicativization systems of [[Wikipedia:Austronesian alignment|Austronesian languages]] like the Filipino language [[Tagalog]].

In the case systems of English and other Indo-European languages, there's typically a subject (agent of the action), a verb (action) and an object or several objects (patient(s) of the action). Trigger languages on the other hand divide things into '''agent''', '''patient''' and other '''objects'''.

The differences between &quot;trigger languages&quot; and &quot;nominative/accusative languages&quot; are:

* What the sentence is about (the emphasis so to speak) is lexicalized, although still pragmatic -- This is called the '''trigger''', '''focus''' or '''topic''' of a sentence.
* The trigger can be the agent or the patient or perhaps have any other [[Wikipedia:Theta role|theta role]], so calling the triggered argument &quot;subject&quot; does not make sense.
* Such languages need no explicit passive voice because they can do this with triggers: for instance,
** ''I-TRG drink-TRG=AGT milk-PAT (&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; drink milk.)'' 
** ''I-AGT drink-TRG=PAT milk-TRG (I drink &lt;u&gt;milk&lt;/u&gt;. / &lt;u&gt;Milk&lt;/u&gt; is drunk by me)''.

Triggering works as follows: Every argument of the sentence is marked for its role (agent, patient, other objects). The triggered argument is marked on the verb.  In  Carsten Becker's conlang Ayeri, perhaps the best known trigger conlang, trigger and case marker change places.

{{PaleoIntro}}
{{displaytitle|title=What is Paleoanthropology?}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
To effectively study paleoanthropology, one must understand that it is a subdiscipline of [[anthropology]] and have a basic understanding of archaeology dating techniques, evolution of cultures, Darwinian thought, genetics, and primate behaviours. 

__toc__
The study of anthropology falls into four main fields:
#Sociocultural anthropology
#Linguistic anthropology
#[[Archaeology]]
#Physical anthropology

Although these disciplines are separate, they share common goals. All forms of anthropology focus on the following:
*Diversity of human cultures observed in past and present.
*Many scientific disciplines involved in study of human cultures.
**Examples include: Psychology, biology, history, geography among others.
*Anthropology holds a very central position in the world of science.
**There is a long academic tradition in modern anthropology which is divided into four fields, as defined by Franz Boas (1858-1942), who is generally considered the father of the field.

==Sociocultural anthropology/ethnology==
This field can trace its roots to global colonial times, when European trade with other parts of the world and eventual political control of overseas territories offered scholars access to different cultures. Over the years, this field has expanded into urban studies, gender studies, ethnic studies and medical anthropology.

==Linguistic anthropology==
[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Boas is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.]]
This study of human speech and languages includes their structure, origins and diversity. It focuses on comparison between contemporary languages, identification of language families and past relationships between human groups. It looks at:
* Relationship between language and culture
*Use of language in perception of various cultural and natural phenomena
*Process of language acquisition, a phenomenon that is uniquely human, as well as the cognitive, cultural, and biological aspects involved in the process.
* Through historical linguistics we can trace the migration trails of large groups of people (be it initiated by choice, by natural disasters, by social and political pressures). In reverse, we can trace movement and establish the impact of the political, social and physical pressures, by looking at where and when the changes in linguistic usage occurred.

==Archaeology==
Is the study of past cultures. It uses very specific study methods, because of limitations of this subfield. It should be noted that recovery and analysis of material remains is only one window to reconstruct past human societies and behaviours. Examples include economic systems, religious beliefs, and social and political organization. Archaeological studies are based on:
* Specific excavation techniques, stratigraphy, chronology
* Animal bones, plant remains, human bones, stone tools, pottery, structures (architecture, pits, hearths).

==Physical anthropology==
Is the study of human biological variation within the framework of evolution, with a strong emphasis on the interaction between biology and culture. Physical anthropology has several subfields:
* Paleoanthropology
* Osteometry/osteology
* Forensic anthropology
* Primatology
* Biological variation in living human populations
* Bioarchaeology/paleopathology

===Paleoanthropology===
As a subdiscipline of physical anthropology that focuses on the fossil record of humans and non-human primates. This field relies on the following:

;Research Design: Understanding Human Evolution
Evolution of hominids from other primates starting around 8 million to 6 million years ago

;Importance of physical anthropology
Evidence of hominid activity between 8 and 2.5 million years ago usually only consists of bone remains available for study. Because of this very incomplete picture of the time period from the fossil record, various aspects of physical anthropology (osteometry, functional anatomy, evolutionary framework) are essential to explain evolution during these first millions of years. Evolution during this time is considered as the result of natural forces only.

;Importance of related disciplines
Paleoanthropologists need to be well-versed in other scientific disciplines and methods, including ecology, biology, anatomy, genetics, and primatology. Through several million years of evolution, humans eventually became a unique species. This process is similar to the evolution of other animals that are adapted to specific environments or &quot;ecological niches&quot;. Animals adapted to niches usually play a specialized part in their ecosystem and rely on a specialized diet.

Humans are different in many ways from other animals.  Since 2.5 million years ago, several breakthroughs have occurred in human evolution, including dietary habits, technological aptitude, and economic revolutions. Humans also showed signs of early migration to new ecological niches and developed new subsistence activities based on new stone tool technologies and the use of fire. Because of this, the concept of an ecological niche does not always apply to humans any more.

==Summary==
The following topics were covered:
* Introduced field of physical anthropology;
* Physical anthropology: study of human biology, non-human primates, and hominid fossil record;
*Placed paleoanthropology within overall context of anthropological studies (along with cultural anthropology, linguistics, and archaeology);

Further modules in this series will focus on physical anthropology and be oriented toward understanding of the natural and cultural factors involved in the evolution of the first hominids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Helpful Hints==
Shelter will keep you out of the elements and help prevent hypothermia. It will provide shade in the heat. It also has an important positive psychological effect.

* Bring a cheap, lightweight tent with you whenever you go hiking, even if you are not staying the night. Consider a &quot;tube tent,&quot; for example...such a tube can be constructed by gluing (with waterproof glue) the long edge of a thin tarp or plastic drop cloth to the matching edge, creating a tube of-sorts. To use, simply string the string from one end of the tube through the other end, and tie the ends between two trees. If you are injured in the wilderness, such a shelter can be easy to erect quickly. When injured (particularly in cold weather) proper shelter can be essential for your survival. 

* A lean-to can be made by lashing a stick between two trees, then leaning more sticks on it to form a triangular structure.  It can be improved by insulating it with evergreen boughs, branches and leaves, or snow. Alternatively just lay sticks against a log and fill with an cover with insulation. Remember add as much insulation as possible.

* Get your body off the ground. Build an insulating pad between your body and the earth using sticks, pine boughs, leaves, etc. You should have twice as much insulation below you as above you.

* Make the inside of your shelter as small as you can in cold conditions with lots of insulation

* Building a fire reflector (a wall of sticks, rocks, etc.) will improve a lean-to by reflecting the fire's warmth back into the open side of the lean-to.

* Bring one or two metallic rescue blankets wherever you go. They are useful for building shelters, reflectors, and water collectors, and you can even cook with them.

* In snowy conditions, build a [[../Quinzhee|quinzhee]].

* One shelter that has worked very well in the past, is a lean-to shelter, it is fairly easy to construct, and is very effective.

== Shelter for Survival ==

In the average consideration of survival it often seems shelter is overlooked, or at least taken for granted and misplaced on the scale of priorities.

It is always good to remember the &quot;rule of threes&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A person can survive for three minutes without air,&lt;br&gt;
three hours without shelter,&lt;br&gt;
three days without water,&lt;br&gt;
three weeks without food.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

While not absolute these guidelines are reasonable and appropriately stress the need for shelter.  Protection from the elements comes second only to breathing.

Quick thoughts about the conditions under which three hours of exposure is a generous life-expectancy should immediately clarify that when shelter is most needed it may be most difficult to find or create.

'''Levels of shelter:'''&lt;br&gt;
Clothing and basic tools&lt;br&gt;
Minimal short-term protection&lt;br&gt;
Long-term protection&lt;br&gt;
A recent engineer by the name of Howard &quot;Chubby&quot; Fultz has developed an idea that could revolutionize outdoor survival. It is commonly refered to as &quot;The Chubby Dome.&quot; The official name is &quot;CD320.&quot; Although still in the developing stages, The Chubby Dome offers a fresh water supply, food storage, power, shelter, and a small bathroom.

'''Clothing:'''

Dress in Layers!

The first level of shelter to consider is that of clothing.  Simply put, you have to be able to &quot;walk home&quot; in the clothing you have on or at hand.  Take a hard look at the difference between what you want to wear and what you should have for all possible conditions.  

Waypoints where additional resources are available (camp, basecamp, your car) can certainly be the initial target of any self-extraction.  Such caches then cover situations of different scope ~what's on your person will get you back to camp, what's at camp will get you to your car, etc.

The concept of walking home may sound out of place, but there is a distinction between being lost and/or injured, and simply being in a difficult spot for an indefinite period of time.  As a rule, if you are lost or injured do not wander -get yourself found-.

A minimal set of equipment should be incorporated into one's wardrobe.  Without the ability to make fire and cut things -right now- you're not even trying to be prepared and will be hard-pressed to spend anything but a summer night outdoors safely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
=== What Is In This Book ===

== What is GIS? ==
Geographic Information Systems provide a method for integrating and analyzing spatial (digital map based) information such as &quot;where is the nearest movie theater?&quot; alongside related non-spatial information (what movies are playing there?).  GIS have three major capabilities (computer mapping, spatial analysis and spatial database) and can operate on a range of platforms (desktop/laptop computer, Internet, PDA, etc.).  Many people are becoming far more familiar with seeing the results both textually - for example when their phone shows them the nearest pub - and on open map systems such as Google Maps.  Where in the past people had to literally use pencils and string on a paper map to find their nearest school, a computer can do this now extremely quickly an accurately, as long as all the information has been entered correctly in the first place.

In a broader context, GIS involves people and often brings a philosophy of change.  For example, in 1994, the New York Police Department introduced GIS to locate crime 'hot-spots', analyze underlying problems and devise strategies and solutions to deal with the problems.  Since 1993, violent crime has dropped by two-thirds in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pct/cspdf.html|title=New York Crime Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy, known as COMPSTAT, has expanded to cities and jurisdictions across the United States and around the world.

=== GIS Software ===
One leading GIS software vendor is ESRI, based in Redlands, California, which offers ArcGIS for the desktop, ArcGIS Server for Internet mapping, ArcPad for PDAs and a range of other products and services for developers.  Other popular GIS software packages are available from Cadcorp, Intergraph, MapInfo, Manifold and Autodesk.  ERDAS Imagine, ENVI, Idrisi, and PCI Geomatica are geared towards remote sensing i.e. analysis of satellite/aircraft images.  There are many third-party extensions and utilities for ArcGIS and other GIS and raster software platforms.  Currently, [http://opensourcegis.org/ open source GIS software] options can be chosen from the first OS GIS package [http://grass.itc.it/ GRASS], recent open source options are [http://www.diva-gis.org/ DIVA GIS], [http://www.qgis.org/ Quantum GIS], and [http://udig.refractions.net/ uDig].  There are efforts underway, through the [http://www.opengis.org/ Open GIS Consortium] to provide interoperability among spatial data formats and software. The leading contender for spatial data storage is another open source package called [http://postgis.refractions.net/ PostGIS], which is a spatial extension to the open source database [[Postgres RDBMS|PostgresSQL]].

== What Is Topology? ==
[[w:Topology|Topology]] is the branch of mathematics concerned with spatial properties in special the continuous deformations of objects, such as deformations that involve stretching (but no tearing or gluing) and how they connect together. In geography this is an indispensable tool for map-making in expressing relevant geographic information, especially in [[w:Topological map|topological maps]].  

=== A Brief History Of Topology ===
=== Topology In Mathematics ===
=== Navigation ===
=== Why Is Geospatial Topology Important In A GIS? ===
Geospatial analysis provides a unique perspective on the world.  It is a tool with which to examine events, patterns, and processes that operate on or near the surface of our planet.  To have this tool interact with the relevant topological information is a must; providing greater understanding of how rivers flow, weather is affected by terrain, or even how humans and other animals flow or choose a specific habitat.  This kind of information can only be gathered and made useful if topological information is present in the GIS.

== Spatial Data ==
Spatial data comes in two major formats, as vector or raster data.  The main difference is that a raster is usually a static background picture used to illustrate, whereas a vector is an intelligent ladder of information that can be selected and searched.

'''Vector (points, lines, polygons)'''

Vector data often represents anthropogenic (human) features such as roads, buildings, political boundaries (counties, congressional districts, etc.), and other features such as lakes and rivers.

Vector data is scalable without loss of resolution and is generally represented by XYZ points in a Cartesian frame reference.

'''Raster (grids/images)'''

Raster data is pixellated data, and the more pixels that map the data, the better the resolution.  However, if raster data is enlarged, it simply enlarges the pixels, which then leads to a loss of resolution.  There are many moves being made to make raster data more usable/searchable as it is much faster to collect, unlike vectors where each piece of data usually has a manual input origin.

Raster data is usually derived from satellite imagery or aerial photography (known as remote sensing). Ordinary cameras are only sensitive to visible light. Satellite sensors can capture not only visible light, but also the thermal, microwave, infrared or other types of energy emanating from the Earth's surface. This extra data provides information about sea surface temperatures, vegetation, ozone, etc.  Remote sensing is also used to study other planets and extraterrestrial bodies, such as Mars.

=== Data Integrity ===

=== Persistent Storage and Vendor Independence ===

=== Practical GIS ===

=== Data sources ===
The U.S. Federal Government offers a wealth of spatial data for free or at cost, with major offerings from the [http://www.usgs.gov/ United States Geological Survey (USGS)], [http://www.nsas.gov/ NASA] and the [http://tiger.census.gov/ U.S. Census Bureau].  State governments also serve spatial data through GIS portals such as [http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/ MassGIS].  As well, many local governments have detailed GIS data of tax parcels, roads, buildings, etc.  Other governments around the world also offer spatial data, though not necessarily for free.  Private industry also offers GIS data, with TeleAtlas/GDT offering a wealth of vector data, while Ikonos and DigitalGlobe (QuickBird) provide high-resolution satellite imagery. Some public-domain data sources are listed at http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/EarthMapTool .

The important thing to notice here is that the 2x2 matrix remains the same when multiplied with the other matrix. The matrix with only 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere is known as the ''identity'' matrix, called ''I'', and any matrix multiplied on either side of it stays the same. That is &lt;math&gt;A \times I = I \times A&lt;/math&gt;

The important thing to notice here is that the 1 to 9 matrix remains the same when multiplied with the other matrix. The matrix with only 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere is known as the ''identity'' matrix, called ''I'', and any matrix multiplied on either side of it stays the same. That is &lt;math&gt;A \times I = I \times A&lt;/math&gt;

===Determinant and Inverses exercises===
1. 
:&lt;math&gt; \det(A) = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} -\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The simultaneous equation will be translated into the following matrices
&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}\frac{2}{5}&amp;\frac{2}{3}\\ \\ \frac{3}{2}&amp; \frac{5}{2}\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Because we already know that
:&lt;math&gt; \det(\begin{pmatrix}\frac{2}{5}&amp;\frac{2}{3}\\ \\ \frac{3}{2}&amp; \frac{5}{2}\end{pmatrix}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
We can say that there is no unique solution to these simultaneous equations.

2. First calculate the value when you multiply the determinants
:&lt;math&gt;
\det(
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}
)
\det(
\begin{pmatrix}
e&amp;f\\
g&amp;h
\end{pmatrix}
) =
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(ad - bc)(eh - fg) = 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
adeh - bceh - adfg + bcfg
&lt;/math&gt;
Now let's calculate C by doing the matrix multiplication first
:&lt;math&gt;
\det(
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
e&amp;f\\
g&amp;h
\end{pmatrix}
) =
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\det(
\begin{pmatrix}
ae+bg&amp;af+bh\\
ce+dg&amp;cf+dh
\end{pmatrix}
) =
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(ae + bg)(cf + dh) - (af + bh)(ce + dg) =
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
aecf+bgcf+aedh+bgdh-afce-bgce-afdg-bhdg = 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
bgcf+aedh-bgce-afdg
&lt;/math&gt;
Which is equal to the value we calculated when we multiplied the determinants, thus
:det(C) = det(A)det(B)
for the 2&amp;times;2 case.

3.
:&lt;math&gt;A =
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\det(A) = ad - bc
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A' =
\begin{pmatrix}
c&amp;d\\
a&amp;b
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\det(A') = cb - da
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
-\det(A') = -(bc - ad) = ad - bc
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus det(A) = -det(A') is true.

4. 
a)
:&lt;math&gt;A = P^{-1}BP&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A) = \det(P^{-1})\det(B)\det(P) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\det(P^{-1})\det(P)\det(B) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\det{(P^{-1}P)}\det(B) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\det{(I)}\det(B) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\det(B)&lt;/math&gt; as det(I) = 1.
thus det(A) = det(B)
b)
if &lt;math&gt;A^k=0&lt;/math&gt; for some k it means that &lt;math&gt;\det(A^k)=0&lt;/math&gt;. But we can write &lt;math&gt;\det(A^k)=\det{(A)}^k&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\det{(A)}^k=0&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;\det(A)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

We see that P and it's inverse disappear when you raise the matrix to the fifth power. Thus you can see that we can calculate A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; very easily because you only have to raise the diagonal matrix to the n-th power. Raising diagonal matrices to a certain power is very easy because you only have to raise the numbers on the diagonal to that power.

e)
We use the method derived in the exercise above.

== Links not working, ) is included giving wrong url ==

The links (in brackets) are not working as the closing bracket is included in the url.

Looking at the editing instructions briefly it seems that you should include these in double square brackets to make them in to proper links.

== Don't include language-specific features ==

''I think that VB features such as the lack of a multiline comment delimiter should be taken to the Visual Basic .NET article.''

:I think that we should include both languages. --[[User:Mplogan|Mplogan]] 23:11, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::ASP.Net is a web programming model that uses different languages for the CodeBehind. We should try not to dive into the language-specific parts of the ASP.Net programming model, rather we should look at ASP.Net from a broader perspective like the usage of the various contorls, web.config, web.sitemap and other such stuff.
::- [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] 08:32, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

== Learning the languages is part of the point ==

Discussing ASP.NET w/o discussing VB.NET and C#.NET is worthless.  The point of the book should be to teach the languages along with the best practices for coding ASP.NET web apps.  A book that merely discussed the life-cycle of development patterns of ASP.NET apps w/o the specifics of language would be too abstract to have any value for most.  The idea, I think, is to create a useful introductory text. --[[User:wheat|wheat]] 02.16.05

== Problems in the code ==

I am still learning ASP.NET, but I am very familiar with C#, and the code given in this article is most definitely not C# code.

  Please quote an example of the book's C# code that is wrong. I can find no fault with the C# code in this book yet.
  All examples are given in both C# and VB.Net, are you sure you're not confusing the VB.Net code with C#?

== ASP to ASP.NET 1.0/1.1 to ASP.NET 2.0 ==

There are three versions 'in the wild' which need explaining - and ASP.NET 1.0/1.1 is also different from ASP.NET 2.0 as well. A basic section on installation would help BY VERSION along with a conversion section.

One aspect that I have found confusing is the deployment to make a designed web available under a public IIS. aspnet_regiis -i anyone?  

Probably an explaination of the .NET paradigm would be of benefit. ASP.NET is just an application of the .NET paradigm to ASP

== Contributors list ==

I am removing the contributors list from the main page, I dont think it's appropriate for people to be signing the content modules. If you want to talk about the authors either do it here on the discussion page, or create a special page for it at [[ASP.NET/Authors]]. I am copy+pasting the contributors list here, in case somebody wants to move them to a better place. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:33, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

{{displaytitle|title=Chronology and dating methods}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Having an accurate time scale is a crucial aspect of reconstructing how anatomical and behavioral characteristics of early hominids evolved.
__toc__
Researchers who are interested in knowing the age of particular hominid fossils and/or artifacts have options that fall into two basic categories:
*Relative dating methods
*Chronometric dating methods

==Relative dating methods==
Relative dating methods allow one to determine if an object is earlier than, later than, or contemporary with some other object.  It does not, however, allow one to independently assign an accurate estimation of the age of an object as expressed in years.  The most common relative dating method is stratigraphy.  Other methods include fluorine dating, nitrogen dating, association with bones of extinct fauna, association with certain pollen profiles, association with geological features such as beaches, terraces and river meanders, and the establishment of cultural seriations.

===Principle of stratigraphy===
Stratigraphic dating is based on the principle of depositional superposition of layers of sediments called strata.  This principle presumes that the oldest layer of a stratigraphic sequence will be on the bottom and the most recent, or youngest, will be on the top.  The earliest-known hominids in East Africa are often found in very specific stratigraphic contexts that have implications for their relative dating.

==Chronometric dating methods==
The majority of chronometric dating methods are radiometric, which means they involve measuring something related to radioactivity, for example radioactive decay.  They are called chronometric because they allow one to make a scientific estimate of the date of an object as expressed in years. They do not, however, give &quot;absolute&quot; dates because they merely provide a statistical probability that a given date falls within a certain range of age expressed in years.  Chronometric methods include radiocarbon, potassium-argon, fission-track, and thermoluminescence.  

The most commonly used chronometic method is radiocarbon analysis.  It measures the decay of radioactive carbon (14C) that has been absorbed from the atmosphere by a plant or animal prior to its death.  Radioactive carbon has a half-life of approximately 5,730 years plus or minus 40 years (1 standard deviation of error) and the theoretical absolute limit of this method is 80,000 years ago, although the practical limit is close to 50,000 years ago.  Because the pool of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere (a result of bombardment of nitrogen by neutrons from cosmic radiation) has not been constant through time, calibration curves based on dendrochronology (tree ring dating) and glacial ice cores, are now used to adjust radiocarbon years to calendrical years.  

The development of Atomic Absorption Mass Spectrometry in recent years, a technique that allows one to count the individual atoms of 14C remaining in a sample instead of measuring the radioactive decay of the 14C, has considerably broadened the applicability of radiocarbon dating because it is now possible to date much smaller samples, as small as a grain of rice, for example.

==Methods of dating in archaeology==

Techniques of recovery include:
* Surveys
* Excavations

Types of archaeological remains include:
* Perishable: plant remains, animal bones, wooden artifacts, basketry, and other easily degradable objects
* Nonperishable materials: stone tools, pottery, rocks used for structures.

Data collection and analysis is oriented to answer questions of subsistence, mobility or settlement patterns, and economy.

== Methods in physical anthropology ==

Data collections based on study of hard tissues (bones and teeth), usually the only remains left of earlier populations, which include:
* Identification of bones/Which part of skeleton is represented?
* Measurement of the cranium and other elements of a skeleton. Carefully defined landmarks are established on the cranium, as well as on the long bones, to facilitate standardization of measurements.
* Superficial examination of bone for any marks (for instance, cutmarks)
* Further examination using specific techniques: 
** X-ray to identify evidence of disease and trauma in bones
** DNA extraction to determine genetic affiliations

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sounds in both English and Arabic ==

Most of the sounds in Arabic are also in English and vice versa. For example, the Arabic ba (ب) sounds exactly like the b in English, the Arabic zay (ز), sounds just like the z in English and the Arabic versions of k (ك), m (م), n (ن), f (ف), and j (ج) are all just the same.
 
The counterpart of l (ل) in Arabic, known as laam, is not exactly the same sound as the English one (the Arabic one is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth a bit farther back). The counterpart of r (ر) in Arabic, known as raa, is very different from English r. The Arabic one is trilled (it is a &quot;rolled r&quot;).

In addition to the above, the following Arabic sounds also exist in English:

-Thâ (ث) makes the sound &quot;th&quot; (voiceless) as in thin or thick or through.

-Dhâ (ذ) makes the sound &quot;th&quot; (''dh'') (voiced) as in them or there or the.  

-Shîn (ش) makes the sound &quot;sh&quot; as in shoot or shin.

-Tâ marbûta (ة) is usually silent in modern Arabic. In Classical Arabic, it is pronounced t, the same as the letter tâ.

-Hamza (ء) represents the glottal stop. It is pronounced by stopping the flow of breath at the back of the mouth cavity (the glottis). We make this sound when speaking English; we just have no symbol for it in our alphabet. Think of the dash in uh-oh, or the Cockney way of saying British as Bri-ish. However, hamza is also written as a diacritic.

-Yâ (ي) acts just like a y. It can be a vowel (always a long vowel) at the end of a word sounding like î (the &quot;ee&quot; in beet), or it can be a consonant (''y'').  It can be a consonant (as in the y in yes) or a vowel (like the &quot;ee&quot; in beet) in the middle of a word.

== Sounds in Arabic only ==

There are sounds in Arabic hard for English speakers to tell apart. Look at what makes them different.

=== Like &quot;k&quot; (ك vs ق) ===

In Arabic, the corresponding letter to q (ق) makes a different sound than the corresponding letter to k (ك), whereas in English they are redundant. The q is further back in the throat while the k is as in English.  Kuwait starts with a k. Qatar with a q. Listen to the difference.

=== Like &quot;h&quot; ===

The most significant sound that English speakers hear in Arabic are the three corresponding letters to h. The first (ه) is equivalent to the h and is thus very light, almost not heard at all. The noise comes from friction in the upper throat. The second (ح) comes from deep down in the throat, from actual friction from the vocal cords themselves. It sounds a little like blowing warm air on your cold hands or very fine sandpaper. The third (خ) is very rough, almost like collecting phlegm. It is very similar to the last sound in &quot;Bach.&quot;  

None of these three sounds have any humming or vowel sound (known as vocalization). They are all like a whisper; your vocal cords do not vibrate.

=== Like &quot;h&quot; but vocalized ===

The ayn (ع) may be difficult to hear and produce because though it is a consonant in Arabic, it sounds like the English a, as in water. Ir is produced like the y in you, but the constriction is made down in the throat instead of the mouth. It is a little like the sound a doctor asks to hear when looking down your throat. While saying &quot;aaah&quot;, pull the back of your tongue back into your throat a bit, with a little squeeze. Similar is the ghayn (غ), which is a rougher version with more of the ch from &quot;Bach&quot;, only with vocal cords vibrating. The difference between the last sound in the previous paragraph and the last sound in the first paragraph should be very clear. They are both rough, but one has no vibrating vocal cords while the other has them.

=== Letters that come in hard and soft varieties ===

Arabic has hard and soft versions of s, t, d, and th (as there, not thin). Arabic-speakers often refer to their language as the language of Dod (hard d) because it is so hard for foreigners to say it right. It can be easier for English-speakers to think of the hard sounds as lower-pitched and the soft sounds as higher-pitched. What complicates matters is that for English-speakers the hard s and the soft s sound the same, but the vowels before and after them are affected by the consonant.  To the English speaker, the vowels are different, and the consonant is the same. To the Arabic-speaker the vowels are the same, and the consonant is different.

Partly, it is because Arabic has very few recognized vowel sounds. An a and an e to an Arabic-speaker are usually the same, depending on the dialect. It is one letter pronounced differently depending on what letter comes before or after it.  

Also, the hard letters can be hard for even native speakers to say and so are often changed in local colloquial Arabic to something else. For example, the hard d in many areas is pronounced exactly like the z, but it is not formal, proper Arabic.

The soft s, &quot;seen&quot; (س), is pronounced just like the English s (with mouth open, small and weak). The hard s, &quot;sod&quot; (ص), is with the mouth more closed, with a lower pitch, as if you were a big, stalwart man. The easiest way to say it is to make the vowels before and after it lower-pitched and deeper.  

The soft t, ta (ت) is just like the English t, soft and weak, and the hard t &quot;taw&quot; (ط) is deep and strong.

The soft d, del (د) is even softer than the English d, and the hard d, Dod (ض) is very deep and hard.

The soft dh, dhel (ذ), is just like the th in &quot;the&quot;, and the hard dh, DHa (ظ) is deep and strong.

====Note on transliteration====
Since Arabic does not use capital letters, transliterating soft letters usually uses in lowercase, hard letters in uppercase.  Transliterating is not an exact science and is never entirely consistent. You are highly recommended to learn the Arabic alphabet because studying Arabic from English letters is terrifically frustrating. The same sound can be written totally differently in English letters.

`Ayn is usually written as ' (with a 6 shape) in English and hamza as an opposite ' (with a 9 shape). `ayn and hamza are often left out when transliterating, especially `ayn at the beginning of a word (as in `iraaq). Ghayn  is written as gh, soft ha as h, khaa (the one in Bach) as kh, and hard ha as &quot;H&quot; (capital h) or &quot;7&quot; (number seven).

== Sounds in English only ==

In case you mistakenly think that Arabic has more sounds than English, the following sounds ''do not'' exist in Arabic, with the sounds that are usually substituted for them in borrowed words.

v (f)

p (b)

g (j in Egypt, usually gh, q, or k elsewhere in order of descending occurrence)

r is very close but is always rolled (similar to Spanish r)

As mentioned above, in Arabic the corresponding letter to q (ق) makes a different sound than the corresponding letter to k (ك).

== Conclusion ==

Most sounds in English and Arabic correspond perfectly.  Give yourself time to recognize the different sounds of h and the hard and soft letters.  And learn the alphabet.  The book &lt;i&gt;Alif Baa&lt;/i&gt; is one of many introductions to the [[Arabic alphabet]].  Much better, take a short course, but make sure it is one that teaches the Arabic alphabet.  Those 50 hours it takes you to get comfortable with the alphabet will be endlessly worth it.  Plus, if you ever want to learn Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Kurdish, Berber, or Urdu, these languages are also written with the same letters.  Some of these languages also have a few extra or modified letters in order to make up for the sounds not available in Arabic but that are found in those languages.

Insha'Allah (God willing) you will learn these sounds with ease.

==Gaining proficiency in the sounds==

Learning and differentiating those sounds is crucial to having a good Arabic accent. First expose yourself to the sounds, as many hours of the day as possible. If you have audio in Arabic, play it again and again, in the background of your life. You can occasionally also listen to it attentively, but you need to listen to how Arabic is spoken to be able to speak it.
# Do not imitate sounds without an expert at Arabic sounds. You do not want to learn them incorrectly. Learn them from someone who has proper pronunciation.
#Because in cartoons, the following letters ح خ ع غ along with others are pronounced very softly, you want be able to pick them up properly. What you need to do is have the sounds pronounced as strongly as possible by an Arabic person, as it is much easier to differentiate the sound when the sound is pronounced strongly. (Make sure they know how to pronounce all letters properly. In any case, all Arabs can pronounce: ح خ ع غ ق ل ر properly.) Then, you will start recognizing the difference. Once you recognize the pronunciation, with the help of an Arabic speaker, pronounce the sounds as strongly (to your mouth the ability to pronounce it properly} but correctly as possible. Once you have a strong pronunciation, your pronunciation will fall in place and the amount of strength you use to pronounce letters will become less, making you sound perfect.
#Listen to more and more Arabic, while learning grammar and vocabulary, and it will all sink in after a while (especially the vowels), and you will إن شاء الله become fluent.

== Arabic phonetics ==

&lt;!--
We should be able to cannibalise this.  The point isn't to give the user a phonentics course, but to help them understand what's the different about those crazily similar sounds.  Also, we should use colour to mark the sounds which are like English so that that the user knows he won't have to work about them.

==Authoring webpages==

I've answered your question at [[Talk:Authoring Webpages]], and have a question for you in return.--[[User:Branko|Branko]] 17:59, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

==Disincentives to growth==
What makes Wikipedia work that is hard to reproduce (or needs to be pursued diligently) at Wikibooks:
*At Wikipedia it is easy for a newbie to create a useful stub/seed in a few minutes. Could Wikibooks devise a way to encourage creating small how-tos that might blossom into complete texts?
*The information Wikipedia presents is more popular than at Wikibooks, and naturally attracts more editors.  Could Wikibooks somehow increase its popular attraction?
*At Wikipedia it is generally possible to get an article overview in a matter of seconds by perusing a page, this makes contributing to an article in an orderly way a low-cost effort.  Could Wikibooks find a way to make textbook organization more transparent and less intimidating to the casual visitor? [[User:Kupord Maizzed|Kupord Maizzed]] 20:02, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

One possibility to seed the early growth of Wikibooks is to capitalize on the How-to or recipe concept.  Multitudes from all over are anxious to share their knowledge of how to do a certain task, though they may not be disposed to write a textbook.  Perhaps Wikibooks could encourage writing &quot;problem&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, &quot;recipe&quot;, or &quot;solution&quot; articles that can be building blocks for complete texts that are more friendly and useful than any texts heretofore seen. [[User:Kupord Maizzed|Kupord Maizzed]] 20:02, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Top active on main page ==

Hi, I took out the &quot;edit&quot; button from Top active on main page, because the list is not meant to be edited by everybody.. at least first-time users should not be able to easily click on &quot;edit&quot; to change the SQL generated ranking. An expert like you will know anyway how to make small modifications. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 18:31, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Gumba gumba ==

He just got a new username [[User:GumbaGumba]].  Apparently doesn't understand the concept of stealth...  :-)  - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 23:12, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)



== Thanks! ==

''Man tackar'', yeah there seems to be an awful lot to do, my grammar is somewhere down in the basement, but I'll start writing some material and others can come in and straighten things up. [[User:Salleman|Salleman]] 20:31, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

== FHSST Physics Electronics ==

Hi David, thanks for adding to the Electronics section of the FHSST Physics book. Its a real disaster and at the moment we've got nobody looking into it.
Any help is greatly appreciated!

== Lord's Table ==
Hello, thanks for your interest. On my talk page, I put an example of table under your comment without &lt;break&gt; in first column and no wrap occurred. We can work together, so tell me what you think about Modernity and/or parallel version. Plan to only parallel the first chapter as example and concentrate on Modernity itself. Had to answer [[User:Portress | Portress]] so I am running out of time, but input is input and much appreciated. The prologue must be right on target. Made some changes suggested by Portress. More later. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 10:08, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

My last statement under your test table is predicated on the seeming lack of public domain Strong's Concordance, another Wikibook possibility? [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 23:00, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
Need to change another page with new table and Portress [[Talk:John 1 |Comments]]. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 23:10, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Made changes on [[John 1]] in '''bold''' and the table compacted somewhat when I completed verses and changed titles because the first column was much wider than the others. Looks even better. Your help was immense. I will keep the prophecy table as is with &lt;breaks&gt;, no wrap... Just noticed the test table was also compacted? So reverted titles to original on my talk page to see what happens by tomorrow. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 06:46, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I was fatigued, Internet Explorer gives table full screen. Netscape, Firefox are compacted. OK either way, decided to keep &quot;The Updated Modernity Version&quot; for final version. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 18:34, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)
----
Curious as to why edits to [[Christianity]], including the vandal (who also left a load on Religion), were in bold on RC page. That could be a good thing (revert) or a bad thing (deletion). There has been a deletion notice on [[John 2]] which produced RC bold for my edits to that discussion page [[Talk:John_2]], added, just to see what happened. The work goes forward. Oh, could you vote to keep if so inclined... I just noticed Wikiversity recognized Christianity under Theology and I made mention of Gospel 101 as course work. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 22:30, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I have (finally!) figured out why.
: You can choose to &quot;watch&quot; some pages ([[Help:Watching pages]]).
: When you look at your watchlist ( [[Special:Watchlist]] ), you see *only* pages on your watchlist.
: When you look at recent changes, you see *all* of the most-recently-changed pages -- the ones on your watchlist are in bold.

I merged the PIC article that you had contributed into the [[Embedded Systems]] book, that i've been working on for a few days now. I'm in the process of cleaning the original page up, and expanding the information there, so if you would like to contribute to this project as well, it would be greatly appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:17, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

''OK, looks good. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:45, 13 November 2005 (UTC)''

== [[Wikibooks:Programming_languages_bookshelf]] ==

Just a reminder: [[Wikibooks:Programming_languages_bookshelf]] is the bookshelf of books available on this wiki and neither a list of programming languages nor a list of wikis around the world. I have changed the entries you made into &quot;Suggested Books&quot;.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

I thought it was weird that the page mentioned &quot;Gambas – Lua&quot; even though there was no Wikibook (yet) about Lua.

When people (like me) are looking for a wiki about, say, the Lua programming language,
the Wikibooks:Programming_languages_bookshelf is the first place we look.
I am glad you kept those links to help people (like me) find what we are looking for.

I am OK with your edits. They do a good job clarifying that those external wiki are *not* internal Wikibooks.

== [[Programmable Logic]] ==

I just wanted to let you know personally that I started the &quot;Programmable Logic&quot; wikibook that previously was just an outline on my user page. As you can see, I took the suggestions that I got and changed the name from &quot;VLSI System Design&quot;, which wasn't appropriate for the subject material that I intend to cover. I wanted to thank you for your comments and suggestions while I was outlining this book, and I wanted to get your help (and the help of all wikibookians) in making this book grow! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:54, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== email, password ==

I'm going to get in touch with the techs. I am going to need your email address. Hopefully, they will manually insert your address into the database, and then your &quot;email new password&quot; function will work. As soon as I get your email address, I can get to work on this for you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:56, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

:Okay, I asked the wikimedia techs, and they said that they can insert your email address into the database manually, if you provide a new email address, and if you can prove your identity. Send me an email to '''wknight8111 &lt;at&gt; hotmail &lt;dot&gt; com''', with your username and your email address, ''and the word &quot;wikibooks&quot; in the subject like''. the subject part is important, so you dont get lost in my spam filter. I will ask the techs to insert that email into the database, and then you can select to have your password emailed to you. 
:The techs did say that you needed to prove that you were who you say you are, if you can prove it to me by sending the email, they should be able to take my word for it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:37, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

Thank you. The &quot;email a new password&quot; worked fine here at Wikibooks.
( But it didn't seem to work at wikipedia ).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:51, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

:That's good, I'm glad you got it back. To be honest, I was never able to get ahold of any of the techs, so somebody else must be responsible for this. Either way, I'm happy to see you back. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

== Microprocessors Book ==

I have been planning this book for months now, and I am just waiting until I have enough time in my schedule to finally create it. I am not planning on discussing the history of CPUs much, although a little discussion on the topic will be interesting. From a high-enough level of abstraction, it doesnt particularly matter whether we discuss FPGA design, or TTL design, or whatever. A CPU that is hand-made out of transistors certainly won't have a multi-level cache, but the people building such CPUs can still benefit from a discussion of them. 

My plan for the book is to identify the mathematical and electrical basis for CPU design, but leave details about the specific implementation techniques out. After all, the implementation techniques for designing a CPU are identical to the Implementation techniques in designing any other ASIC. We can leave discussions on how to program an FPGA to the [[Programming Logic]] book, and we can leave information about how to lay out transistors to a different book as well (perhaps a new book that we need to start?). I am also not planning on talking much about fabrication techniques, because I feel that those techniques are not necessarily specific to CPUs, but instead to all ASICs. Perhaps we need to start a companion book about ASIC design as well?

--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:21, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

There are a lot of people who think &quot;it would be cool to build a CPU&quot;.
Some of them go on to [http://www.holmea.demon.co.uk/Links.htm#Homemade build their own CPU out of TTL chips] (the Homebuilt CPUs WebRing).
I think it would be cool to have a wikibook dedicated to that audience.

You are right that all the information necessary *should* already be in about 6 of the Wikibooks we already have or are soon planning to have: Assembly-language programming; high-level CPU design with pipelining and VHDL down to register-transfer language (RTL); state machine design down to individual flip-flops; digital logic from ALU design down to NAND gates; switching power supply design; oscillator design; schematic drawing tips; PCB layout; wire-wrapping tips; ... and probably something else I've forgotten.

But I think it would be nifty to build a book that left out all the distracting &quot;clutter&quot; in those other books that doesn't move me forward to my goal: a Turing-complete machine, and the understanding that comes from building it myself (rather than buying a magical off-the-shelf black box).
* Focus on just a few chips that give a good bang for the buck -- a &quot;universal&quot; chip such as the 74HC253 mux, and a few &quot;shortcut&quot; chips that reduce assembly time &quot;significantly&quot;: static RAM, the 74HC374N, ... perhaps one or two others. (Alas, the 74LS181 ALU seems to be going obsolete?)
* Describe the 74HC253 mux without getting sidetracked into how it is built out of logic gates, their truth tables, how those logic gates are built out of transistors, how the transistors are built, etc.
* testing *is* essential
** LEDs ... 7 segment displays
** quick serial port interface
* the grand climax: a functioning Turing-complete machine
* After the climax: other ways to improve performance:
** Other computronium substrates: relays, individual transistors, FPGAs, ...
** Interfacing to IDE hard drives?
** links to other Wikibooks that discuss pipelining, etc.

Hopefully this will point out and fill in gaps in the other 6 or so related Wikibooks. (Do any of them discuss interfacing to static RAM?)

:In this subject, as in most subjects, there is a large distinction between the theoretical discussion of the topic, and the practical application of the subject. If we blur the lines too much, this book could become more cluttered then the other books, and far less readable. I think it is far more valuable to describe the theory behind a CPU, and to show some general schematics, then it is to provide a design for a single brew-your-own model. 
:Also, I think that it's perfectly acceptable for us to build a new book on the shoulders of previous books. For instance, we should be able to say &quot;read [[Semiconductors]], [[Digital Circuits]], and [[Electronics]] before you read this book&quot;. In that way, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. [[Digital Circuits]] does have sections on ALU, MUX, and other integrated logic devices. If we know the theory of what an ALU does, the specifics about which model number should be used are arbitrary.
:With that said, my intention for this outline was to cater to a more theoretical discussion, and less of a practical one. Once it is described how an ALU works, and where it goes in the schematic, the hobbyists can figure out which specific brand/model of ALU to put in their circuit. Conversely, we could also create a second book that discusses the topic from a &quot;build your own&quot; standpoint. Consider the relationship between a course textbook, and the lab manual. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:55, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

I've seen several articles/web pages on &quot;Here is the schematic diagram for one particular CPU, and an analysis of how it works&quot;.
What I would like to do is something more along the lines of &quot;So you want to build a CPU? Let me tell you how I did it, ''but also'' let me tell you some other alternatives that would certainly make things different, perhaps more clever, but with their own quirks and tradeoffs, and reasons you may want to do it this other way ... let me tell you what went wrong, some pitfalls along this path ... let me tell you what I wish I had did different ... and some other ways of doing things that I haven't really investigated, but might make things much better/simpler ...&quot;
[[Wiki:CategoryComputerArchitecture]]

In particular, mentioning differences between the wire-wrap design flow, the PCB design flow, the FPGA design flow, and the ASIC design flow.

I suspect I'm biting off more than I can chew, so I hope the &quot;wiki magic&quot; allows other people to add stuff in (where I vaguely wave my hands), and also take stuff out (where I know only one complicated way of doing things, but others know simpler and better ways).

I hope a book on &quot;how to build a CPU&quot; won't get too cluttered, because I would encourage editors to use ruthless deletion when I get sidetracked onto factoids that don't really help building a CPU. If it doesn't help me pick and order the parts I need, and it doesn't help me put the parts together, leave it out (perhaps it belongs in some other book).

Last week I was thinking that &quot;how to build a CPU&quot; ( [[User:Whiteknight/Microprocessor Design]] ?)
and [[Digital Circuits]] would all go into one book.
Too many technical books explain ''how'' something works, but utterly fail to tell us ''why'' we need to learn it, ''what'' the alternatives are, and ''when'' one should use that thing (rather than the alternatives).
The &quot;how to build a CPU&quot; perspective (possibly in sidebars) illustrate why we need to learn truth tables, state machines, etc.
(Or perhaps the &quot;building a CPU&quot; would be the main text, with digressions into digital circuit theory going into long sidebars).
It would also help us editors remember to to make the [[Digital Circuits]] book &quot;complete&quot;, at least in the sense that it covers everything needed to build a CPU -- it would make it more obvious when we've forgotten something crucial.

You have almost convinced me that these should be seperate books (perhaps with heavy cross-linking so we don't re-invent an inferior wheel).

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:The only problem that I see is that there is no easy way to implement some of the large, complicated CPU structures that do exist in the world. Can you imagine trying to implement high-level cache, CISC instruction decoding, or branch predictors in brew-your-own hardware? There are plenty of things that need to be discussed when it comes to this topic, and not all of them can really be implemented in your own basement.

:Also, if we use a bottom-up approach to this book (introduce the basic structure, and then build on that structure to add more complicated features), it will make building your own CPU difficult. Changing an unpipelined processor into a multistage processor is a few changes in the schematic (and the truth table of your control path), but will require gigantic changes in hardware implementation. I would definately recommend two books, but I agree that there would need to be an enormous amount of cross-linking between them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:: If I can't implement them, why do we &quot;need to discuss&quot; them? Seriously?
:: Perhaps there is some good reason -- the way there is a good reason to learn that some countries standardize on (roughly) 110 VAC power, while others have standardized on (roughly) 220 VAC power, even though it is unlikely I'll ever implement a national voltage standard.
:: &lt;tangent&gt;Most wire-wrapped homebrew CPUs do, in fact, implement CISC decoding. Hard-wired no-microcode CPUs are very much the exception in wire-wrapped homebrewed CPUs.&lt;/tangent&gt;

:: I agree that the most complicated features of modern custom-CMOS CPUs transistors would be crazy to implement in my basement.
:: Are there any digital circuits outside of CPUs that use any of those complex features?
:: Are those complex features really *necessary* to implement any instruction set?
::  Since the answer is &quot;no&quot; to both of those, then a merged &quot;build a CPU&quot; and &quot;Digital Circuits&quot; in one book would simply not mention those features (or relegate them to an appendix or a footnote).
:: Could I start &quot;How to build a CPU&quot; as an independent book, and then later (if others think it is a good idea, considering how much they overlap) merge it with the [[Digital Circuits]] book?

:: ''a bottom-up approach to this book ... will make building your own CPU difficult. ... gigantic changes in hardware implementation''
:: You may be right. Do you have any suggestions for how to make building my own CPU &quot;easy&quot; ?
:: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

== fixing images ==

I downloaded and corrected and downloaded a few media files today.  I had to reformat a couple of them, and forgot the license on a couple.  Tried to delete the old ones but had no authority to do so.  Who will clean that up?  The ones I want are embedded in the text of Telescope Making.
--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 21:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

I am confused.
When I check
http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Vorblesnak
I see that you have contributed several items with the &quot;image:&quot; tag.
But every single one of them is in use in the [[Telescope Making]] module -- have the unnecessary ones already been deleted?

I spotted 3 that have no license yet:
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:Formula_2_Small.png
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:Sagitta_Calculations_Small.png
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:Mirror_Basics_Small.png

Would you mind going to each of your images that have no license, hit the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top, and copy-and-paste the 11 characters
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
into each one, then bang the &quot;save&quot; button?
That would take care of it.
(I *could* do that, but some people around here frown at me when I change the license on someone else's pictures).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 17:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

Done today.  I had not been back for a day or two.  I was tired after the last edit session and then noticed the text and images were not where I left them.

== File validation with Javascript ==

About your question of using javascript to validate if a file in the &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;... tag you could probably use javascript to get the name attribute of the tag and check the file's extension... so if it was .exe and you only want .txt then it could find the .exe and that is != to .txt. Haha. Ok. yeah.

== Thank you for the welcome message ==

Dear David,

Thank you for the responsiveness. Maybe, it looks strange but your message is only the second reaction (the first one was of [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]) of a wikibookian to [[Circuit Idea]] that I started with enthusiasm two months ago. I have moved from Wikipedia to Wikibooks in the hope of meeting adherents; only, I note again that there are very few people who are interested in revealing circuit ideas and who have their own philosophy about circuits. So, I would be grateful to you for joining the [[Talk:Circuit Idea|discussion page]] and giving valuable ideas about the content and implementation of the book.

Thank you for the valuable links to the great materials of William J. Beaty. I read some of them (e.g., the article about [http://amasci.com/emotor/cap1.html capacitor]) a few years ago; then I was deeply impressed by his philosophy. I will scrutinize his [[Wikipedia:User talk:Wjbeaty|user discussion page]]; it seems to be very interesting.

Finally, I would like to know if it is possible to place web trackers (counters) on the wikibooks pages. If so, can you help me to place a tracker on the ''Circuit Idea'' [[Circuit Idea|home page]]?

== [[Signal Processing]] merger ==

Hey david, i saw your suggestion to merge [[Signal Processing]] into [[Signals and Systems]]. I oppose the merger (which should be obvious since I created both book separately), for a number of reasons. The [[Signals and Systems]] book really deals with the concept of linear systems, which is a very broad foundational subject. What I wanted was to create a book from the shared prerequisite information from many other advanced books, such as [[Communication Systems]], [[Signal Processing]], or [[Control Systems]]. The [[Signal Processing]] book no more needs to be merged into [[Signals and Systems]] then either of the other two books need to be. The field of signal processing is really large in it's own right, and I think there is more then enough information to fill at least one book (likely more, as time goes on). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:00, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

:I hope you dont mind, but i've gone ahead and removed those merger tags. If you really think they should be merged we can discuss the issue some more, but I would really like to keep the two books separate. I'm trying my hardest to differentiate the two, including making different prerequisites, different topics, etc. Give me a little while to lay some ground work, and we can reevaluate the merger later. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:17, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

:: OK. At the current rough-draft state, it appeared that these books almost totally overlap -- both talk about Fourier analysis, filtering, and &quot;signals&quot;. But now I see that [[Signals and Systems]] is intended to be a minimum pre-requisite for a bunch of other books, and the other book is about a bunch of related topics that aren't necessary to understand those other books. So breaking up the subject into a short &quot;intro&quot; and a &quot;advanced topics&quot; now makes more sense to me.

:: I've had several classes that just covered the &quot;first half&quot; of a thick, relatively expensive engineering book. Such classes were generally a prerequisite to the few classes that covered the &quot;second half&quot; of that book. (Which led to a lot of student complaining when they bought the Fifth Revision for the first class, and the professor for the second class insists on the Sixth Revision).

:: Why were books were so big that they were clearly marked with a &quot;introduction&quot; half and a &quot;advanced&quot; half (rather printed as 2 smaller books)?
:: Do those reasons apply to Wikibooks?
:: How does transclusion -- in particular, the way a Fourier table can be transcluded into a bunch of books ( [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Engineering_Tables/Fourier_Transform_Table]] ) -- affect things?

:: I see now that [[Signal Processing]] lists [[Signals and Systems]] as a prerequisite. Would it make sense for [[Signals and Systems]] to explicitly list all the books (that you mention above) that it was designed to support? Where's a good place for that list? For the reader, perhaps it would make sense at the end of the book to give hints on how to continue the education. But for the writers, perhaps they should learn up-front that the target audience is people who wanted to read those other books, but were told this was the prerequisite. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:34, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

:::Thanks for the reply! [[Signals and Systems]] contains a partial list of books that it supports at [[Signals_and_Systems/Introduction#Where_to_Go_From_Here]]. Many of those books are also listed at the end in [[Signals and Systems/Resources]], although they are just listed as &quot;resources&quot;, not places to continue reading further. I will add a note about that. Maybe I'll create a category for all books that use [[Signals and Systems]] as a prerequisite. I'll get to work on all this, and report back when i have some results. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:45, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[Reverse Engineering]] ==

Hello David, how are you? I've been thinking a lot about the [[Reverse Engineering]] book, and I think I want to change it up. I've posted some rationale behind the idea at [[Talk:Reverse Engineering]], and I've started up an outline for the split at [[User:Whiteknight/Reverse Engineering]]. 

At the moment, the book just doesnt have any focus, and many of the pages outside of the &quot;core&quot; subject area are short, stubby, etc. What I want to do is split the book into smaller books that are more focused on particular subjects. If we do this, I have high hopes that the book about the x86/C disassembly stuff could easily become a featured book within a month, while the whole of the [[Reverse Engineering]] book might never earn such a distinction because there are too many stub pages and too much missing information (based on the apparent scope of the book as it is now). Plus, the name &quot;Reverse Engineering&quot; is too ambiguous (as has been pointed out by many people on the talk page and other places).

Anyway, I wanted to get your opinion of this idea, if you don't mind. I feel like there are too few people around here who understand that subject matter. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:43, 3 January 2008 (UTC)

David, thank for joining the [[Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?|story about LC oscillations]].

Well then, only give me a few days to develop briefly the idea.
Thank you for the cool analogies and especially for &quot;putting the pedal to the metal&quot;. As regards to integrators, I will give reasons for such a classification in the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?|talk page]].

== Crazy categorizing for Computers &amp; Society ==

Hi!
You said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
„I personally don't create a category unless I know of more than one page that will go into that category. And so I am mystified -- why do you create categories which contain only one page each, such as Category:Learning how to ask questions, Category:Learning how to read stuff, Category:WikiWorld, and Category:Back cover ?“
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I had similar query/comment from  [[User:Mike.lifeguard]]

I am afraid that it was a complete misunderstanding on my part about what categororization in Wikibooks is for.
I mis-read something somewhere that each page chapter had to be categorized...
and so I did just that for each page. Help/advice in cleaning up would be appreciated.

And thanks for commenting and asking. --Михал Орела 12:11, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

: ''(a) It's a redundant link, the table of contents doesn't need 2 links to the same module.'' Please go ahead and remove those redundant links, and state they are redundant in the edit comment.
: ''(b) We don't need a module by that name.'' In that case, please go through the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] first to delete the pages. Later, after the table of comments shows them as redlinks, delete those links and state &quot;deleting redlinks&quot; in the edit comment.
: ''(c) That module really belongs to some other book.'' Rename the module to clarify which book it belongs to. Then use (b) on the redirect page that leaves behind.
: ''(d) The pages have poorly-written content.'' Slap the {{tl|attention}} tag and perhaps the {{tl|expand}} tag on the page. While I love it when people post a finished masterpiece, the [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline]] also encourages people to post poorly-written first drafts and gradually improve it. It's not possible to improve a page that no one ever sees (an [[Wikibooks:Orphan Modules]] or a deleted module), so we should keep those links.

== Operating System History Book ==

I was so underwhelmed with the quality of the operating system book, in its present configuration that I updated the history, to include some information from Tanenbaums Operating Systems Design and Implementation. It's rewritten so it shouldn't break copyright, but it does probably break the patterns of the original authors statements since I put in about a couple of pages of historical information that the original author had ignored. The information probably needs to be reformatted to fit the original purpose, if we want to keep it. I have also reworked his timeline, to favor CP which was a mainframe operating system that was rewritten for minicomputers and became CP/M. As far as I know CP predated MULTICS in the way that MULTICS predated UNIX. Perhaps MULTICS Derivatives would be a better top line for the Unix branch as well. I have juggled things around a bit, if only to stop the screaming of the Linux people who quite rightly suggest that Linux is not Unix. Everything below the POSIX level can be seen to be completely rewritten to exclude Unix copyright. And I moved Mac OSX away from OS9 and into the Unix branch because it was based on the CUBE operating system. I also noted that BASIC was implemented as an operating system. I remember my Commodore 64 with it's Basic Language that included commands like load, and run. I believe the first implementation of this was Stand Alone Basic written for the 4 bit Altair S-100 bus computer by Microsoft. I swapped place between LISP and SMALLTALK because LISP came first, things like that. Anyway, I can see fleshing this book out a bit more if there is any interest in keeping it alive.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 17:49, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

I added a chapter on Network security to Evolution of Operating System Design, but now that I look back on it, I may have mistaken the meaning of the chapter heading. When the original author was talking about Network distribution was he talking about the history of networks and their security problems or about how to distribute CD-Roms via the internet... I chose the first interpretation but on second thought, I could do a simple move, I suppose to a module named...Network Security or something, since I might have made a mistake. How hard is it to change a filename once the file is created? If it is a mistake, then the problem probably came about because he put the distribution file up at the middle of the book instead of putting it down lower where it would make more sense. I mean the last thing you want to do before rewriting your operating system is distribute the current version... I think the guy was overspecifying his modules. For instance the Memory transparency page, doesn't make sense to me, considering he hasn't laid the groundwork for memory systems. Maybe I should lay off adding modules until I understand their purpose better.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 19:47, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

: It's easy to change file names. [[Help:Editing FAQ#Q: How can I easily change the title of a book?]]. I would be happy to do that for you -- just ask.
: Lots of people distribute the &quot;current version&quot; of their software even while making major changes to it. See [[wikipedia: continuous integration]] for a list of some of the more notable projects that do that.
: Are you talking about the &quot;Storage: transparent persistence&quot; module mentioned in the [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs]] ? I suspect that has something to do with [[wiki: TransparentPersistence]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:53, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

OK, now that makes sense. The guy was generating his module names according to high level concepts, that he wanted the modules to cover, more a shopping list, than a framework. I can live with that, but I do not personally work that way. My frameworks always start with a low level concept and build up to a high level concept, they don't usually start with the high level concept. But that is a failure of mine from an OOP programming perspective. Still I suppose I could build the framework within the module. The problem is that the framework might have to extend beyond his point in evolution because evolution of operating systems has proceeded beyond that point. In other words we have the case of an inappropriate module name because it limits the development of the modules to evolve with the operating systems. Since this is to be a living book, probably updated from time to time, as new data comes in, we want a more general statement for the title, and for transparent persistence to be a subheading within the module. Don't mind me running on at the mouth, I am thinking as I write. OK, I think I can take over from here. I just needed a conceptual framework under which to understand the nature of the original authors ideas.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:55, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

: ''&quot;Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.&quot; -[[Wiki: BottomUpProgramming | Alan Perlis]]''
: Yes, this is a living book. As time goes on, we'll probably shuffle the order of the modules many times -- this is easily done by editing the table of contents page: [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs]]. As you said, we'll probably merge small modules into one larger module with a more general name. We'll probably split modules that grow too large into smaller modules with more specific names. We'll probably add entirely new modules about topics in operating systems that we all overlooked before -- perhaps even topics that didn't even exist back in 2010. This is all part of the natural process of growing any Wikibook. Thank you again for taking the initiative to help us write this one. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:44, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

No problem, this (Operating System Design) was part of my areas of study before I began to get into Artificial Consciousness. I noticed that someone caught my error on how many times the data bus width had doubled I dropped it back to 3 and referenced it with an Intel Processor book I had lying around.(I keep getting confused between number and instance values, it's a personal failing). I plan to take lessons from my Artificial Consciousness research and feed them back into operating system design at some point. My section on the Workspace, and Slipnet are actually based on a competing cognitive architecture to my own called IDA which in turn was based on Hoffsteaders CopyCat program. I figure that it is related to Transparent Persistence, and can be built on top of that architecture.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E.

Oh, by the way, I had expressly created the red ink you just fixed by moving the data you linked to, to a new better module name. So what you did by &quot;fixing the red ink&quot; was essentially install two versions of the same data, at two different locations in the same TOC. I guess I should have given you an update about that, but I was too busy putting content into the Storage area and my father is in hospital so I had to take my blind mother over to visit him so I was away from the computer for a while and forgot to give you a heads up. My bad, sorry.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 18:29, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

OK, well, I am stalled for the nonce on the Evolution of Operating Systems Designs book, I promoted the sub-modules out of the HCI Module so that they are easier to work on, but I don't know what the original author meant by Direct Manipulation, unless they are talking about something like direct X,
and the next sub-module is also hazy for me, so I can't expand on it.

At the Module level, the next Original Module is the one about uniformity and Reflection. In my Artificial Consciousness work I have been exposed to Refexivity, but I am not sure that that would translate out to reflection, in operating system design. So I think I have more or less reached the limit of my ability to help on this book.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 16:04, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

: Direct manipulation usually refers to manipulating hardware in some way directly, without using a library's interface. Like directly manipulating a graphic's card to speed up some graphic operation. Someone whose designing an operating system is likely to interface directly with the hardware in order to provide an interface between the hardware, parts of the system and any software that is intended to be designed to be used with the operating system. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:11, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree that many people use the term &quot;direct&quot; to describe applications that directly write to hardware, rather than use a system call ([[Wikipedia: framebuffer]]).
:: However, the people who wrote the [[Wikipedia: direct manipulation interface]] article use the term &quot;direct manipulation&quot; to mean something else entirely.

::: Direct manipulation may be different from a direct manipulation interface, or perhaps a direct manipulation interface may have a more general meaning beyond computers. The [[w:Direct manipulation interface]] article does seem to mention/acknowledge briefly the meaning as I described it as well. The article also has a notice about needing to be improved. I will admit that &quot;direct manipulation&quot; may be a coined term that has no official recognition, even though I happened to recognize the term. &quot;Raw mode&quot; might be ambiguous too. Raw mode can refer to a form of communication over a terminal or port, how files should be read or saved to disk, etc. Other possibilities which might describe the concept include &quot;direct communication&quot;, &quot;direct hardware manipulation&quot;, &quot;direct hardware communication&quot;, &quot;hardware-system interface&quot;, &quot;hardware-system integration&quot;, &quot;hardware-system interaction&quot;, &quot;direct device control&quot;, &quot;raw access control&quot;, &quot;hardware access control&quot;, &quot;device access control&quot;, ... anyways I was just trying to point out what &quot;direct manipulation&quot; is likely to have meant, so that Graeme E. Smith and you could figure out how to move forward.

Hmm... You have a good point there. I will go back and update the sub-module I wrote on Darklama's  recommendation. The problem is that I have been working mostly on the guts of the operating system, and haven't worried about the HCI interface so the terms go over my head. I think that both are HCI issues aren't they? How about ''Direct Access to Hardware'' and ''Direct Manipulation'' sub-modules will that work? I was wondering, has anyone thought about the evolution of the Interprocess Communication? You know, Locks, Semaphores, Mutexes, etc? It is necessary for understanding concurrency.--[[User:Graeme E.

: ''&quot;both are HCI issues aren't they?&quot;'' No. Direct access to hardware is not a HCI issue. If you have one program that directly writes to the hardware (for example, a game designed to run on the Super NES), it's possible to make a program have exactly the same human interface on a computer without ever directly writing to the hardware (for example, that exact same game software running on a [[Super NES Programming/SNES Emulators]]). Therefore, since it makes no difference to the human interfaces, it is not a HCI issue. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:33, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

Hmmm... Let us separate virtualization from direct access to hardware. I was thinking about the issue of the human interface to a movie. If the movie is jerky, it doesn't have a good interface to the the human, whereas if it is smooth, it does. Going through the system call interface, gives the operating system leave to decide if a program should be given time slices or not, which means that it can be delayed while a higher priority task is running.

This is different from the program thinking it is running on bare silicone like when it runs on the super NES versus when it runs on the Super NES Programming/SNES Emulator. The problem then is to determine if the machine is running on the real computer or on a Virtual Machine version, which involves detection of virtualization. A completely different problem with a completely different solution since it often requires that the computer hardware have a command that can't be virtualized in order to detect the state. The former paragraph describes direct access to hardware
while this paragraph describes virtualization.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 14:41, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

: I don't understand.

: When I play a classic game on an emulator, I want the game to have exactly the same human-computer interface as if I was running on the original hardware. Right? I don't want the game to &quot;determine if the machine is running on the real computer or on a Virtual Machine&quot;. I want it to appear to run smoothly either way -- I agree that smooth is good. I don't want the game to have &quot;detection of virtualization&quot;.  When I play a classic game on new hardware, the new hardware does not &quot;require ... a comand that can't be virtualized&quot;, and the old software does not need &quot;to detect the state&quot;. Right? Or am I missing something important about emulators? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:56, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

The latter I am afraid. Virtualization is about making the software think it is running on bare silicon when it really isn't. To do that you actually have to intercept the machine language commands, and monitor them to see if the software is going to try to work outside the virtual memory page, and if so, trick it into thinking that the new page you add to its memory framework is the page it wanted to deal with, not a copy, possibly addressed in a different location in memory. Ideally you do this super quick, and only have a quick test to make sure a command is not out of range, and then do the machine language on the real silicon, but that quick check slows down the machines effective speed, and in doing so, you can desynchronize something like a movie player. Ideally if you want to work on the bare silicon, you have to detect that you are running on an emulator, and dig down below the emulator to the real silicon below it. This is especially true if you want a secure operating system, the first kernel must load on bare silicon, or a phishing site could be running below it. If your virtualization kernel is not running on bare silicon and the only way to tell is to test a command that can't be virtualized without breaking it, Then you might have a virtual machine being virtualized. Emulation is not really possible on the same speed machine as it is trying to emulate if only because of the overhead for virtualization. However when you run an emulator for a slower machine, the difference in speed can be hidden by timing the virtual commands so they take up exactly the same amount of time as the original. Then it is a true emulator. Mostly when you run a gamebox emulator on a computer what you are running is a slower system on a faster general computer the emulator has to overcome the overhead of translations between the two machine languages as well as the virtualization interface. However there is no reason why you can't run a Windows system on a windows system, or a Linux system on a linux system, the main requirement seems to be either a software virtualization kernel, or a special hardware cpu designed for virtualization. One example of this is XEN which I have successfully managed to run 5 versions of RedHat Enterprise Linux 4.5 on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 platform with an XEN Virtualization kernel. I was able to successfully prove that this package was incompatible with most Cluster Software making the virtual cluster implementation annoyingly useless. Each virtual processor ran at nearly full speed, unless there were other virtual processors working, in which case they timeshared the processing and all slowed down. While I didn't do the tests such systems tend to be 80% efficient or less. the 20% loss in efficiency can be directly linked to the fact that the programs are being virtualized.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 23:28, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

: Some CPUs meet the [[Wikipedia: Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]].
: Is it really true that &quot;you have to detect that you are running on an emulator, and dig down below the emulator to the real silicon below it&quot;? Because that is impossible on a CPU that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

:: Only if you want a secure operating system or to work on bare silicon. The problem with running a virtualization interface on a virtualization interface, is that, the root virtualization interface can choose to overcome the secondary virtualization interfaces security appliances, without the second virtualization being aware of it. This is OK, if you are the guy in control of the more secure primary virtualization interface, but if someone slips you a ringer, and puts their own virtualization interface underneath yours, you are the person being unaware that your security is being breached. Which is why you really do want at least one atomic instruction that can't be virtualized.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:37, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

: Is &quot;the only way to tell is to test a command that can't be virtualized without breaking it&quot;? Because no such comand exists on a CPU that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.
: Any task that &quot;requires that the computer hardware have a command that can't be virtualized in order to detect the state&quot; can't be done on a CPU that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

But I hope you forgive me for wondering if perhaps I don't really need to have X, since my hardware seems to me to be adequate, and then asking what benefits (if any) do I get from X.

::It depends on whether you are in a secure network, and are unlikely to have friends that like to play with your mind. I am not telling you that you have to do anything, I am telling you the facts of life about virtualization. If you don't mind someone running a phishing site right under your nose or using your interface with the network to run a child porn ring, then there is no problem with using a processor that follows a standard that has few if any commands that can detect the presence of a virtualization interface. On the other hand, one of the reasons why the industry is going to HARDWARE virtualization is that they can embed the security appliances into the hardware and not have to worry about double virtualization layers. If every virtualized process is running using the same hardware security appliances, then there is no second level of virtualization even if you are running two virtualization programs one on top of another. Just be sure that you got the hardware security appliance along with the hardware virtualization, and you are golden.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E.

Actually now you have it, Direct access to hardware is all about performance degradation. Whether you are talking about a movie interface, or Virtualization, it is the performance degradation that makes it necessary for some programs usually related to graphics to dig down to silicon. Since the performance degradation impacts the Computer Human Interface, it is a HCI issue. Whether you are playing an old game on a new computer, or worrying about the security of a trusted system, it is the performance degradation that is the factor that makes it an HCI issue. What I had tried to explain was that it wasn't whether the computer was new or not, but the relative speed of the hardware and consistency in action of the software, versus the cost of emulation that determined whether there would be degradation, you assumed that I was talking about the relative trustworthiness of the computer. I answered the questions you put, sorry if you read more into it, than I put there.

As for the Hardware Security Appliance, I was talking generically about a design process that is ongoing, not trying to push a particular device. I have no doubt that hardware security appliances are controversial. Especially specific Hardware Security Devices that may or may not have some specific vulnerability, or could be software emulated indetectably because there is no way to tell if the machine is running a Virtualization of the device without being able to tell when you are down on bare silicon. It is like your game emulator, one of the things it does is implement a virtual version of the Graphics System of your old game machine on the completely different graphics card in your new machine. To do so, it might have to directly control the graphics card to be able to do timely emulation of complex graphics capabilities in the original game system.
Now, suppose your grandson, wants to play your old Tetris game in his new super-super-blapunkt stereo-video entertainment system. His superNES emulator, might have to go through two steps of virtualization instead of one, where it first converts the emulator to say IBM PC, and then converts the IBM PC to Super-Super-Blapunkt. Depending on whether the speed of the machine has increased significantly, and who knows how powerful an entertainment system would be compared to an equivalent computer, the game might run extremely slowly, and your grandson would be annoyed at grandpas stupid game, when really the problem is that the game is being emulated multiple times in order to convert from its original architecture to the new stereo-video entertainment unit.

: ''&quot;I was talking generically about a design process that is ongoing, not trying to push a particular device.&quot;''
: I was under the impression that the particular device I mentioned -- as described in the [[Wikipedia: Trusted Computing]] article -- was the only one. Is there any other hardware security device(s) that I have overlooked?

: ''&quot;Especially specific Hardware Security Devices that ... could be software emulated indetectably&quot;''
: Is there any other kind? There are ways the user can figure out if a piece of software is running on top of an emulator, but -- as far as I know -- it's not possible for the software itself (without the cooperation of the user or the emulator) to tell the difference between &quot;running on bare silicon&quot; vs. &quot;running on an emulator which is running on a completely different kind of CPU&quot;.

: ''&quot;emulated multiple times&quot;'' -- I agree that when there are multiple layers of emulators, each layer sacrifices some performance when the game executes a &quot;privileged instruction&quot;. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 00:53, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

All a privelidged instruction that can't be emulated without detection offers, is a way of telling whether or not emulation is running. Essentially it is an instruction that takes a specific amount of time to execute, so the emulator would have to falsify the time-clock in order to  emulate it, and that is a significant amount of software emulation of a hardware facility. Think of Hardware as fossilized software, There is nothing that hardware can do that can't be done by software, except that software emulation takes longer, often because more software is needed to emulate the hardware and because the hardware can be running in parallel to the software. Given enough parallelism in the software environment this advantage would eventually disappear. But today it is still possible to tell whether or not an emulator is running by testing a command that takes a known amount of time to run. Set the clock run the command, and sample the clock, against a known value and you know if you are running an emulation or not. The reason is simple to do that process in an emulation you have to escape out of the emulation between setting the clock, and triggering the command, and that takes a detectable period of time. It is just a split second, but it is detectable. Whether that is important to you again depends on how public your humiliation is going to be if someone sticks an emulator under your normal operating environment that bypasses your security appliances. Right now the hardware guys are madly trying to figure out how to develop a security appliance that can't be emulated, and the software guys are emulating everything that the hardware guys come up with, and may the best design team win.--[[User:Graeme E.

== Initialization Page on Operating System Design ==

I took a look at the Operating System Design book, and noticed that Initialization was still red-inked. I took the liberty of fleshing it out a bit since it is a level of software I am fairly familiar with. You might want to check other sources for Plug and play and Hot Socketing however as I am not sure how accurate those entries are.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E.

== Table of Fourier transforms ==
I noticed your response to Taku's comment in the reading room, and thought I would specifically make some comments about the table directly.  I did a lot of work at some point in the past finding references and cleaning up the Fourier transform tables at [[w:Fourier transform#Tables of important Fourier transforms]], which is a bit more extensive then we have here.  Would you like to see any of that material appear here, (using our existing notational convention of course)?  On a separate note, to what extent is including the references interesting to a wikibooks projects? And should the references appear on the page with the table itself since the tables are transcluded?  Anyways thought you might be interested. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:25, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

: Yes, please do. Improving the Wikibooks tables would be great.
: References are good -- they make it obvious to the casual reader that we are following [[WB:NOR]] policy.
: I don't know what is the best way to display references, so just stick them in there in whatever way you find easiest -- on the same page as the table, I guess.
: If anyone complains, tell that person &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{[[template:sofixit|sofixit]]}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and let that person pretty up how those references are displayed. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:45, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

== non-terminal ==
Not opposing the change. They have equal value, but since there are also terminal symbols having (non-terminal) expressed seemed more readable. Basically hyphens are meant to aid comprehension.&lt;br&gt;
From Wikipedia: ''British English tends towards hyphenation (pre-school) whereas American English tends towards omission of the hyphen (preschool). ([[w:English compound]], [[w:Hyphen]] ).&lt;br&gt;
This seems to be a common practice on more technical books (the use of the hyphen). I've been thinking on adopting this as  convention on the books I'm working (so to provide consistency). Do you have one opinion on this subject in general ? Am I getting something wrong ?

(did a search on google also &quot;convention of hyphen of words technical&quot;: [http://books.google.pt/books?id=8n-GDx3cGHMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=convention+of+hyphen+of+words+technical&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0gzEdCuAAM&amp;sig=Szx1W4pMfaiLdEEAhd_g0ZH7wQo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d6N_SqyfBqbKjAfC_ujwAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 1] this one resumes my views on the issue)

As I'm not a natural English speaker I have less reasons to defend a particular view point over the other but without the hyphen words like &quot;microorganism&quot; or &quot;antiimmigration&quot; seem weird.

== Linux categories ==

I know there's a tendency to want to have one's book show up everywhere to get the most hits, but the categories are keeping a narrow scope.  Books in Linux should actually be on Linux or categories become diluted.  As an example, say there's a program that runs on Windows, is written in C++, and is software for a business.  Books in [[:Category:Windows]] are covering the Windows operating system.  Books in [[:Category:C++ programming language]] are covering the language.  This hypothetical book being used as an example would be a best fit for [[:Category:Business software]].  

Imagine, if you will, how many categories [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] would show up in if categories were assigned based on a single chapter rather than the topic of the book as a whole.  There's also been a tendency by some to want to put their books in high-level categories instead of low-level categories for greater visibility as opposed to fine-grained categorization.  You have to consider our 3,000+ books.  If every book's authors wanted their book to be present in one of five top-level categories, you'd have an average of 600 books in each top-level category.  And if every book were put in five categories, four of which were not directly related, I hope you can see how this would become overwhelming to the person browsing.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:08, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

: I agree that putting hundreds of books in a high-level category can overwhelm our users. If someone is looking for some high-level overview of, say, operating systems in general, he's not going to want a book that focuses on one small facet of programming one particular OS. The solution to that problem is to edit those books to use a more specific, lower-level category instead of a high-level category.

: On the other hand, occasionally someone *is* interested in the highly specialized topic of writing programs for one particular OS. I know someone familiar with programming on some other OS, but today he wants to write GUI programs to run on Linux. How can I help my friend find information on programming on Linux?

: Would a &quot;Linux programming&quot; category help that person? (Currently we don't have any &quot;subject category&quot; sub-categories under the Linux category).

: ''Books in Linux should actually be on Linux''
: Each of the 8 books I tagged yesterday with the &quot;Linux&quot; category has a module &quot;on Linux&quot;. For example, if the module [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Linux]] is not on Linux, then what is it on? Those modules are closer to that category than any other category I've seen.

: I agree that hundreds of books in a narrow, specialized &quot;bottom-level&quot; topic would be just as overwhelming to our users as hundreds of books in a high-level category. But I don't see how it is possible to have hundreds of books, each of which have a chapter on the same &quot;bottom-level&quot; topic, given the number of people here who support our (draft) [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 23:46, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

: Sorry to intrude but since I gave this issue a thought when I gave it a shoot on working on categories and subjects I think this view had some strengths.
: Categories and Subjects shouldn't promote books but themselves (this will increase visibility to all books), this means that a book should only have a 2 categories displayed (adding subjects will only confuse things as they run very parallel due to the purpose they were created).
:Subjects were added to pass the categories namespace and the recent substitution to the bookshelves did give the subject namespace a purpose, having said that by having the cover page (the entry point of a book) using only that book category and the one that closely relates to the subject covered should be enough, all other relations to any other categories should be placed on the book category page, this will only require that anyone interested performs a click in any of the book's pages to be shown all the interconnections (not only the cover page as it is now).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:06, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
:Well the cover page should have a subject (related to the scope) and the book category on the &quot;cover&quot; but there aren't yet subject pages for all books. Maybe a mixed approach but that will be harder to maintain consistent.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:21, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

:: Thank you for jumping in. Tagging the book's &quot;book category&quot; page with other related &quot;subject categories&quot; sounds much better than the way I was doing it, tagging the book's &quot;cover page&quot; with those categories.

:: I'm still confused about &quot;subjects&quot; and I don't understand why they are different from &quot;categories&quot;. Do either of you (or any other gentle reader) know of any pages that give more detail than [[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]] ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 02:06, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

::: Well, since I was largely responsible for writing the page you've linked to, I can try to elaborate further on details you need more information on.  In all actuality, subjects and categories which I've termed &quot;subject categories&quot; will not be different at all from one another.  Subjects serve to display books in a friendly manner without categories holding a book's pages getting in the way.  I'm perfectly content to browse by category, but others besides myself felt subject pages were needed to enhance the book browsing process.  Subject pages can also be styled any way you want, while category listings' appearance is largely governed by the software.  

:::A much simpler system could likely be implemented were the software designed with subpages in mind from the start (rather than it being kludged in later).  I don't know that the six systems in place (categories, alphabetical, Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress, subjects, and bookshelves) help in avoiding confusion for readers.  I do know they increase administrative overhead categorizing from personal experience.

:::Hopefully I clarified subjects compared to categories.  I knew of other pages with more information on the subject, but those were whittled down for conciseness and to keep things simple.  That probably led to my being asked to write the above page, as others needed help understanding the nuances of the system, which I had to try to get a hold of myself when I first went through trying to clean things up. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

:::(edit conflict)
::: For what I understand of the history (of why we have now a subject namespace), was because the categories was so messed up (at least that was the first justification for the new namespace), the person to talk about the real rational would probably be WitheKnight, he made the announcement at the time and was the first one to attempt to make something of the new namespace.
::: I don't see having the two as problematic as we now have found some very distinct (even if related) functions for them. The tow pound gorilla in the room at the moment (and one that I warned [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] at the time) is that there aren't any guidelines approved that can establish a stable and functional structure to the use we are giving them. I know that you are aware of some of my objections to the issue of booknames and this is very closely related to how  categories and subject are intertwined. One can safely state (based on the present uses) that without books there would not be subjects but categories would exist in any of the Wikimedia projects.
::: I'm very afraid that without constant argumentation/control/protection from those working on those structures all the work that has been put on them would quickly become undone at least this has happened always to any previous attempts to provide structure to them. This is why as soon I understood that [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] was putting such a great effort on the categories, I warned that it was being done in a vacuum and there is a real possibility of losing it all as soon as [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] losses interest or just becomes absent from the project.
::: To begin solving this issue I see an extreme need on Wikibooks to create a simple guideline that defines ans separates namespaces since we don't have one. We need to clearly state what the different existing namespaces are for not only for future uses but as a clear statement of the community vision for them.
:::#Clearly define the functions of Template, Help, Category, Subject and any other we see as relevant to define.

:::#Clearly state how new namespace can be created the steps to get them. This would resolve the lingering issue about the use of : on project names and explain why Cookbook and the other more self contained projects exit, the normal Wikibookian isn't aware of all this.
:::After those steps to define what they are, the next is to implement, probably in the same guideline (if not to verbose and if people easily reach a consensus), a definition on how to use the namespaces and provide a greater level of consistency on the type information they display and even in some cases how it is structured.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:20, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

::::Categories on a book's category are supposed to mirror those on the book's main page, so the main page and the category containing ''all'' the pages appear in the same places.  Adding categories to a book's main page causes it to appear in more categories, while you can add categories to a book's category all day long and it won't change any subject pages at all.  My comments above still apply whether we're talking about the main page or the main category.  In fact, if you add a category to a main page I expect it to be added to the category and vice versa.  Whether a specific category is correct for a book in general is unfortunately something that is subjective and best evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Having the main page of a book only link only to its own category and one subject (this would involve completing the list of all missing subjects) makes the sporadic editor think twice in adding more categories to that page. This would make maintaining a consistent category system only an issue on categories pages, much easier and step away from the books (if a user needs that information, he would only need to click on that book category on any page of that book, personally I never click on other categories besides the book category or template, I use the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:CategoryTree?target=Wikibooks&amp;mode=categories&amp;dotree=Visualization category navigation page] something that is somewhat hidden from the user).

I take severe issue with those simplifications.  It is not the direction the system was evolving in and I went through a great deal of trouble to ensure a book's category had the same categories as a book's main page when reorganizing.  There were many books with the book category in one place but the book's main page in another.  I also removed overcategorization from main pages so nearly all books now reflect the one subject and book category scheme.  Adding categories to a book's category won't change the display of what books are on what subject pages because the subject pages look at the categories on the book's main page and ignore a book's category.  It would indeed change the way books are displayed on the page you linked to above, but that is hidden from users and so lacks effect.  It would also make the category tree inconsistent with the subject tree and force debate over which of several categories (maybe all of which are relevant) gets top billing as the only one allowed on a book's main page and the only one allowed to affect its position within the subjects.

And subject page categorization must be maintained else the subject pages don't work.  The sub-subjects are based on the subjects in a particular sub-category.  You remove the categories from the subjects and suddenly none of the subjects link to each other in a dynamic fashion.  You say they should only have other subjects added.  Well, that is currently the case.  The categories they have reflect the parent subjects they are part of.  This brings me full circle back to my comment to DavidCary that subjects and 'subject categories' are not much different from one another.  In fact, subjects are inextricably linked to categories because of the way they are dynamically generated using them. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:24, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

:I understand that you have put much work into this (more than anyone else before), and I'm not pushing for a change, but as I said before you started, not all views were in agreement. I could also have made a similar claim when you started implementing those changes, as I was the last one to tackle the issue. If you are putting your hopes on the argument that things are now as they should, then it was all for not, it hasn't historically been successful, it has indeed created stronger objections and people willing to commit to the tasks of restructuring.
:The system has not been evolving into any particular direction, Whiteknight took a shot next Darklama made some headway and then I did some work (this is a bit of oversimplification and I can't include bots as I don't monitor those changes).
:We do agree in things more than we disagree. We seem to agree in preferring one subject and the book category in the title page, all subpages part of that book category, dislike overcategorization and like the subject namespeace structure to mirror the categories, these are the most important points.
:But those points aren't affected by the differences of implementation I defend and those would resolve having book title pages outside of those book category pages, for no particular purpose, since it is duplicating the subject function. It would also remove the need of having subject shown inside categories mixed with book titles. It would permit to link subject with other subjects as they should.
:The likes and dislikes aren't incompatible at all, and there are several ways of going about it. I pertinently  stated in the start of your changes, that we should write this stuff down and agree on it first (before a large scale undertaking). The more time it takes to define the community opinion on the subject the less opportunity will there be for compromises and less secure will be the work you have put into it and without a guideline as soon as you relent your attention on the subject chaos will rain once more, and the cycle will begin again.
:In any case you now have my opinion. [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] also raised some questions and I remember Darklama also not fully committing to all of the decisions. These are only the top points, we can then go down into the details of case, plural versus singular, etc...

I see some structural problems with the book as it is conceived of now. By making coding a prerequisite you eliminate some of the explicatory power of definitions, and imply that coding is going to be the major element that makes tighter storage possible. What I would do, if you allow me, is to split the page up into chapters, one of which would explain the relationship between coding and symbolic content showing how different codings of the same data, can result in more or less storage even though the content remains the same.

Another chapter would explore the necessity for a model, perhaps taking statistical modelling as an example and showing how different statistical modelling techniques allow for different storage sizes.

Another chapter might explore the Library/Dictionary coding schemes, and how common content can be used to reduce the size of storage, inflating the size of the program rather than the compressed file.

Another chapter might explore the Order/Entropy aspect, and how compression increases the Entropy of the file at the expense of order, while imposing order on the interpretation of the file, and thus why compression is not necessarily a good form of encryption. This chapter could also deal with order injection, and Entropy Injection as ways of extending compressability.

Another chapter might explore the Assymetric nature of compression, where extended processing during compression might result in smaller files, that are quickly and easily recovered.

Another chapter might explore Lossy versus Non-Lossy compression using the example of the JPEG and how fractals make it possible to compress the relatively large graphics data file into a variable compression scheme capable of much smaller files than data content suggests.

I actually did some work on an inference compression scheme some years back, but abandoned the project when my coding ability came up against the limitations of the programming language I was programming the project in, and no one offered me any help debugging a particularly buggy section of code. I have since decided that I am not a professional programmer, and therefore should not attempt coding that is too complex.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:58, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

: Some people believe that even expert programmers &quot;should not attempt coding that is too complex&quot;. ''Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. --Brian Kernighan''
: I'm thinking about adding source code to this book. I'm hoping that with enough eyeballs looking at this Wikibook, that bugs in the code I write will be quickly spotted and fixed. (Or should I be posting that compression algorithm source code at the [http://algorithmist.com/ Algorithmist wiki] ?)
: I don't think I'd mind if a couple of the algorithms in the book are things someone made up one day -- the [[Wikipedia: Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day]] apparently does not apply to Wikibooks, especially to the sort of &quot;self-verifying&quot; statements that we have in mathematical proofs and computer source code.
: Feel free to slip in some a little extremely experimental and somewhat buggy compression code. Perhaps someone might help debug it; and in the worst case someone will decide it doesn't help our readers and simply delete it.
: Also, I hope that people edit my source code such that it is extremely easy to read. Such code often *appears* simple or even [http://alistair.cockburn.us/Screechingly+obvious+code &quot;screechingly obvious code&quot;].
: As I said before, please go ahead and split it up and extend it. Do whatever you think will make this a better book. If I tried to tell you &quot;don't touch it!&quot;, then the book would end up worse. I -- and the people who wrote [[Wikibooks:Ownership]] -- think the same is true of every book at Wikibooks.

OK, I added a Contents section and gave it about 5 chapters, each one with a blurb describing the type of compression scheme I was suggesting in that chapter, take a look at it, and tell me what you think, any screamingly obvious errors and such like.

I finally got around to folding the first page back into the chapters in the contents list, so you might want to take a new look at it especially since I am not sure that I should have put some of the data into the chapters I did, because of a sort of incongruency between the chapters and the data on the front page. For instance I left auditory compression to last, because I wasn't really shure where to put it.

== How to Write a Program ==

Hi DavidCary!

Thanks for you Wikibooks contributions.

In any case, you've assigned [[How to Write a Program]] as a prerequisite for [[Optimizing Code for Speed]], the latter of which I have originated. However, on the &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; talk-page, I've said that I've been feeling that its style was horrible, and that it mentioned only several private resources (e.g: Google, Freshmeat.net, etc.), and not some other prominent alternatives, and was also too opinionated and/or fatalist. I'd like to change it and remedy it, but not sure I've got a green light for that. Please reply here and/or on that page.

== Further reading... ==
Hi David.&lt;br&gt; 
Noticed that you added a further reading to [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions]], I think I had already talked to you about the issues of adding those sections, they can be useful but if unwatched and unverified they can serve to dump clutter on what is not a self contained article about a subject (like a Wikipedia article) but a page of a book.&lt;br&gt;
Adding a '''Further reading''' will also increase a sense of &quot;things that are still not covered&quot; we in the book have adopted the TODO box for pending work but in this case the coverage seems satisfactory (the page has been stable for some time).
I also don't know if you browsed the information that is already present on that page, at least from my part it was an attempt to keep it NPOV (my personal preferences are [[User:Panic2k4/Sandbox/TiC|here]]), and it aims to aggregate all the different rationals behind the available choices (that is why only the historical styles are present on the Web links) anything else should/could be &quot;adopted&quot; in.&lt;br&gt;
Regarding these 2 new links, the first is a collection of Style Conventions (some are C only so a better way to integrate it is  to expand the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Weblinks#C.2B.2B_Coding_Conventions Weblinks#C++ Coding Conventions] list (it already has the top 3 styles) with only the relevant links and/or &quot;import&quot; (without directly coping it) some of the useful sections.  Note that the text already points to that list &quot;A list of different approaches can be found on the C++ coding conventions Reference Section.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The second link is more problematic since it specifically attempts to deal with one single issue, security. This is something that hasn't yet have a specific section on the book (even if I and others, have attempted to place notes where relevant) it can probably be converted into the content in that way or just added to the above list also (with the note that it is problem specific and as stated on the PDF as one of its objectives &quot;a C++ subset suitable for use in critical 
systems&quot; it doesn't really conform to &quot;normal&quot; use (I had already known of the paper and browsed over it sometime ago) it usefulness (to the book) it a bit debatable in that section.&lt;br&gt;
In any case if I hadn't, I'll ask you to continue to add useful information but integrating it with the book text where pertinent, verify and use the correct subset of the linked information, you can also add you finds and rational about what is missing on the content discussion page and I (or others) will deal with it, if you aren't interested in doing more. If you agree (even if only partially) that those sections shouldn't really be added to book pages, create a post on the [[Talk:C++ Programming/Content]] were we can both reduce, the first url list, see if all references are already covered, came to a positive outcome if or what of the second url information can be &quot;adopted&quot; into the book.&lt;br&gt;
PS:The second link is somewhat broken, the pdf ( http://www.misra-cpp.org/downloads/SCSC-Tapp.pdf ) or at least I'm thinking that this is the conventions you found interesting.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:12, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

: OK, I did what you suggested -- I moved those two items to the [[C++ Programming/Weblinks#C++ Coding Conventions]] section. I agree that's a better place for those external links.
: I certainly agree that writing code with memory leaks and buffer overflow bugs and undefined behavior is all too often the &quot;normal&quot; use of C++.
: However, I think the readers of this Wikibook would benefit from knowing where to learn more about techniques that reduce the number of such bugs in software, just like the readers of this Wikibook benefit from knowing a little about techniques used in [[C++ Programming/Software Internationalization | internationalization]], even if they &quot;normally&quot; don't bother with the extra hassle of using those techniques.
: p.s.: I think you were just seeing a temporary glitch.
: Would you mind going to [[C++ Programming/Weblinks#C++ Coding Conventions]], clicking on the MISRA link, then choose &quot;Resources&quot; and then &quot;Introduction to MISRA C++:2008&quot;. That seems to load the &quot;SCSC-Tapp.pdf&quot; document on my end -- or am I just seeing a stale cache? Is it still broken when you try it?

::Thanks. Going by you script it goes there but a user will probably not fallow that sequence, it will see the blinking line and click there if persistent enough. In any case I've reexamined the information available there, it doesn't really cover C++ but a subset of the language and the information consists in 2 small paragraphs, and I think the goto information is already present on our book. I'll put on my todo to try to examine the links one by one and see if the content can be made redundant by covering it locally.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:04, 15 February 2010 (UTC)

::: I don't understand. The module [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators]], like pretty much every individual page in the C++ book, doesn't really cover C++ but a subset of the language.
::: I agree that the &quot;SCSC-Tapp.pdf&quot; doesn't say much that isn't already in the wikibook, so I don't understand why you brought it up. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:55, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

::::I thought that your second link was because of the content of that PDF, if so it states that the conventions about security it promotes are only valid on a subset of the language (I don't clearly understand what they mean by that and I suppose that it is because it only cover a set of instructions not all the standard, as they only provide 2 paragraphs of instructions). It is a bit hard to compare a link to a work to a single page of a work like you did, its oranges and apples. Going to the absurd to better pass what I was attempting to say, it would be like adding links to newsgroups posts that provided any useful info, I don't think we should promote that, not on the book (it is welcomed to point it on the content discussion page if relevant).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:59, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

::::: By &quot;subset of the language&quot;, they mean that when a programmer writes code that follows all those guidelines, that code can be complied on any standard ANSI C++ compiler.
::::: It's a way of clarifying that &quot;code written in MISRA C++&quot; means &quot;code written in C++ that follows all the guidelines from MISRA; code that you can compile with any ANSI C++ compiler&quot;; and not &quot;code written in a language that is similar to ANSI C++, but it can only be compiled using some crazy expensive compiler from one particular company&quot;.

::::: I wish MISRA allowed me to show the readers of this book the complete &quot;MISRA Guidelines for the use of the C++ language in critical systems&quot; document.
::::: The closest I've found so far is the link I posted to the main page of &quot;the MISRA C++ website&quot;. (That website also happens to include the &quot;SCSC-Tapp.pdf&quot; file. The &quot;SCSC-Tapp.pdf&quot; document covers 2 or 3 out of over 100 MISRA recommendations in the complete &quot;MISRA Guidelines for the use of the C++ language in critical systems&quot; document.)

::::: Let me try to compare apples to apples:
::::: I think it would help the readers of the C++ Wikibook to know that the Unicode Consortium exists and has a standard code for information interchange, even if the Wikibook doesn't list any particular numeric values of that code. I don't think leaving out every one those numeric values makes the C++ wikibook &quot;incomplete&quot;, althought not mentioning Unicode at all would make it incomplete.
::::: Likewise, I think it would help the readers of the C++ Wikibook to know that MISRA exists and has guidelines for programmers working on safety critical systems, even if the Wikibook doesn't list any of those guidelines. I don't think leaving out every one of those particular guidelines makes the C++ wikibook &quot;incomplete&quot;, although not mentioning MISRA at all would make it incomplete.

::::: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 06:06, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::As an introduction I must inform that I'm also the person removing all mentions of unmanaged C++ as a language on Wikipedia. :) So I hope you appreciate my point of view... 
::::::I agree with your interpretation of subset, but not to the complete rational you make above (even if I understand your meaning in reality ANSI C++ never existed, a C++ language committee was formed but never concluded to formalize it under the ANSI, [[w:ANSI C|ANSI C]] did) we have ISO C++ (or the standard C++ language, or simply C++), so a thing is C++ or a subset of C++ but portability (I think that was you reference to ANSI C++) is another issue and deals with stuff that isn't defined on the standard. I don't believe that they intended to make that the distinction. Why do they make a point of calling their instructions as based on a subset of C++ (what implications/limitations are they attempting to convey), they could just state that it covers the standard C++ language. I got a bit of an inkling that they seem to be attempting to use their guide/standards as a certification base as they make a point of writing MISRA C++ in almost every instance that simply indicating C++ would have sufficed. As certifications are often more about creating revenue than producing added value or open standards it didn't convince me...
::::::[Addendum] I saw this at the Lambda the Ultimate blog and thought it relates to the intent/meaning about the subset. [http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3830 Joe-E: A Security-Oriented Subset of Java] &quot;...Joe-E, a language designed to support the development of secure software systems. Joe-E is a subset of Java that makes it easier to architect and implement programs with strong security properties that can be checked during a security review.&quot; if this is close to the meaning that the MISRA is promoting, it means that it doesn't relate to C++ but to the use of a subset that is closer to a new language (C++ with restrictions)... 
::::::Is the MISRA Guidelines for the use of the C++ language in critical systems publicly available ? I got the PDF you linked a year+ ago IIRC but thought it was very &quot;low&quot; in content and that was why (besides the need to navigate the site), I don't see it as a benefit for readers (we could indeed add/plan a section about security and critical system for the book and then integrate MISRA and similar organizations on the text).
::::::As for the Unicode and character encoding schemes in general, it was my intention to cover that, it features on the editor's list of things to do.
::::::There is still more important things missing, the STL has yet many content missing (I had already got permission from the http://www.cppreference.com/ to use their content before they relicensed it for compatibility) but I have reduced my content contributions to Wikibooks in general since I've keep my attention more on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#User:Indiaebooks|politics of the project]] ([[User_talk:Swift#Noticed this page today Wikibooks:Reading room.2FUser:Panic2k4|not by preference but necessity]]). I think in general things in the Wikibooks project are getting better, consensus has been taking an higher impact on decisions, people are demonstrating more respect for the opinion of others, the Be Bold was approved, books can now be created to cover the same topic from distinct perspectives (there are two other great books on C++, the &quot;optimization&quot; and the &quot;more idioms&quot;) and users seem to be more aware of licensing issues and problems of ownership, all this have been huge improvements from the situation we had before.
::::::After the debacle of the TOCs the book lost a lot momentum, even the sporadic contributions have dropped, probably because the current situation makes navigating the book harder and in general puts people off. The request for restoration is still pending, with time I hope things will be put on the original locations, the cover/entry page is already unlocked and I've been slowly organizing the pages, some of the content deleted is still missing and people have complained about the missing low level introductory content, the language comparison section needs to be rewritten and reformatted, there is still a lot to do. More important the chapters still need to be renamed since the names they have were a result of a compromise, not my first option, so until that is done adding new sections/pages is a bit tricky since a move would be needed later on.
::::::Recently I've been attempting to provide a bridge to [[v:C++|Wikiversity C++]] (take a look if you haven't) to the exercises already present on the book and interweave them with the chapters to provide a end of chapter exercise section.

*reset of indentation

I would put the limit on what constitutes a subset of a language to the level of complexity of the adopted limitations. Today I reread part of our last discussion on [[Talk:C++ Programming/Content]] regarding C style and C++ style, this is more or less the same issue if the excluded section of the language is computationally significant it becomes a subset (I like this last definition).&lt;br&gt;
As for the format of the book, as an Editor I prefer the monolithic but after many requests to split it into subsections and due to the size of the content (IIRC the books is the second biggest work on Wikibooks), subsections and modularity became a necessity and useful since the C++ language can't be really understood linearly since there are too many interconnections.&lt;br&gt;
Regarding security yes you misunderstood me (or I wasn't clear) but &quot;I and others, have attempted to place notes where relevant&quot; seems clear. Security is a concern I share with you but wouldn't like to exclude including insecure alternatives from the content, since security considerations often depends on the requirements and objectives. Security may not always be a goal or a primary consideration...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:10, 22 March 2010 (UTC)

The example used my be unnecessarily confusing. &quot;For instance a compression scheme that assumes capital letters are common, will probably not deal well with a list of URLs. &quot; It implies a supposition from the reader that letter case is relevant (it may be or not) and erodes the notion that URLs are by default case insensitive.

::Changing of examples is hard, I did attempt to came up with a good example and failed, your last change is a bit more complex but resolves the issue. 
::I don't particularly like glossary pages on a Wikibook (they are just impossible to maintain in the context of multiple editors), those pages have some usefulness on paper books (especially if the works cover extremely technical details and introduces a lot of new concepts, generally new or new to he reader, depending on the scope). Do you remember the last time you looked into a glossary page ? Myself I rarely do. I prefer an index that points to the locations where a specific topic is covered and of course a list of acronyms is at times also extensively useful. My view is that the glossary if needed should be the last stage of a usable book, on Wikibooks we can use Wikipedia links extensively (or when introducing the concept), in &quot;my&quot; books I attempt to fallow this practice at a later stage this can, if needed, be used to create the the glossary section.
::The problem with illustrations is that Wikipedia still seems not to use Commons to host most of the images, like we do. From time to time I do some searches on commons to find usable items, for example I got a lot of images for the [[Hypnosis]] work but more technical projects have limited options and coming up with good illustrations is hard, I have done some myself for the [[C++ Programming]] book...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:17, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

== OpenSSH / SSH ==

It would make sense to have only one book on SSH but OpenSSH is nearly a complete book of publishable length and the SSH wikibook is two very sparse pages.  So if there is any merging to do it would make sense to use the OpenSSH book as the base and add material from Tectia or whatever the competitor is now called.  Who knows but most of the material might be applicable as-is for more than one implementation of SSH.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Collections/OpenSSH

: You have convinced me. [[Talk:OpenSSH#merge]] is probably the best place for any further discussion of this merge. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 08:55, 12 August 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Introduction to Philosophy]]

A good definition for Political Philosophy is found only after determining what is politics,  which is a sticky question to begin with.  Politics could be defined as &quot;the question of how to distribute a scarce amount of resources 'justly.'&quot;  Which is, essentially, the way in which people obtain, keep, and exercise power.  Political philosophy, then, is the study of the theories behind politics.  These theories may be used to gain power or to justify its existence.

Mostly, however, they have been used to justify or legitimate the existence of contemporary political structures by appealing to &quot;rationality,&quot; &quot;reason,&quot; or, among others, &quot;natural law.&quot;

Plato's ''Republic'' is a good starting point for political philosophy, however, it's really a treatise on education.  It starts out by trying to define Justice (one of Kenneth Burke's &quot;God Terms&quot;).  In it, he makes an argument for a sort of acetic life-style by, through a standard Platonic dialogue, laying out a minimally functional society.  He then, somewhat parodically, responds to the question of luxury by outlining how to 'justly' lay out a state that will accommodate luxuries for the entitled (a state that looks very similar to Sparta).  It's a good starting place, because it lays out  his conception of Justice, which, inevitably, is based on his theory of the forms, which is a similar basis of conceptions of natural law.

Skipping a few thousand years and many important texts, we get to Nicolo Machiavelli's ''The Prince, '' which was written in 1513 and published, after his death, in 1532.  Machiavelli lived in Florence under the Medici family's rule.  During a brief period of reform, the Medicis were chased from power, and Machiavelli became a diplomat.  When the Medicis returned, Machiavelli was basically exiled.  One reason he might have written ''The Prince'' was to try to return to public life in Florence.  This book is often criticized for its moral relativism, and, in an inadequate summarization, that power defines moral action.

Moving along, we can get to the social contract theorists, namely Jean Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Charles Montesquieu, and Baruch Spinoza.  This, of course, will be a brief and incomplete treatment of them, but it's a starting place.  Hobbes' theory is mostly found in his book ''Leviathan.''  In it, he defines the state of nature (the prepolitical society) as a place where life is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;  It's important to understand that Hobbes was writing after the Thirty Years War (a religious conflict between, primarily, the English Protestants and the Spanish Catholics), so he had a very pessimistic view of Human Nature.  He basically thought that man, left to its own devices, would war against itself, hence the above quotation.

From that, Hobbes had a view that society with a state, at its worst, was better than having no state at all, so he concluded that any state action would be justified if for no other reason than that it is a ''modus vivendi,'' a lesser evil.  The crux of this, and all social contract theory, is that the citizen has a sort of contract with the state in which people give up some autonomy to make their lives better.  For Hobbes, this autonomy was given up to protect life at its most fundamental level.

Locke, however, has an entirely different notion.  His view of the state of nature (the prepolitical society) is much nicer.  Basically people will respect each other and not infringe on another's person or property.  If someone does, then the agressee has the natural right to rectify the situation, and anyone else who witnesses an aggressor has the duty to help the agressee.  Locke concedes that property disputes will eventually be numerous enough that this would be time consuming, and in the general interest, people will form a state in order to have someone else protect their property and persons--basically to settle disputes--out of convenience.  Much of this is laid out in ''The Second Treatise on Government.'' It's important to note that much of the U.S. constitution is based on Locke's political philosophy.

A question, of course, is why these social contract theorists are doing what they're doing.  I mean, they're creating these ridiculous constructs of a prepolitcal reality through a strange process of abstraction.  One answer is that they're justifying the existence of the state and the state's actions.  Under Hobbes' view, the state is thus legitimate in anything it does, in any violation of 'human rights' because, well, things would be worse off without it.  Locke goes about it in order to have a sort of neutral procedure to protect property rights.

More contemporary social contract theorists include Robert Nozick (his main book on this, ''Anarchy, the State, and Utopia,'' is a defense for the libertarian state), John Rawls (whose book ''A Theory of Justice'' outlines the philosophy of deontological liberalism, which is a system of redistributive justice), and Bruce Ackerman (who wrote [[Wikipedia:Social justice in the liberal state|''Social Justice in the Liberal State'']], arguing for a sort of dialogic justice.)

Another important figure is John Stuart Mill who wrote ''Utilitarianism.''  Expanding on Jeremy Bentham's notion of Utilitarianism, Mill's short book influenced political calculations for over a hundred years.  The main thrust of Utilitarianism is to increase the overall utility for a society.  Utility is similar to happiness, so a decision or distributive scheme that would increase the societal level of happiness is better than a scheme that wouldn't--simple enough.  The main critique of Bentham's Utilitarianism is the case in which there are three people and a certain distributions would give person A and B 151 utilitons each (the measurement for utility) and give Person C 0 utilitons.  In other configurations, each might be able to have 100 utilitons each, however, the extra two utilitons are created by this distribution at the expense of Person C.  This would create, to invoke the catchphrase, a &quot;tyranny of the majority.&quot;  Mill's Utilitarianism responded to this by adding in protections for the minority.

Some more contemporary political philosophers are Hannah Arendt, Jurgen Habermas, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler, Richard Rorty, and Slavoj Zizek.

== TOC Suggestions ==


I think there are enough chapters here that it might be worth breaking them up into units to make the chunks more manageable: background basics, earliest hominids, paleolithic, etc. Then perhaps the interior TOC box could be changed to show only the TOC for that unit, so it's not so long and doesn't break up the layout of the page so much.

If I was comfortable enough with templates to fuss with yours, I'd also go ahead and make the bibliography section, and include your &quot;Class notes&quot; reference. With as much text here as there is, people might expect it to be more finished than it really is; if they can see that it's still a draft being converted from lecture notes, it might ward off problems.

Finally, I think it needs more text, either in chapter 1 or immediately before or after it,  that focuses on hominids. Most people probably aren't coming to a book on paleoanthropology to read about genetics, or the history of Darwinism, or linguistics, or whatnot -- they're looking for ''Bones! Fossils! Cave Men! Lucy! Neat Stuff!'' The background stuff is important, but we need to give them a substantial appetizer of the neat stuff first, so that they're willing to keep reading the background before getting to the meat of the book, instead of getting frustrated and wandering off in search of fossils elsewhere. At the very least, we need a good description of what a hominid is and what a hominid isn't, and what a paleoanthropologist does and doesn't study. (Chapter 1 made a start on what a paleoanthropologist does and doesn't study, but then it gets muddled in the following chapters.)--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 22:07, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

{{displaytitle|title=Cultural Evolution and Progress}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==The concept of progress==
'''Progress''' is defined as a gradual but predictable bettering of the human condition from age to age.

===History of Progressivism===
* Progressivism has been one of the cornerstones of Western historical and philosophical thought since ancient Greek times.
* For most of its history (from the Greek period to the 15th century), Progressivism was a purely philosophical or ideological doctrine: in the absence of any empirical evidence of improvement in the human condition, early progressivists devised imaginary scenarios of human history in which they pictured the gradual emergence of enlightened present-day institutions out of earlier and ruder institutions. The defining characteristics of any primitive society, thus conceived, were wholly negative: they were whatever civilization was not.
*In the 15th century, ethnographic information about living &quot;primitives,&quot; especially in the Americas, increased, providing the progressivists with empirical confirmation for their ideas. Living conditions of these &quot;primitive peoples&quot; conformed in a general way to the imagined early condition of humankind; they were therefore considered as &quot;fossilized&quot; survivals from ancient times, who had somehow failed to progress.
*In the 19th century, archaeology also began to provide confirmation: evidence of early peoples who had indeed lived without metals, agriculture, or permanent dwellings, just as the progressivists had always imagined.
*Out of the conjunction of progressivist theory with ethnographic and archaeological researches, the discipline of anthropology was born in the latter half of the 19th century. Early anthropologists arranged that evidence in orderly progression to provide seemingly irrefutable confirmation for what had long been only a philosophical doctrine. Progressivism was transformed into a science named anthropology; &quot;Progress&quot; was renamed &quot;Social Evolution&quot; or &quot;Cultural Evolution.&quot;

===Characteristics===
Progressivism flourished mainly in optimistic times, that is, times of scientific advances and expanding imaginations:
*pre-Socratic Greece
*the Enlightenment (18th century)
*the Victorian age (19th century)
*the generation following World War II

Progressivism has been the doctrine that legitimizes all scientific discoveries and labels them as &quot;advances&quot;.
*All progressivists agree, however, that their age is superior to those that preceded it.
*Human history is perceived with a basic directionality, from worse to better.

===What is better?===
* What constitutes &quot;the better&quot;? What causes it? How can it be measured?
* Answers to these questions have changed in accordance with the ideological preoccupation of different eras, and different philosophies:
**improved material circumstances
**intellectual maturation
**aesthetic achievements

===Us vs. Them mentality===
The problem with categorizing &quot;progressive&quot; judgments must be viewed in long-term perspective as a struggle between two basically incompatible cultural systems:
* in the present, us and the others: states/civilizations vs. bands/tribes;
* in paleoanthropology, us (''Homo sapiens'') and the others (other hominid species, e.g. Neandertals, ''Homo erectus'').

==Historical background of Western nations==
Hunting and gathering was predominant as a way of life for about 7 million years, whereas life in cities or states has been around for only the past 5,000 years or so.

Changes, or progess, since the first appearance of urban life and state organization (5,000 yrs ago):
* non-state tribal peoples persisted in a dynamic equilibrium or symbiotic relationship with states/civilizations
* states/civilizations developed and remained within their own ecological boundaries
* this situation lasted for thousands of years

This situation shifted 500 years ago:
* In the 15th century, Europeans began to expand beyond their long-established frontiers.
* For about 250 years (until 1750), the expansion was relatively slow, as non-state tribal peoples still seemed secure and successfully adapted to their economically &quot;marginal&quot; refuges.
* In the mid-eighteenth century, the industrial revolution launched the developing Western nations on an explosive growth in population and consumption called &quot;progress.&quot;

==The Industrial Revolution==
This period marks a major explosion at the scale of humankind:
* phenomenal increase in population
* increase in per capita consumption rates
* totally unparalleled scope
* these two critical correlates (population and consumption rates) of industrialization quickly led to overwhelming pressure on natural resources

Very quickly, industrial nations could no longer supply from within
their own boundaries the resources needed to support further growth or even
to maintain current consumption levels.

As a consequence:
* Industrial revolution led to an unprecedented assault on the world's relatively stable non-Western tribal peoples and their resources.
* Many of the &quot;underdeveloped&quot; resources controlled by the world's self-sufficient tribal peoples were quickly appropriated by outsiders to support their own industrial progress.
*In the last 200 years, these tribal cultures have virtually disappeared or have been completely marginalized.

Increased rates of resource consumption, accompanying industrialization,
have been even more critical than mere population increase:
* Industrial civilization is a culture of consumption. In this respect, it differs most strikingly from tribal cultures.
* Industrial economies are founded on the principle that consumption must be ever expanded.
* Complex systems of mass marketing and advertising have been developed for that specific purpose.
* Social stratification in industrial societies is based primarily on inequalities in material wealth and is both supported and reflected by differential access to resources.

Industrial ideological systems and prejudices:
* place great stress on belief in
** continual economic growth
** progress
* measure &quot;standard of living&quot; in terms of levels of material consumption.

==Ethnocentrism==
Ethnocentrism is the belief in the superiority of one's own culture.
It is vital to the integrity of any culture, but it can be a threat to the
well-being of other peoples when it becomes the basis for forcing Western
standards upon non-Western tribal cultures.

The impact of modern civilization on tribal peoples is a dominant research
theme in anthropology and social sciences.

Among economic development writers, the consensus is the clearly
ethnocentric view that any contact with superior industrial culture causes
non-Western tribal peoples to voluntarily reject their own cultures in
order to obtain a better life.

In the past, anthropologists also often viewed this contact from the same ethnocentric premises accepted by government officials, developers, missionaries, and the general public. But in recent years, there has been considerable confusion in the enormous culture change literature regarding the basic question of why tribal cultures seem inevitably to be acculturated or modernized by industrial civilization.

* There is therefore a problem to conceptualize the causes of the transformation process in simple nonethnocentric terms.
* This apparent inability may be due to the fact that the analysts are members of the culture of consumption that today happens to be the dominant world culture type.
* The most powerful cultures have always assumed a natural right to exploit the world's resources wherever they find them, regardless of the prior claims of indigenous populations.

Arguing for efficiency and survival of the fittest, old-fashioned
colonialists elevated this &quot;right&quot; to the level of an ethical and legal
principle that could be invoked to justify the elimination of any cultures
that were not making &quot;effective&quot; use of their resources.

This viewpoint has found its way into modern theories of cultural
evolution, expressed as the &quot;Law of Cultural Dominance&quot;: ''any cultural system which exploits more effectively the energy resources of a given environment will tend to spread in that environment at the expense of other less effective (indigenous) systems.''
* These old attitudes of social Darwinism are deeply embedded in our ideological system.
* They still occur in the professional literature on culture change.

While resource exploitation is clearly the basic cause of the destruction
of tribal peoples, it is important to identify the underlying ethnocentric
attitudes that are often used to justify what are actually exploitative
policies.

Apart from the obvious ethical implications involved here, upon close
inspection all of these theories expounding the greater adaptability,
efficiency, and survival value of the dominant industrial culture prove to
be quite misleading.

----
&lt;center&gt;
''Of course, as a culture of consumption, industrial &lt;br&gt; civilization is uniquely capable of consuming resources at tremendous  &lt;br&gt; rates, but this certainly does not make it a more effective culture than &lt;br&gt; low-energy tribal cultures, if stability or long-run ecological success is &lt;br&gt; taken as the criterion for &quot;effectiveness.&quot;''
&lt;/center&gt;
----

Likewise, we should expect, almost by definition, that members of the
culture of consumption would probably consider another culture's resources
to be underexploited and to use this as a justification for appropriating
them.

Among some writers, it is assumed that all people share our desire for
what we define as material wealth, prosperity, and progress and that others
have different cultures only because they have not yet been exposed to the
superior technological alternatives offered by industrial civilization.
Supporters of this view seem to minimize the difficulties of creating new
wants in a culture and at the same time make the following highly
questionable and clearly ethnocentric assumptions:
# The materialistic values of industrial civilization are cultural universals.
# Tribal cultures are unable to satisfy the material needs of their peoples.
# Industrial goods are, in fact, always superior to their handcrafted counterparts.

'''Assumption 1 -''' Unquestionably, tribal cultures represent a clear rejection of the
materialistic values of industrial civilization, yet tribal individuals can
indeed be made to reject their traditional values if outside interests
create the necessary conditions for this rejection. The point is that far
more is involved here than a mere demonstration of the superiority of
industrial civilization.

'''Assumption 2 -''' The ethnocentrism of the second assumption is obvious. Clearly, tribal cultures could not have survived for millions of years if they did not do a
reasonable job of satisfying basic human needs.

'''Assumption 3 -''' Regarding the third assumption, there is abundant evidence that many of the material accoutrements of industrial civilization may well not be worth
their real costs regardless of how appealing they may seem in the short term.

== General plural thoughts ==

More emphasis should probably be made that -tachi and -ra are almost never used with non-personified nouns. Is Hoshi-tachi a good example? I've never heard stars said that way before. If I did, I would probably think you were talking to the stars as if they were people or something. I'm not a native Japanese speaker, but that's my impression.

:Hi there, I'm a native Japanese speaker. Yes, we usually say 星々 (hoshi-boshi for stars), 木々 (ki-gi for trees), 家々 (ie-ie for houses), 人々 (hito-bito for people) etc... And, for animals, birds or fish, we use -tachi such as 動物達. Just FYI. [[User:Electric goat|e-Goat]] 15:49, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC) p.s. If you need more examples, then I can help.

== Rewrite this page? ==

Not to be rude, but this page is suffering pretty badly. I'm not convinced the writer of this page speaks and understands Japanese language.

Nouns in Japanese are very simple. You just learn one word for one thing. That's it! You don't have learn a plural form as in English. Nor is there &quot;grammatical gender&quot; as there is in many other languages. Again, like English, gender is something in what the word represents, not in the word. And since this page is written in English and not Italian, gender can be entirely ignored. Let's not over-complicate things. :-)[[User:Newtonsfig|Newtonsfig]] ([[User talk:Newtonsfig|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Newtonsfig|contribs]]) 03:56, 28 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

Notice that John uses the polite forms &quot;alst'''u'''blieft&quot; (please) and &quot;hartelijk dank&quot; (thank you very much) to a total stranger rather than the more informal &quot;als'''je'''blieft and &quot;dank je&quot;.

==Grammatica 5-1 ~ Conjugation of verbs;  the four moods ==
Dutch has a relatively simple system of verbs with four moods and eight tenses. The Dutch verb has a few more endings than the English one. We will focus on three forms:

# stem
# stem + -t
# stem + -en

===Imperative mood===
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|neem}} neem||{{knop|neemt}} neemt||{{knop|nemen}} nemen
|}
The simplest form is the imperative mood. As in English it is simply the ''stem'' of the verb:

:Neem! - take!

There is a (rather archaic) plural of the imperative, that takes an extra -t:

:Neemt! - take (you all!).

Often imperatives are 'softened' to a kind request or encouragement with modal adverbs like ''maar'' or ''even'':

:Ga weg   - Go away! (This is pretty curt, even offensive: Get lost!)
:Ga even weg -  Please leave me alone for a moment (A kind request: do me a favor)
:Ga maar weg  - You can go now, that's OK. (An encouragement or permission)

In polite address with 'u'  often a -t is added, although grammarians don't always consider that an imperative&lt;ref&gt;The linguistic advice of the Taalunie [http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/531] and [http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/924/wordt_word_lid/] are downright contradictory. One one page it is said that the imperative gets a -t in the presence of the personal pronoun u, on the other it says that this is not an imperative! The case of to be is not discussed, but it is hard to argue that ''weest u'' is not an imperative, because an indicative ''u weest'' does not exist. The other authoritative source the Algemene Nederlandse Spraakkunst [http://ans.ruhosting.nl/e-ans/02/04/04/body.html (ANS)] has little more to offer than a few weasel words.  The author of this book thinks that the Taalunie is simply mistaken in its analysis&lt;/ref&gt;:

:Gaat u zitten - please sit down
:Weest u niet bang - don't be afraid

===Indicative mood in the present tense===

By far the most important mood is the indicative one and its tenses. We will look at the present tense only here. The first person singular has the same form as the imperative:

:neem! - take!
:ik neem - I take

The third person (''he/she'') singular acquires a final -t in the present. In English it gets a -s instead:

:ik volg - I follow
:hij volg'''t''' - he follow'''s'''

In contrast to English this also applies to the second person singular:

:jij vind'''t''' - you find (informal)
:U kun'''t''' - you can  (formal, polite)

However, the -t ending is lost for the informal jij form, when the word order is reversed, e.g. when asking a question:
:Vind je dat ook niet?
[[File:Storytelling (3676086866).jpg|thumb|200px|{{knop|vertellen}} het vertellen van verhalen]]
The Dutch verb has a 'plural' form that generally ends in ''-en'', which is used for all plural persons and for the infinitive as well:

:vertel'''len''' - to tell
:wij nem'''en''' - we take
:jullie volg'''en''' - you (all) follow
:zij kun'''nen''' - they can

Notice that the vowel usually does not change and '''''therefore''''' we are doubling either consonants or vowels when we go from one syllable to two:

:vertel - vertelt - verte'''l'''ˑlen =&gt; single e remains [ɛ] in syllable closed by extra '''l'''.
:lo'''o'''p - lo'''o'''pt - loˑpen =&gt; o remains [o], even in the closed syllable, as indicated by &quot;oo&quot;. 

====Brief exercise====
Choose the correct form of the verb, then hover you mouse over the verb to see the right answer.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|jij {{C|(werken)|werkt}}||ik {{C|(lopen)|loop}}||wij {{C|(lopen)|lopen}}
|-
|jullie {{C|(werken)|werken}}||u {{C|(graven)|graaft}}||zij {{C|(kijken)|kijken}}
|-
|wij {{C|(volgen)|volgen}}||ik {{C|(bereiken)|bereik}}||{{C|(verkopen)|verkoop}} ik?
|-
|{{C|(werken)|werk}}!!||{{C|(zitten)|zitten}} wij?||{{C|(halen)|haal}} jij
|-
|hij {{C|(verstoppen)|verstopt}}||het {{C|(waaien)|waait}}||wij {{C|(begrijpen)|begrijpen}}
|-
|}

Fill in the correct verb form in the blank. Hover to check the answer.

*[werken]. Waar {{C|_____|werk}} jij?
*[gaan]. Zij {{C|_____|gaan}} allebei naar het concert.
*[bibberen]. Het kindje {{C|_____|bibbert}} van de kou.
*[pakken]. Ik {{C|_____|pak}} de kaart even.
*[eten].  {{C|____|Eet}} u graag pannenkoeken met spek?

===Infinitive mood===
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|maken}} maken||{{knop|moeilijk}} moeilijk||{{knop|eten}} eten
|}
The plural form is also the infinitive of the verb:

: wij maken - we make
: maken - to make

It occasionally takes 'te' as in English 'to' but that is more exceptional in Dutch. 
The form with ''te'' is known as the ''extended infinitive'' and it has its own uses. Some of them are quite comparable to what happens in English:

: dat is moeilijk ''te'' maken - that is hard ''to'' make

The infinitive can be used as a ''noun'' where English uses the gerund in -ing. It is always neuter in gender:

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|vertellen}} vertellen||{{knop|eten}} eten||{{knop|leven}} leven
|}
:het vertellen van volkverhalen is een leuk tijdverdrijf.
:::the telling of folktales is a nice pastime.

:het eten - the food, the meal
:het eten is klaar! - dinner's ready!
:het leven - life

There is a present participle, it ends in -end(e) rather than -ing. It is used mostly as an adjective&lt;ref&gt;Participles are revisited extensively in [[Dutch/Lesson 22|Lesson 22]]&lt;/ref&gt;:
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|volgen}} volgen||{{knop|volgend}} volgend
|}
:de week die volgt → de volgende week
::the week that follows → the following week
:volgend jaar 
::next year

There are forms ending in '''''-ing''''' in Dutch but they are (feminine) ''nouns of action'' only loosely associated with the verb they derive from, e.g.

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|vertalen}} vertalen||{{knop|vertaling}} vertaling
|}
:vertalen - to translate
:de vertaling - the translation

We will revisit verbal nouns much more extensively in one of the later lessons.

Some verbs are monosyllabic, e.g.
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|zie}} zie||{{knop|ziet}} ziet||{{knop|zien}} zien
|}
:zien - to see
:ik zie - I see
:hij ziet - he sees
:zij zien - they see

===Subjunctive mood===
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|neme}} neme||{{knop|zij}} zij||{{knop|gehakt}} gehakt
|}
The subjunctive mood is even rarer in Dutch than it is in English. It only exists in third person singular and (with few exceptions) present tense. It looks like the infinitive minus -n:

:Men ''neme'' twee pond gehakt 
:''lit''. (May) one ''take'' two pounds of ground beef (minced meat)
:Het ''zij'' zo - ''be'' it so

It is only mentioned here for the sake of completeness. It is only used in a few wishes and recipes.

===Some irregular verbs===

Of course, there are a number of irregular verbs in Dutch, but often they are the same ones as in English. In English ''can'' and ''may'' do not take an '''-s''' in the third person. In Dutch a similar thing happens:
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|kunnen}} kunnen||{{knop|kan}} kan||{{knop|kunt}} kunt
|}
:kunnen
:ik k'''a'''n - I can
:jij kunt - you can 
:hij k'''a'''n - he can (no '''t''' in Dutch - no '''s''' in English)

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|mogen}} mogen||{{knop|mag}} mag
|}
:mogen
:ik mag - I may
:jij mag - you may
:hij mag - he may (no '''t''' - no '''s''')

We will revisit irregulars later.

==Exercise 5.1==

Read conversation 5.1 again and underline all verbs. Mark all endings as 0) - none 1) - t and 2) -en and identify in each case why this ending is used.

==Grammatica 5-2==
===Clitics revisited===
[[File:Barack Obama takes one last look in the mirror, before going out to take oath, Jan. 20, 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|Obama kijkt in de spiegel. {{knop|spiegel}} spiegel]]
As shown before many personal pronouns have a strong and a weak form:

:mij, me - me (object)
:jij, je - you (subject)
:jou, je - you (object) 
:wij, we - we
:zij, ze - they or she
:hen, ze - them

The weak forms me, je, we and ze are used when the emphasis lies on some other part of the sentence. The strong form expresses mild emphasis.

:Hij ziet me in de ''spíégel'' - He sees me in the ''mirror'' (not on television).
:Hij ziet ''míj'' in de spiegel - He sees ''me'' in the mirror (not my mother).

Some pronouns do not have clitics, like ''u'' and ''jullie''. In the spoken language there are more weak forms than in the written one, e.g. for ''he'' (ie), ''him'' ('m) and for ''her'' (d'r or 'r)

:''Dat heeft-ie niet gedaan'' - ''He ain't done it''
:''Hij heeft 'r geslagen''  -  ''He beat 'r up''
:''Ze hebben 'm gezien''    -- ''They spotted him ''

In the written language they are often written in full ''hij'', ''haar'' and ''hem''.

For possessive pronouns the same holds. Compare:

:''Mijn'' motor is een Honda. Wat is ''jouw'' motor? - ''My'' bike is a Honda. What is ''your'' bike?
:Ik wil graag een ritje op ''je'' motor maken. - I'd love to ride y'r bike!

:mijn, m'n  - my
:jouw, je   - your
:zijn, z'n  - his
:haar, (d'r)- her

Again the spoken language has a clearer distinction than the written one. The forms m'n, z'n, and especially d'r are often written as mijn, zijn and haar in formal writing. The form ''je'' is pretty much the only clitic possessive generally accepted in writing.

{{displaytitle|title=Pre-Darwinian and Darwinian Thoughts on Evolution}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Pre-Darwinian Thoughts on Evolution==
Throughout the Middle Ages, there was one predominant component of the European world view: stasis.
* All aspects of nature were considered as fixed and change was unconceivable.
* No new species had appeared, and none had disappeared or become extinct.

The social and political context of the Middle Ages helps explain this world view:
* shaped by feudal society - hierarchical arrangement supporting a rigid class system that had changed little for centuries
* shaped by a powerful religious system - life on Earth had been created by God exactly as it existed in the present (known as fixity of species).

This social and political context, and its world view, provided a formidable obstacle to the development of evolutionary theory. In order to formulate new evolutionary principles, scientists needed to:
* overcome the concept of fixity of species
* establish a theory of long geological time

From the 16th to the 18th century, along with renewed interest in scientific
knowledge, scholars focused on listing and describing all kinds of forms of
organic life. As attempts in this direction were made, they became increasingly impressed with the amount of biological diversity that confronted them.

These scholars included:
*[[:wikipedia:John Ray|John Ray]] (1627-1705) - put some order into the diversity of animal and plant life, by creating the concepts of species and genus.
*[[:wikipedia:Carolus Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] (1707-1778) - added two more categories (class and order) and created a complex system of classification (taxonomy) still used today; also innovated by including humans in his classification of animals.
* [[:wikipedia:Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges-Louis Leclerc]] (1707-1788) - innovated by suggesting the changing nature of species, through adaptation to local climatic and environmental conditions.
* [[:wikipedia:Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744-1829) - offered a comprehensive system to explain species changes; postulated that physical alterations of organic life would occur in relation to changing environmental circumstances, making species better suited for their new habitat; also postulated that new traits would be passed on to offspring (the theory known as inheritance of acquired characteristics).

Therefore, the principle of &quot;fixity of species&quot; that ruled during the Middle Ages was no longer considered valid.

In the mid-19th century, [[:wikipedia:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]] offered  a new theory which pushed further the debate of evolutionary processes and marks a fundamental
step in their explanation by suggesting that evolution works through natural selection.

==Charles Darwin (1809-1882)==
Charles Darwin's life as a scientist began when he took a position as
naturalist aboard ''HMS Beagle'', a ship charting the coastal waters of South
America. As the ship circled the globe over a five-year period (1831-1836),
Darwin puzzled over the diversity and distribution of life he observed.
Observations and collections of materials made during these travels laid
the foundation for his life's work studying the natural world.

As an example, the ''Beagle'' stopped five weeks in the Galapagos
archipelago. There Darwin observed an unusual combination of species and
wondered how they ended up on this island.

Darwin's observations on the diversity of plants and animals and their
particular geographical distribution around the globe led him to question
the assumption that species were immutable, established by a single act of
creation. He reasoned that species, like the Earth itself, were constantly
changing. Life forms colonized new habitats and had to survive in new
conditions. Over generations, they underwent transmutation into new forms.
Many became extinct. The idea of evolution slowly began to take shape in
his mind.

In his 1859 publication ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin presented some
of the main principles that explained the diversity of plants and animals
around the globe: adaptation and natural selection.
According to him, species were mutable, not fixed; and they evolved from
other species through the mechanism of natural selection.

===Darwin's theory of natural selection===
In 1838, Darwin, at 28, had been back from his voyage on the ''Beagle'' for two years. He read Thomas Malthus's ''Essay on Population'', which stated that human populations invariably grow until they are limited by starvation, poverty, and death,
and realized that Malthus's logic could also apply to the natural world. This realization led Darwin to develop the principle of evolution by natural selection, which
revolutionized our understanding of the living world.

His theory was published for the first time in 1859 in ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life''.

===Darwin's Postulates===

The theory of adaptation and how species change through time follows three
postulates:
*'''Struggle for existence''': The ability of a population to expand is infinite, but the ability of any environment to support populations is always finite.
:Example: Animals require food to grow and reproduce. When food is plentiful, animal populations grow until their numbers exceed the local food supply. Since resources are always finite, it follows that not all individuals in a population will be able to survive and reproduce.

* '''Variation in fitness''': Organisms in populations vary. Therefore, some individuals will possess traits that enable them to survive and reproduce more successfully (producing more offspring) than others in the same environment.

* '''Inheritance of variation''': If the advantageous traits are inherited by offspring, then these traits will become more common in succeeding generations. Thus, traits that confer advantages in survival and reproduction are retained in the population, and traits that are disadvantageous disappear.

===Examples of adaptation by natural selection===

During his voyage on the ''HMS Beagle'', Darwin observed a curious pattern of
adaptations among several species of finches (now called Darwin's finches)
that live on the Galapagos Islands.

Several traits of finches went through drastic changes in response to changes in their environment. One example is beak depth:
* There was huge variation in beak depth among finches on the island; it affected the birds' survival and adaptation to local environmental changes.
:: During a drought, finches with deeper beaks were more likely to survive than finches with shallow beaks (which were at a disadvantage because it was harder for them to crack larger and harder seeds).
* Parents and offsprings had similar beak depths.

Through natural selection, average morphology (an organism's size, shape and composition) of the bird population changed so that birds became better adapted to their environment.

===Benefits and disadvantages of evolution===
====Individual Selection====
Adaptation results from competition among individuals, not between entire populations or species.

Selection produces adaptations that benefit individuals. Such adaptation may or may not benefit the population or species. In the case of finches' beak depth, selection probably does allow the population of finches to compete more effectively with other populations of seed predators. However, this need not be the case. Selection often leads to changes in behavior or morphology that increase the reproductive success of
individuals but decrease the average reproductive success and competitive
ability of the group, population, and species.
:: Example of conflict between individual and group interests: All organisms in the population produce many more offspring than are necessary to maintain the species. A female monkey may, on average, produce 10 offspring during her lifetime. In a stable population, perhaps only two of these offspring will survive and reproduce. From the point of view of the species, the other eight are a waste of resources. The species as a whole might be more likely to survive if all females produced fewer offspring.

The idea that natural selection operates at the level of the individual
is a key element in understanding adaptation.

====Directional Selection====
Instead of a completely random selection of individuals whose traits will
be passed on to the next generation, there is selection by forces of
nature. In this process, the frequency of genetic variants for harmful or
maladaptive traits within the population is reduced while the frequency of
genetic variants for adaptive traits is increased.

Natural selection, as it acts to promote change in gene frequencies, is
referred to as directional selection.

====Stabilizing Selection====

'''Finches' beaks''' (Example)

Large beaks have benefits as well as disadvantages. Birds with large beaks are less likely to survive their juvenile period than birds with small beaks, probably because they require more food to grow.

Evolutionary theory prediction:
* Over time, selection will increase the average beak depth in a population until the costs of larger-than-average beak size exceed the benefits.
* At this point, finches with average beak size in the population will be the most likely to survive and reproduce, and finches with deeper or shallower beaks than the new average will be at a disadvantage.

At this point, the population reaches equilibrium with regard to beak size. The process that produces this equilibrium state is called stabilizing selection.

Even though average characteristics of the beak in the population will
not change in this situation, selection is still going on. The point to remember here is that populations do not remain static over the long run; if so, it is because a population is consistently favored by stabilizing selection.

===Rate of Evolutionary Change===
In Darwin's day, the idea that natural selection could change a
chimpanzee into a human, much less that it might do so in just a few
million years (which is a brief moment in evolutionary time), was
unthinkable.

Today, most scientists believe that humans evolved from an apelike creature in only 5 to 10 million years. In fact, some of the rates of selective change observed in contemporary populations are far faster than necessary for natural selection to produce the adaptations that we observe.
::The human brain has roughly doubled in the last 2 million years (rate of change of 0.00005% per year); that is 10,000 times slower than the rate of change observed among finches in the Galapagos Islands.

Therefore the real puzzle is why the change in the fossil record seem to
have been quite slow.

The fossil record is still very incomplete.

It is quite likely that some evolutionary changes in the past were rapid,
but the sparseness of the fossil record prevents us from detecting them.

===Darwin's Difficulties===

In ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin proposed that new species and other
major evolutionary changes arise by the accumulation of small variations
through natural selection.

This idea was not widely embraced by his contemporaries.
* Many accepted the idea that new species arise through the transformation of existing species.
* Many accepted the idea that natural selection is the most important cause of organic change.
* But only a few endorsed Darwin's view that major changes occur through the accumulation of small variations.

Darwin's critics raised a major objection to his theory: The actions of selection would inevitably deplete variation in populations and make it impossible for natural selection to continue.

Yet Darwin couldn't convince his contemporaries that evolution occurred through the accumulation of small variations because he could not explain how variation is maintained, because he and his contemporaries did not yet understand the mechanics of inheritance.

For most people at the time, including Darwin, many of the characteristics of offspring were thought to be an average of the characteristics of their parents.  This phenomena was believed to be caused by the action of blending inheritance, a model of inheritance that assumes the mother and father each contribute a hereditary substance that mixes, or &quot;blends&quot;, to determine the characteristics of the offspring.

The solution to these problems required an understanding of genetics, which was not available for another half century. It was not until well into the 20th century that geneticists came to understand how variation is maintained, and Darwin's theory of evolution was generally accepted.

Although Charles Darwin is credited with discovering the first observations of natural selection, he never explained how or why the process happens. Other scholars tackled these problems.

==Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)==

Darwin recognized the importance of individual variation in process of
natural selection, but could not explain how individual differences were
transmitted from one generation to another.
[[File:Gregor Mendel Monk.jpg|thumb|right|Gregor Mendel]]
Although none of main scientists in the 19th-century debate about
evolution knew it, the key experiments necessary to understand how genetic
inheritance really worked had already been performed by an obscure monk,
Gregor Mendel, who lived near Brno, in the Czech Republic.

Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel performed many breeding experiments using
the common edible garden pea plants. He meticulously recorded his
observations and isolated a number of traits in order to confirm his
results.

In 1866, Mendel published a report where he described many features of
the mode of inheritance which Darwin was seeking. He proposed the existence
of three fundamental principles of inheritance: Segregation; Independent
Assortment; Dominance and Recessiveness.

Because the basic rules of inheritance Mendel discovered apply to humans
as well as to peas, his work is of prime relevance for paleoanthropology
and human evolution.

Nevertheless Mendel's work was beyond the thinking of the time; its
significance was overlooked and unrecognized until the beginning of the
20th century.

===Mendelian Genetics===

====Mendel's research====

Mendel observed that his peas had seven easily observable
characteristics, with only two forms, or variants, for each trait:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|Seed texture || smooth ||wrinkled
|-
| Seed interior color || yellow || green
|-
| Seed coat color || gray || white
|-
| Ripe pods || inflated || constricted
|-
| Unripe pods || green || yellow
|-
| Position of flowers on stem || along stem || end of stem
|-
| Length of stem || long || short
|}
After crossing plants, Mendel noted and carefully recorded the number of
plants in each generation with a given trait. He believed that the ratio of
plant varieties in a generation of offspring would yield clues about
inheritance, and he continually tested his ideas by performing more
experiments.
[[File:Mendel_seven_characters.svg|thumb|right|The seven varying characteristics observed by Mendel]]
From his controlled experiments and the large sample of numerous breeding
experiments, Mendel proposed the existence of three fundamental principles
of inheritance:
* Segregation
* Independent Assortment
* Dominance and Recessiveness

====Segregation====

Mendel began crossing different varieties of purebred plants that
differed with regard to a specific trait. For example, pea color.

In the experiment:
* The first generation (parental, Fo) of plants were either green or yellow. As they matured, the first hybrid offspring generation was not intermediate in color, as blending theories of inheritance (Darwin) would have predicted. To the contrary, they were all yellow.
* Next, Mendel allowed these plants to self-fertilize and produce a second generation of plants (generation F1). But this time, only 3/4 of offspring plants were yellow, and the remaining 1/4 were green.

These results suggested an important fact:
::Different expressions of a trait were controlled by discrete units, which occurred in pairs, and that offspring inherited one unit from each parent.

This is Mendel's first principle of inheritance: principle of segregation.

====Independent Assortment====

Mendel also made crosses in which two traits were considered
simultaneously to determine whether there was a relationship between them. For example: Plant height and seed color.

Results of experiments:
No relationship between the two traits were found; nothing to dictate that a tall
plant must have yellow (or green) seeds; therefore, expression of one trait is not
influenced by the expression of the other trait.

Based on these results, Mendel stated his second principle of
inheritance: the principle of independent assortment. 	This principle says that the genes that code for different traits assort independently of each other.

====Dominance and Recessiveness====

Mendel also recognized that the trait that was absent in the first
generation of offspring plants had not actually disappeared at all - it had
remained, but was masked and could not be expressed.

To describe the trait that seemed to be lost, Mendel used the term
recessive; the trait that was expressed was said to be dominant.

Thus the important principle of dominance and recessiveness was
formulated; and it remains today an essential concept in the field of
genetics.

===Implications of Mendel's research===

Mendel thought his findings were important, so he published them in 1866.

Scientists, especially botanists studying inheritance, in the late 19th
century, should have understood the importance of Mendel's experiments.
But instead, they dismissed Mendel's work, perhaps because it contradicted
their own results or because he was an obscure monk.

Soon after the publication of his work, Mendel was elected abbot of his
monastery and was forced to give up his experiments.

His ideas did not resurface until the turn of the 20th century, when
several botanists independently replicated Mendel's experiments and
rediscovered the laws of inheritance.

===The role of cell division in inheritence===

'''Mitosis and Meiosis'''

By the time Mendel's experiments were rediscovered in 1900, some facts
were well known:
* virtually all living organisms are built out of cells;
* all the cells in complex organisms arise from a single cell through the process of cell division.
[[File:Mitosis_vs._meiosis.png|thumb|right|How genetic material is shared in mitosis (above) and meiosis (below)]]
In order for plants and animals to grow and maintain good health, body
cells of an organism must divide and produce new cells. Cell division is
the process that results in the production of new cells.

Two types of cell division have been identified:
*'''Mitosis''': a process when chromosomes (and genes) replicate, forming a second pair that duplicates the original pair of chromosomes in the nucleus. Thus, mitosis produces new cells (daughter cells) that have exactly the same number of chromosome pairs and genes, as did the parent cell

*'''Meiosis''': while mitosis produces new cells (which	contain a pair of homologous chromosomes), meiosis leads to development of new individuals, known as gametes (which contain only one copy of each chromosome). With this process, each new cell (containing only one copy of each chromosome) is said to be haploid: when new individual is conceived, a haploid sperm from father unites with a haploid egg from the mother to produce a diploid zygote. The zygote is a single cell that divides mitotically over and over again to produce the millions and millions of cells that make up an individual's body.

===Mendel and chromosomes===

Mendel stated in 1866 that an organism's observed traits are determined
by &quot;particules&quot; (later named genes by the American geneticist T.H. Morgan)
acquired from each of the parents. This statement was only understood by
further research.

Between the time of Mendel's initial discovery of the nature of
inheritance and its rediscovery at the turn of the century, a crucial
feature of cellular anatomy was discovered: the chromosome.
::Chromosomes are small, linear bodies contained in every cell and replicated during cell division.

In 1902, a graduate student from Columbia University, (Walter Sutton) made the
connection between chromosomes and properties of inheritance discovered by
Mendel's principles:
* genes reside on chromosomes because individuals inherit one copy of each chromosome from each parent
* therefore an organism's observed traits are determined by genes from both parents
* these propositions are consistent with the observation that mitosis transmits a copy of both chromosomes to every daughter cell, so every cell contains copies of both the maternal and paternal chromosomes.

==Molecular genetics==

In first half of the 20th century, geneticists made substantial progress in:
* describing the cellular events that took place during mitosis and meiosis
* understanding the chemistry of reproduction.

By the middle of the 20th century it was known that chromosomes contain two structurally complex molecules: protein and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). It was also determined that the particle of heredity postulated by Mendel was DNA, not protein - though exactly how DNA might contain and convey the information essential to life was still a mystery.

In the early 1950s, several biologists (led by Francis Crick and James Watson), at
Cambridge University, made a discovery that revolutionized biology: they deduced the structure of DNA.

Through this discovery, we now know how DNA stores information and how this
information controls the chemistry of life, and this knowledge explains why
heredity leads to the patterns Mendel describes in pea plants, and why
there are sometimes new variations.

====Molecular Components====

'''Cells'''&lt;br&gt;
Cells are basic units of life in all living organisms. Complex multicellular forms (plants, insects, birds, humans, ...) are composed of billions of cells, all functioning in complex ways to promote the survival of the individual.

'''DNA Molecules'''&lt;br&gt;
Complex molecule with an unusual shape: like two strands (called nucleotides) of a rope (composed of alternating sequences of phosphate and sugar molecules) twisted around one another (double helix). Chemical bases that connect two strands constitute code that contains information to direct production of proteins.

It is at this level that development of certain traits occurs; . . Yet,
since the DNA in a single chromosome is millions of bases long, there is
room for a nearly infinite variety of messages.

DNA molecules have the unique property of being able to produce exact
copies of themselves: as long as no errors are made in the replication
process, new organisms will contain genetic material exactly like that in
ancestral organisms.

'''Genes'''&lt;br&gt;
A Gene is a short segment of the DNA molecule that directs the
development of observable or identifiable traits. Thus genetics is the study of how traits are transmitted from one generation to the next.

'''Chromosomes'''&lt;br&gt;
Each chromosome contains a single DNA molecule, roughly two meters long that is folded up to fit in the nucleus. Chromosomes are nothing more than long strands of DNA combined with protein to produce structures that can actually be seen under a conventional light microscope

Each kind of organism has characteristic number of chromosomes, which are usually found in pairs. For example, human cells contain 23 pairs.

====Cellular processes====

'''DNA Replication'''&lt;br&gt;
In addition to preserving a message faithfully, hereditary material must
be replicable. Without the ability to make copies of itself, the genetic message that
directs the activities of living cells could not be spread to offspring,
and natural selection would be impossible.

Cells multiply by dividing in such a way that each new cell receives a
full complement of genetic material. For new cells to receive the essential amount of DNA, it is first necessary for the DNA to replicate:
*  Specific enzymes break the bonds between bases in the DNA molecule, leaving the two previously joined strands exposed
* When process is completed, there are two double-stranded DNA molecules exactly like the original one.

'''Protein Synthesis'''&lt;br&gt;
One of most important functions of DNA is that it directs protein
synthesis within the cell. Proteins are complex, three-dimensional molecules that function through
their ability to bind to other molecules.

Proteins function in myriad ways:
* '''Collagen''' is most common protein in body and major component of all connective tissues
* '''Enzymes''' are also proteins; their function is to initiate and enhance chemical reactions
* '''Hormones''' are another class.
Proteins are not only major constituents of all body tissues, but also
direct and perform physiological and cellular functions. Therefore critical
that protein synthesis occur accurately, for, if it does not, physiological
development and metabolic activities can be disrupted or even prevented.

===Evolutionary significance of cellular processes===

Meiosis is a highly important evolutionary innovation, since it increases
variation in populations at a faster rate than mutation alone can do in
asexually reproducing species.

Individual members of sexually reproducing species are not genetically
identical clones of other individuals. Therefore each individual represents
a unique combination of genes that has never occurred before and will never
occur again.

Genetic diversity is therefore considerably enhanced by meiosis. If all
individuals in a population are genetically identical over time, the
natural selection and evolution cannot occur.
Therefore, sexual reproduction and meiosis are of major evolutionary
importance because they contribute to the role of natural selection in
populations.

==Synthesizing the knowledge==

Darwin believed that evolution proceeded by the gradual accumulation of
small changes. But Mendel and the biologists who elucidated the structure of the genetic
system around the turn of the century proved that inheritance was
fundamentally discontinuous.

Yet turn-of-the-century geneticists argued that this fact could not be
reconciled with Darwin's idea that adaptation occurs through the
accumulation of small variations.
:: If generation of parent plants are tall and short, then there will be no intermediate in the generation of offspring and size of peas cannot change in small steps. In a population of short plants, tall ones must be created all at once by mutation, not gradually lengthened over time by selection.

These arguments convinced most biologists of the time, and consequently
Darwinism was in decline during the early part of the 20th century.

In the early 1930s, a team of British and American biologists showed how
Mendelian genetics could be used to explain continuous variation. Their
insights led to the resolution of two main objections to Darwin's theory:
* the absence of a theory of inheritance
* the problem of accounting for how variation is maintained in populations

When their theory was combined with Darwin's theory of natural selection
and with modern biological studies, a powerful explanation of organic
evolution emerged. This body of theory and the supporting empirical evidence is now called the
modern synthesis.

==Variation maintained==

Darwin knew nothing about genetics, and his theory of adaptation by
natural selection was framed as a &quot;struggle for existence&quot;: there is
variation of observed traits that affects survival and reproduction, and
this variation if heritable.

Also, the blending model of inheritance appealed to 19th century thinkers,
because it explained the fact that for most continuously varying
characters, offspring are intermediate between their parents.

:: When yellow and blue parents are crossed to 	produce a green offspring, the blending model posits 	that the hereditary material has mixed, so that when two green individuals mate they produce only green offspring.

According to Mendelian genetics, however, the effects of genes are blended in their expression to produce a green phenotype, but the genes themselves remain unchanged. Thus, when two green parents mate, they can produce blue, yellow and green offspring.

Sexual reproduction produces no blending in the genes themselves, despite
the fact that offspring may appear to be intermediate between their
parents. This is because genetic transmission involves faithful copying of
the genes themselves and reassembling them in different combinations in
zygotes.

The only blending that occurs takes place at the level of the expression of
genes in phenotypes (ex. Beak depth, pea color). The genes themselves
remain distinct physical entities.

Yet, these facts do not completely solve the problem of the maintenance
of variation. Indeed, even is selection tends to deplete variation, there would still be
variation of traits due to environmental effects. In fact, without genetic variation there can be no further adaptation.

===Mutation===
Genes are copied with amazing fidelity, and their messages are protected
from random degradation by a number of molecular repair mechanisms.

However, every once in a while, a mistake in copying is made that goes
unrepaired. These mistakes damage the DNA and alter the message that it
carries.

These changes are called '''mutations''', and they add variation to a population
by continuously introducing new genes, some of which may produce novel
traits that selection can assemble into adaptations.
Although rates of mutation are very slow, this process plays an important
role in generating variation.

More importantly, this process provides the solution to one of Darwin's
dilemma: the problem of accounting for how variation is maintained in populations.

Twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic
variation: hidden and expressed. Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation. Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.

In other words: if individuals with a variety of genotypes are equally
likely to survive and reproduce, a considerable amount of variation is
protected (or hidden) from selection; and because of this process, a very
low mutation rate can maintain variation despite the depleting action of
selection.

Human evolution and adaptation are intimately linked to life processes that
involve cells, replication and decoding of genetic information, and
transmission of this information between generations.
Because physical anthropologists are concerned with human evolution,
adaptation, and variation, they must have a thorough understanding of the
factors that lie at very root of these phenomena. Because it is genetics
that ultimately links or influences many of the various subdisciplines of
biological anthropology.

About the Artcyclopedia
Our mission is to become the definitive and most effective guide to museum-quality fine art on the Internet: 
definitive: We have compiled a comprehensive index of every artist represented at hundreds of museum sites, image archives, and other online resources. We have started out by covering the biggest and best sites around, and have links for most well-known artists to keep you surfing for hours. Update February/2002: We have now indexed 1200 arts sites, and offer more than 32,000 links to an estimated 100,000 works by 7,500 renowned artists.
  

most effective: The Artcyclopedia's custom search engine is already the fastest way to search the Net for information about fine artists. Period.
  

museum-quality: There are scads of artists with home pages on the Web, many of whom are extremely talented. But we can't list every site, and we really don't want to set ourselves up as arbiters of who produces &quot;quality&quot; art and who doesn't - making such a judgment is impossible over the Internet in any case. We feel that fairest approach is to rely on the worldwide network of museum professionals to make that call. So our general policy is, if an artist is in an arts museum collection, then he or she is qualified to be listed in our database. See our Information for Artists page for more specific information. 

  
What is and is not in the Artcyclopedia's database?
  
We only provide references to sites on the World Wide Web where artists' works can be viewed online. For calendars of real-world museum exhibits, try a resource such as Gallery Guide Online, or Traditional Fine Arts Online, or the Art Museum Network's ExCalendar, all of which seem to do an excellent job.
  
The vast majority of the fine artists in our database specialize in painting and sculpture. We do include other artistic media where possible. Examples of these types of media are: 
photography (e.g. Ansel Adams, Berenice Abbott, Man Ray, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Dorothea Lange, Alfred Stieglitz, and Cindy Sherman) 
decorative arts (e.g. Carl Fabergé, René Lalique, and Louis Comfort Tiffany) 
installation art (e.g. Dan Flavin and Ed Kienholz) 
video, digital and web-based art (e.g. Jenny Holzer, Bill Viola, and Nam June Paik) 
naïve art/folk art/outsider art (e.g. Edward Hicks and Grandma Moses) 
architecture (e.g. Frank Lloyd Wright and Andrea Palladio) 
Note that we are primarily oriented to searching by artist name, although we intend to add more and more access by artistic movement, nation, timeline and medium. At the moment we do not have entries for artworks by unknown artists. This includes works with such attributions as &quot;follower of&quot;, &quot;workshop of&quot;, or &quot;school of&quot; given artists. We do have entries for certain notable individual artists whose names have been lost (for example, the Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece).
  
  
Who is behind this project?
  
The Artcyclopedia was created by John Malyon, an IT professional, web developer, and entrepreneur currently living in Calgary, Canada. Here is a brief overview of John's background:

17 years in the software industry 
10 years project leader roles 
9 years data modeling and online interface design 
first exposed to the Internet through the WELL, the legendary online community, of which he was a member for several years in the early nineties 
fine arts webmaster for 3 years 
sometime writer (one professional credit to date: At the Robot Olympics, published in the Whole Earth Review, Spring 1992) 
John's current project is to develop a system for commercializing the Artcyclopedia in such a way as to add value for visitors (by providing them with additional useful and relevant information), rather than subtracting value (e.g. through indiscriminate use of banners).

Frequently Asked Questions


Why isn't artist X listed on your site? 
Can you tell me everything about artist X? 
How much is this etching/edition by artist X worth? 
How much is this painting by artist X worth? 
I think I own a valuable painting. What should I do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Why isn't artist X listed on your site?
  
Keep in mind that our site is an Internet search tool, not a forum for assessing which artists are &quot;museum-quality&quot; and which aren't. If an artist's work doesn't happen to be viewable online at one of the sites we have indexed, then they won't be in our database.
  
If you want to suggest an artist for inclusion, please look over our guidelines. Note that we already have a backlog of suggestions, and adding links in this way is a rather time-consuming process.
  
  
Can you tell me everything about artist X?
  
Pretty much everything we can tell you about an artist we put on the artist pages. If you need more than is available at any of the sites the Artcyclopedia links to, I suggest heading to Alta Vista and Google, which I find to be the largest and most effective search engines.
  
Another excellent place to research fine artists is the Grove Dictionary of Art site. It's a pay site, but as of this writing you can still register for a 24-hour free trial.
  
You can also find the print edition of the Grove in better libraries. For better-known artists, you'll probably find entire books about them there, or within the inter-library loan system.
  
  
How much is this etching/edition by artist X worth?
  
Valuation of prints and etchings is very complicated, and I don't have any resources in this area whatsoever. I recommend finding a gallery who has some knowledge of the field and paying them for an appraisal - the cost is usually reasonable. For collectible artists, a site like Ebay may also give you some insight into the real-world value of your work.
  
  
How much is this painting by artist X worth?
  
Here are some tools to help you come up with some idea of what your original work of art might be worth.
  
Prices for works by a given artist vary widely and wildly for many reasons, including:
auction prices are usually lower than gallery &quot;list&quot; prices 
size: larger is better, within reason 
medium: oil paintings are almost invariably the most valuable, followed distantly by watercolors, pastels, drawings, etc. 
period: is it from the artist's best period? 
subject matter: is it characteristic of the artist's most sought-after work? 
if a realistic work: does it have a girl or a horse in it? 
if an abstract work: do the dominant colors match common shades of sofas and drapes? 
provenance: has it been in the Rothschild family collection since they bought it from the artist 200 years ago (good), or does it have no traceable lineage before, say, 1946 (very very bad)? 
certainty of authentication: even if the work is signed by the artist it could be a forgery, or it could be a genuine work from the period on which the signature has been forged 
where the auction took place, geographically: is there a natural market for the artist's work? 
uncontrollable factors: rain, full moon, sunspot activity, etc. 
lastly, (and sometimes least) the actual artistic merit of the work 
Keeping the above in mind, it is possible to look up auction records in the reference section of your local library, to get a general idea of what an artist's works fetch. There are several annual publications which list hundreds of thousands of sales results. The public library I use, which is good but by no means world class, has three sets by different publishers.
  
One good online resource is Artcult, which has a freely accessible database of price ranges for many artists. And if you are willing to pay, you can get full auction results online at several sites, including artnet.com and artprice.com.
  
  
I think I own a valuable artwork. What should I do?
  
First, what not to do: do NOT clean it, or reframe it, or restore it, by yourself. If it's on paper, do not give it too much light and never let it receive direct sunlight. And resist the temptation to remove layers of paint to see if the artist painted the women naked under their clothes.
  
(I have recently discovered a nice page at the North Carolina Museum of Art site which discusses conservation issues related to the display, storage, and transport of fine art.)
  
Now, if you think you have a valuable work of art, here's what to do:
Take a trip to the library to familiarize yourself with the artist's oeuvre and find out how much his works are typically worth (see above for more on this). This will help you determine how much is would be sensible to spend on the next few steps. 
Have the work authenticated and appraised. 
Insure the work as soon as possible. 
Get advice from a professional conservator. 
Sell the work, if you wish. 
Now, if you have reason to believe you own a valuable work of art, you should probably have it appraised. Sothebys and Christie's offer this service, as do many galleries. You can also find professional fine art appraisers in the Yellow Pages (under &quot;appraisers&quot; where I live). They should also be able to advise about authentication of your work.

&quot;If you're trying to soak up some culture on the Web, going about it by plugging a name into a search engine is bound to be frustrating.

Household Information - Past and Present

Household information is what this site is about and there are over 300 articles here.  The genesis of this site was a book published in 1881 called the Household Cyclopedia of General Information.  Many of the articles are from that book and are fascinating from a historical perspective and for research purposes.  At LoveToKnow, we liked the idea of a site for general household information a lot, so we decided to add articles that are up to date and germane to today's living and challenges.

Select a category below for articles from the Late 19th Century:

Agricultural Articles - Includes soil information, oats, barley, hay making, grafting a tree, etc.
Old Fashioned Recipes - Includes Old Fashioned gingerbread, cake, pudding, home made wine and many more.
Household Advice and Information - Includes articles like: Old Fashioned Cologne; How to live, Avoiding Nightmares, etc.
Paints and Dyes - Includes articles on how to make dyes, paints, pastes, etc.
Printing and Engraving - Includes articles on copying, printing, engraving and etching.
Metallurgy - Includes articles on assaying, casting, methods of steel making and more.
Home Crafts and Necessities - How to make Chinaware, tobacco pipes, stoneware pottery, etc.
Weights and Measures - Information on weight values, gravity of liquids, reading barometers, etc
Miscellaneous - Fishing history, dog age calculation, breeding canary's, etc.

Cyclopedia Cryptologia 

Welcome to Cyclopedia Cryptologia. This is an online encyclopedia of cryptographic protocols. There will be coverage of a few related topics such as encryption/decryption algorithms and a few historical references, but for the most part, the intent here is to be a reference on cryptographic protocols. Although my intent is to be as exhaustive as possible, the literature is increasingly broad and deep; the coverage I give it here will probably never be truly exhaustive. 

+++

Foreword 

This work is a cyclopedia, or a collection of articles relating to a particular field. In this case, the field is cryptographic protocols and protocol design. 

There are many thousands of papers in the field that have been published in recent years. Each of these has been developed by a single author or small group of authors, and generally each has evolved its own terminology and notation. They are published at academic conferences held at various intervals and by various organizations, or as thesis papers by various graduate students or academic researchers from different universities. 

A lot of the mental effort of reading these papers is devoted to learning the different notations and terminology preferred by each different team of writers, and a lot of the information is hard to collect and publish directly because of the diversity of the sources and of course the conflicts of copyright. The publication formats themselves range from plain text, to TeX, to HTML, to PostScript, to mere ink on paper. 

The purpose of a cyclopedia such as this is to collect as much of this information as possible together, with a unified notation, in a single electronic format, and under a single copyright. Of course, I will try to concentrate on that which is most useful, since there will necessarily be omissions. 

For now this cyclopedia is a work in progress. At some point in the future, when I am reasonably satisfied with it, I will probably publish it as a printed book. Regardless, the HTML version of it will remain available on the web, and work on it will most likely continue. 

My purpose in writing such a work is simply this: I want people to have in their hands the means of protecting themselves from eavesdroppers, blackmailers, extortionists, embezzlers, thieves, and worse. Now that information is mainly digital and electronic, the only meaningful protection from such entities is a working knowledge of cryptographic protocols. 

+++

Introduction 

Cyclopedia Cryptologia is a work in progress. There are a lot of articles that need to be written, and I've written only some of them. Twice a week or so, I sit down, review the last ten &quot;404 not found&quot; errors the site has generated, and pick one of them to write an article about, so that that particular URL will quit generating 404 errors. So far, the articles aren't very broadly researched -- They are mainly placeholders to be replaced by later versions as I bring the whole up to professional standards. 

Protocols are the heart and soul of applied cryptography. Protocols are the methods by which cryptography is used to get things done. 

For many centuries, cryptography was mainly involved only in the very simplest protocol -- sending secret messages. But the fact of the matter is, cryptography is also useful for many other types of transactions. Cryptography is a general tool for the management of information. There are a lot of things that can be done with cryptography, and this site is about how to do them. 

While encryption and decryption algorithms provide some of the materials of which useful structures are made, the materials have to be organized in a useful way to make useful structures. And that is what protocol designers do. We're going to cover a few encryption/decryption algorithms, but this cyclopedia is about protocols. Everyone can figure out how to make a mud hut; similarly, everyone can find the &quot;secret message&quot; protocol -- it's the simplest protocol in the universe. But just as a good building architect/engineer can develop a workable plan for a cathedral, a good protocol architect/engineer can develop incredibly useful complex cryptographic protocols, with surprising and subtle properties.

Notation and Terminology 
If someone has to spend a full second thinking about what notation means, then the author has clearly made a mistake. With that simple but exacting criterion in mind, here is the complete vocabulary of mathematical primitives that this work will use. 


() 
Parentheses denote a subexpression. Calculations inside a subexpression are to be done before the calculations outside of it. For example 
(2 * 3) + 5 = 11 but 2 * (3 + 5) = 16
Parentheses also enclose the arguments of a function. 
A, AB, A1 etc. 
Identifiers starting with a capital letter and including only capital letters or numbers represent strings or numbers. In this work, we do not differentiate between strings and numbers. 
Alice, Bob, etc. 
Capitalized identifiers represent actors in various protocols. Traditionally, these are alphabetic and alternate in gender, starting with Alice and Bob. Also, certain roles are traditionally associated with certain names: Trent is the trusted authority, Eve is the eavesdropper, Mallory is the active attacker, etc. These &quot;special&quot; names are outside and additional to the alphabetic run of names representing ordinary participants. 
*, /, +, -, %, 
asterisk, slash, the plus sign, the minus sign, and the percent sign are infix operators for multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and the modulo operator, respectively. The minus sign may also be used as a unary prefix operator for negation (subtraction from zero). 
, 
Comma is used as an infix operator for concatenation. 
&amp;, |, !, &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; 
The Ampersand, vertical bar, exclamation point, double left-angle, and double right-angle are the infix operators for binary and, binary or, binary inversion, leftward shift, and rightward shift. 
trunc(), frac(), time(), pubkey(), hash(), etc. 
identifiers in lower case, followed by parentheses, are functions. Functions are always followed by an open-paren, their arguments if any, and a close paren. For now some of these just have to stand, but when I'm pulling together all the loose ends before publication I'll try to provide definitions for them all. 

+++

Acknowledgements 
First of all, I need to give thanks to the many people who've contributed knowledge which I present here. 

Probably first among these is Bruce Schneier of Counterpane Security Systems, who wrote a book called Applied Cryptography, which serves as a one-volume introduction to the field. But there is a sharp limit to what can really be covered in one volume, and Mr. Schneier recognized this. In order that the inevitable shortcomings of a single volume would not hinder his readers from future research, his book has an extensive bibliography. He also maintains at his website an extensive bibliography of cryptographic papers available online, which has been a great help. I cannot state often enough how great a service to a researcher a good bibliography is, particularly in a field like Cryptography. Cryptography, until the last few decades, has not been much studied in the private sector, and publications about it have tended to be rare and secret. Since the revolution in studying cryptography that started to happen in the 1970's, where it's been coming out into the open and mathematicians have been getting to sink their teeth into it and shake, there's been a fever of scholarly articles, published in small journals and circulated to a few thousand people. These articles have covered huge amounts of ground, come out with truly breathtaking insights and mathematical techniques. But these articles were mostly unknown and inaccessible to the public -- until Schneier enumerated them in his bibliography. Since Schneier's book came out, it's been ten times easier to do research in the field of cryptography than it was before. Schneier has continued to contribute to the field with his company, Counterpane Systems, and with his email newsletter, the Crypto-gram. 

The second name I want to mention here is David Kahn, for his earlier work, The Code Breakers. This book purports to be a history of cryptography and cryptology throughout history, and in fact about half of it is devoted to that purpose. But the other half is mainly a history of cryptography and cryptology in the second world war. Prior to its publication in 1967, there had been nothing but a vast deep silence concerning cryptography, disturbed by the natterings of sunday-paper puzzle ciphers and occasional scandals of traitors divulging secrets and being quickly discredited and hushed up. 

Kahn had a daunting task before him in researching and reporting the cryptographic history of the world, and he did an admirable job. And like Schneier did after him, he compensated for his book being just one book by including a fantastically complete bibliography, to drag all the obscure sources that people would otherwise never have heard of out into the light. It is not too much to say that Kahn's book, by bringing knowledge of ciphers to a broader audience, may be one of the primary forces (the other being the seminal paper new directions in cryptography by Diffie and Hellman in 1976) which set off the astounding revolution in the study of cryptography that Schneier had before him when he started to write his book. 

The third major source of information I want to mention is not so well known as the other two: It is a book titled Advances in Cryptology 1981-1997, edited by Kevin McCurley and Claus Dieter Zeigler. The book is primarily an index to every paper published at these two conferences for 16 years, and is accompanied by a CD-ROM containing PDF copies of all the publications. While the publications of these conferences have been necessarily made in small runs and are therefore expensive and rare, this electronic document collecting sixteen highly eventful years of these publications has been a font of knowledge unsurpassed by any other single resource I have available to me and has saved me much effort in tracking down copies of publications long out of print and gathering dust in someone's attic. It turns the bibliography question on its head, taking the large data storage capacity available in an electronic format and simply putting all the papers there for perusal. And of course each paper has its own bibliography, so taken as a whole the bibliography given in this work eclipses either of the two above. 

Fourth, there is a team of three authors: Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone. These gentlemen are responsible for a book called the Handbook of Applied Cryptography. This is a book strictly about the mathematics and implementation of cryptography - while there is an entire chapter on the oft-overlooked problem of key management and other trust issues, it does not concern itself much with protocols and history. It is strictly a book about engineering, implementation and analysis, and for that purpose, it excels. 

I want to make a special thanks to Ronald Rivest, both for having a lot of truly neat ideas, and for taking the time and energy to make his publications available on the World Wide Web. People like Rivest realize that the march of progress is not just about ideas. It's also about access to ideas, and the general public benefits from ideas as well as the few peers in the field that receive the specialized publications in which these papers come out. So, to Rivest and other researchers like him, who take care to make their ideas available to more than just the specialists in their own disciplines, I'd like to extend a sincere and heartfelt thanks.</text>

Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography

This six-volume biographical dictionary was published between 1887 and 1889 and was one of the first and most definitive works of its kind published in America. It can still be found as a reference source in many libraries throughout America, and was republished in 1968 by the Gale Research Company. Unfortunately, a large number of its biographical sketches (perhaps as many as 200 of them) are entirely fictitious (a fact which Gale did not publicize when it reprinted the work). The fictitious entries were not discovered until almost thirty years after the original publication of the volumes. Almost all the false sketches describe pre-nineteenth century European scientists who travelled to the New World to study its natural history. 

Some of the false entries are more obvious in retrospect than others. For instance, the biography of Charles Henry Huon de Penanster, identified as a French botanist, almost exactly parallels the real life of Nicolas Thiery de Menonville (whose biography also appears in the Cyclopedia). The biography of Nicolas Henrion, a French scientist, reports that he arrived in South America in 1783, just as the Asiatic cholera broke out there. However, epidemic Asiatic cholera first broke out in South America only in 1835. Miguel da Fonseca e Silva Herrera, a Brazilian historian, was said to have been presented with a gold medal by the historical institute of Rio de Janeiro in 1820, even though this society was not founded until 1838. 

Most of the false entries are fairly dry, but a few are more colorful, such as that of Jean Pierre de Vogué, a Flemish adventurer who apparently ended his days wandering through the Brazilian rainforest in search of the fabled &quot;Mountain of Wealth&quot;, and the Spanish geographer Andres Vicente y Bennazar who reportedly published a map of the world clearly displaying both North and South America sixteen years before Columbus sailed to the Americas. The author (or authors) of the false entries is not known, but the motive for writing the pieces was probably financial since contributors to the Cyclopedia were paid by space, and the articles were generally checked only for form.

VOGUÉ, Jean Pierre de, Flemish adventurer,
b. in Malines in 1570; d. in Brazil in 1630. He
was a captain in the Spanish army when, hearing
the fabulous description of the country of the Es-
meraldas, he went to Espiritu Santo, in Brazil,
and succeeded to the command of the colony
that had been founded there. The establish-
ment soon dissolved, as the adventurers were only
anxious for riches; and Vogué, having announced 
that he knew the location of the Mountain of
Wealth, was soon at the head of a host, and led
an expedition to the interior of the Mamalucos
country, wandering for several years through cen-
tral and south Brazil, and suffering many mis-
fortunes. His confidence in ultimate success was
never shaken, but he was abandoned by his follow-
ers, and fell at last into the hands of the Charcas
Indians. It is supposed that he died during his
captivity, although the &quot;Colleccão de alguns manu-
scriptos curiosos&quot; credits to him the work &quot;Jor-
nada por el descobrimento de las Serras Esme-
raldas&quot; (Seville, 1690).

VICENTE Y BENNAZAR, Andres (ve-then'-
tay), Spanish geographer, lived in the second half
of the 15th century. He published at Antwerp
in 1476 four charts, representing the four conti-
nents of the world. Unlike Columbus, he did not
imagine America to be part of Asia, but repre-
sented it as a distinct continent and, what is more
remarkable, as a continent divided into two parts
by an isthmus. This publication, at so early a
date, and before columbus's discovery, has caused 
much discussion. Some authorities think that
Vicente y Bennazar had arrived at the conclusion
that America existed as a distinct continent;
others, that such an opinion was general among
scientific circles in the 15th century; and still
others, that he only intended to reproduce the lost
Atlantis spoken of by Plato and the ancients.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
* 3 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (optional)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]]s [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (or to taste)
* 1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:pepper|black pepper]] (or to taste)

== Procedure ==

# Crack eggs into a measuring cup.
# Add the milk (if desired) and salt.
# Using a whisk or fork, beat the mixture until foamy. 
# Melt 2 tsp. butter in a frying pan on medium heat
# Pour eggs into frying pan.
# Stir mixture to break up the egg as it cooks and allow more liquid to touch the hot pan. Stirring rapidly will create small curds, while slower stirring will create larger curds.
# Cook until just before you feel that they are done, since the eggs will continue to cook after being removed from the pan. The eggs are done when the sheen disappears; stop cooking just before this happens.
# Transfer to a plate.
# Season with black pepper (black pepper will burn and become bitter if seasoned before cooking)
Serves one.  Good eaten as is or with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] ([[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]), [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]] and/or butter on [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]].

== Variations ==

* For a [[Cookbook:Low-sodium Cooking|low sodium]] version, omit salt and use unsalted butter.

* Grated [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]] can be added into the mixture or on top of the cooked eggs.

* Sour cream may be used in place of milk for a creamier and richer version.

* Cook 1/3 cup of crumbled cooked meats (like [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]) or chopped vegetables (like [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]) for a couple of minutes before adding the egg mixture. See also [[Cookbook:Southwestern Scramble|Southwestern Scramble]].

== Fried Pita Bread with Eggs ==
===Ingredients===
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 pita bread
* 2 eggs
===Procedure===
* salt and black pepper
# In a heavy skillet heat the oil at medium low temperature
# Tear the pita into small pieces and add to the hot oil
# Cook, stirring frequently, until the bread is lightly browned and crispy.
# Add the eggs and scramble them with the bread.
# Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste and serve.
Serves one. This is a Westernised version of a dish from Yemen.

== Cornstarch creamy Scrambled Eggs ==
===Ingredients===
*3 large eggs
*3 tablespoons unsalted butter
*1.½ tablespoons whole milk
*1.¾ teaspoons cornstarch or potato starch
===Procedure===
# In a separate cup, whisk together the milk and cornstarch until it is free of lumps.
# Add the milk cornstarch mixture to your eggs, and beat until smooth. +Season with salt. 
# Heat a non-stick skillet over high heat until hot, then add the butter (should sizzle right away). Wait until the butter’s melted and bubbly, but before it browns.
# Add the beaten eggs. Wait without stirring anything, until the edges of the eggs start to bubble up…about 3 seconds… 1, 2, 3 ...Then remove the skillet from the heat. (yes, remove!)
# After removing the skillet from the heat,  start stirring the eggs, making 1 full circle per second… 1, 2, 3, ...9, 10, 11, ... (If you use a mini skillet instead of a large one, it may need a few more seconds).
# After 11 to 12 seconds. The eggs will have absorbed all the butter, but remain partially undercooked. This is when you transfer them onto a plate. Do not wait until they look fully cooked! (+5 seconds more for every +3 extra eggs you’re scrambling, but I would not make more than 6 at once!)
# Season with black pepper to taste and serve.
Serves one.

==The Classification System==

In order to understand the exact place of humanity among the animals, it is
helpful to describe the system used by biologists to classify living things. The basic system was devised by 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl von Linné.

The purpose of the Linnean system was simply to create order in the great mass of
confusing biological data that had accumulated by that time. Von Linné classified living things on the basis of overall similarities into small groups or species. On the basis of homologies, groups of like species are organized into larger, more inclusive groups, called genera.

Through careful comparison and analysis, von Linné and those who have
come after him have been able to classify specific animals into a series of
larger and more inclusive groups up to the largest and most inclusive of
all, the animal kingdom.

==The Primate Order==
Primates are only one of several mammalian orders, such as rodents, carnivores,
and ungulates.

As such, primates share a number of features with other mammals:
*mammals are intelligent animals
*in most species, the young are born live, the egg being retained within the womb of the female until it achieves an advanced state of growth
* once born, the young are nourished by their mothers
* mammals have a constant body temperature, an efficient respiratory system featuring a separation between the nasal and mouth cavities, an efficient four-chambered heart that prevents mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, among other characteristics
*the skeleton of most mammals is simplified compared to that of most reptiles, in that it has fewer bones. For example, the lower jaw consists of a single bone, rather than several.

==Species==
In modern evolutionary biology, the term species is usually defined as a
population or group of organisms that look more or less alike and that is
potentially capable of interbreeding to produce fertile offspring.
Practically speaking, individuals are usually assigned to a species based
on their appearance, but it is their ability to interbreed that ultimately
validates (or invalidates) the assignment. Thus, no matter how similar two
populations may look, if they are incapable of interbreeding, they must be
assigned to different species.

Populations within a species that are quite capable of interbreeding but
may not regularly do so are called races or subspecies.
Evolutionary theory suggests that species evolve from races through the
accumulation of differences in the gene pools of the separated groups.

==Primate Characteristics==
Although living primates are a varied group of animals, they do have a
number of features in common. These features are displayed in varying
degrees by the different kinds of primates: in some they are barely
detectable, while in others they are greatly elaborated.

All are useful in one way or another to arboreal (or tree-dwelling)
animals, although they are not essential to life in trees.

===Primate Sense Organs===
The primates' adaptation to their way of life in the trees coincided with
changes in the form and function of their sensory apparatus: the senses of
sight and touch became highly developed, and the sense of smell declined.

Catching insects in trees, as the early primates did and as many still
do, demands quickness of movement and the ability to land in the right
place without falling. Thus, they had to be adept at judging depth,
direction, distance and the relationship of objects in space.

Primates' sense of touch also became highly developed as a result of
arboreal living. An effective feeling and grasping
mechanism was useful to them in grabbing their insect prey, and by preventing them from falling and
tumbling while moving through the trees.

===The Primate Brain===
By far the most outstanding characteristic in primate evolution has been
the enlargement of the brain among members of the order. Primate brains
tend to be large, heavy in proportion to body weight, and very complex.

Reasons for this important change in brain size are many:
*Prior to 65 Myrs ago, mammals seem to have been nocturnal in their habits; after 65 million years ago, primates began to carry out their activities in the daylight hours. As a consequence, the sense of vision took on greater importance, and so visual acuity was favored by natural selection
* another hypothesis involves the use of the hand as a tactile organ to replace the teeth and jaws. The hands assumed some of the grasping, tearing and dividing functions of the snout, again requiring development of the brain centers for more complete coordination.
* The enlarged cortex not only provided the primates with a greater degree of efficiency in the daily struggle for survival but also gave them the basis for more sophisticated cerebration or thought. The ability to think probably played a decisive role in the evolution of the primates from which human beings emerged.

===Primate Teeth===
Although they have added other things than insects to their diets,
primates have retained less specialized teeth than other mammals.

The evolutionary trend for primate dentition has generally been toward
economy, with fewer, smaller, more efficient teeth doing more work.
::Our own 32 teeth are fewer in number than those of some, and more generalized than most, primates.

===Primate Skeleton===
A number of factors are responsible for the shape of the primate skull as
compared with those of most other mammals: changes in dentition, changes in
the sensory organs of sight and smell, and increase in brain size. As a
result, primates have more a humanlike face than other mammals.

The upper body is shaped such as to allow greater maneuverability of
the arms, permitting them to swing sideways and outward from the trunk of
the body.

The structural characteristics of the primate foot and hand make grasping
possible; the digits are extremely flexible, the big toe is fully opposable
to the other digits in most species, and the thumb is opposable to the
other digits to varying degrees. The flexible, unspecialized primate hand
was to prove a valuable asset for future evolution of this group. It
allowed early hominines to manufacture and utilize tools and thus embark on
the new and unique evolutionary pathway that led to the revolutionary
ability to adapt through culture.

==Types of Living Primates==
===Prosimians===
The most primitive of the primates are represented by the various prosimians, including the lemurs and the lorises, which are more similar anatomically to earlier mammalian ancestors than are other primates (monkeys, apes, humans). They tend to exhibit certain more ancestral features, such as a more pronounced reliance on olfaction (sense of smell). Their greater olfactory capabilities are reflected in the presence of a moist, fleshy pad at the end of the nose and in a relatively long snout.

Lemurs and lorises represent the same general adaptive level. Both groups exhibit good grasping and climbing abilities and a fairly well developed visual apparatus, although their vision is not completely stereoscopic, and color
vision may not be as well developed as in anthropoids.

====Lemurs====
At present, lemurs are found only on the island of Madagascar and adjacent islands off the east coast of Africa.

As the only natural nonhuman primates on this island, they diversified into numerous and varied ecological niches without competition from monkeys and apes. Thus, the 52 surviving species on Madagascar represent an evolutionary pattern that has vanished elsewhere.

Lemurs range in size from 5 inches to a little over two feet. While the larger lemurs are diurnal and exploit a wide variety of dietary items (leaves, fruits, buds, bark), the smaller forms (mouse and dwarf lemurs) are nocturnal and insectivorous.

Lemurs display considerable variation regarding numerous other aspects of behavior. While many are primarily arboreal, others (e.g. ring-tailed lemur) are more terrestrial. Some arboreal species are quadrupeds, and others are vertical clingers and leapers.

====Lorises====
Lorises are similar in appearance to lemurs, but were able to survive in mainland areas by adopting a nocturnal activity pattern at a time when most other prosimians became extinct. Thus, they were (and are still) able to avoid competition with more recently evolved primates (diurnal monkeys).

There are five loris species, all of which are found in tropical forest and woodland habitats of India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and Africa.

Locomotion in lorises is a slow, cautious climbing form of quadrupedalism, and flexible hip joints permit suspension by hind limbs while the hands are used in feeding. Some lorises are almost entirely insectivorous; others supplement their diet with various combinations of fruits, leaves, gums, etc.

====Tarsiers====
There are seven recognized species, all restricted to island areas in Southeast Asia. They inhabit a wide range of forest types, from tropical forest to backyard gardens.

They are nocturnal insectivores, leaping onto prey from lower branches and shrubs. They appear to form stable pair bonds, and the basic tarsier social unit is a mated pair and their young offspring.

Tarsiers present a complex blend of characteristics not seen in other primates. They are unique in that their enormous eyes, which dominate much of the face, are immobile within their sockets. To compensate for this inability to move the eyes, tarsiers are able to rotate their heads 180º, like owls.

===Simians===
Although there is much variation among simians (also called anthropoids), there are certain
features that, when taken together, distinguish them as a group from
prosimians (and other mammals)
* generally larger body size
* larger brain
* reduced reliance on the sense of smell
* increased reliance on vision, with forward-facing eyes placed at the front of the face
* greater degree of color vision
* back of eye socket formed by a bony plate
* blood supply to brain different from that of prosimians
* fusion of two sides of mandible at midline to form one bone
* less specialized dentition
* differences with regard to female internal reproductive anatomy
* longer gestation and maturation periods
* increased parental care
* more mutual grooming

====Monkeys====
Approximately 70 percent of all primates (about 240 species) are monkeys, although it is frequently impossible to give precise numbers of species because the taxonomic status of some primates remains in doubt and there are constantly new discoveries.

Monkeys are divided into two groups (New World and Old World) separated by geographical area as well as by several million years of separate evolutionary history.

'''New World monkeys''' exhibit a wide range of size, diet, and ecological adaptation. In size, they vary from tiny marmosets and tamarins to the 20-pound howler monkey. Almost all are exclusively arboreal; most are diurnal. Although confined to trees, New World monkeys can be found in a wide range of arboreal environments throughout most forested areas in Southern Mexico and Central and South America. One of the characteristics distinguishing New World monkeys from Old World is the shape of their nose: they have broad noses with outward-facing nostrils.

'''Old World monkeys''' display much more morphological and behavioral diversity than New World monkeys. Except for humans, they are the most widely distributed of all living primates. They are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, ranging from tropical jungle habitats to semiarid desert and even to seasonally snow-covered areas in northern Japan. Most are quadrupedal and primarily arboreal.

====Apes and humans====
This group is made up of several families:
* Hylobatidae (gibbons and siamangs)
* Pongidae (orangutans)
* Hominidae (humans, gorillas, common chimpanzees, bonobos)

They differ from monkeys in numerous ways:
* generally larger body size, except for gibbons and siamangs
* absence of a tail
* shortened trunk
* differences in position and musculature of the shoulder joint (adapted for suspensory locomotion)
* more complex behavior
* more complex brain and enhanced cognitive abilities
* increased period of infant development and dependency.

====Orangutans====
Found today only in heavily forested areas on the Indonesian islands of Borneo and Sumatra, orangutans are slow, cautious climbers whose locomotor behavior can best be described as &quot;four-handed&quot;, a tendency to use all four limbs for grasping and support. Although they are almost completely arboreal, they do sometimes travel quadrupedally on ground. They are very large animals with pronounced sexual dimorphism: males weigh over 200 pounds while females are usually less than 100 pounds.

====Gorillas====
The largest of all living primates, gorillas are today confined to forested areas of western and equatorial Africa. There are four generally recognized subspecies: Western Lowland Gorilla, Cross River Gorilla, Eastern Lowland Gorilla, and Mountain Gorilla. Gorillas exhibit strong sexual dimorphism. Because of their weight, adult gorillas, especially males, are primarily terrestrial and adopt a semiquadrupedal (knuckle-walking) posture on the ground. All gorillas are almost exclusively vegetarian.

====Common Chimpanzees====
The best-known of all nonhuman primates, Common Chimpanzees are found in equatorial Africa. In many ways, they are structurally similar to gorillas, with corresponding limb proportions and upper body shape, because of their similar locomotion when on the ground (quadrupedal knuckle-walking). However, chimps spend more time in trees; when on the ground, they frequently walk bipedally for short distances when carrying food or other objects.

They are highly excitable, active and noisy. Common Chimpanzee social behavior is complex, and individuals form lifelong attachments with friends and relatives.  They live in large, fluid communities of as many as 50 individuals or more. At the core of a community is a group of bonded males. They act as a group to defend their territory and are highly intolerant of unfamiliar chimps, especially nongroup males.

====Bonobos====
Found only in an area south of the Zaire River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bonobos (also called Pygmy Chimpanzees) have a strong resemblance to Common Chimpanzees, but are somewhat smaller. Yet they exhibit several anatomical and behavioral differences.  Physically, they have a more linear body build, longer legs relative to the arms, a relatively smaller head, and a dark face from birth. Bonobos are more arboreal than Common Chimpanzees, and they appear to be less excitable and aggressive. 

Like Common Chimpanzees, Bonobos live in geographically based, fluid communities, and they exploit many of the same foods, including occasional meat derived from killing small mammals. But they are not centered around a group of closely bonded males. Instead, male-female bonding is more important than in Common Chimpanzees.

#''What are the implications of the shared characteristics between humans and the other primates?''
#''Why do anthropologists study the social behavior of monkeys and apes?''

__toc__

Information about primate behavior and ecology plays an integral role in the story of human evolution.

# Humans are primates, and the first members of the human species were probably more similar to living nonhuman primates than to any other animals on earth. Thus, by studying living primates we can learn something about the lives of our ancestors.
# Humans are closely related to primates and similar to them in many ways. If we understand how evolution has shaped the behavior of animals so much like ourselves, we may have greater insights about the way evolution has shaped our own behavior and the behavior of our ancestors.

==Primate social behavior==
Over the past four decades, primatologists have made prolonged close-range observations of monkeys and apes in their natural habitats, and we are discovering much about social organization, learning ability, and communication among our closest relatives (chimpanzees, and gorillas) in the animal kingdom.

In particular, we are finding that a number of behavioral traits that we used to think of as distinctively human are found to one degree or another among other primates, reminding us that many of the differences between us and them are differences of degree, rather than kind.

===The Group===
Primates are social animals, living and travelling in groups that vary in size from species to species. In most species, females and their offspring constitute core of social system.

Among chimps, the largest organizational unit is the community, composed of 50 or more individuals. Rarely however are all these animals together at a single time. Instead they are usually ranging singly or in small subgroups consisting of adult males together, females with their young, or males and females together with their young. In the course of their travels, subgroups may join forces and forage together, but sooner or later these will break up into smaller units.

===Dominance===
Many primate societies are organized into dominance hierarchies, that impose some degree of order with groups by establishing parameters of individual behavior.

Although aggression is frequently a means of increasing one's status, dominance usually serves to reduce the amount of actual physical violence. Not only are lower-ranking animals unlikely to attack or even threaten a higher-ranking one, but dominant animals are also frequently able to exert control simply by making a threatening gesture.

Individual rank or status may be measured by access to resources, including food items and mating partners.

An individual's rank is not permanent and changes throughout life. It is influenced by many factors, including sex, age, level of aggression, amount of time spent in the group, intelligence, etc.

In species organized into groups containing a number of females associated with one or several adult males, the males are generally dominant to females. Within such groups, males and females have separate hierarchies, although very high ranking females can dominate the lowest-ranking males (particularly young ones).

Yet many exceptions to this pattern of male dominance:
* Among many lemur species, females are the dominant sex
* Among species that form monogamous pairs (e.g., indris, gibbons), males and females are codominant

===Aggression===
Within primate societies, there is an interplay between affiliative behaviors that promote group cohesion and aggressive behaviors that can lead to group disruption. Conflict within a group frequently develops out of competition for resources, including mating partners and food items. Instead of actual attacks or fighting, most intragroup aggression occurs in the form of various signals and displays, frequently within the context of dominance hierarchy. Majority of such situations are resolved through various submissive and appeasement behaviors.

But conflict is not always resolved peacefully.
* High-ranking female macaques frequently intimidate, harass, and even attack lower-ranking females, particularly to restrict their access to food
* Competition between males for mates frequently results in injury and occasionally in death
* Aggressive encounters occur between groups as well as within groups
* Aggression occurs in the defense of territories

===Individual interaction===
To minimize actual violence and to defuse potentially dangerous situations, there is an array of affiliative, or friendly, behaviors that serve to reinforce bonds between individuals and enhance group stability. Common affiliative behaviors include reconciliation, consolation, and simple interactions between friends and relatives.

Most such behaviors involve various forms of physical contact including touching, hand holding, hugging, and, among chimpanzees, kissing. In fact, physical contact is one of the most important factors in primate development and is crucial in promoting peaceful relationships in many
primate social groups.

One of the most notable primate activities is grooming, the ritual cleaning of another animal's coat to remove parasites, shreds of grass or other matter. Among bonobos and chimps, grooming is a gesture of friendliness, submission, appeasement or closeness.

The mother-infant bond is the strongest and most long-lasting in the group. It may last for many years; commonly for the lifetime of the mother.

===Play===
Frequent play activity among primate infants and juveniles is a means of learning about the environment, testing strength, and generally learning how to behave as adults. For example, Chimpanzee infants mimic the food-getting activities of their mothers, &quot;attack&quot; dozing adults, and &quot;harass&quot; adolescents.

===Communication===
Primates, like many animals, vocalize. They have a great range of calls that are often used together with movements of the face or body to convey a message.

Observers have not yet established the meaning of all the sounds, but a good number have been distinguished, such as warning calls, threat calls, defense calls, and gathering calls. Much of the communication takes place by the use of specific gestures and postures.

===Home range===
Primates usually move about within circumscribed areas, or home ranges, which are of varying sizes, depending on the size of the group and on ecological factors, such as availability of food. Home ranges are often moved seasonally. The distance traveled by a group in a day varies, but may
include many miles.

Within this home range is a portion known as the core area, which contains the highest concentration of predictable resources (water, food) and where the group is most frequently found (with resting places and sleeping trees).

The core area can also be said to be a group's territory, and it is this portion of the home range that is usually defended against intrusion by others:
* Gorillas do not defend their home ranges against incursions of others of their kind
* Chimps, by contrast, have been observed patrolling their territories to ward off potential trespassers

Among primates in general, the clearest territoriality appears in forest species, rather than in those that are terrestrial in their habits.

===Tool use===
A tool may be defined as an object used to facilitate some task or activity. A distinction must be made between simple tool use and tool making, which involves deliberate modification of some material for its intended use.

In the wild, gorillas do not make or use tools in any significant way, but chimpanzees do. Chimps modify objects to make them suitable for particular purposes. They can also pick up and even prepare objects for future use at some other location, and they can use objects as tools to
solve new and novel problems.

Examples:
* use of stalks of grass to collect termites
* use of leaves as wipes or sponges to get water out of a hollow to drink
* use of rocks as hammers and anvils to open palm nuts and hard fruits

==Primates and human evolution==

Studies of monkeys and apes living today [especially those most closely
related to humans: gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees] provide essential
clues in the reconstruction of adaptations and behavior patterns involved
in the emergence of our earliest ancestors.

These practices have several implications:
* Chimpanzees can be engaged in activities that prepare them for a future (not immediate) task at a somewhat distant location. These actions imply planning and forethought
* Attention to the shape and size of the raw material indicates that chimpanzee toolmakers have a preconceived idea of what the finished product needs to be in order to be useful

To produce a tool, even a simple tool, based on a concept is an extremely complex behavior. Scientists previously believed that such behavior was the exclusive domain of humans, but now we must question this very basic assumption.

At the same time, we must be careful about how we reconstruct this development. Primates have changed in various ways from earlier times, and undoubtedly certain forms of behavior that they now exhibit were not found among their ancestors.

Also it is important to remember that present-day primate behavior shows considerable variation, not just from one species to another, but also from one population to another within a single species.

==Primate fossils==

The study of early primate fossils tells us something we can use to interpret the evolution of the entire primate line, including ourselves. It gives us a better understanding of the physical forces that caused these primitive creatures to evolve into today's primates.

Ultimately, the study of these ancient ancestors gives us a fuller knowledge of the processes through which insect-eating, small-brained animals evolved into a toolmaker and thinker that is recognizably human.

===Rise of the primates===
For animals that have often lived where conditions for fossilization are generally poor, we do have a surprisingly large number of primate fossils. Some are relatively complete skeletons, while most are teeth and jaw fragments.

Primates arose as part of a great adaptive radiation that began more than 100 million years after the appearance of the first mammals. The reason for this late diversification of mammals was that most ecological niches that they have since occupied were either preempted by reptiles or were nonexistent until the flowering plants became widespread beginning about 65 million years ago.

By 65 million years ago, primates were probably beginning to diverge from other mammalian lineages (such as those which later led to rodents, bats and carnivores). For the period between 65-55 Myrs ago (Paleocene), it is extremely difficult to identify the earliest members of the primate order:
* available fossil material is scarce
* first primates were not easily distinguished from other early (generalized) mammals

===Eocene primates===
First fossil forms that are clearly identifiable as primates appeared during Eocene (55-34 million years ago). From this period have been recovered a wide variety of primates, which
can all be called prosimians. Lemur-like adapids were common in the Eocene, as were species of tarsier-like primates.

These first primates were insect eaters and their characteristics developed as an adaptation to the initial tree-dwelling environment:
* larger, rounder braincases
* nails instead of claws
* eyes that are rotated forward, allowing overlapping fields of perception and thus binocular vision
* presence of opposable large toe

This time period exhibited the widest geographical distribution and broadest adaptive radiation ever displayed by prosimians. In recent years, numerous finds of Late Eocene (36-34 Myrs ago) suggest that members of the adapid family were the most likely candidates as ancestors of early anthropoids.

===Oligocene primates===
The center of action for primate evolution after Eocene is confined largely to Old World. Only on the continents of Africa and Eurasia can we trace the evolutionary development of apes and hominids due to crucial geological events; particularly continental drift.

During the Oligocene (34-23 Myrs ago), great deal of diversification among primates occurred. The vast majority of Old World primate fossils for this period comes from just one locality: the Fayum area of Egypt. From Fayum, 21 different species have been identified.

====Apidium====
*Most abundant of all Oligocene forms
*This animal was about size of squirrel
*Teeth suggest diet composed of fruits and probably seeds
*Preserved remains of the limbs indicate that this creature was a small arboreal quadruped, adept at leaping and springing

====Propliopithecus====
*Morphologically, quite primitive
*Not showing particular derived tendencies in any direction
*Small to medium in size
*Likely fruit eaters

====Aegyptopithecus====
*Largest of Fayum anthropoids, roughly the size of modern howler (13 to 18 pounds)
*Primitive skull, which is small and resembles the one of a monkey in some details
*From analysis of limb proportions and muscle insertions, Aegyptopithecus was a short-limbed, heavily muscled, slow-moving arboreal quadruped
*This form of primates important because, better than any other fossil primate, it bridges the gap between the Eocene prosimians and the Miocene hominoids.

===Miocene Primates===
A great abundance of hominoid fossil material has been found in the Old
World from the Miocene (23-7 million years ago).

Based on size, these fossils can be divided into two major subgroupings:
small-bodied and large-bodied hominoids.
* Small-bodied varieties comprise gibbon and siamang
* Large-bodied hominoids are Pongo (orangutan), Gorilla, Pan (chimpanzees and bonobos) and Homo. These four forms can then be subdivided into two major subgroups: Asian large-bodied (orangutan) and African large-bodied (gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans).

The remarkable evolutionary success represented by the adaptive radiation of large-bodied hominoids is shown in its geographical range from Africa to Eurasia. Large-bodied hominoids first evolved in Africa around 23 million years ago. Then they migrated into Eurasia,	dispersed rapidly and diversified into a variety of species. After 14 million years ago, we have evidence of widely distributed hominoids in many parts of Asia and Europe. The separation of the Asian large-bodied hominoid line from the African stock (leading ultimately to gorillas, chimps and humans) thus would have occurred at about that time.

====African Forms====
*A wealth of early hominoid fossils has come from deep and rich stratigraphic layers of Kenya and Uganda
*These diverse forms are presently classified into at least 23 species of hominoids
*Best samples and thus best known forms are those of genus Proconsul
*Environmental niches were quite varied: some species were apparently confined to dense rain forests, others potentially exploited more open woodlands
*Considerable diversity of locomotor behaviors: some were at least partially terrestrial - on the ground, some may have even occasionally adopted a bipedal position
*Most forms were probably fruit eaters, some may also have included considerable amounts of leaves in their diet

====European Forms====
*Very few fossils have been discovered
*Most researchers would place these forms into the genus Dryopithecus
*Evolutionary relationship with other hominoids is both difficult and controversial at this point.

====South/Southwest Asian Forms====
*Remains have been found in Turkey, India and Pakistan
*Attributed to genus Sivapithecus
*Probably good-sized hominoid (70-150 pounds), that inhabited a mostly arboreal niche
*Facial remains have concave profiles and projecting incisors, which bear striking similarities with the orangutan
*Other traits are distinctively unlike an orangutan. For example, the forelimb suggests a unique mixture of traits, indicating probably some mode of arboreal quadrupedalism but with no suspensory component.

==Miocene apes and Human Origin==
The large-bodied African hominoids appeared by 16 million years ago and were widespread even as recently as 8 million years ago.

Based on fossils of teeth and jaws, it was easy to postulate some sort of relationship between them and humans. A number of features: position of incisors, reduced canines, thick enamel of the molars, and shape of tooth row, seemed to point in a somewhat human direction.

Although the African hominoids display a number of features from which hominine characteristics may be derived, and some may occasionally have walked bipedally, they were much too apelike to be considered hominines. 

Nevertheless, existing evidence allows the hypothesis that apes and humans separated from a common evolutionary line sometime during the Late Miocene and some fossils, particularly the African hominoids, do possess traits associated with humans.

Not all African apes evolved into hominines. Those that remained in the forests and woodlands continued to develop as arboreal apes, although ultimately some of them took up a more terrestrial life. These are the bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas, who have changed far more from the ncestral condition than have the still arboreal orangutans.

==Summary==

;When did the first primates appear, and what were they like?
::The earliest primates had developed by 60 million years ago and were small, arboreal insect eaters. Their initial adaptation to life in trees set the stage for the	subsequent appearance of other primate models.

;When did the first monkeys and apes appear, and what were they like?
::By the Late Eocene (about 37 Myrs ago), monkeys and apes about the size of modern house cats were living in Africa. By about 20 million years ago, they had proliferated and soon spread over many parts of the Old World. Some forms remained relatively small, while others became quite large, some even larger than present-day gorillas.

;When did group of primates give rise to the human line of evolution?
::Present evidence suggests that our own ancestors are to be found among the African large-bodied hominoids, which were widespread between approximately 17 and 8 million years ago. Some of these ape-like primates lived in situations in which the right kind of selective pressure existed to transform them into primitive hominines.

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|150px|Vitruvian Man by Leonardo Da Vinci]]

The Italian Renaissance of the 13th and 14th centuries spread through the rest of Europe, representing a time when Europe sought knowledge from the ancient world and moved out of the Dark Ages. A renewed interest in science and experimentation, and a focus on the importance of living well in the present as opposed to the afterlife as promoted by the Church. The Renaissance brought on an explosion in art, poetry, and architecture. New techniques and styles developed as these art forms moved away from the colder and darker styles of the Middle Ages. This period, in this view, represents Europe emerging from a long period of backwardness and the rise of trade and exploration. The [[w:Italian Renaissance|Italian Renaissance]] is often labeled as the beginning of the &quot;modern&quot; epoch.

However, it is important to recognize the countless modern institutions that did have their roots in the [[w:Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], such as nation-states, parliaments, limited government, bureaucracies, and regulation of goods and services.

==Origins==

In the wake of the [[w:Black Death|Black Death]], which decreased in incidence in 1351, faith in  the power and significance of the church declined. The multitude of deaths (approximately 25-30 million between 1347 and 1351) signaled the need for a revival in art, education, and society in general. A large decrease in workers led to demands for higher wages, and thus uprisings were staged in several countries throughout Europe, particularly Germany, France, and Italy. 

The Renaissance began in northern Italy in the early 1300s.
Although it was not inevitable, several factors—nationalism (due to an increased pride in the days of early Rome), the [[w:Crusades|Crusades]], revival of trade—helped to bring about reform. Throughout Italy (Florence, Genoa, Rome, Naples, and Milan in particular) scholars revived their studies of early Greek and Latin literature, derived from archived manuscripts. Upon examining these early works, they realized that culture was essential to living a meaningful life, and education (especially history) was important  in understanding both the world of yesterday and contemporary times, as well as gaining insight into the future. Thus, Italian scholars called for a 'Renaissance' (French for rebirth) in European education and culture.

==Social Order and Cultural Change==

===Florentine Social Divisions===
The denizens of Florence fell into one of four main social classes. These included the ''grandi'' (the great), the rulers of the city; the ''popolo grosso'' (big people), the capitalist merchants (these challenged the ''grandi'' for power); the smaller businesspeople, and the ''popolo minuto'' (little people), the lower economic classes, such as the paupers, who, despite constituting a third of the Florentine population, had no wealth at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Western Heritage&quot;&gt;Kagan, Donalt et al. The Western Heritage Since 1300. 3rd ed. New Jersey:Pearson Prentice Hall, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This division of society was prone to conflict, and eventually resulted in the successful [[w:Ciompi Revolt|Ciompi Revolt]] of 1378. The Ciompi Revolt was that of the poor, who revolted because of the constant feuds between the ''grandi'' and the ''popolo grosso'', the anarchy from the Black Death, and the collapse of banks, which made the ''popolo minuto'' even poorer. After a while, the Ciompi Revolt led to a four-year reign by the ''popolo minuto'' until Cosimo de’ Medici came into power in 1434 and restored the stability of Florence.

===The Household===
The plague resulted in more favorable working positions for women, although the overall participation of women in public life varied with class as well as region.  Married couples worked together frequently, and most men and women remarried quickly if their spouse died.

===Underclass===
At the beginning of the Renaissance, the boundary between the poor and criminals was very thin.  Larger cities frequently had problems with organized gangs.  The so-called &quot;decent society&quot; treated the marginal elements of society with great suspicion and hatred.  Women were featured prominently in the underclass, and many poor women found prostitution their only option.  Male violence forced women into prostitution as well, as rape resulted in the stripping of a woman's social respectability and prospects for marriage.

===Hard Times for Business===
The [[w:Hundred Years' War|Hundred Years' War]] resulted in the various governments in Europe borrowing a great deal of money that they could not pay back.  Thus, merchants were less likely to take risks, and instead invested in government bonds.  The result of this was an overall decrease in trade.

==The Birth of Humanism==
[[Image:Pico della mirandola.jpg|thumb|200px|right|'''Pico della Mirandola''', 1463-1494, one of the most famous humanists of the Renaissance.  By an unknown artist, in the Uffizi, Florence.]]

At the time, Italy was the center of culture in Europe. Middle class writers were supported by noble patronage, and as a result, during the beginning of the Renaissance literature blossomed alongside classic revival.  This resulted in the rise of humanism, an intellectual movement that advocated the study of history and literature as the chief means of identifying with the glories of the ancient world.  Humanism advocated classical learning and active participation of the individual in civic affairs.

Renaissance scholars advocated the concept of &quot;returning to the sources,&quot; attempting to reconcile the disciplines of the Christian faith with ancient learning.   In addition, the concept of [[w:civic humanism|civic humanism]] arose, which advocated participation in government.  Civilization was inspired by the writings of Roman emperors, and by the end of the 1400s intellectuals had a command of the Latin language.

In the 1440s, [[w:Johannes Gutenberg|Johannes Gutenberg]] created a printing press with movable type. This revolution in communication greatly assisted in the spread of Renaissance ideals throughout Europe, allowing the ideas to be printed for mass circulation, for the first time in history. Gutenberg was the first European ever to create a printing press with a movable type, though the Chinese had long before innovated this technology. 

The Renaissance conception of life and man's role on earth was more secular than in the past, but in no way was it nonreligious.  It was now believed that God holds people above everything else, and that the greatest thing about being human is the human's free will to choose.  People were celebrated, as Renaissance scholars argued that men are made in God's image, and that we should celebrate our God-given talents and abilities.  People believed that life on Earth was intrinsically valuable, and that citizens should strive to be the best that they can.  The emphasis of the Renaissance was on the individual rather than the collective.

===Italian Humanists===
[[w:Francesco Petrarch|Francesco Petrarch]] (1304-1374) was an Italian scholar, poet, and early humanist.  In his sonnets, he created the image of real people with personality, debunking the typical Medieval conceptions and stereotypes of people.

[[w:Giovanni Boccaccio|Giovanni Boccaccio]] (1313-1375) wrote ''[[w:The Decameron|The Decameron]]'', a short story about the lives of people living during the Black Death.  The book focused on people's responses to the plague rather than God's wrath. In this sense, the book was not about religion, but rather about people, a relatively new concept at the time.

[[w:Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]] (1463-1494) was an Italian Renaissance humanist philosopher and scholar.  He authored the &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man,&quot; which has become known as the &quot;Manifesto of the Renaissance.&quot;  In this, he explained that man has unlimited potential, and with his free will can be anything he wants to be.  He argued that man should make use of his abilities and not waste them.  Finally, he explained that people should live their life with virtue, or the quality of being a man - shaping their own destiny, using all of their opportunities, and working aggressively through life.

===Northern Humanists===
[[w:Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] was an English lawyer, writer, and politician.  He was a devout Catholic who wrote ''[[w:Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', a novel that depicted [[w:Christian Humanism|Christian Humanist]] ideals producing an ideal fictional society.  In his utopia, there was no crime, poverty, nor war.  Much of the novel is a conversation that criticizes European practices, especially capital punishment.

[[w:Desiderius Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Dutch humanist and theologian.  He was also a Catholic.  In his ''Handbook of a Christian Knight'', he argued that through education, society can be reformed in the pious Christian model.  He believed faith, good works, and charity were the core Christian values, and that elaborate ceremonies were superfluous.  In his ''The Praise of Folly'', Erasmus claimed that the true Christian table of virtues, namely modesty, humility, and simplicity, had been replaced by a different, perverted value system of opulence, power, wealth, and so on.

==Arts==
Renaissance art tended to focus on the human body with accurate proportions, and the most common subjects of art were religion, mythology, portraits, and the use of classical (Greco-Roman) subjects.  Artisans of the Renaissance used oil paint to add shadow and light, and the use of the [[w:vanishing point|vanishing point]] in art became prominent during this time.

Artists of the Renaissance depended on patronage, or financial support from the wealthy.


[[Image:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg|thumb|175px|left|da Vinci's Mona Lisa.]]
===Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519)===
[[w:Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]] of Florence was known as one of the great masters of the High Renaissance, as a result of his innovations in both art and science.  Leonardo is often viewed as the archetype of the &quot;Renaissance Man&quot;  or &quot;polymath&quot; because of his expertise and interest in many different areas, including art, science, music, mechanics, architecture and the arts of war and philosophy.

Leonardo is best known for his paintings, the most famous of which are [[w:The Last Supper|The Last Supper]] and The [[w:Mona Lisa|Mona Lisa]].  There remain about fifteen paintings attributed reliably to Leonardo, and many others to his pupils and imitators.  He also left several important drawings of which the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; is the most famous and probably the most reproduced drawing in the world.  Leonardo left many note books of studies of many subjects, often profusely illustrated.  Much of his work was intended for publication but only a small percentage of his work was published, relating to art and mathematics.

In science, Leonardo practised meticulous observation and documentation.  He dissected thirty corpses in order to study human anatomy and produced detailed drawings of the human skeletal, muscular, and internal organ systems including human fetuses.
He made discoveries in anatomy, meteorology and geology, hydraulics, and aerodynamics.  This led to his devising of many ingenious plans, including an underwater diving suit and non-functioning flying machines.  He also sketched plans for elaborate killing machines. Many of these projects have proved impossible to create.  On the other hand, he successfully built a mechanical lion that walked, roared and opened its chest to produce a bunch of flowers.

===Michelangelo (1475–1564)===
[[Image:David von Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|170px|Michelangelo's ''[[w:David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' statue, in Florence. Note that the original is kept at the Accademia in Florence. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tickitaly.com/galleries/accademia.php&lt;/ref&gt; The statue in the Piazza della Signoria is a copy.]]

[[w:Michelangelo|Michelangelo]]  was one of the most prominent and important artists of the Renaissance, supported by the Medici family of Florence.  Michelangelo's monumental sculpture of David preparing to kill the giant Goliath with his rock and sling is the perfect confirmation of the return to a humanistic appreciation of physical beauty from the austere medieval conception of emaciated, self-flagellated saints. Michelangelo also adorned the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel with his &quot;Creation of Adam&quot; and other scenes and painted the ''Last Judgment'' on one wall of the [[w:Sistine Chapel|Sistine Chapel]] in present day Vatican City.

===Raphael (1483-1520)===
[[w:Raphael|Raphael]] was a famous painter and architect during the Renaissance.

Some of Raphael's famous paintings include [[w:The School of Athens|The School Of Athens]], [[w:Galatea (Raphael)|The Nymph Galatea]], and [[w:Portrait of Leo X (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Leo X with two Cardinals]].

==''The Prince''==

[[w:The Prince|''The Prince'']], a political treatise by the Florentine writer [[w:Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1464-1527), was an essential work of the Renaissance.  For the first time, politics was presented as an objective science. Machiavelli recorded successful rulers and then drew conclusions without judgments.  In other words, Machiavelli's politics were divorced from morality and religion.

Machiavelli's research showed that a successful leader of a nation acted in a number of ways:

* His power should be held as more important than ethics and morals
* It is better to be feared, not loved, but he should never be hated
* His advisers should be truthful and loyal, he should avoid flatterers, and he should select old and experienced advisers because they lack ambition to attempt to steal his power
* He should be both the lion (brave) and the fox (cunning)
* He should break treaties and promises when it benefits him and he should assume everyone else will do the same

==Northern Renaissance vs. Italian Renaissance==
The Southern Renaissance in Italy occurred earlier, from about 1300 to 1600, while the [[w:Northern Renaissance|Northern Renaissance]] occurred later, ending in about 1630.  The Southern Renaissance emphasized pagan and Greco-Roman ideals, and as a result was considerably more secular, while the Northern Renaissance advocated &quot;Christian&quot; humanism, or humility, tolerance, focus on the individual, and the importance of earnest life on earth.  While the Southern Renaissance emphasized art and culture, the Northern Renaissance emphasized the sciences and new technology.  This failed to occur in the south primarily because the Roman Catholic Church stunted learning and the sciences.  While the Northern Renaissance was religiously diverse, with the rise of Protestantism and a great deal of religious division, the Southern Renaissance was entirely Roman Catholic.  The Southern Renaissance saw far fewer universities, while the Northern Renaissance saw more universities and education. Also, Northern Renaissance humanists pushed for social reform based on Christian ideals.

==The New Monarchies==
With the Renaissance came the rise of new monarchs.  These new monarchs were kings who took responsibility for the welfare of all of society.  They centralized power and consolidated authority - the kings now controlled tariffs, taxes, the army, many aspects of religion, and the laws and judiciary.

In the way of the rise of new monarchs stood the church and nobles, who feared losing their power to the king.  In addition, these new monarchs needed money, and they needed to establish a competent military rather than mercenaries.

The middle class allied themselves with the new monarchs.  The monarchs desired their support because their money came from trade, and this trade provided a great source of taxable revenue.  The middle class supported the monarchs because they received the elimination of local tariffs, as well as peace and stability.

===France===
From the tenth century onwards France had been governed by the Capetian dynasty. Although the family ruled over what might be, in theory, considered the most powerful country in Europe, the French monarchs had little control over their vassals, and many parts of France functioned as though they were independent states. The most powerful vassals of the French kings were the Plantagenet dynasty of England, who, through their Angevin ancestry, ruled large parts of western France. The ensuing conflicts, known as the Hundred Years War, helped to solidify the power of the French monarchs over their country. 

In France, the [[w:Valois Dynasty|Valois dynasty]] came to the throne in 1328.

[[w:Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] expelled the English and lowered the church's power under the state in 1422.

[[w:Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] expanded the French state, laying the foundations for absolutism, in 1461.

===England===
[[w:Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] began the restoration of royal authority, but the strengthening of the crown gained momentum only after the [[w:Tudor dynasty|Tudor family]] came to power.

[[w:Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] manipulated the Parliament to make it a tool of the king.  He created the Royal court and the [[w:Star Chamber|Star Chamber]], in which royalty had the power to torture while questioning; this legal system allowed the king to limit the power of the aristocracy.  He also promoted trade in order to gain the support of the middle class.

His son, [[w:Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], took this process still further when, as a result of his desire to have a male heir, he founded the [[w:Anglican Church|Anglican Church]] in England and broke away from the [[w:Catholic Church|Catholic Church]].  After Henry married [[w:Catherine of Aragon|Catherine of Aragon]], she failed to produce a male heir, and Henry desired to divorce her in order to marry a new lady, [[w:Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn]], who he hoped would be able to produce a son.  The Catholic Church strictly prohibited divorce, however, and Henry found that the only way to sever his marriage was to separate from the Pope's jurisdiction.  As a result, he withdrew England from the Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England, and in the [[w:Acts of Supremacy|First Act of Supremacy]] he established the monarch of England as the head of the Church.

===Spain===
With the success of the Spanish [[w:reconquista|''reconquista'']], Spain expelled the Jews and Muslims. The marriage of [[w:Isabella of Castile|Queen Isabella I of Castile]] and [[w:Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the Catholic monarchs (Spanish:''Los Reyes Católicos''), was the final element which unified Spain. They revived the [[w:Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition]] to remove the last of the Jews.

===Holy Roman Empire===
In the [[w:Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]], which occupied Austria and [[w:Bohemia|Bohemia]], the [[w:Hapsburg Dynasty|Hapsburg Dynasty]] began.  The Empire expanded its territory, acquiring Burgundy and attempting to unite Germany.  The emperor's son married the daughter of the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella; their son, [[w:Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], became heir to Spain, Austria, and Burgundy.

===Ottoman Turks===
The [[w:Ottoman Turks|Ottoman Turks]] were Muslims from Asia Minor who gradually conquered the old [[w:Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]], completed in 1453 with the [[w:Fall of Constantinople|fall of Constantinople]] (renamed to Istanbul).

== The Rise of Court Life ==
New monarchs began to utilize the court during this time to increase their power by setting themselves apart from the lay people and by allowing the king to control the nobles.  The court became the center of politics and religion in their respective nations.

Nobles were required to live in the courts, and were as a result under constant watch by the king.  Thus, the most important function of the court was that it allowed the king to control the nobles and prevent coup.  In addition, however, the courts served an important social function, as the king's social circle was the nobles, and the court allowed him to interact with them.

Court life was incredibly lavish, with events including hunting, mock battles, balls, parties, dances, celebratory dinners, gambling, and general socialization.  The middle class loved this, and frequently copied the behaviors of the nobility from the courts.

The scholarly uses are rarely seen in modern literature and are only seen in very old books. I think it's ok to ignore them altogether. Maybe they will disappear.

I agree that the pace of the whole book needs to be slowed considerably.[[User:86.137.109.142|86.137.109.142]] 11:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

the word pronounced as 着 is much more common as 'zhe' rather than 'zhao2'. The word ‘到’ should be introduced before the word 着 as most people think of the word '到', which is more 'direct' in a sense, rather than the word '着' in the case of '我拿到(so-and-so)了！’  rather than '我拿着(so-and-so)了！‘ --[[User: chinzh|chinzh]]</text>

Can I just say that, as someone who has been self-studying as a hobby for a while, and actually bought some textbooks, nowhere else have I been able to find word order in simple, clear terms.

'''Swedish meatballs (Köttbullar)'''

All recipes are based on the following basic, or minimum, recipe for Swedish meatballs; Servings: 4, Time: 30 minutes

==Ingredients==
*250 [[Cookbook:g|g]], 9 oz [[Cookbook:Ground Beef|ground beef]]
*250 [[Cookbook:g|g]], 9 oz ground pork
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*50 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], 1/4 cup dried [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
*200 - 300 mL, 3/4 - 1 1/4 cup(s) fluid, like [[Cookbook:Water|water]], [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]

==Procedure==
#Combine the liquid ingredients and the bread crumbs in a bowl and let it sit for 7-8 minutes.
#Finely chop or grate the onion.
#Combine the ground beef, ground pork, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper in the bowl.
#Make round meatballs, approximately 2-3 [[Cookbook:cm|centimeters]] (1 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]]) in diameter.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Pan fry]] the meatballs on medium heat in a frying pan with butter for approximately 3-5 minutes. Fry them on all sides until they are brown and not pink in the middle. Shaking the pan occasionally will help the meatballs cook evenly.

Serve them with [[Cookbook:Potato#Mashing|mashed potatoes]] with a veal based brown sauce made with [[Cookbook:cream|cream]] and lingonberry preserve or [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|cranberry preserve]].

{{PaleoIntro}}
{{displaytitle|title=History of Research in Palaeoanthropology}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Beginning of the 20th Century==
In 1891, Eugene Dubois discovers remains of hominid fossils (which he will call Pithecanthropus) on the Island of Java, South-East Asia.
The two main consequences of this discovery:
*stimulates research for &quot;missing link&quot; of our origins
*orients research interest toward SE Asia as possible cradle of humanity

Yet, in South Africa, 1924, discovery by accident of remains of child (at Taung) during exploitation of a quarry. Raymond Dart identifies remains of this child and publishes them in 1925 as a new species - ''Australopithecus africanus'' (which means &quot;African southern ape&quot;). Dart, a British-trained anatomist, was appointed in 1922 professor of anatomy at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.
This discovery:
* documented the ancient age of hominids in Africa
* questioned the SE Asian origin of hominids, arguing for a possible African origin.

Nevertheless, his ideas were not accepted by the scientific community at the time:
* major discoveries carried out in Europe (Gibraltar, Germany - Neanderthal, etc.) and Asia (Java)
* remains of this species were the only ones found and did not seem to fit in phylogenetic tree of our origins
* finally considered simply as a fossil ape

It took almost 20 years before Dart's ideas could be accepted, due to notable new discoveries:
* in 1938, identification of a second species of Australopithecine, also in South Africa: Paranthropus (Australopithecus) robustus. Robert Broom collected at Kromdraai Cave the remains of a skull and teeth
* in 1947, other remains of A. africanus found at Sterkfontein and Makapansgat
* in 1948, other remains of P. robustus found at Swartkrans, also by R. Broom

==1950s - 1970s==

During the first half of the 20th century, most discoveries essential for
paleoanthropology and human evolution are done in South Africa.

After World War II, research centres in East Africa with the couple Mary and Louis Leakey. They discovered major site of Olduvai (Tanzania):
* many seasons of excavations at this site - discovery of many layers (called Beds), with essential collection of faunal remains and stone tools, and several hominid species identified for the first time there;
* In 1959, discovery in Bed I of hominid remains (OH5), named Zinjanthropus (Australopithecus) boisei;
* L. Leakey first considered this hominid as the author of stone tools, until he found (in 1964) in same Bed I other hominid fossils, which he attributed to different species - Homo habilis (OH7).

Another major discovery of paleoanthropological interest comes from the
Omo Valley in Ethiopia:
* from 1967 to 1976, 9 field seasons were carried out;
* In 1967, discovery of hominid fossils attributed to new species - ''Australopithecus aethiopicus''
* 217 specimens of hominid fossils attributed to five hominid species: ''A. afarensis'', ''A. aethiopicus'', ''A. boisei'', ''H. rudolfensis'', ''H. erectus'', dated to between 3.3 and 1 Million years ago.

Also in 1967, Richard Leakey starts survey and excavation on the east shore of Lake Turkana (Kenya), at a location called Koobi Fora:
* research carried out between 1967 and 1975
* very rich collection of fossils identified, attributed to ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. boisei''

In 1972, a French-American expedition led by Donald Johanson and Yves Coppens focuses on a new locality (Hadar region) in the Awash Valley (Ethiopia):
* research carried out between 1972-1976
* in 1973, discovery of most complete skeleton to date, named Lucy, attributed (in 1978 only) to ''A. afarensis''
* more than 300 hominid individuals were recovered
* discoveries allow for a detailed analysis of locomotion and bipedalism among early hominids

From 1976 to 1979, Mary Leakey carries out research at site of Laetoli, in Tanzania:
* In 1976, she discovers animal footprints preserved in tuff (volcanic ash), dated to 3.7 Myrs ago
* In 1978-1979, discovery of site with three series of hominid (australopithecines) footprints, confirming evidence of bipedalism.

==1980 - The Present==
===South Africa===
Four australopithecine foot bones dated at around 3.5 million years were found at Sterkfontein in 1994 by Ronald Clarke:
* oldest hominid fossils yet found in South Africa
* They seem to be adapted to bipedalism, but have an intriguing mixture of ape and human features

Since then, eight more foot and leg bones have been found from the same individual, who has been nicknamed &quot;Little Foot&quot;.

===Eastern Africa===

Recent discovery of new ''A. boisei'' skull is:
* one of the most complete known, and the first known with an associated cranium and lower jaw;
* It also has a surprising amount of variability from other ''A. boisei'' skulls, which may have implications for how hominid fossils are classified.

Recent research suggests that the some australopithecines were capable of a precision grip, like that of humans but unlike apes, which would have meant they were capable of making stone tools.

The oldest known stone tools have been found in Ethiopia in sediments dated at between 2.5 million and 2.6 million years old. The makers are unknown, but may be either early ''Homo'' or ''A. garhi''

main question is, how have these species come to exist in the geographical areas so far apart from one another

===Chad===

A partial jaw found in Chad (Central Africa) greatly extends the geographical range in which australopithecines are known to have lived. The specimen (nicknamed Abel) has been attributed to a new species - ''Australopithecus bahrelghazali''.

In June 2002, publication of major discovery of earliest hominid known: ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' (nickname: &quot;Toumai&quot;).

{{displaytitle|title=Bone Terminology and the Defining of Humans}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Bone Identification and Terminology==
===Skull===
'''Cranium''': The skull minus the lower jaw bone.

'''Brow, Supraorbital Ridges''': Bony protrusions above eye sockets.

'''Endocranial Volume''': The volume of a skull's brain cavity.

'''Foramen Magnum''': The hole in the skull through which the spinal cord passes.
* In apes, it is towards the back of the skull, because of their quadrupedal posture
* In humans it is at the bottom of the skull, because the head of bipeds is balanced on top of a vertical column.

'''Sagittal Crest''': A bony ridge that runs along the centre line of the skull to which chewing muscles attach.

'''Subnasal Prognathism''': Occurs when front of the face below the nose is pushed out.

'''Temporalis Muscles''': The muscles that close the jaw.

===Teeth===
'''Canines''', '''Molars''': Teeth size can help define species.
* Gorillas eat lots of foliage; therefore they are chewing all day and have great canines
* Humans are omnivorous and have small, more generalized canines
'''Dental Arcade''': The rows of teeth in the upper and lower jaws.
* Chimpanzees have a narrow, U-shaped dental arcade
* Modern humans have a wider, parabolic dental arcade
* The dental arcade of Australopithecus afarensis has an intermediate V shape
'''Diastema''': Functional gaps between teeth.
*  In the chimpanzee's jaw, the gap between the	canine and the neighbouring incisor, which provides a space for the opposing canine when the animal's mouth is closed
* Modern humans have small canines and no diastema

==Using Bones to Define Humans==
===Bipedalism===
Fossil pelvic and leg bones, body proportions, and footprints all read
&quot;bipeds.&quot; The fossil bones are not identical to modern humans, but were
likely functionally equivalent and a marked departure from those of
quadrupedal chimpanzees.
[[Image:A.afarensis.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of ''Australopithecus afarensis'']] 
Australopithecine fossils possess various components of the bipedal complex which can be compared to those of chimpanzees and humans:
* A diagnostic feature of bipedal locomotion is	a shortened and broadened ilium; the australopithecine ilium is shorter than that of apes, and it is slightly curved; this shape suggests that the gluteal muscles were in a position to rotate and support the body during bipedal walking
* In modern humans, the head of the femur is robust, indicating increased stability at this joint for greater load bearing
* In humans, the femur angles inward from the hip to the knee joint, so that the lower limbs stand close to the body's midline. The line of gravity and weight are carried on the outside of the knee joint; in contrast, the chimpanzee femur articulates at the hip, then continues in a straight line downward to the knee joint
* The morphology of the australopithecine femur is distinct and suggests a slightly different function for the hip and knee joints. The femoral shaft is angled more than that of a chimpanzee and indicates that the knees and feet were well planted under the body
* In modern humans, the lower limbs bear all the body weight and perform all locomotor functions. Consequently, the hip, knee and ankle joint are all large with less mobility than their counterparts in chimpanzees. In australopithecines, the joints remain relatively small. In part, this might be due to smaller body size. It may also be due to a unique early hominid form of bipedal locomotion that differed somewhat from that of later hominids.

Thus human bodies were redesigned by natural selection for walking in an upright position for longer distances over uneven terrain.

===Brain Size===

Bipedal locomotion became established in the earliest stages of the hominid lineage, about 7 million years ago, whereas brain expansion came later. Early hominids had brains slightly larger than those of apes, but fossil hominids with significantly increased cranial capacities did not appear until about 2 million years ago.

Brain size remains near 450 cubic centimetres (cc) for robust australopithecines until almost 1.5 million years ago. At the same time, fossils assigned to Homo exceed 500 cc and reach almost 900 cc.

What might account for this later and rapid expansion of hominid brain size? One explanation is called the &quot;radiator theory&quot;: a new means for cooling this vital heat-generating organ, namely a new pattern of cerebral blood circulation, would be responsible for brain expansion in hominids.
Gravitational forces on blood draining from the brain differ in quadrupedal animals versus bipedal animals: when humans stand bipedally, most blood drains into veins at the back of the neck, a network of small veins that form a complex system around the spinal column.

The two different drainage patterns might reflect two systems of cooling brains in early hominids. Active brains and bodies generate a lot of metabolic heat. The brain is a hot organ, but must maintain a fairly rigid temperature range to keep it functioning properly and to prevent permanent
damage.

Savanna-dwelling hominids with this network of veins had a way to cool a bigger brain, allowing the &quot;engine&quot; to expand, contributing to hominid flexibility in moving into new habitats and in being active under a wide range of climatic conditions.

===Free Hands===
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in locomotion or bearing weight or swinging through the trees. The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the hand's use for bearing weight in knuckle walking. The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges. Fossil hand bones two million to three million years old reveal this shift in specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation.

Chimpanzee hands are a compromise. They must be relatively immobile in bearing weight during knuckle walking, but dexterous for using tools. Human hands are capable of power and precision grips but more importantly are uniquely suited for fine manipulation and coordination.

===Tool Use===

Fossil hand bones show greater potential for evidence of tool use. Although no stone tools are recognizable in an archaeological context until 2.5 million years ago, we can infer nevertheless their existence for the earliest stage of human evolution. The tradition of making and using tools almost certainly goes back much earlier to a period of utilizing unmodified stones and tools mainly of organic, perishable materials (wood or leaves) that would not be preserved in the fossil record.

How can we tell a hominid-made artefact from a stone generated by natural processes? First, the manufacturing process of hitting one stone with another to form a sharp cutting edge leaves a characteristic mark where the flake has been removed. Second, the raw material for the tools often comes from some distance away and indicates transport to the site by hominids.

Modification of rocks into predetermined shapes was a technological breakthrough. Possession of such tools opened up new possibilities in foraging: for example, the ability to crack open long bones and get at the marrow, to dig, and to sharpen or shape wooden implements.

Even before the fossil record of tools around 2.5 Myrs, australopithecine brains were larger than chimpanzee brains, suggesting increased motor skills and problem solving. All lines of evidence point to the importance of skilled making and using of tools in human evolution.

==Summary==
In this chapter, we learned the following:

1. Humans clearly depart from apes in several significant areas of anatomy,
which stem from adaptation:
* bipedalism
* dentition (tooth size and shape)
* free hands
* brain size

2. For most of human evolution, cultural evolution played a fairly minor role. If we look back at the time of most australopithecines, it is obvious that culture had little or no influence on the lives of these creatures, who were constrained and directed by the same evolutionary pressures as the other organisms with which they shared their ecosystem. So, for most of the time during which hominids have existed, human evolution was no different from that of other organisms.

3. Nevertheless once our ancestors began to develop a dependence on culture for survival, then a new layer was added to human evolution. Sherwood Washburn suggested that the unique interplay of cultural change and biological change could account for why humans have become so different.
According to him, as culture became more advantageous for the survival of our ancestors, natural selection favoured the genes responsible for such behaviour. These genes that improved our capacity for culture would have had an adaptive advantage. We can add that not only the genes but also anatomical changes made the transformations more advantageous. The ultimate result of the interplay between genes and culture was a significant acceleration of human evolution around 2.6 million to 2.5 million years ago.

:&lt;math&gt;x'\Rightarrow y' = x + y'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y\Rightarrow x = y' + x = x + y'&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus the statements are the same


2. 
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Leftrightarrow y) \Rightarrow z = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Leftrightarrow y)' + z = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x' + y)' + z = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;xy' + z&lt;/math&gt;

3.
:a. &lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(x^2 = 9 \Rightarrow x^2 - 6x - 3 = 0) &lt;/math&gt;
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 means that ''x'' can be 3
:3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 6*3 - 3 = 0 is false
:Thus the sentence is false
:b.&lt;math&gt;(\exists x)((x^2 = 9) \times (x^2 - 6x - 3 = 0))&lt;/math&gt;
:For this equation to be false we need an ''x'' so that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=9 and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 6x - 3 = 0 are both false.
:The values of ''x'' for which ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=9 is true are x=3 and x=-3
:The values of ''x'' for which ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 6x - 3 = 0 is true are &lt;math&gt;x=2\sqrt{3}+3 \mbox{ and }x=-2\sqrt{3}+3&lt;/math&gt;
:Since none of the values for x are the same there exist no numbers at all for which the statement is true.


4.
(This solution is due to Tom Lam). Let (x+y)w+z = a NAND b , where a and b can either be one of x,y,w,z or another NAND operator.

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z=(ab)'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z=a'+b'&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;a=[(x+y)w]'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=z'&lt;/math&gt; , both need further NAND operators. Let a = c NAND d , and let b = e NAND f.

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z={(cd)'}^{'}+{(ef)'}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z=cd+ef&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore d=w, e=f=z,c=x+y.Let c = g NAND h.

&lt;math&gt;x+y=(gh)'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x+y=g'+h'&lt;/math&gt;

Now g=x' and h=y', we still need more NAND operators. Let g = i NAND j and let h = k NAND l.

&lt;math&gt;(ij)'=x'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=ij&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(kl)'=y'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;kl=y&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore i=j=x and k=l=y.

Now substitute all the variables back, you should get:
(x+y)w+z={[(x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)] NAND w} NAND (z NAND z)


'''Alternatively''' 
Each of AND, OR and NOT can be expressed in terms of NAND only. And therefore any boolean expression can be written down entirely in terms of NAND. This property is called the universality of NAND. Remember x NAND y = (xy)'

Firstly,
:NOT x = x' = x'x' = (xx)' = x NAND x
also,
:x OR y = x + y = (x'y')' = (x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)
and
:x AND y = xy = (xy)' ' = (x NAND y) NAND (x NAND y)

Now
:(x + y)w = ((x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)) NAND w
and so 
:(x + y)w + z = ((((x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)) NAND w) NAND (((x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)) NAND w)) NAND (z NAND z)</text>

'''Deontology''' is a set of moral theories which place themselves opposite consequentialism. While consequentialism determines right actions from good ends, deontology asserts that the end and the means by which it is arrived upon are intrinsically linked. A good end will come about as a result of good or right means. 

The most famous of deontologists is Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804). His categorical imperative (divided into three formulations) determines a set of universal principles by which right action can be judged. The name &quot;deontology&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;deon&quot; which means &quot;duty.&quot; Kant's goal in formulating deontology was to establish an ethical system that does not depend on anyone's subjective experience; rather, the good or evil of an action can be entirely determined by irrefutable logic. Thus, ethically correct behavior would be a duty whose truth no one could deny, just as no one can reasonably deny that two plus two makes four.

Kant's categorical imperative tells us how logic can determine whether an action is right or wrong. It revolves around the idea of the maxim that cannot be made universal without defeating itself. A classic example is the statement, &quot;I choose to lie about my car so that I will not be punished for arriving late at work.&quot; This may work for one individual, but if everyone adopted this principle (if lying were universalized), they would cancel out the concept of promising. In a world where lying was normal behavior, no one would believe anything they were told. This is the first formulation of the categorical imperative, that any action whose maxim logically defeats itself when universalized cannot be a moral action.

'''John Rawls''' is a deontologist as well. His book, ''A Theory of Justice'' establishes that a system of wealth redistribution ought to be created such that it abides by a specific set of moral rules.

Another way of looking at deontology is that it is opposed teleological theories such as consequentialism. In this sense Deontology is concerned with finding the right actions that one should perform to produce the 'good', while teleology is concerned with isolating the meaning of the 'good' and then stating that a right action is one which will produce said good. Thus as well as formulating his categorial imperative Kant also states that one is acting morally when one performs one's duty to fulfill the categorical imperative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A carboxylic acid is characterized by the presence of the ''carboxyl group'' -COOH. The chemical reactivity of carboxylic acids is dominated by the very positive carbon, and the resonance stabilization that is possible should the group lose a proton. These two factors contribute both to acidity and to the group's dominant chemical reaction: nucleophilic substitution.  

=Preparation=
1) from alkenes
        R-CH=CHR + KMnO&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt; + OH&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; + Heat----&gt; 2RCOOH
        
2) from ROH
        RCH&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;OH + OXIDIZING AGENT ----&gt; RCOOH

Aliphatic carboxylic acids are formed from primary alcohols or aldehydes by reflux with potassium dichromate (VI) acidified with sulphuric acid.

3) from toluene etc.
        toluene + KMnO&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt; ----&gt; benzoic acid  

Alkyl benzenes (methyl benzene, ethyl benzene, etc) react with potassium manganate (VII) to form benzoic acid. All alkyl benzenes give the same product, because all but one alkyl carbon is lost.

No acidification is needed. The reaction is refluxed and generates KOH. The benzoic acid is worked up by adding a proton source (such as HCl).

4) from methyl ketones
        RCOCH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; + NaOH + I-I ----&gt; RCOO&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; + CHI&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;
5) from Grignard reagents
        RMgX + O=C=O ----&gt; RCOOMgX 
        RCOOMgX + HOH ----&gt; RCOOH + MgX(OH)

==Nomenclature==
The systematic IUPAC nomenclature for carboxylic acids requires the longest carbon chain of the molecule to be identified and the -e of alkane name to be replaced with -oic acid.

The traditional names of many carboxylic acids are still in common use.

The systematic approach for naming dicarboxylic acids (alkanes with carboxylic acids on either end) is the same as for carboxylic acids, except that the suffix is -dioic acid.
Common name Nomenclature of dicarboxylic acids is aided by the acronym OMSGAP (Om's Gap), where each letter stands for the first letter of the first seven names for each dicarboxylic acid, starting from the simplest.

==Acidity==
Most carboxylic acids are weak acids. To quantify the acidities we need to know the pKa values: The pH above which the acids start showing mostly acidic behaviour:
Ethanoic acid:  4.8
Phenol:           10.0
Ethanol:          15.9
Water:            15.7

Clearly, the carboxylic acids are remarkably acidic for organic molecules. Somehow, the release of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is favoured by the structure.
Two arguments:
The O-H bond is polarised by the removal of electrons to the carbonyl oxygen.
The ion is stabilised by resonance: the carbonyl oxygen can accept the charge from the other oxygen.
The acid strength of carboxylic acid are strongly modulated by the moiety attached to the carboxyl. Electron-donor moiety decrease the acid strength, whereas strong electron-withdrawing groups increase it.

=Reactions=

==Acid Chloride Formation==
Carboxylic acids are converted to acid chlorides by a range of reagents:
SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the usual reagents. Other products are HCl &amp; SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl &amp; POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. The conditions must be dry, as water will hydrolyse the acid chloride in a vigorous reaction. Hydrolysis forms the original carboxylic acid.

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCl + HCl + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COCl + HCl + POCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COCl + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Esterification==
Alcohols will react with acid chlorides or carboxylic acids to form esters. This reaction is catalyzed by acidic or basic conditions. See alcohol notes.


C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COCl + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl


With carboxylic acids, the condensation reaction is an unfavourable equilibrium, promoted by using non-aqueous solvent (if any) and a dehydrating agent such as sulfuric acid (non-nucleophilic), catalyzing the reaction).


CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH = CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[Image:Esterification.PNG|frame|none|Ethanoic Acid reacts with Propanol to form Propyl Ethanoate]]



Reversing the reaction is simply a matter of refluxing the ester with plenty of aqueous acid. This hydrolysis produces the carboxylic acid and the alcohol.

C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H2O &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH


Alternatively, the reflux is done with aqueous alkali. The salt of the carboxylic acid is produced.
This latter process is called 'saponification' because when fats are hydrolysed in this way, their salts are useful as soap.

==Anhydrides==
See [[w:Acid anhydride|acid anhydride]].

==Amides==
Conceptually, an amide is formed by reacting an acid (an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophile electrophile]) with an amine compound (a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleophile nucleophile]), releasing water. 

RCOOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR' &amp;rarr; RCONHR' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

However, the acid-base reaction is much faster, which yields the non-electrophilic carboxylate and the non-nucleophilic ammonium, and no further reaction takes place.  

RCOOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR' &amp;rarr; RCOO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NR'&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 

To get around this, a variety of coupling reagents have been developed that first react with the acid or carboxylate to form an active acyl compound, which is basic enough to deprotonate an ammonium and electrophilic enough to react with the free base of the amine. A common coupling agent is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dicyclohexylcarbodiimide], or DCC, which is very toxic.

==Acid Decarboxylation==
On heating with sodalime (NaOH/CaO solid mix) carboxylic acids lose their –COOH group and produce a small alkane plus sodium carbonate:

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + 2 NaOH &amp;rarr;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Note how a carbon is lost from the main chain. The product of the reaction may be easier to identify than the original acid, helping us to find the structure.

==Ethanoic anhydride==
Industrially, ethanoic anhydride is used as a less costly and reactive alternative to ethanoyl chloride.
It forms esters and can be hydrolysed in very similar ways, but yields a second ethanoic acid molecule, not HCl
The structure is formed from two ethanoic acid molecules…
==Polyester==
Polyester can be made by reacting a diol (ethane-1,2-diol) with a dicarboxylic acids (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid).
n HO-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH + n HOOC-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-COOH &amp;rarr; (-O-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O-OC-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CO-)n + n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Polyester makes reasonable fibres, it is quite inflexible so it does not crease easily; but for clothing it is usually combined with cotton for comfort.
The plastic is not light-sensitive, so it is often used for net curtains. Film, bottles and other moulded products are made from polyester.

==Distinguishing carboxylic acids from phenols==
Although carboxylic acids are acidic, they can be distinguished from phenol because:
Only carboxylic acids will react with carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to form CO2


2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COONa + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COONa + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Some phenols react with FeCl&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; solution, giving a characteristic purple colour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!

I am a professional freelance technical writer. Many of my assignments involve non-technical subjects. In my spare time, I lead book discussion groups.

I was born in 1945, and I am married to someone who is so incredible that I have to pinch myself to see if I am dreaming. She is a project manager at a U.S. Government agency. We have five children and seven grandchildren, and we live in the suburbs of Washington.

At Wikibooks, I am very interested in initiating and &quot;mother-hening&quot; various glossaries, study guides to great books, and anthologies of essays. Please leave me a note on my talk/discussion page if you would like to work together (tab is at top of this page).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've just fleshed out the chapter on ideals, hopefully this isn't too controversial. I agree with earlier comments that the structure is lacking - e.g. no connections between modules and vector spaces. There's also the question of who this is aimed at - advanced high school, undergraduate, graduate / reference and whether accomodating these is easier if using a wiki rather than just a book. The other question is also to what depth one wants to study each subject - too much group theory might be annoying to someone only interested in commutative algebra. Presenting everything in the utmost generality for the sake of non-commutative algebra would obscure the simple case, but not enough would naturally annoy the non-commutative algebraist. The first example isn't too problematic - the reader can simply omit the complicated group theory, and having a massive wikibook doesnt have the same problems as having a massive dead-tree book - but the second is a bit harder because it influences the presentation in an essential way. A similar question might be whether to use category theory, or add in a geometric perspective (ala Atiyah-McDonald and Eisenbud), again these might affect the presentation quite fundamentally. My answers to these questions are probably quite biased - would be good to hear other perspectives --[[User:Drufino|Drufino]] 22:59, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

This Abstract algebra book seems to be more like a collection of related topics rather than a planned literature. It assumes too much prior knowledge and all the modules are still quite immature. I'd like see a little more structure to it, maybe it should have been called a first course in Abstract algebra and it should assume knowledge of basic linear algebra? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 00:56, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)
: Of course the modules are still immature, nearly everything here needs work (not just in this section)
: Some sections do assume some prior knowledge, and some do not. The section on Groups for example should be able to be picked up with just a relatively small amount of prior mathematical knowledge. Some of the stuff is quite &quot;disgusting&quot; and needs a lot of work.
: The linear algebra stuff needs merely to be bumped up the top, as it shouldn't be too difficult to understand. 
: Why do you want it to be called &quot;a first course in abstract algebra&quot;?  [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 02:05, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:: It's very hard trying to cover everything in Abstract algebra all at once, we might want to break the book into smaller books. It's very dangerous calling the book just Abstract Algebra, it's better to do the elementary stuff in a &quot;first course&quot; book then more advaced stuff in a &quot;second course&quot; book and so. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 08:01, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Hello I'm new to Wikibooks (Been on wikipedia for a while).  I have a few humble sugestions:
* Much of this material needs to be made more accesible.  This sort of text ought to develop the ideas more gradually, with more examples and more explanation.
* Category theory really should not be in here.  It is way too advanced really and might put people off.
* We should have some sort of dependencies table or at least each chapter should say what knowledge it presumes.
* We should have exercises at the end of each chapter and some sort of answers section (preferably it should have a slowdown built in to encourage people to work things out for themselves).
* We should include a section on naive set theory together with a cautionary exhibition of Russels paradox.

I'm thinking of starting a wikibook on Galois theory and maybe one on Set theory so I may be around some more. [[User:Barnaby dawson|Barnaby dawson]] 21:26, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

# Barnaby, the books still need a lot of work. I just said that above. They will get better with time and effort.
# It should be included in a book on abstract algebra. The stuff isn't that hard. If we stratify the abstract algebra outline more, it will have a place
# Ok
# see 1.
# see [[Discrete mathematics/Set theory]], though it should be here too since it overlaps, I think I need to go rip out the DM book a bit more.

Cool, a section on Galois theory would be very welcome. When I get a chance to, I'll go and radically restructure everything, or something. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:16, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

'''Outline of Basic Ring Theory?'''

In the ring theory section, one thing that would help unify the concepts that are being presented would be to spend some time developing the concept of the Division Algorithm, GCDs, and the Euclidean algorithm.  It appears that this is begun under the &quot;Modular Arithmetic&quot; module of the discrete math book.  However, the strong connection between relative primality/irreducibility and existence of multiplicative inverses is not really described.

Having done this, it becomes possible to generalize the Division Algorithm to polynomials of a single variable.  This allows for the Euclidean algorithm to be carried over and we can develop the idea of quotient rings.  (And of F[x] as a field.)  This leads naturally into the development of ideals.

Finally, coverage of ring homomorphisms and the Isomorphism Theorems needs to be introduced.  This would be a good start on getting to more advanced topics like modules, lattices, and eventually, polynomials in multiple variables.

All in good time, I know, but it might be wise to spend a moment thinking about what the overall organization of ring theory is like.  I personally see the initial definitions of rings, fields, and integral domains as being the &quot;easy&quot; part and the development of the Division Algorithm, GCDs, the Euclidean Algorithm, followed by polynomial rings, ideals and quotient rings, and ring homomorphisms as the &quot;meat&quot; of basic ring theory.

Thoughts? --[[User:Ashsong|Ashsong]] 06:44, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Well, be bold, and add the stuff! That's what the wiki's all about. Though, I've removed the division algorithm, etc., from having their own modules (they can and should be dealt with in their respective modules when necessary) and cleaned up the structure a bit. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 07:37, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Do you have any favorite wikibooks that I ought to look at in order to get a better idea of the style that you'd like to see? --[[User:Ashsong|Ashsong]] 15:27, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Proposed name change ==

I'd like to change all the subpages of this book so that they begin with &quot;Abstract Algebra/&quot; rather than &quot;Abstract Algebra:&quot; to make them consistent with the new naming convention. I trust this will be non-controversial, but note it here to allow for comments before the move, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:01, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

hey can some1 tell me what &quot;Ris are predicate symbols of some arity and ν is an interpretation of these symbols on the set.&quot; means?[[User:Vandal 0nly account|Vandal 0nly account]] 07:52, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

== Number theory is not prerequisite ==

Requiring that one knows number theory before beginning is a little silly to me.  Algebra is far more fundamental to everything, while number theory is a bunch of cool results that aren't useful, many times.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Virtual Network Computing''' (VNC) is a remote desktop protocol to remote control another computer. VNC is used to transport the desktop environment of a graphical user interface from one computer to a viewer application on another computer on the network. There are clients and servers for many platforms including Linux, Microsoft Windows, Berkeley Software Distribution variants and MacOS X. In fact you would be hard pressed to not find a viewer available for any GUI operating system.  The VNC protocol allows for complete platform independence.  A VNC viewer on any operating system can connect to a VNC server on any other operating system.  It is also possible for multiple clients to connect to a VNC server at the same time.  Popular uses of the technology include remote tech support, and accessing your files on your work PC while at home or even on the road.  There is even a Java viewer for VNC, so you can connect to a VNC server from your web browser without installing any software.  The original VNC code is open source, as are many of the flavors of VNC available today.

== How it works ==

VNC is actually two parts, a client and a server.  A server is the machine that is sharing its screen, and the client, or viewer is the program that is doing the watching and perhaps interacting with the server.  VNC is actually a VERY simple protocol and is based one one and only one graphic primitive, &quot;Put a rectangle of pixel data at a given x,y position&quot;.  What this means is VNC takes small rectangles of the screen (actually the framebuffer) and transports them from the server to the client.  This in its simplest form would cause lots of bandwidth to be used, and hence various methods have been invented to make this process go faster.  There are now many different 'encodings' or methods to determine the most efficient way to transfer these rectangles.  The VNC protocol allows the client and server to negotiate which encoding it will use.  The simplest and lowest common denominator is the ''raw encoding'' method where the pixel data is sent in left-to-right scanline order, and after initial setup, then only transfers the rectangles that have changed.

== how to copy and paste ==

How do I copy-and-paste
from applications running on a server (visible inside a local VNC window)
to applications running locally (outside the VNC window)
and back?

Some people
[http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2003-February/037299.html]
[http://landru.uwaterloo.ca/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Remote_Access]
suggest using xcutsel or autocutsel as a work-around:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the VNC server side (inside the VNC window) run &quot;&lt;code&gt;xcutsel &amp;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Leave it up and running.
*   1. If you want to copy from VNC to local, select what you want to copy, then click &quot;copy PRIMARY to 0&quot; in xcutsel, then paste in local.
*   2. If you want to copy from local to VNC, select what you want to copy, then click &quot;copy 0 to PRIMARY&quot; in xcutsel, then paste in VNC window. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others [http://www.lugs.org.sg/pipermail/slugnet/2002-July/000590.html] recommend autocutsel (or is it autcutsel?),
pointing at [http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/faq.html#q25 the VNC FAQ].

'''Midwestern cuisine''' in the United States is based on simple dishes such as [[Cookbook:Classic Pot Roast|pot roast]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]],  and [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]]. [[Cookbook:Dairy|Dairy]] is an important ingredient, especially [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]. In homes, meals tend to be served family-style rather than in courses. Seasoning is mild, and tends to the sweet.

Like most American cuisines, Midwestern cooking is influenced by the cuisine of the immigrants who settled in the region. Scandinavians and Germans settled the northern Midwest, so [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Norway|Norwegian]] lutefisk, Cornish pasties, or [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] pa˛czki may be found. Missouri and Illinois were destinations for many ethnic [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|German]] immigrants, so [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] are more prevalent. 

The Midwest produces most of America's grain, beef, and dairy products, and these products are staples of traditional Midwestern cuisine.

__NOTOC__
This recipe is fairly easy, serves 6 to 8 adults, and requires a minimum of 3 hours to prepare.

Midwestern chicken wings are not to be confused with hot wings; midwestern wings are not spicy.

==Ingredients==
*4 to 5 pounds of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] wings
*2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 Tablespoon of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]
*12 ounces of [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]] preserves (not preserved apricots, not apricot jelly)

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Mince|Mince]] garlic and ginger.
#Place all ingredients except chicken into a bowl and mix.
#[[Cookbook:Marinating|Marinate]] the chicken with the marinade. A plastic bag sealed tight without much air or free space is believed to provide the best marinating.
#Refrigerate at least 3 hours, but as with many marinating recipes, the longer the better.
#Clean then preheat grill at medium.
#Place wings on grill.
#Turn once, or four times, during next 20 minutes.

==Notes, Tips, And Variations==
*Cut the chicken wings into two pieces at the elbow joint (recommended).
*For the health conscious, remove the chicken skin.
*Heat marinade on grill along with chicken wings, add a little to the wings when done.
*1 teaspoon of ginger powder can be substituted for the fresh ginger.
*Feel free to apply the marinade recipe to other chicken cuts, such as breasts. A shish-kabob variation of this recipe is also excellent.

==Warnings==
*Ensure a clean kitchen environment (hands, surfaces, etc) since this recipe requires marinating.
*As with all fish and poultry, [[Cookbook:Chicken#Foodborne_Organisms_Associated_with_Chicken|clean then rinse the chicken]].
*Never reuse a marinade without first heating it to a boil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yes, there is a new, free, non copyrighted cookbook that came in the mail recently. It has the same recipe.

I said to my mom &quot;isnt this your recipe?&quot;, and she agreed it was the same, but said &quot;Josh, its not a unique family recipe. Its just chicken wings&quot;

But damn it, 
it's the best thing she cooks...

It is what we call &quot;generic&quot; or traditional much like British Blues. You know Clapton. Page, Beck, and others imported the likes of Howlin Wolf and Muddy Waters to learn their guitar riffs and record their versions... What connection relates to this recipe, simple. Early Brits Band which some of later great guitarist, was named the yard birds. Slang for chicken!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Solution of Algebraic and Transcendental Equations==
An equation of the type &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; is either algebraic or transcendental.

E.g, these equations are algebraic.
:&lt;math&gt;2x=5 \quad x^2+x=1 \quad x^7=x(1+2x) &lt;/math&gt;
and these are transcendental
:&lt;math&gt; \sin x = 0 \quad \quad e^\sqrt{x} = \pi \quad \tan x = x&lt;/math&gt;

While roots can be found directly for algebraic equations of fourth order or lower, and for a few special transcendental equations, in practice we need to solve equations of higher order and also arbitrary transcendental equations.

As analytic solutions are often either too cumbersome or simply do not exist, we need to find an approximate method of solution. This is where numerical analysis comes into the picture.

===Some Useful Observations===
* The total number of roots an algebraic equation can have is the same as its degree.
* An algebraic equation can have at most as many positive roots as the number of changes of sign in &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* An algebraic equation can have at most as many negative roots as the number of changes of sign in &lt;math&gt;f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* In an algebraic equation with real coefficients, complex roots occur in conjugate pairs
* If &lt;math&gt;f(x)=a_0x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+a_2x^{n-2}+...+a_{n-1}x+a_n&lt;/math&gt; with roots &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt; then the following hold good:
** &lt;math&gt;\sum_i\alpha_i=\frac{-a_1}{a_0}&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i&lt;j}{\alpha_i\alpha_j}=\frac{a_2}{a_0}&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;\prod_i\alpha_i=(-1)^n \frac{a_n}{a_0}&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(a)f(b)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; then a root must exist in the interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

===Initial Approximation===
The last point about the interval is one of the most useful properties numerical methods use to find the roots. 
All of them have in common the requirement that we need to make an initial guess for the root.
Practically, this is easy to do graphically.
Simply plot the equation and make a rough estimate of the solution.
Analytically, we can usually choose any point in an interval where a change of sign takes place.
However, this is subject to certain conditions that vary from method to method.

===Convergence===
A numerical method to solve equations will be a long process. We would like to know, if the method will lead to a solution (close to the exact solution) or will lead us away from the solution.
If the method, leads to the solution, then we say that the method is convergent. 
Otherwise, the method is said to be divergent.i.e, in case of linear and non linear interpolation convergence means tends to 0.

===Rate of Convergence===
Various methods converge to the root at different rates.
That is, some methods are slow to converge and it takes a long time to arrive at the root, while other methods can lead us to the root faster.
This is in general a compromise between ease of calculation and time.

For a computer program however, it is generally better to look at methods which converge quickly.
The rate of convergence could be linear or of some higher order.
The higher the order, the faster the method converges.

If &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the error in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th iteration, ignoring sign, then the order is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^n}&lt;/math&gt; is approximately constant.

It is also important to note that the chosen method will converge only if &lt;math&gt;e_{i+1}&lt;e_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Bisection Method===
This is one of the simplest methods and is strongly based on the property of intervals.
To find a root using this method, the first thing to do is to find an interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a) \cdot f(b) &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
Bisect this interval to get a point &lt;math&gt;(c,f(c))&lt;/math&gt;.
Choose one of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; so that the sign of &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; is opposite to the ordinate at that point.
Use this as the new interval and proceed until you get the root within desired accuracy.

=====Example=====
'''Solve &lt;math&gt;2x^3+x^2-20x+12&lt;/math&gt; correct up to 2 decimal places.'''

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=4x^4+3x^3+2x-7&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow f(2) \cdot f(3) &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \epsilon = \frac{1}{2}10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow i = \frac{2.3010}{0.3010} = 8&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow x_1=2.5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1)=5.625 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow x_2 = 2.25&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow ... x_8 = 2.09&lt;/math&gt;

====Error Analysis====
The maximum error after the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th iteration using this process will be given as
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i=\frac{|b-a|}{2^i}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow i\ge\frac{[\log(b-a)-\log\epsilon_i]}{\log 2}&lt;/math&gt;

As the interval at each iteration is halved, we have 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon_{i+1}}{\epsilon_i} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus this method converges linearly.

If we are interested in the number of iterations the ''Bisection Method'' needs to converge to a root within a certain tolerance than we can use the formula for the maximum error. 

=====Example=====
'''How many iterations do you need to get the root if you start with ''a'' = 1 and ''b'' = 2 and the tolerance is 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;?'''

The error &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; needs to be smaller than 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Use the formula for the maximum error:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i = 2^{-i} \cdot (2-1) &lt; 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i = 2^{-i} &lt; 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Solve for ''i'' using log rules &lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\log_{10}{2^{-i}} &lt; \log_{10}{10^{-4}} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -i \cdot \log_{10}{2} &lt; -4 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i &gt; \frac{4}{\log_{10}{2}} = 13.29 = 14 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Hence 14 iterations will ensure an approximation to the root accurate to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;. Note: the error analysis only gives a bound approximation to the error; the actual error may be much smaller.

===False Position Method===
The false position method (sometimes called the regula falsi method) is essentially same as the bisection method -- except that instead of bisecting the interval, we find where the chord joining the two points meets the X axis. The roots are calculated using the equation of the chord, i.e. putting &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; in

:&lt;math&gt;y-f(x_0)=\frac{f(x_1)-f(x_0)}{x_1-x_0}(x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

The rate of convergence is still linear but faster than that of the bisection method. Both these methods will fail if ''f'' has a double root.

====Example====
Consider ''f''(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-1. We already know the roots of this equation, so we can easily check how fast the regula falsi method converges.

For our initial guess, we'll use the interval [0,2].

Since ''f'' is concave upwards and increasing, a quick sketch of the geometry shows that the chord will always intersect the ''x''-axis to the left of the solution. This can be confirmed by a little algebra.

We'll call our ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; iteration of the interval [''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, 2]

The chord intersects the ''x''-axis when

:&lt;math&gt;-(a_n^2-1)=\frac{(2^2-1)-(a_n^2-1)}{2-a_n} (x-a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging and simplifying gives

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1+2a_n}{2+a_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is always less than the root, it is also ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;

The difference between ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and the root is ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-1, but

:&lt;math&gt;e_{n+1}=\frac{1+2a_n}{2+a_n}-1 = \frac{a_n-1}{a_n+2} =
\frac{1}{a_n+2}e_n &lt;/math&gt;

This is always smaller than ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; when ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive. When ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; approaches 1, each extra iteration reduces the error by two-thirds, rather than one-half as the bisection method would.

The order of convergence of this method is 2/3 and is linear.

In this case, the lower end of the interval tends to the root, and the minimum error tends to zero, but the upper limit and maximum error remain fixed. This is not uncommon.

===Fixed Point Iteration (or Staircase method)===

If we can write ''f''(''x'')=0 in the form ''x''=''g''(''x''), then the point ''x'' would be a &lt;u&gt;fixed point&lt;/u&gt; of the function ''g'' (that is, the input of ''g'' is also the output). Then an obvious sequence to consider is

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=g(x_n) \,&lt;/math&gt;

If we look at this on a graph we can see how this could converge to the intersection. &lt;!-- image goes here --&gt;

Any function can be written in this form if we define ''g''(''x'')=''f''(''x'')+''x'', though in some cases other rearrangements may prove more useful. 

====Error analysis====

We define the error at the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; step to be

:&lt;math&gt;e_n=x_n-x \mbox{ where } x=g(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
e_{n+1} &amp; = &amp; x_{n+1}-x &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; g(x_n)-x &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; g(x+e_n) -x &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; -x + g(x)+ e_n g^\prime(x) + \cdots &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; e_n g^\prime(x) + \cdots &amp; \mbox{since } g(x)=x
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So, when |''g''&amp;prime;(''x'')|&lt;l,  this sequence converges to a root, and the error will be approximately proportional to ''n''.
 
Because the relationship between ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''linear'', we say that this method ''converges linearly'', if it converges at all.

When ''g''(''x'')=''f''(''x'')+''x'' this means that if

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n+f(x_n) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

converges to a root, ''x'', of ''f'' then

:&lt;math&gt; -2 &lt; f^\prime(x) &lt; 0 \, &lt;/math&gt; 

Note that this convergence will only happen for a certain range of ''x''. If the first estimate is outside that range then no solution will be found.

Also note that although this is a necessary condition for convergence, it does not guarantee convergence. In the error analysis we neglected higher powers of ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but we can only do this if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is small. If our initial error is large, the higher powers may prevent convergence, even when the condition is satisfied.

If |''g''&amp;prime;(''x'')|&lt;1 is true at the root, the iteration sequence will converge  in some interval around the root, which may be smaller than the interval where |''g''&amp;prime;(''x'')|&lt;1. If |''g''&amp;prime;(''x'')| isn't smaller than one at the root, the iteration will not converge to that root.

====Example====


Lets consider &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^3+x-2&lt;/math&gt;, which we can see has a single root at ''x''=1. There are several ways ''f''(''x'')=0 can be written in the desired form, ''x''=''g''(''x'').

The simplest is

1):&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n+f(x_n)=x_n^3 +2x_n -2&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, &lt;math&gt;g'(x)=3x^2+2&lt;/math&gt;, and the convergence condition is

:&lt;math&gt;1&gt;|g'(x)|=3x^2+2, \qquad -1&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is never true, this doesn't converge to the root.

2)An alternate rearrangement is

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=2-x_n^3&lt;/math&gt;

This converges when

:&lt;math&gt;1 &gt; |g'(x)|= |-3x^2|, \qquad x^2 &lt; \frac{1}{3},
\qquad |x| &lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this range does not include the root, this method won't converge either.

3)Another obvious rearrangement is

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=\sqrt[3]{2-x_n}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case the convergence condition becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\left| (2-x_n)^{-\frac{2}{3}} \right| &lt;1, \qquad
\left(2-x_n \right)^{-2} &lt; 3^3, \qquad
|x_n-2|&gt;\sqrt{27} &lt;/math&gt;

Again, this region excludes the root.

4)Another possibility is obtained by dividing by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=\frac{2}{x_n^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case the convergence condition becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4|x|}{(1+x^2)^2}&lt;1, \qquad 4|x| &lt; (1+x^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Consideration of this inequality shows it is satisfied if ''x''&gt;1, so if we start with such an ''x'', this will converge to the root.

Clearly, finding a method of this type which converges is not always straightforwards.

===Newton-Raphson===

In numerical analysis, Newton's method (also known as the Newton–Raphson method or the Newton–Fourier method) is an efficient algorithm for finding approximations to the zeros (or roots) of a real-valued function. As such, it is an example of a root-finding algorithm.

Any zero-finding method (Bisection Method, False Position Method, Newton-Raphson, etc.)
can also be used to find a minimum or maximum of such a function, by finding a zero in the function's first derivative, see Newton's method as an optimization algorithm.

====Description of the method====

The idea of the Newton-Raphson method is as follows: one starts with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the true root, then the function is approximated by its tangent line (which can be computed using the tools of calculus), and one computes the x-intercept of this tangent line (which is easily done with elementary algebra). This x-intercept will typically be a better approximation to the function's root than the original guess, and the method can be iterated.
Suppose f : [a, b] → R is a differentiable function defined on the interval [a, b] with values in the real numbers R. The formula for converging on the root can be easily derived. Suppose we have some current approximation xn. Then we can derive the formula for a better approximation, xn+1 by referring to the diagram on the right. We know from the definition of the derivative at a given point that it is the slope of a tangent at that point.

We can get better convergence if we know about the function's derivatives. Consider the tangent to the function:
[[Image:Newton iteration.png|thumb|Tangent is in red; the function itself in blue.]]

Near any point, the tangent at that point is approximately the same as ''f''('x'') itself, so we can use the tangent to approximate the function.

The tangent through the point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{y-f(x_n)}{x-x_n}=f'(x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

The next approximation, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, is where the tangent line intersects the axis, so where ''y''=0. Rearranging, we find

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}&lt;/math&gt;

====Error analysis====

Again, we define the root to be ''x'', and the error at the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; step to be

:&lt;math&gt;e_n=x_n-x \,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the error at the next step is

:&lt;math&gt;e_{n+1} =  e_n - \frac{f(x)+e_n f'(x)+ \frac{1}{2}e_n^2 f''(x)+ \cdots}
{f'(x)+e_n f''(x)+ \cdots }&lt;/math&gt; (1)

where we've written ''f'' as a Taylor series round its root, ''x''. Rearranging this, and using ''f''(''x'')=0, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
e_{n+1} &amp; = &amp; e_n &amp; - &amp; e_n \left( f'(x)+\frac{1}{2}e_n f''(x) \right) /f'(x) + \cdots \\
&amp; = &amp; -\frac{f''(x)}{f'(x)}e_n^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots  
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where we've neglected cubic and higher powers of the error, since they will be much smaller than the squared term, when the error itself is small.

Notice that the error is squared at each step. This means that the number of correct decimal places ''doubles'' with each step, much faster than linear convergence.

This sequence will converge if

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \frac{f''(x)}{f'(x)}e_n^2 \right| &lt; |e_n|, \qquad
|e_n|&lt; \frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

If ''f''&amp;prime; isn't zero at the root, then there will always be a range round the root where this method converges.

If ''f''&amp;prime; is zero at the root, then on looking again at (1) we see that we get

:&lt;math&gt;e_{n+1} =  e_n /2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the convergence becomes merely linear.

Overall, this method works well, provided ''f'' does not have a minimum near its root, but it can only be used if the derivative is known.

====Example====

Let's consider ''f''(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''a''. Here, we know the roots exactly, so we can see better just how well the method converges.

We have 

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n-\frac{x_n^2-a}{2x_n} 
= \frac{x_n^2+a}{2x_n} = \frac{1}{2}\left( x_n + \frac{a}{x_n} \right) &lt;/math&gt; 

This method is easily implemented, even with just pen and paper, and has been used to rapidly estimate square roots since long before Newton. &lt;!-- Babylonian, I think, but check. --&gt;

The ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; error is ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-&amp;radic;''a'', so we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
e_{n+1} &amp; = &amp; \frac{(e_n+\sqrt{a})^2+a}{2(\sqrt{a}+e_n)} - \sqrt{a} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{2a+2e_n\sqrt{a}+e_n^2}{2(\sqrt{a}+e_n)} - \sqrt{a} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{2(\sqrt{a}+e_n)\sqrt{a}+e_n^2}{2(\sqrt{a}+e_n)} - \sqrt{a} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{e_n^2}{2(\sqrt{a}+e_n)}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''a''=0, this simplifies to ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/2, as expected.

If ''a''&gt;0, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; will be positive, provided ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than -&amp;radic;''a'', i.e provided ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive. Thus, starting from any positive number, all the errors, except perhaps the first will be positive.

The method converges when,

:&lt;math&gt; |e_{n+1}| = \left| \frac{e_n^2}{2(\sqrt{a}+e_n)} \right| &lt; |e_n| &lt;/math&gt;

so, assuming ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive, it converges when

:&lt;math&gt; e_n &lt; 2 \left( e_n + \sqrt{a} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which is always true.

This method converges to the square root, ''starting from any positive number'', and it does so quadratically.

===Higher order methods===

There are methods that converge even faster than Newton-Raphson. e.g

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{f''(x_n)f^2(x_n)}{{f'}^3(x_n)}
&lt;/math&gt;

which converge cubicly, tripling the number of correct digits at each iteration, which is 50% faster than Newton-Raphson.

However, if iterating each step takes 50% longer, due to the more complex formula, there is no net gain in speed. For this reason, methods such as this are seldom used.

Red Devils are a hot, open faced sandwich. They are a great dinner or lunch.  They include all the major food groups and taste great.  Their ease of preparation makes them suitable for people on the move and the recipe can easily be scaled up or down for family or guests.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Processed Cheese|American cheese]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]], diced
*[[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]]

Makes 9-12 sandwiches depending on the size of the cookie sheet

==Procedure==
#Place bacon in a pan.
#Set the broiler to 'Low.'
#Pre-cook the bacon until it is about halfway done.
#While bacon cooks, place white bread on a sheet, one slice per diner.
#Place a slice of American cheese on each slice of bread.
#Place the tomato slices on each sandwich
#Sprinkle a small amount of onion onto each sandwich.
#Place a strip of half cooked bacon on each sandwich.
#Place the cookie sheet in broiler and set to maximum temperature and broil for approximately 3-4 minutes.
#''You must check on The Red Devils often to prevent burning''.
#Remove once the bread is toasted, the cheese is golden at the edges, and the bacon is fully cooked.

==Tips, tricks, and variations==

Often it may be easier to eat with utensils instead of by hand.

The bacon is usually too long to fit on the sandwich so cut it in half.  One strip of bacon is usually used per sandwich so it will have 2 halves on it when finished.

Precooking the bacon may be accomplished while preparing the rest of the food.  It is best to cook until between rare and crisp.

Red devils usually require one tomato per sheet of sandwiches but may vary depending upon the size of your sheets or the size of your tomato slices.

A whole onion is not needed for a tray of Red Devils.  A small sprinkling of diced onions is sufficient. Sweet onions or red onions are a good substitution for normal white &quot;storage&quot; onions.

As always, you can experiment or change things according to your tastes.

==Warnings==

''It is very important to check on the Red Devils once they are in the oven''.  They can quickly change from being undercooked to overcooked within a few seconds.  The goal is to quickly cook the bacon and toast the bread and cheese without making the sandwich too hot to eat soon after being finished.

==&quot;And&quot; and &quot;And?&quot; &quot;Or&quot; or &quot;Or&quot;?==

One thing that varies in korean is that there is a difference between an “and” for a verb and an “and” for a noun.  In this lesson, we will learn these ands, ors, and buts.  It just so happens that today 찬호 is introducing his friends to Joseph, so this is a perfect opportunity to use these forms! (Don't feel overwhelmed, there's only 3 ways to say each!)

:찬호: &lt;big&gt;오늘 저는 조세프에게 친구들을 소개하겠습니다.&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;오케이! 기대합니다!&lt;/big&gt;
:찬호: &lt;big&gt;저 친구들은 &quot;연희&quot;와 &quot;가영&quot;입니다.&lt;/big&gt;
:저세프: &lt;big&gt;만나서 반갑습니다!&lt;/big&gt;
:연희와 가영: &lt;big&gt;반갑습니다.&lt;/big&gt;
:연희: &lt;big&gt;조세프는 미국에서 왔고 한국말을 공부하고 있습니까?&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;네, 그래요.&lt;/big&gt;
:가영: &lt;big&gt;와우! 고생 많네요! 한식을 좋아합니까?&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;양식이나 한식 둘 다 좋아합니다. 하지만, 한국에서 양식을 먹지 않습니다.&lt;/big&gt;
:가영: &lt;big&gt;그렇군요... 학교에 걸어갑니까? 아니면 버스를 탑니까?&lt;/big&gt;
:찬호: &lt;big&gt;집에서 버스를 타지 못합니다. 걸어가거나 뛰어갑니다. 하하하!&lt;/big&gt;

The above example has several new forms in it because of the differentiation between noun &quot;and/or&quot; &amp; verb &quot;and/or&quot;.  We'll look at the examples and pick out new vocabulary, and then discuss new grammar separately.&lt;br&gt;

:찬호: &lt;big&gt;오늘 저는 조세프에게 친구들을 소개하겠습니다.&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;오케이! 기대합니다!&lt;/big&gt;

[[wikt:소개하다|소개하다]] means &quot;to introduce.&quot;  It's used really often when talking about friends and people you know, but it can also be used to refer to something like &quot;introducing information.&quot; Following that, [[wikt:기대하다|기대하다]] means &quot;to await expectedly or excitedly.&quot;  This can also be said 기대되다, which sometimes sounds more natural.

:찬호: &lt;big&gt;저 친구들은 &quot;연희&quot;와 &quot;가영&quot;입니다.&lt;/big&gt;

Here we meet the noun connective particle [[wikt:와|와]] (“and”) and its alternative [[wikt:과|과]], used after consonants.  More information can be learned about this in the following section, but its use is fairly straight forward.

:찬호: &lt;big&gt;만나서 반갑습니다!&lt;/big&gt;
:연희와 가영: &lt;big&gt;반갑습니다.&lt;/big&gt;

Nothing new here. &lt;br&gt;

:연희: &lt;big&gt;조세프는 미국에서 왔고 한국말을 공부하고 있습니까?&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;네, 그래요.&lt;/big&gt;

[[wikt:오다|오다]] means “to come” (the form you see, &quot;왔-&quot; in this sentence is past tense.) but the connective verb suffix [[wikt:-고|-고]] (“and”) is connected to it (왔고).  [[wikt:에서|에서]] in this case means “from”. (So keep track! You now know it means “from” or “at”.)  Finally, Joseph responds with [[wikt:그러다|그래요]] (“that’s right”).

:가영: &lt;big&gt;와! 고생 많네요! 한식을 좋아합니까?&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;양식이나 한식 둘 다 좋아합니다. 하지만, 한국에서는 양식을 먹지 않습니다.&lt;/big&gt;

가영 uses a phrase that is often heard in Korea: &quot;고생 많다.&quot;  This means &quot;you have lots of struggles,&quot; but is used sort of like &quot;must be difficult,&quot; a sort of compliment for the listener who might be going through hard times.  The ending on this is &quot;VS+군요&quot; Which is a sort of exclamatory form.  This will also be discussed in the next section.  &quot;한식&quot; means &quot;Korean food,&quot; a sort of contraction of &quot;한국 음식,&quot; and &quot;양식&quot; is &quot;Western food.&quot;  Can you guess the contraction for this one?

Joseph links the two with &quot;N+(이)나&quot; which is &quot;or&quot; for nouns. The verb form is &quot;VS+거나&quot; (discussed later, of course).  &quot;둘 다&quot; means &quot;both&quot;  Afterwards, Joseph uses the stand alone word &quot;하지만,&quot; meaning &quot;however&quot; or &quot;but.&quot;  The verb form of this is &quot;VS+지만.&quot;  It's simplicity doesn't merit any further discussion.

:가영: &lt;big&gt;그렇군요... 학교에 걸어갑니까? 아니면 버스를 탑니까?&lt;/big&gt;
:찬호: &lt;big&gt;집에서 버스를 타지 못합니다. 걸어가거나 뛰어갑니다. 하하하!&lt;/big&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a Wikipedia vetran, who came to Wikibooks to find practise problems for Statistics. I am trying to teach it to myself, and I have a good textbook, but I don't have the answers to the practise problems. Since the stats Wikibook doesn't have practise problems, I figure that I can write up some practise problems. If I'm fairly confident of the answer, I will give the answer and then other users can double-check. If I don't understand a topic, I'll just note that we need a question addressing that topic.

I couldn't find any precedent or discussion about practise problems, so I'll just go ahead and get started.</text>

== Practice Problems ==

I added a &quot;practise problem&quot; section. I see no precedent for this, nor any discussion of it, so I'm just going ahead and doing something. I'll mark the new problem as new. Please double check those and then remove the &quot;new&quot; marking. Thanks. [[User:AdamRetchless|AdamRetchless]] 14:05, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:It might make more sense to put a 'practice problem' section at the end of each chapter. But what if the last chapter (where you have these practice problems now) had solutions to the &quot;odd numbered problems&quot; as is often the case in textbooks? --[[User:Murraytodd|Murraytodd]] 19:32, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::I don't know why we wouldn't just put the answers to ''all'' the problems.  I don't know what the learning value would be of questions without answers.  And it seems like, in order to develop a question, you must've also developed the answer.  Why throw away that work?  Don't the commercial textbooks do it so that there can be problems to be graded on?  Nobody is grading you here.  Nobody has the teacher's edition.

== Quantiles/Quartiles ==

This is probably fairly moot since the actual section hasn't even been written yet, but should the section be titled Quantiles or Quartiles? Both are common in statistics and I don't know which would be more likely to be the header of a section.--[[User:Carraway|Carraway]] 19:05, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:Good point.  Quartiles are a better title given the context of the chapter.  --[[User:Llywelyn|Llywelyn]] 08:18, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I would disagree.  Quantiles is a more general term. Ie. a quartile is a type of quantile, but the converse is not true. In fact, the quartile section now discusses quantiles, quinties and percentiles, none of which are quartiles! --[[User:Murraytodd|Murraytodd]] 19:32, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I agree with Murraytodd, the section should be titled &quot;Quantiles&quot;, since not only quartiles are mentioned, but also quintiles, deciles and percentiles.[[User:Nijdam|Nijdam]] 16:05, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:As far as I know, quintiles is the general term. For example &lt;math&gt; F(x)= 1 - \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is called the alpha-quintile of the stochastic variable X. Quartile refers to fixed quintiles in steps of 25%, where alpha is 25%, 50% (median) and 75%. For steps of 10% we have got deciles, and for single percentages we have percentiles. I hope that I am bringing light to this discussion. I will see if I can fix it.

== Distributions ==

I took the liberty or rearranging the distributions chapter a little bit. First, I separated the discrete and continuous distributions, then I placed them in a more natural order—from the simplest to the more complex. We should be careful when writing this chapter to create a consistent &quot;train of thought&quot; to link these distributions together, lest our &quot;textbook&quot; turn into an unreadable encyclopedia. I would suggest that whenever applicable we show phenomena in the real world that follow these sorts of distributions. For example, the Exponential distribution being a good measure of &quot;time to failure&quot; like the lifespan of lightbulbs; the Poisson distribution being the distribution of how many customers walk into a store in any 5-minute interval; the Binomial distribution being the number of students in the classroom with green eyes—and thus a sum of simple Bernoulli trials. (Oh, and I added the Bournoulli distribution!) --[[User:Murraytodd|Murraytodd]] 19:32, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== A Programming Language ==

What would people think of the idea of adopting R as an optional tool for students within this text? R is arguably the up-and-coming standard in academic statistics programs (at least the graduate programs) and it's Open Source and available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It would be nice to occasionally show how results can be computed using R. When we show graphs of distributions, etc., we could include the R code that was used to generate those graphs. It would be an excellent resource for potential students. --[[User:Murraytodd|Murray Todd Williams]] 22:38, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:While I like the idea of adding a section on R, I do not believe that it should be integrated through the text.  There is too much of an emphasis today on getting a piece of software and/or hardware to do someone's thinking for them, and at least I would advocate that for an ''introductory'' course in something as basic as statistics should emphasis the ''process'' and the ''understanding'' and not the '''function,''' which is the emphasis of software packages. 

:That having been said: I personally think a chapter, set of chapters, integrating sections into chapters of more advanced statistics (e.g., multivariate analysis), or even a separate textbook on R would be incredibly valuable.  --[[User:Llywelyn|Llywelyn]] 01:39, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:: I agree with the ''spirit'' of your concern, but I still think R would provide the student with a quick way to explore the field. Back in the days of SAS and SPSS I would wholeheartedly agree with you. Those packages focused on the &quot;load up the data into the black-box, hit go, and assume the reams of meaningless output was a good thing&quot;. R, however, is more of an interactive language that makes it easy for the student to &quot;play around with&quot; and explore these concepts quickly. 

:: Instead of looking around for a calculator that can somehow handle factorials and punching in esoteric equations, the student can quickly type something like dpoisson(0:6,3) and see the probabilities of of Poisson distribution with lambda parameter=3 for X=0..6. Add a quick plot() function around that and the student can see that graphically. A little more and the student can overlay a normal distribution and see how well (or poorly) a normal curve will approximate it. Equally easy the student can create a vector with a random sample from that same Poisson distribution.

:: Frankly, I can't imagine ''teaching'' statistics without providing some mechanism for ''playing around'' with examples and encouraging the student to do the same. Also, with some pre-generated sample data it becomes easy to create ''homework'' problems that encourage exploration, examination, etc. I don't mean saying &quot;load this data set and perform an ANOVA and give me a p-value from the pre-canned report&quot; but rather &quot;Here's a set of data. Do you think an ANOVA would be suitable? What problems and questions are we facing? Do you feel the sample size is sufficient, or is the problem over-parameterized?&quot;

:: Of course, this discussion is (pardon the pun:) academic. Probably the best thing to do would be to go ahead and write a section or two (with problems) to demonstrate what I'm thinking and get feedback to see if people concur. --[[User:Murraytodd|Murray Todd Williams]] 16:44, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:::It sounds like there are two independent issues here: 1) whether to add practical problems with online data that students can use to better understand the concepts and 2) whether to include statistical-package specific information on how to implement different types of analysis. In my mind, these can be implemented seperately. 

:::For the first case, the homework problems can include data for students to use with any of the common packages. For the second case, my opinion is that this should not be directly integrated into the text because people might be reading them to understand the core concepts and forcing them to read through a bunch of programming syntax while they do so will lose a lot of these types of readers. 

:::Rather an external page with a title like 'implementing historgrams' or 'how it's done' with a step by step process and code for major languages, Excel, oo and the like would be a great resource for more advanced readers. I'd think that a lot of this type of info could reference other textbooks in wikibooks or not to reduce duplication. [[User:Antonrojo|Antonrojo]] 13:38, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

== Random Variables? ==

The way I was taught probability, it doesn't make much sense to discuss distributions without any discussion of random variables.  Is this a standard approach, or are the probability courses I have taken odd?  I'm willing to add a section on random variables and adjust the sections regarding distributions if other people think this is a good idea. [[User:Adamwg|Adam Wolfe Gordon]] 02:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== Just a quick comment... ==

...And I guess it's a little ridiculous to add it to the discussion page -- no response required! -- but I just wanted to thank everyone who's contributing to this book, I'm really excited that there'll be an open, online introductory book on statistics, and hopefully a broader array of statistics books to come.

==Frequency Density==

I haven't done much yet other than the definitions, but in the histogram section I started frequency density. Do you think this can be applied to statistics and the course? [[User:Pinkie closes|Pinkie closes]] 20:00, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== merge &quot;Research Methods&quot; into this page? ==

I actually have a couple of comments.

First, this is fantastic!  I hope it's a topic at a future statistics conference.

Second, I definitely like the idea of using R.  However, that may well require another separate document on installing/updating/how to...

Finally, some material is synonomous with the Research Methods site.  Since Statistics is currently more comprehensive, I'd suggest merging that data in with this one.  I was expecting more of a study design flavor at that site, but didn't find it.

== Who is this book aimed at? ==
Please make clear who this book is supposed to be aimed at. Doing so will guide the content. Whole books have been written on linear models, graphing data, testing hypotheses, and so on. This single book cannot cover all areas in the depth they deserve. The level of depth depends on the intended audience, though. A book aimed at 18 year old students of statistics will be very different from one aimed at 21 year old students of statistics or at medical practitioners, for example.

Basically we should ask who is willing to contribute? The contribution from me and my students (Numerical Methods &amp; Analysis of Specific Datasets) might be little to high-level for student in basic statistics courses. On the other hand I would not mind to move it to another book, e.g. something like &quot;Various topics in statistics&quot;. --[[User:sigbert|sigbert]] 11:25, 02 April 2007 (MESZ)

== Permutations and combinations ==

Should we have a section on permutations and combinations and if so where? [[User:Zginder|Zginder]] 20:13, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

== Issue with the PDF ==

The PDF version of this book has two issues that I can see - one is that tables go over two pages with no additional column headings, and also it's showing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. - [[Special:Contributions/114.76.227.0|114.76.227.0]] ([[User talk:114.76.227.0|discuss]]) 07:07, 5 October 2011 (UTC)

These two issues have been resolved in the PDF I uploaded today.[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 20:34, 28 October 2011 (UTC)</text>

:White sugar is vegan insofar as there are no animal products in it. You may consider the possibility of using bone charcoal to be unacceptable, though. (I tend not to care; the animals aren't killed for their bones -- better to use the waste products for something productive) In any case, replacing with turbinado, fructose, evaporated cane (florida crystals), etc is usually fine; add a bit of molassas =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]

Gazpacho is a Spanish recipe which originated in Andalucia. The authentic gazpacho recipe is Andaluz and I think wikibooks should reflect that. The addition of chilli is a Latin American innovation, and I think should just be mentioned as an aside. [[User:87.127.73.65|87.127.73.65]] 21:04, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quality of whole &quot;US History&quot; book is so low that in my opinion it should be deleted, and started anew if someone feels like doing it right.

Anyway, partial list of mistakes in just this chapter:
:After World War I, the Germans felt that they had been treated unfairly by being forced to pay reparations to the Allies. Taking advantage of German resentment for the Treaty of Versailles, Adolf Hitler and his supporters attempted to stir up rebellion in 1923. Hitler failed and was sentenced to prison for treason.

It wasn't about having to pay reparations &amp;ndash; the existence of reparations was agreed in armistice negotiations. The reparations in Treaty of Versailles far exceeded those agreed during those negotiations and those that were possible to be actually paid. The treaty contained many other points which tried to damage Germany beyond what was usual practice of the time. It has been analyzed many time, including the famous analysis of Keynes, so I'm not going to repeat that here. And in any case &amp;ndash; not that was the direct reason of the putsch.

Direct cause of the Beer Hall Putsch were domestic, with change of policy of the central government under new chancellor. The putsch was also only one of many revolts that took place in Germany in years following the war. It wasn't largest, or special in any way except for involving Adolf Hitler.

:However, in 1928, a freed Hitler's Nazi Party stood for election, 

Hitler was freed much earlier - in 1924.

:Jews and opponents of the Nazi Party were sent to concentration camps, where they were tortured or killed.

You're confusing concentration camps with death camps. Mass killings in death camps didn't start till much later &amp;ndash; early 1942.

:Hitler contended that Germans belonged to a race superior to other races, thus, in the minds of many German people, justifying the Holocaust, the killing and torture of Jews.

&quot;Killing and torture&quot; of the Jews didn't start until much later.

:Hitler had no intention of keeping his agreement. In 1939, he took over the remainder of Czechoslovakia and turned his sights to Poland. France and the United Kingdom agreed to come to Poland's aid, but Germany signed the Nazi-Soviet Pact, which ensured the neutrality of the Soviet Union (formerly Russia).

:On the first day of September in 1939, Germany declared war on Poland; the British and French responded by declaring war on Germany two days later.

:The Germans used the tactic of blitzkrieg (lightning war) in Poland, defeating the Polish Army at lightning speed. By the end of the first week of October, the Germans had gained control of all of Poland. The British and French had done little to aid Poland, fearing a repeat of the First World War.

This is not a mistake &amp;ndash; I'm sure it's a deliberate lie by the author.
The pact didn't ensure '''neutrality''' of the Soviet Union, it ensured full cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union and it divided Central Europe between the two.

Not saying a word about Soviet involvement in attack on Poland and saying instead that &quot;Germans had gained control of all of Poland&quot; (while about half of it was occupied by the Soviets, not Germans) just confirms my suspicions that it wasn't just a mistake.

:Hitler's Germany was the supreme power on Continental Europe. Only the United Kingdom offered resistance.

Soviet Union's existence isn't even acknowledged. In fact the Soviet Union was the main potential danger for Germany (with which it tried to deal with preemptive strike), not Britain.

:The Yalta conference suggested the division of Germany into &quot;zones&quot; after the war for the purpose of reconstruction. Also, the leaders decided to punish Nazis who had participated in war crimes such as the Holocaust.

The main issue wasn't division of Germany, and certainly not the fate of German leadership, but the division of power in Central Europe.

Claiming that the zones were meant for &quot;reconstruction&quot; is also highly inaccurate &amp;ndash; at least the Soviets had no reconstruction in mind and used their zone first to take everything that was possible to be taken, and later to establish a Communist state there.

In addition to these and other inaccuracies and deliberate lies, there are many important omissions, for example of all the Soviet and Allied war crimes. The chapter presents picture of the World War II, which is neither accurate nor neutral. [[User:Taw|Taw]] 01:15, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== VfD discussion ==

* [[US_History/Contents/World_War_II_and_Rise_of_Atomic_Age]], and probably other [[US_History]] modules. I explained the problems with that module in its talk page, but nobody bothered to either answer or to correct the problems. [[User:Taw|Taw]] 03:17, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)
** '''Just edit the page!''' Minor errors, like dates, can be changed easily. If there is a big problem, don't worry about it, just edit the page. It definitely shouldn't be deleted because it has content that isn't entirely wrong or rubbish. If it's as bad as you say it is, just edit the page. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:47, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)
*** Minor errors ? That module consists almost only of errors, half-truths and plain lies. [[User:Taw|Taw]] 04:55, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)
**** Then ''rewrite'' the page! - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:12, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Still a mess ==

I agree with [[User:Taw]] that this chapter is quite a mess.  I am going to make some dramatic attempts to re-organize how the chapter should be designed.  Currently, it reads more like a History of Germany than an American History of World War II. - [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 14:34, 19 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

'''This Document is obsolete, please use [[Aros/Developer/Zune]]'''




===Prerequisites===

Some knowledge of OO (object-oriented) programming is more than welcome when it comes to dealing with Zune or MUI for that matter.  Having said that the principles and techniques used should be easy enough for even the complete beginner to grasp.  [http://www.google.com Google] may also help in the search for good introductory papers on this classic subject.

Knowing AROS (or AmigaOS) APIs and concepts, such as the use of taglists - and of course BOOPSI, is essential to developing with Zune. Having a copy of the official &quot;Amiga Reference Manuals&quot; (aka RKM - Rom Kernel Manuals) may be very useful.

Since Zune is a clone of 'MUI', all the documentation pertaining to it is also applicable to Zune. In particular, the latest available 'MUI developer kit' can be found [http://www.sasg.com/mui/download.html here]. In the LHA archive, 2 documents are of most interest:

:* MUIdev.guide, the MUI programmer documentation.
      
:* PSI.c, the sourcecode of an application demonstrating all the modern MUI practices like object-oriented design and dynamic object creation.

Additionally, this archive contains the MUI autodocs, which can also be used as reference documentations for all Zune classes.

Finally, you will need a good &quot;build&quot; environment to develop under.  AROS favours GCC, since the whole of the main system is generated with it.

==BOOPSI Primer==
===Concepts===

There are four main concepts paramount to BOOPSI.  They are CLASS, OBJECT, ATTRIBUTE and METHOD, and are the building blocks on which BOOPSI is implemented.

====Class====

A class is defined by its name, its parent class and a dispatcher.

;NAME: either a string for the public classes, so that they may be used by any program in the system, or none if its a private class used only by a single application.
      
;PARENT CLASS: all BOOPSI classes form a hierarchy starting from the class aptly named rootclass. BOOPSI allows each subclass to implement its own versions of specific parent operations/functions, or to fall back to ones provided by its &quot;parent&quot;. Also known as base class or super class.
      
;DISPATCHER: This is the entry point for BOOPSI &quot;Classes&quot;.  It provides a single point of access to all operations (called methods) that a class can perform, ensuring that each operation is handled by the proper code or passed to its &quot;super class&quot;.

The BOOPSI type for a class is ..

        Class *

.. also known as IClass.

====Object====

An object is an instance of class: each object has its specific data, but all objects of the same class share the same behavior. An object has several classes if we count the parents of its true class (the most derived one) up to the rootclass.

BOOPSI type for an object is ..

        Object *

It has no field you can directly access.

====Attribute====

Attributes are related to the instance (private) data of each object.

You can't access an objects internal data directly, so it provides a set of &quot;attrbitues&quot;, you can set or get, to modify its internal state. An attribute is implemented as a Tag (ULONG value or'ed with TAG_USER).

GetAttr() and SetAttrs() are used to modify an object's attributes.

AROS also has macros SET() and GET().  To modify/read the state the object has its OM_GET or OM_SET &quot;Method&quot; invoked.

Attributes can be one or more of the following:

      * Initialization-settable (I) : the attribute can be given as parameter
        at the object creation.
      
      * Settable (S) : You can set this attribute at any time (or at least, not
        only creation).
      
      * Gettable (G) : You can get the value of this attribute.

====Method====

A BOOPSI method is a function which receives as parameters an object, a class and a message:

      * object: the object you act on
      
      * class: the considered class for this object.
      
      * message: contains a method ID which determines the function to call within
        a dispatcher, and is followed by its parameters.

To send a message to an object, use the DoMethod() call. It will try to use the true class of the object to perform the chosen method first.  If the class implements the method, it will perform the required operation. If the class DOESNT implement the method  it will try the parent class, and so on up the chain until the message is handled or the rootclass is reached (in this case, the unknown message is silently discarded).

The most minimal class could consist of 1 method - OM_NEW, although its use would be extremely limited.

===Examples===

Let's see basic examples of this OOP framework:
====Getting an attribute====

We'll query a MUI String object for its content:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
      void f(Object *string)
      {
          IPTR result;
      
          GetAttr(string, MUIA_String_Contents, &amp;result);
          printf(&quot;String content is: %s\n&quot;, (STRPTR)result);
      }
&lt;/source&gt;
* Object * is the type of BOOPSI objects.
      
* IPTR must be used for the type of the result, which can be an integer
or a pointer. An IPTR is always written in memory, so using a smaller
type would lead to memory corruption!
      
* Here we query a MUI String object for its content: MUIA_String_Contents,
as any other attribute, is a ULONG (it's a Tag)

Zune applications use more often the get() and XGET() macros instead:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
      get(string, MUIA_String_Contents, &amp;result);
      
      result = XGET(string, MUIA_String_Contents);
&lt;/source&gt;

====Setting an attribute====

Let's change the content of our string:

      SetAttrs(string, MUIA_String_Contents, (IPTR)&quot;hello&quot;, TAG_DONE);

      * Pointers parameters must be casted to IPTR to avoid warnings.
      
      * After the object parameter, a taglist is passed to SetAttrs and thus must
        end with TAG_DONE.

You'll find the set() macro useful:

      set(string, MUIA_String_Contents, (IPTR)&quot;hello&quot;);

But it's only with SetAttrs() that you can set several attributes at once:

      SetAttrs(string,
            MUIA_Disabled, TRUE,
            MUIA_String_Contents, (IPTR)&quot;hmmm...&quot;,
            TAG_DONE);

====Calling a method====

Let's see the most called method in a Zune program, the event processing method called in your main loop:

      result = DoMethod(obj, MUIM_Application_NewInput, (IPTR)&amp;sigs);

      * Parameters are not a taglist, and thus don't end with TAG_DONE.
      
      * You have to cast pointers to IPTR to avoid warnings.

==Hello world==

[http://www.aros.org/documentation/developers/zune/images/hello.png Screenshot 'Hello World']

First things first! I knew you would be all excited.
===Source===

Let's study our first real life example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
      // gcc hello.c -lmui
      #include &lt;exec/types.h&gt;
      #include &lt;libraries/mui.h&gt;
      
      #include &lt;proto/exec.h&gt;
      #include &lt;proto/intuition.h&gt;
      #include &lt;proto/muimaster.h&gt;
      #include &lt;clib/alib_protos.h&gt;
      
      int main(void)
      {
          Object *wnd, *app, *but;
      
          // GUI creation
          app = ApplicationObject,
              SubWindow, wnd = WindowObject,
                  MUIA_Window_Title, &quot;Hello world!&quot;,
                  WindowContents, VGroup,
                      Child, TextObject,
                          MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;\33cHello world!\nHow are you?&quot;,
                          End,
                      Child, but = SimpleButton(&quot;_Ok&quot;),
                      End,
                  End,
              End;
      
          if (app != NULL)
          {
              ULONG sigs = 0;
      
              // Click Close gadget or hit Escape to quit
              DoMethod(wnd, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Window_CloseRequest, TRUE,
                       (IPTR)app, 2,
                       MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);
      
              // Click the button to quit
              DoMethod(but, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Pressed, FALSE,
                       (IPTR)app, 2,
                       MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);
      
              // Open the window
              set(wnd, MUIA_Window_Open, TRUE);
      
              // Check that the window opened
              if (XGET(wnd, MUIA_Window_Open))
              {
                  // Main loop
                  while((LONG)DoMethod(app, MUIM_Application_NewInput, (IPTR)&amp;sigs)
                        != MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)
                  {
                      if (sigs)
                      {
                          sigs = Wait(sigs | SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
                          if (sigs &amp; SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
                              break;
                      }
                  }
              }
              // Destroy our application and all its objects
              MUI_DisposeObject(app);
          }
          
          return 0;
      }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Remarks===
====General====

We don't manually open libraries, it's done automatically for us.
====GUI creation====

We use a macro-based language to easily build our GUI. A Zune application has always 1 and only 1 Application object:

      app = ApplicationObject,

An application can have 0, 1 or more Window objects. Most often a single one:

            SubWindow, wnd = WindowObject,

Be nice, give a title to the window:

                  MUIA_Window_Title, &quot;Hello world!&quot;,

A window must have 1 and only 1 child, usually a group. This one is vertical, that means that its children will be arranged vertically:

                  WindowContents, VGroup,

A group must have at least 1 child, here it's just a text:

                        Child, TextObject,

Zune accepts various escape codes (here, to center the text) and newlines:

                              MUIA_Text_Contents, &quot;\33cHello world!\nHow are you? :)&quot;,

An End macro must match every xxxObject macro (here, TextObject):

                              End,

Let's add a second child to our group, a button! With a keyboard shortcut o indicated by an underscore:

                        Child, but = SimpleButton(&quot;_Ok&quot;),

Finish the group:

                        End,

Finish the window:

                  End,

Finish the application:

            End;

So, who still needs a GUI builder? :-)

====Error handling====

If any of the object in the application tree can't be created, Zune destroys all the objects already created and application creation fails. If not, you have a fully working application:

      if (app != NULL)
      {
            ...

When you're done, just call MUI_DisposeObject() on your application object to destroy all the objects currently in the application, and free all the resources:

            ...
            MUI_DisposeObject(app);
      }

====Notifications====

Notifications are the simplest way to react on events. The principle? We want to be notified when a certain attribute of a certain object is set to a certain value:

      DoMethod(wnd, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Window_CloseRequest, TRUE,

Here we'll listen to the MUIA_Window_CloseRequest of our Window object and be notified whenever this attribute is set to TRUE. So what happens when a notification is triggered? A message is sent to an object, here we tell our Application to return MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit on the next event loop iteration:

            (IPTR)app, 2,
            MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);

As we can specify anything we want here, we have to tell the number of extra parameters we are supplying to MUIM_Notify: here, 2 parameters.

For the button, we listen to its MUIA_Pressed attribute: it's set to FALSE whenever the button is being released (reacting when it's pressed is bad practice, you may want to release the mouse outside of the button to cancel your action - plus we want to see how it looks when it's pressed). The action is the same as the previous, send a message to the application:

      DoMethod(but, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Pressed, FALSE,
            (IPTR)app, 2,
            MUIM_Application_ReturnID, MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit);

====Opening the window====

Windows aren't open until you ask them to:

      set(wnd, MUIA_Window_Open, TRUE);

If all goes well, your window should be displayed at this point. But it can fail! So don't forget to check by querying the attribute, which should be TRUE:

      if (XGET(wnd, MUIA_Window_Open))

====Main loop====

Let me introduce you my lil' friend, the ideal Zune event loop:

      ULONG sigs = 0;

Don't forget to initialize the signals to 0 ... The test of the loop is the MUIM_Application_NewInput method:

      ...
      while((LONG) DoMethod(app, MUIM_Application_NewInput, (IPTR)&amp;sigs)
            != MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)

It takes as input the signals of the events it has to process (result from Wait(), or 0), will modify this value to place the signals Zune is waiting for (for the next Wait()) and will return a value. This return value mechanism was historically the only way to react on events, but it was ugly and has been deprecated in favor of custom classes and object-oriented design.

The body of the loop is quite empty, we only wait for signals and handle Ctrl-C to break out of the loop:

      {
            if (sigs)
            {
                  sigs = Wait(sigs | SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
                  if (sigs &amp; SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
                        break;
            }
      }

====Conclusion====

This program gets you started with Zune, and allows you to toy with GUI design, but not more.

==Notification actions==

Notification allows you to respond to events your application/gui or any other object might cause.  Due to the attribute and method based nature of Zune, and a few special attributes, Most applications can be almost completely automated through the use of Notification(s).

As seen in hello.c, you use MUIM_Notify to cause an object/class to react if a certain condition happens. If you want your application to react in a specific way to events, you can use one of these schemes:

:* Set An attribute.  You can automate the passing of values from gadgets, etc to other gadgets.  Setting values may also trigger other notification events.
      
:* Invoke a method, for example:    

::;MUIM_Application_ReturnID: you can ask your application to return an arbitrary ID on the next loop iteration, and check for the value in the loop. This is the dirty old way of doing things.
      
::;MUIM_CallHook: to call a standard Amiga callback hook: this is an average choice, not object-oriented but not that ugly either.
      
::;custom method: the method belongs to one of your custom class. It is the best solution as it supports object-oriented design in applications. It needs you to create custom classes so it may not be  the easiest for beginners or people in a hurry.

== Why geometry? ==
Geometry is one of the most elegant fields in mathematics. 
It deals with visual shapes that we know from everyday life.

== Who should use this book? ==
This book is intended for use by a parent (or a teacher) and a child.
It is recommended that the parent have some familiarity with geometry, but this is not necessary. The parent can simply read the chapter before teaching the child and then learn it together.

== Book guidelines == 
The classic book about geometry is [[wikisource:The Elements of Euclid|Euclid's ''Elements'']]. This book helped teach geometry for hundreds of years, so we feel that writing this book based on the Elements is a correct step.

We will adapt parts of the book for children and modify the order of some topics in order to make the book clearer.

The learning will be based on constructions and proofs. A construction is a method of creating a geometric object (such as a triangle) using a set of tools. In the case of this book, the tools we will be using are a compass and a ruler. A proof is a logical trail where we can prove one fact by starting with some given information and make a series of conclusions based on that information. Oftentimes it is more difficult to prove a result than to simply find the result.

The constructions are useful for letting the child experience geometric ideas and get visual results.

The proofs are a good way to understand geometry and are a good basis for future study of logic.

Since the book is for children, we omit some of the proof details and use intuition instead of precise definition. On the other hand, we insist on correct and elegant proofs. Precise definitions and exact proofs can be found in regular geometry books and can be used to extend to material to some of the children.

== Notation ==

The notation that is used in the book is defined the first time it is used. However, in order to simplify its use, it is also summarized in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Conventions#Notation|the ''notation'' section of the ''conventions'' chapter]] at the end of the book.

==How to contribute to this book==
This book uses British English as a primary language; however, there is a table provided at the end of this book that summarises all the American terms that readers may come across.

==Before using this book==
Make sure that these resources are available before using this book:
*A protractor
*A compass
*A ruler
*Graph paper
*Single-lined paper

== Introduction ==
[[File:Geom compass ruler.png|thumb|300px|center|This is a picture of a pair of compasses and a ruler.]]

== How to draw a line ==
[[File:Geom draw line.png|thumb|300px|left|Using a ruler (based on [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/post1.html Book I, Postulate 1]), we can draw a segment of a straight line.]]

We will use the notation &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; for the line segment the starts at '''A''' and ends at '''B'''. Note that we don't care about the segment direction and therefore &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;\overline{BA}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Geom line ab.png|thumb|300px|center|Line segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;]]

== How to draw a circle ==
* Using the compass (based on [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/post3.html Book I, Postulate 3]).

We use the notation &lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt; for the circle whose centre is the point '''A''' and its radius length equals that of the segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Geom draw circle sequence.png|300px|center]]

Note that in other sources, such as [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/defI15.html Euclid's Elements], a circle is described by any 3 points on its circumference, '''ABC'''.

The center-radius notation was chosen because of its suitability for constructing circles with a ruler and a compass.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Geom constr eqtr00.svg|thumb|300px|left|Equilateral triangle]]

In this chapter, we will show you how to draw an equilateral triangle.
What does &quot;equilateral&quot; mean? It simply means that all three sides of the triangle are the same length.

Any triangle whose vertices (points) are '''A''', '''B''' and '''C''' is written like this: &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt;.

And if it's equilateral, it will look like the one in the picture.

== The construction ==

# Again using your compass [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a circle?|Draw the circle]] &lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt;, whose center is '''B''' and radius is  &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom constr eqtr03.svg|300px]]
# Can you see how the circles intersect (cross over each other) at two points?&lt;br/&gt;The points are shown in red on the picture below.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom constr eqtr04.svg|300px]]
# Choose one of these points and call it '''C'''.&lt;br/&gt;We chose the upper point, but you can choose the lower point if you like. If you choose the lower point, your triangle will look &quot;upside-down&quot;, but it will still be an equilateral triangle.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom constr eqtr05.svg|300px]]
# [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a line|Draw a line segment]] between '''A''' and '''C''' and get line segment  &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom constr eqtr06.svg|300px]]
# [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a line|Draw a line segment]] between '''B''' and '''C''' and get line segment  &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom constr eqtr07.svg|300px]]
# Construction of &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; is completed.

== Claim ==
The triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; is an  equilateral triangle.

== Proof ==
# The points  '''B''' and '''C''' are both on the circumference of the circle &lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt; and point '''A''' is at the center.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom eqtriangle proof01.svg|300px]]
# So the line segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is the same length as the line segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  Each is a radius of circle &lt;math&gt;\circ A&lt;/math&gt;, or more simply &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}=\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;div style=&quot;margin:1em;&quot;&gt;[[File:Geom eqtr proof05b.svg|300px]]&lt;/div&gt;
# We do the same for the other circle:&lt;br/&gt;The points '''A''' and '''C''' are both on the circumference of the circle &lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt; and point '''B''' is at the center.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom eqtriangle proof06b.svg|300px]]&lt;br/&gt;
# So we can say that &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}=\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;div style=&quot;margin:1em;&quot;&gt;[[File:Geom eqtr proof09b.svg|300px]]&lt;/div&gt;
# We've already shown that &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}=\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}=\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; are both equal in length to &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, they must also be equal in length to each other. This can be shown by substitution. So we can say &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}=\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin:1em;&quot;&gt;[[File:Geom eqtr proof05b.svg|300px]]&lt;/div&gt;
#Therefore, the line segments &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; are all equal. &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}=\overline{AC}=\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom eqtr proof11.svg|300px]]
#We proved that all sides of &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; are equal, so this triangle is an equilateral triangle by definition.

== Problems with the proof ==

The construction above is simple and elegant. One can imagine how children, using their legs as compass, accidentally find it.

However, Euclid’s proof was wrong.

In mathematical logic, we assume some postulates. We construct proofs by advancing step by step. A proof should be made only of postulates and claims that can be deduced from the postulates. Some useful claims are given names and called theorems in order to enable their use in future proofs.

There are some steps in its proof that cannot be deduced from the postulates.
For example, according to the postulates he used, the circles &lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt; do not have to intersect.

Although the proof was wrong, the construction is not necessarily  wrong.
One can make the construction valid, by extending the set of postulates.
Indeed, in later years, different sets of postulates were proposed in order to make the proof valid. Using these sets, the construction that works so well using pencil and paper is also logically sound.

This error of Euclid, the gifted mathematician, should serve as an excellent example of the difficulty in mathematical proof and also the difference between proof and our intuition.

The angle is called the included angle.

== The Side-Angle-Side congruence theorem ==
Given two triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt; such that their sides are equal, hence:
# The side &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline {DE} &lt;/math&gt;.
# The side &lt;math&gt;\overline {CA} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline {DF} &lt;/math&gt;.
# The angle &lt;math&gt;\angle CAB &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\angle FDE &lt;/math&gt; (These are the angles between the sides).

Then the triangles are congruent and their other angles and sides are equal too.  Success!

== Proof ==
We will use the method of superposition – we will move one triangle to the other one and we will show that they coincide.
We won’t use the construction we learnt to copy a line or a segment but we will move the triangle as whole.

# &lt;math&gt;\text{Superpose } \triangle ABC \text{ on } \triangle DEF \text{ such that } A \text { is placed on } D \text { and } \overline {AB} \text{ is placed on } \overline {DE}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\because \overline {AB} = \overline {DE} \text{ (given)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\therefore B \text{ coincides with } E &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\because \angle CAB = \angle FDE \text{ (given)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\therefore \overline {CA} = \overline {FD} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\because \overline {CA} = \overline {DF} \text{ (given)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\therefore C \text{ coincides with } F &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\therefore \overline {CB} = \overline {EF} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\therefore \triangle ABC = \triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\therefore \triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt;

In this chapter, we will show how to copy a triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt;  to other triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE &lt;/math&gt; . 
The construction is an excellent example of the '''reduction''' technique – solving a problem by solution to a previously solved problem.

== The construction ==
# [[../Constructing a triangle|Construct a triangle]] from the sides of &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE &lt;/math&gt;.

== Claim == 
The triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE &lt;/math&gt; are congruent.

== Proof ==
# &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt; are sides of the  triangle  &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; and therefore obey the triangle inequality.
# Therefore one can build a triangle whose sides equal these segments.
# The sides of the triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE &lt;/math&gt; are equal.
# Due to [[../The Side-Side-Side congruence theorem/]] the triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE&lt;/math&gt; congruence.

In the previous chapters, we introduced constructions and proved their validity. Therefore, these constructions should work flawlessly. In this chapter, we will check whether the construction are indeed foolproof.

== Testing a construction ==
# [[../Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a line|Draw a line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; of length 10cm.
# [[../Copying a line segment|Copy the line segment]] to a different point '''T'''.
# Measure the length of the segment you constructed.

== Explanation ==
I must admit that I never could copy the segment accurately. Some times the segment I constructed was of the length 10.5cm, I did even worse. A more talented person might get better results, but probably not exact.

How come the construction didn't work, at least in my case?

Our proof of the construction is correct. However, the construction is done in an ideal world. In this world, the lines and circles drawn are also ideal. They match the mathematical definition perfectly.

The circle I draw doesn't match the mathematical definition.
Actually, many say that they don't match any definition of circle.
When I try to use the construction, I'm using the wrong building blocks.

However, the construction are not useless in our far from ideal world.
If we use approximation of a circle in the construction, we are getting and approximation of the segment copy.
After all, even my copy is not too far from the original.

== Note ==
In the Euclidian geometry developed by the Greek the rule is used only to draw lines.
One cannot measure the length of segments using the rulers as we did in this test.
Therefore our test should be viewed as a criticism of the use of Euclidian geometry in the real world and not as part of that geometry.

In this chapter, we will show how to copy an angle &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC&lt;/math&gt; to other angle &lt;math&gt;\angle CDE&lt;/math&gt;.
The construction is based on [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI23.html Book I, proposition 23].

== The construction ==

# [[../Our_tools:_Ruler_and_compasses# how to draw a line?| Draw a line]] between '''A''' and '''C''' and get &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt;. 
# [[../Copying a triangle|Copy the triangle]] &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE&lt;/math&gt;

== Claim == 
The angles &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\angle CDE&lt;/math&gt; are equal. 

== Proof ==
# The triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDE&lt;/math&gt; congruence.
# Therefore the angles of the triangles equal.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\angle CDE&lt;/math&gt; are equal.

Note that any two points on the rays can be used to create a triangle.

In the previous chapters, we discussed several construction procedures.
In this chapter, we will number some problems for which there is no construction using only ruler and compass.

The problems were introduced by the Greek and since then mathematicians tried to find constructions for them. Only in 1882, it was proven that there is no construction for the problems.  

Note that the problems have no construction when we restrict ourself to constructions using ruler and compass. The problems can be solved when allowing the use of other tools or operations, for example, if we use [[w:Origami|Origami]].

The mathematics involved in proving that the constructions are impossible are too advanced for this book. Therefore, we only name the problems and give reference to the proof of their impossibility at the further reading section.

== Impossible constructions ==

=== Squaring the circle ===
The problem is to find a construction procedure that in a finite number of steps, to make a square with the same area as a given circle.

=== Doubling the cube ===
To &quot;double the cube&quot; means to be given a cube of some side length ''s'' and volume ''V'', and to construct a new cube, larger than the first, with volume 2''V'' and therefore side length &amp;sup3;&amp;radic;2''s''.
=== Trisecting the angle ===
The problem is to find a construction procedure that in a finite number of steps, constructs an angle that is one-third of a given arbitrary angle. 

== Further reading ==
Proving that the constructions are impossible involves mathematics that is not in the scope of this book.

The interested reader can use these links to learn why the constructions are impossible.

The [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/antiquity.shtml Four Problems of Antiquity] have no solution since any solution would involve constructing a number that is not a [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/rational.shtml constructible number].
The numbers that should have been constructed in the problems are defined by these [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/cubic.shtml cubic equations].

It is recommended to read the references in this order:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you prepare to start writing a new program using your text editor (or IDE), remember this:

== Rule 1: Don't write that Program!==

The world is full of bad code, we don't need your bad code! Therefore the first rule is Don't! Look for programs that do, or almost do what you want them to and use / modify them.

Remember what [[wikipedia:Eric S. Raymond|Eric S. Raymond]] wrote in [[wikipedia:The Cathedral and the Bazaar|The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, did I immediately launch into a furious whirl of coding up a brand-new POP3 client to compete with the existing ones? Not on your life! I looked carefully at the POP utilities I had in hand, asking myself ``Which one is closest to what I want?'' Because:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While I don't claim to be a great programmer, I try to imitate one. An important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness. They know that you get an A not for effort but for results, and that it's almost always easier to start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some good sources for finding already-written software include:

# Software directories such as [[wikipedia:Freshmeat|Freshmeat]] or [[wikipedia:Free Software Directory|the Free Software Foundation's Free Software Directory]]
# [[wikipedia:Forge (software)|Open Source Software Development Hubs (&quot;Forges&quot;)]] such as [[wikipedia:SourceForge|SourceForge]].
# Generic [[wikipedia:Web search engine|web search engines]] such as [[wikipedia:Google search|Google search]].
# The package repositories of various [[wikipedia:Linux distribution|Linux distributions]], and other distributions or operating systems.
# Collections of packages for various languages or platforms such as [[wikipedia:Perl|Perl's]] [[wikipedia:CPAN|CPAN]] (the &quot;Comprehensive Perl Archive Network&quot;). 

Normally searching using a good search engine (by trying several keywords) and on Freshmeat would be enough. If you still want to be sure, you can try asking whether anyone can point you to such a program in a relevant channel in a popular [[wikipedia:Internet Relay Chat|Internet Relay Chat (IRC)]] network such as [[wikipedia:Freenode|Freenode]] or differnet kinds of Internet forums.

If you were able to find a program that almost does what you want this way, you may wish to move on to the [[How to Write a Program/Enhancing code|How to Write a Program/Enhancing code]]

== Rule 2: Think about what you want the program to do before you start. ==

Writing the wrong program is the most expensive mistake you can make. So let us consider [[How to Write a Program/Requirements analysis|How to Write a Program/Requirements analysis]]

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Csegura26. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Csegura26~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This in itself is the topic of ''many'' large books and the career of many well paid consultants. Google will guide you into that vast realm.

And doubtless other wiki editors may expand hugely on the topic. But here I will merely state

'''Rule 2 : Analysis Paralysis is the greatest danger your program will ever face.'''

You may have heard that many programming projects fail or are delivered way over time and over budget.

The dead truth is that most programs simply are '''never even started!'''

They freeze up and die in an perpetual analysis phase.

You certainly could do worse than generate the artifacts prescribed by [http://ootips.org/rup.html the Rational Unified Process], but save that for when you really have something huge to do.

Start by writing down, very simply, what you want the program to do.

Don't get fancy now, half a page handwritten absolute maximum. Trust me.

Lets try that now...

''   I want to drive the [http://www.povray.org Povray] ray tracer from ruby.''

Well, scratch that one out. It's a techno goal. As soon as you see specific technologies on your page, scribble them out and try again...

''  I want to draw cool pictures with mathematically precise placement of maybe thousands of objects.''

Ah. That is better. But too fuzzy.

'' Well, actually I was trying to draw a string in povray and I got frustrated with the scene description language and I wished for the power of my favourite language. But my favourite language doesn't do raytracing. I found the modelers like kpovraymodeler drove me nuts and weren't doing what I wanted.''

Oo, nice. This is what the customer was trying do. 

'''Rule 3: When someone, including yourself, tells you to &quot;Write a Program to do...&quot;, make a few loose notes and then ignore him.'''

Always, always, always get up, and go over to their work place and understand first what they are trying to do. I promise you from hundreds of experiences if you just obey them, and create the program they (and/or yourself) told you to, you will write the ''wrong'' program!

Write down a couple of ways in which you want to interact with it. These are called ''use cases'' and Google will give you a million pages on them. I will have finished the program before you have read half the important pages on the topic... :-)

What do the three or four columns represent?

.a'a      attentive               inattentive             avoiding

It appears that .a'a means attentive, and I would guess that with some sort of modifier means inattentive or avoiding?

I see this format a lot in lojban references, but haven't seen an explanation for it.
Thanks!

:Taken from the second external link (I'm not saying that was obvious though): 'Attitudinals have three-way glosses: what they mean on their own, what they mean with cu'i after them, and what they mean with nai after them.' Which I beleive means: Actual Feeling, Indifference of the feeling, Opposite of the Feeling. [[User:Ragzouken|Ragzouken]] 13:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.  Digrammit: ch  sh  qu. Diftongit: au  eu.

=== Ääntämys ===

'''Vokaalit'''  a e i o u  äännetään yleensä kuten suomessa: sama ’sama’ || selektante ’valikoiden’ || kavali ’hevoset’ || koridoro ’käytävä’ || multa ’monta’.&lt;br&gt;
i – äännetään konsonantin jäljessä j-mäisenä: Italia [i.ta.lja].&lt;br&gt;
u – äännetään q:n, g:n ja k:n jäljessä w-mäisenä: quanto [kwan.to] ’määrä’ || linguo [lin.gwo] ’kieli’ || vakua [va.kwa] ’tyhjä’.

'''Diftongit'''  au  eu  äännetään kuten suomessa: autoro ’kirjailija’, Europa. Muut vokaalien yhdistelmät äännetään erillisinä: manuo [ma.nu.o] ’käsi’ || cielo [ci.e.lo] ’taivas’ || antee [an.te.e] ’aiemmin’ || triimo [tri.i.mo] ’kolmannes’.

'''Konsonantit''' h k l m n p r s t v (ja d) äännetään kuten suomessa: masto ’masto’ || helpo ’apu’ || korento ’sähkövirta’ || patro ’isä’ || savar ’tietää’.

Konsonantit b d g f äännetään kuten suomen laina- ja sivistyssanoissa: babilar ’lörpötellä’ || dormigar ’nukuttaa’ || fido ’usko’.&lt;br&gt;
c – äännetään affrikaattana ts: cent [tsent] ’sata’ &lt;br&gt;
ch – äännetään suhu-affrikaattana t&amp;#353;: chefo [t&amp;#353;efo] ’päällikkö’ &lt;br&gt;
sh – äännetään suhu-ässänä &amp;#353;: shako [&amp;#353;ako] ’&amp;#353;akki’&lt;br&gt;
j – äännetään soinnillisena suhu-ässänä &amp;#382; (ei j): jurnalo [&amp;#382;urnalo] ’sanomalehti’. Myös hieman affrikaattamainen ääntämys on mahdollinen: manjar [man(d)&amp;#382;ar] ’syödä’ &lt;br&gt;
y – äännetään kuten suomen j: yaro ’vuosi’ &lt;br&gt;
z – äännetään soinnillisena ässänä (ei ts): zero ’nolla’ &lt;br&gt;
x – äännetään ks: maximo [ma.ksi.mo] ’maksimi’ &lt;br&gt;
w – äännetään bilabiaalisena (ylä- ja alahuuli yhtyvät): watto ’watti’ &lt;br&gt;
qu – äännetään kw: quik ’heti’ (q:n jäljessä voi olla vain u) &lt;br&gt;
ng – äännetään erillisinä n.g, ei kuten suomen äng-äänne: linguo [lin.gwo] ’kieli’ || sango [san.go] ’veri’.

=== Painotus ===

Pääsääntö on, että toiseksi viimeinen tavu on painollinen: incidento [in.tsi.dén.to] ’välikohtaus’ || encefalo [en.tse.fá.lo] ’aivot’ || broshuro [bro.&amp;#353;ú.ro] ’esite’ || aquo [á.kwo] ’vesi’.

Kun toiseksi viimeinen tavu on lyhyt, paino siirtyy lähemmäs sanan alkua. Tällöin toiseksi viimeinen vokaali on yleensä i tai u, joka samalla muuttuu konsonanttimaisemmaksi: pekunio [pe.kú.njo] ’raha’ || revuo [ré.vwo] ’aikakauslehti’.

Infinitiivin tunnus on aina painollinen: lektar [lektár] ’lukea’ || dormar [dormár] ’nukkua’.

== Artikkeli ==

Epämääräistä artikkelia ei ole: tablo ’[[pöytä]]’, stulo ’tuoli’. Määräinen artikkeli on la: la tablo, la stulo ’(puheena oleva) [[pöytä]], tuoli’. Artikkeli voidaan lyhentää vokaalilla alkavan sanan edellä: l’ adreso ’osoite’, l’ idealo ’ihanne’. Myös muutamien prepositioiden yhteydessä on mahdollista tiivistää seuraavasti: da la = da l’ = dal.

Monikollista määräistä artikkelia le voidaan käyttää, jos monikollisuus ei ilmene mistään muusta lauseenjäsenestä: le 3 ’kolmet’, le yes e le no ’kyllä ja ei (vastaukset)’.

== Sanavarat ==

Idon sanavarat perustuvat Euroopan suuriin kieliin: ranskaan, englantiin, saksaan, espanjaan, italiaan ja venäjään. Monessa tapauksessa näiden kielten yhteinen aines koostuu sanoista, jotka ovat lähtöisin latinasta. Myös sivistyssanoista tuttua kreikkalaista sanastoa on mukana. Osa sanastosta periytyy esperantosta.

== Sanaluokat ==

Idon sananmuodosta voi nähdä, mihin sanaluokkaan sana kuuluu. Substantiivi päättyy -o, adjektiivi ja possessiivipronomini -a, adverbi -e, infinitiivi -ar, finiittinen verbi -s, substantiivin ja adjektiivin monikko päättyy -i.

Kansainvälisesti tunnetut maiden ym. nimet (eli substantiivit) säilyttävät tutun muotonsa: Italia, Portugal, Peru, Gabon. Sen sijaan maan nimessä oleva -lando saa substantiivin o-tunnuksen: Finlando.

=== Substantiivi ===

Substantiivin tunnus on sananlopun -o: domo ’talo’, nubo ’pilvi’. Myös adjektiivi voi esiintyä substantiivina, kun tunnuksena on -o: belo ’kaunotar’, sinistro ’vasuri’. Samoin partisiipin voi substantivoida: lektanto ’lukija’, iranto ’se, joka menee’. 

Verbistä voidaan tehdä vastaava substantiivi: savar ’tietää’ –&gt; savo ’tieto’. Deverbaalisessa substantiivissa on mukana edelleen verbisyyttä: danko ’kiitos, kiittäminen’.

=== Adjektiivi ===

Adjektiivin tunnus on sananlopun -a: bona ’hyvä’, granda ’suuri’. Myös partisiipit ovat adjektiivisia: sidanta ’istuva’, lektita ’luettu’. Substantiivistakin saadaan adjektiivi: papera chapelo ’paperinen hattu’, paperihattu’.

Attribuutin voi sijoittaa substantiivin eteen tai jälkeen: nova libri = libri nova ’uudet kirjat’. Jos attribuutteja on useita, ne voidaan sijoittaa niin substantiivin eteen kuin jälkeenkin: bela linguo internaciona ’kaunis kansainvälinen kieli’. Yleensä pitkä (ja attribuutin määritteitä sisältävä) adjektiivi sijoitetaan pääsanan jälkeen. Myös keskenään samanarvoisten attribuuttien luettelo sijoitetaan pääsanan jälkeen: la homi instruktita, senpartisa, e prudenta ’koulutetut, puolueettomat ja järkevät ihmiset’.

Adjektiivin -a voi jäädä valinnaisesti pois: Bon(a) jorno! ’Hyvää päivää!’. Tunnus jätetään pois yleensä silloin, kun seuraava sana alkaa vokaalilla:  kordial amiko ’sydämellinen ystävä’.

=== Adverbi ===

Adverbin tunnus on sananlopun -e: rapide ’nopeasti’, bone ’hyvin’. Tavallisesti adverbi muodostetaan adjektiivista, mutta sen voi muodostaa myös substantiivista: nokto ’yö’ –&gt; nokte ’yöllä’, hemo ’koti’ –&gt; heme ’kotona’.

Adverbi sijoitetaan määritettävän sanan eteen: aparte facile memorebla vorti ’erityisen helposti muistettavat sanat’ (aparte facile + facile memorebla).

=== Vertailuasteet ===

Adjektiivien vertailu muodostetaan sanoilla plu ja maxim sekä min ja minim: &lt;br&gt;
forta ’vahva’, plu forta ’vahvempi’ maxim forta ’vahvin’; saja ’viisas’, min saja ’vähemmän viisas, tyhmempi’, minim saja ’vähiten viisas, tyhmin’.

Myös adverbeilla on vertailuasteet: plu rapide ’nopeammin’, maxim bone ’parhaiten’.

== Monikko ==

Monikon tunnus on -i. Sen voi liittää niin substantiiviin kuin adjektiiviin: libri ’kirjat’, flori ’kukat’, novi ’uudet’, populari ’suositut’. Monikollista substantiivia määrittävä attribuutti on aina yksikkömuotoinen: negra kati ’mustat kissat’. Myös predikatiivilauseen predikaatti on yksikössä:
L’ elekti esas importanta. ’Vaalit ovat tärkeät.’

Suomen kielen plurale tantum -sanat ovat idoksi yksiköllisiä: pantalono ’housut’, cizo ’sakset’. Monikko muodostetaan normaalisti: pantaloni ’monet housut’.

== Verbi ==

=== Finiittinen verbi ===

Finiittisen verbin tunnus on -s jokaisessa persoonassa ja kummassakin luvussa: iras ’menen, menet, menee, menemme, menette, menevät’. Ennen tunnusta oleva -a- merkitsee '''preesensiä'''.

'''Preteritin''' tunnus on -is: kantis ’lauloin, lauloit, (jne.)’. 

'''Futuurin''' tunnus on -os: trovos ’löydän, löydät, (jne.)’ (suomessa preesens ilmaisee myös futuuria). 

'''Konditionaali''' ilmaistaan päätteellä -us: povus ’voisin, voisit, (jne.)’. 

Koska idon verbistä ei ilmene subjektia, täytyy aina käyttää verbin yhteydessä persoonapronominia tai muuta sanaa, josta subjekti ilmenee.

'''Imperatiivin''' pääte on -ez: venez! ’tule!’, irez! ’menkää’. Myös imperatiivi on monipersoonainen, joten myös itseä voi käskeä: me irez! ’menenpä!’. Imperatiivimuotoinen sana (1) täytyy kääntää suomeksi joskus optatiivisena (2) tai konditionaalisena (3): 
Takaze  irez (2) e  dicez (1) a li, ke li  venez (3) direkte a me. 
’Siinä tapauksessa tulkoot (2), ja sano (1) heille, että he tulisivat (3) suoraan minun luokseni.’

=== Passiivi ===

Aktiiviverbistä voidaan muodostaa passiivinen es-suffiksilla (vrt. esas ’olla’).
:vidas –&gt; videsas ’nähdään (nyt)’
:trovos –&gt; trovesos ’löydetään (myöhemmin)’
:lektus –&gt; lektesus ’luettaisiin’ (jne.).

Passiivilauseessa verbin objekti sijaitsee ennen verbiä (subjektin paikalla): Vi trovesos. ’Teidät löydetään.’ (Vrt. La hundo trovos vi. ’Koira löytää teidät.’)

=== Partisiippi ===

Partisiipeilla on sekä aktiivin (-nta) että passiivin (-ta) muodot. Muotoihin sisältyvät myös tempuksen tunnukset (a, i, o).

Aktiivi
:Preesens: flug.a.nta ’lentävä’
:Preteriti: flug.i.nta ’lentänyt’
:Futuuri: flug.o.nta ’lentävä’

Passiivi
:Preesens: skrib.a.ta ’kirjoitettava’
:Preteriti: skrib.i.ta ’kirjoitettu’
:Futuuri: skrib.o.ta ’kirjoitettava’

Partisiipit toimivat kuten adjektiivit määritteinä: hundo dorminta ’nukkuva koira’, lavita vesti ’pestyt vaatteet’, letro skribota ’kirje, joka tullaan kirjoittamaan’.

=== Liittotempukset ===

Esas ’olla’ -verbistä ja partisiipeista voidaan muodostaa eräänlaisia liittotempuksia.

Näillä '''aktiivin''' rakenteilla on selkeät vastineet suomessa:
:me esas vidinta ’olen nähnyt’
:me esis skribinta ’olin lukenut’.

Idon järjestelmä tuottaa loogisia ja ymmärrettäviä yhdistelmiä, vaikka suomennokset ovatkin hieman erikoisia:
:me esos vendinta ’tulen olemaan myynyt’
:me esos flugonta ’olen oleva lentämään tuleva’ (jne.).

Aktiivin liittomuotojen kanssa käytetään subjektia: Me esas lektinta. ’Minä olen lukenut.’ Nämä ovat oikeastaan predikatiivilauseita, kuten Ol esas nova. ’Se on uusi’ (’se = uusi’). 

Partisiipilla voi olla myös täydennyksiä, esim. Me esas lektinta la libro. ’Minä olen kirjan lukenut.’ Normaali is-preteritinen lause Me (tra)lektis la libro vastaa suomessa menneen ajan lauseita ’Minä olen lukenut kirjan’, ’Minä luin kirjan’.

Vaihtoehtoisessa ilmauksessa voidaan käyttää ab-suffiksia:
:me esas vidinta = me vid.ab.as ’olen nähnyt’
:me esis skribinta = me skrib.ab.is ’olin lukenut’
:me esos vendinta = me vend.ab.os ’olen myyvä’ (jne.).

Näillä '''passiivin''' rakenteilla on selkeät vastineet suomessa:
:me esas amata ’olen rakastettu’
:me esas trovita ’olen löydetty’, ’minut on löydetty’
:me esis vidita ’olin nähty’, ’minut oli nähty’.

Idon järjestelmä tuottaa loogisia ja ymmärrettäviä mutta käytännössä ehkä harvinaisia yhdistelmiä:
:me esas vidata ’olen nähtävä’
:me esos trovita ’olen oleva löydetty’
:me esis vidota ’olin nähdyksi tuleva’
:me esus lektita ’olisin luetuksi tullut’ (jne.).

Passiivin liittomuotojen kanssa lauseen toimija tai tekijä ilmaistaan agenttirakenteella, jossa käytetään da-prepositiota: Ni esis salvata da nia hundo. Suomen kieli vaatii näissä rakenteissa aktiivilauseen ja subjektin: ’Koiramme pelasti (on pelastanut) meidät.’ (Vrt. ni esis salvata ’meidät on pelastettu’.)

Myös passiivin yhteydessä voidaan käyttää vaihtoehtoisesti ab-suffiksia:
:me esabis amata ’minä olen ollut rakastettu’
:me esabus amata ’minä olisin ollut rakastettu’
:ol esabis facita = ol fac.es.ab.is ’se oli tehty’.

== Pronomini ==

=== Persoonapronominit ===

Yksikkö
:me ’minä’
:tu ’sinä’ (käytetään vain läheisten kesken)
:vu ’Te’ (yksiköllinen; käytetään tuttavallisessakin puheessa)
:lu ’hän, se’ || il, ilu ’hän’ (miehestä) || el, elu ’hän (naisesta) || ol, olu ’se’

Monikko
:ni ’me’
:vi ’Te; te’ (monikko sanasta vu)
:ili ’he’ (monikko sanasta ilu) || eli ’he’ (monikko sanasta elu) || oli ’ne’ (monikko sanasta olu) || li ’he, ne’ (monikko sanasta lu eli sanoista ilu, elu, olu)

Lisäksi käytetään pronomineja
:on, onu (yleispersoona). Esimerkki yleispersoonainen on-sanasta: On dicez to quon on volas. ’Sanottakoon, mitä halutaan.’, ’Kukin sanokoon, mitä (kukin) haluaa.’
:su (refleksiivinen, joka viittaa 3. persoonaan).

Koska suomessa on vain yksi ''hän''-sana, täytyy il ja el joskus osoittaa tarkemmin:
Il manjis pomi ed el drinkis lakto. ’Poika (= hän) söi omenaa ja tyttö (= hän) joi maitoa.’

Kun joukkoa ihmisiä puhutellaan sanalla vu, kaikkia teititellään. Joukossa voi olla henkilöitä, joiden kanssa voisi sinutella, mutta tällaisessa yhteydessä teitittelystä ei ole mitään haittaa.

Refleksiivisessä ilmauksessa osoitetaan, että toiminto kohdistuu itseen. Tällöin objekti on sama kuin subjekti:
:Me lavis me. ’Peseydyin’ (”Minä pesin minut.”)
:Vu lavas vu. ’Te peseydytte.’
:Vu ruinos vu. ’Te tuhoatte itsenne.’
3. persoonassa käytetään sanaa su: El lavas su. ’Hän peseytyy.’ Li lavus su. ’He peseytyisivät.’

=== Possessiivipronominit ===

Possessiivipronominin merkkinä on -a:
:mea ’minun’
:tua ’sinun’
:vua ’Teidän’
:lua ’hänen; sen’ || ilua ’hänen’ (miehestä) || elua ’hänen’ (naisesta) || olua ’sen’
:nia ’meidän’
:via ’Teidän’
:lia ’heidän’
:onua (yleispersoonan)
:sua ’hänen / sen / heidän / niiden oma’.

Esimerkkejä: &lt;br&gt;
Ilu havas elua biciklo. ’Hänellä (= pojalla) on tytön polkupyörä’.&lt;br&gt;
Ol esas certe mea. ’Se on varmasti minun.’ &lt;br&gt;
Nia kato e vua hundo esas en mea domo. ’Meidän kissamme ja Teidän koiranne ovat minun talossani.’ &lt;br&gt;
El manjis sua pomi. ’Hän söi omia omeniaan.’ &lt;br&gt;

Suomessa usein riittää pelkkä possessiivisuffiksi:&lt;br&gt;
Mea filio trovis vua klefo. ’(Minun) poikani löysi (Teidän) avaimenne.’

=== Muita pronomineja ===

Demonstratiivipronomineja
:ca, ica ’tämä’; ci, ici ’nämä’ (– substantiivisena co, ico).
:ta, ita ’tuo, se’; ti, iti ’nuo, ne’ (– substantiivisena to, ito). 

Persoona- ja demonstratiivipronominin voi yhdistää: ilca ’se mies’, elca ’se nainen’, olca ’se (siinä)’.

Relatiivi- ja interrogatiivipronomini
:qua ’kuka, mikä, joka’; qui ’ketkä, mitkä, jotka’ (– substantiivisena quo).

Esimerkkejä: &lt;br&gt;
ilta qua volas ’se mies, joka haluaa’. &lt;br&gt;
la homi qui venis ’ihmiset, jotka tulivat’. &lt;br&gt;
la kati quin me vidis ’ne kissat, jotka näin’.

Indefiniittipronomineja
:ula ’joku’; uli ’jotkut’ (– substantiivisena ulu)
:nula ’ei kukaan, mikään’; nuli (– nulu)
:irga ’jokin’; irgi (– irgu)
:altra ’muu’; altri (– altru)
:kelka ’jonkin verran’; kelki (– kelku)
:singla ’yksittäinen’; singli (– singlu)
:omna ’kaikki’; omni (– omnu)
:multa ’paljon’; multi (– multo)
:poka ’vähän’; poki (– poko)
:plura ’moni’; pluri.
:ipsa ’itse’.

Esimerkkejä: &lt;br&gt;
Il parolis a singlu. ’Hän puhui yhdelle.’&lt;br&gt;
Omna homo (= homi) esas mortiva. ’Kaikki ihmiset ovat kuolevaisia.’, ’Jokainen ihminen on kuolevainen.’&lt;br&gt;
Mea kuzino ipsa respondis. ’Serkkutyttöni vastasi itse.’&lt;br&gt;
Ta afero produktis multo. ’Se juttu tuotti paljon (= monia).’&lt;br&gt;

Indefiniittipronomineista voidaan muodostaa myös adverbeja, esim. &lt;br&gt;
ipse ’itsekseen’, omne ’kaikin’, single ’kukin’, poke ’vähän, harvoin’.

== Numerot ==

Idon lukusanat 1–10 ovat un, du, tri, quar, kin, sis, sep, ok, non, dek. Tavallisimmat tasaluvut ovat cent ’sata’, mil ’tuhat’, miliono ’miljoona’.

Yhdyssanaiset lukusanat muodostetaan siten, että '''e(d)''' merkitsee ’ja’ sekä '''a''' merkitsee kerrannaista:
:dek-e-tri ’13’
:kin-a-dek-e-sis ’56’
:mil e non-a-cent e sis-a-dek-e-du ’1962’
:triacent e quaradek e kinamil e sisacent e sepadek ed ok ’345 678’.

Muita lukuihin liittyviä ilmauksia:
:10 - 7 = 3 : dek minus sep esas tri.
:4 + 5 = 9 : quar plus kin esas non.
:2 · 4 = 8 : duople quar esas ok.
:2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; : du potenco tria.
:3/2 : radiko tria di du.

== Sananmuodostus ==

Idon sanoja voidaan muodostaa käyttämällä johtimia ja prefiksejä:

:persist.em.es.o ’toimeliaisuus, sinnikkyys’&lt;br&gt;1. ’pysyä, kestää’, 2. halukkuus, innokkuus, 3. olotila, 4. substantiivi.

:bir.if.eri.o ’olutpanimo’ &lt;br&gt;1. ’olut’, 2. tuottaa jotakin, 3. paikka jossa tehdään jotakin, 4. substantiivi.

:ri.san.esk.int.e ’tullen uudestaan terveeksi’&lt;br&gt;1. ’uudelleen’, 2. ’terve’, 3. alkaminen, 4. partisiippi, 5. adverbiaali.

Lisäksi sanoja muodostetaan yhdistämällä jo valmiita sanoja.

ex – entinen: ex.oficiro ’entinen upseeri’. &lt;br&gt;
ge – aviosukulaiset: ge.avi ’isovanhemmat’. &lt;br&gt;
mi – puoli: mi.horo ’puolituntinen’, mi.cirklo ’kaari, puoliympyrä’. &lt;br&gt;
mis – väärin: mis.komprenar ’ymmärtää väärin’, mis.uzo ’väärinkäyttö’. &lt;br&gt;
ne – kielto (ei vastakohta!): ne.posibla ’mahdoton’, ne.afabla ’epäystävällinen’, ne.richa ’ei rikas’. &lt;br&gt;
par – kokonaan, läpeensä: par.lektar ’lukea kokonaan’, par.kurar ’juosta päästä päähän’. &lt;br&gt;
para – jotakin vastaan: para.pluvo ’sateenvarjo’, para.vento ’tuulilasi’. &lt;br&gt;
pre – aiempi, edellinen: pre.nomo ’etunimi’, pre.dicar ’ennustaa’. &lt;br&gt;
pseudo – väärä, ei-oikea: pseudo.amiko ’valheellinen ystävä’, pseudo.nimo ’salanimi’. &lt;br&gt;
retro – takaisin: retro.irar ’mennä takaisin’, retro.venar ’palata’. &lt;br&gt;
ri – toisto: ri.facar ’tehdä uudestaan’, ri.freshigar ’virkistää’. &lt;br&gt;
sen – ilman, vailla: sen.denta ’hampaaton’, sen.senca ’merkityksetön’. &lt;br&gt;
stif – puolisukulaisuus: stif.matro ’äitipuoli’. &lt;br&gt;
vice – varallaolo, sijaisuus: vice.prezidanto ’varapresidentti’. &lt;br&gt;

Myös prepositioita voidaan käyttää prefikseinä, esim. kontre ’vastaan’: kontre.febra ’kuumeenvastainen’.

=== Yhdyssanat ===
Yhdyssanojen muodostaminen on idossa helppoa. Sanaluokkaa osoittavan loppuvokaalin voi jättää pois yhdyssanan alkuosasta:
:vapornavo ’höyrylaiva’
:kristalklara ’kristallinkirkas’
:amoletro ’rakkauskirje’.

Yhdyssanoja muodostettaessa täytyy ottaa huomioon mahdollisesti syntyvät konsonanttirykelmät:&lt;br&gt; mieluummin letrobuxo ’postilaatikko’ kuin letrbuxo.

Selkeyden vuoksi on aina mahdollista käyttää yhdyssanan osien välissä yhdysviivaa: vid-punto ’näkökohta’, skrib-tablo ’kirjoituspöytä’. Myös sanaluokkaa osoittavan loppuvokaalin voi pitää mukana: mar-salo = maro-salo ’merisuola’.

Yhdyssanailmauksen tilalla voi käyttää myös analyyttista rakennetta: marala salo, salo di maro ’merisuola’, letro di amo ’rakkauskirje’.

Tyypissä, jossa määrite kertoo, mikä kantasanan ilmoittama kohde on, voidaan vastaavassa sanaliitossa käyttää johtamatonta a-adjektiivia määritteenä: respondo-letro (letro = respondo) = responda letro ’vastauskirje’ Vrt. skribo-tablo (tablo ≠ skribo).

== Käänteinen sanajärjestys ==

Normaali sanajärjestys on SVO. Verbin suoraa komplementtia (objektia) ei siis merkitä, koska sen sijainti verbin jäljessä kertoo funktion:
:Me vidas muso. ’Minä näen hiiren.’
:Me havas libro. ’Minulla on kirja.’

Kysymyslauseissa on käytettävä järjestystä OSV. Tällöin suora komplementti merkitään päätteellä -n:
:Quon vu vidas? ’Minkä Te näette?’
:Quanta homin l’ alkoholismo domajas? ’Kuinka monta ihmistä alkoholismi pilaa?’

Jos kirjoittaja tahtoo esim. temaattisista syistä, verbin määritteen voi sijoittaa ennen predikaattia (verbiä):
:Muson me vidas. ’Hiiren minä näen.’
:Katin me prizas. ’Kissoista minä pidän.’

== Konjunktiot ==

Tavallisimmat konjunktiot ovat seuraavat:
:e (myös: ed)  ’ja, sekä’ || o (myös: od)  ’tai, vai’ || ma  ’mutta’ || ke  ’että’ || se  ’jos’ || nam  ’sillä’ || e(d) … e(d)  ’sekä … että’ || o(d) … o(d)  ’joko … tai’ || sive … sive  ’joko … tai’ || nek … nek  ’ei … eikä’.

== Applicability ==

This module is primary of interest for people building their own electronics with an RS-232 interface. 
Off-the-shelf computers with RS-232 interfaces already contain the necessary electronics, and there is no need to add the circuitry as described here.

== Introduction ==

=== Logic Signal Voltage ===
Serial RS-232 (V.24) communication works with voltages (between -15V ... -3V are used to transmit a binary '1' and +3V ... +15V to transmit a binary '0') which are not compatible with today's computer logic voltages. On the other hand, classic TTL computer logic operates between 0V ... +5V (roughly 0V ... +0.8V referred to as ''low'' for binary '0', +2V ... +5V for ''high'' binary '1' ). Modern low-power logic operates in the range of 0V ... +3.3V or even lower.

So, the maximum RS-232 signal levels are far too high for today's computer logic electronics, and the negative RS-232 voltage can't be grokked at all by the computer logic. Therefore, to receive serial data from an RS-232 interface the voltage has to be reduced, and the ''0'' and ''1'' voltage levels inverted. In the other direction (sending data from some logic over RS-232) the low logic voltage has to be &quot;bumped up&quot;, and a negative voltage has to be generated, too.

      RS-232              TTL             Logic
 -----------------------------------------------
  -15V ...  -3V  &lt;-&gt;  +2V ... +5V    &lt;-&gt;  1   (idle state)
   +3V ... +15V  &lt;-&gt;   0V ... +0.8V  &lt;-&gt;  0   (start bit)

All this can be done with conventional analog electronics, e.g. a particular power supply and a couple of [[wikipedia:transistor|transistors]] or the once popular 1488 (transmitter) and 1489 (receiver) ICs. However, since more than a decade it has become standard in amateur electronics to do the necessary signal level conversion with an integrated circuit (IC) from the MAX232 family (typically a MAX232A or some clone). In fact, it is hard to find some RS-232 circuitry in amateur electronics without a MAX232A or some clone.

We discuss the [[Serial_Programming/RS-232_Connections#Signal_Bits | signal bits] in more detail later in this book.

=== The MAX232 &amp; MAX232A ===
[[Image:Max232_in_hand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A MAX232 integrated circuit]]
The MAX232 from [http://www.maxim-ic.com/ Maxim] was the first IC which in one package contains the necessary drivers (two) and receivers (also two), to adapt the RS-232 signal voltage levels to TTL logic. It became popular, because it just needs one voltage (+5V) and generates the necessary RS-232 voltage levels (approx. -10V and +10V) internally. This greatly simplified the design of circuitry. Circuitry designers no longer need to design and build a power supply with three voltages (e.g. -12V, +5V, and +12V), but could just provide one +5V power supply, e.g. with the help of a simple 78x05 voltage regulator.

The MAX232 has a successor, the MAX232'''A'''. The ICs are almost identical, however, the MAX232A is much more often used (and easier to get) than the original MAX232, and the MAX232A only needs external capacitors 1/10th the capacity of what the original MAX232 needs.

It should be noted that the MAX232(A) is just a driver/receiver. It does not generate the necessary RS-232 sequence of marks and spaces with the right timing, it does not decode the RS-232 signal, it does not provide a serial/parallel conversion. '''All it does is to convert signal voltage levels'''. Generating serial data with the right timing and decoding serial data has to be done by additional circuitry, e.g. by a [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming|16550 UART]] or one of these small micro controllers (e.g.
[[Atmel AVR]],
[[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller|Microchip PIC]]) getting more and more popular.

The MAX232 and MAX232A were once rather expensive ICs, but today they are cheap. It has also helped that many companies now produce clones  (ie. [http://www.sipex.com/products/interface.htm Sipex]). These clones sometimes need different external circuitry, e.g. the capacities of the external capacitors vary. It is recommended to check the data sheet of the particular manufacturer of an IC instead of relying on Maxim's original data sheet.

The original manufacturer (and now some clone manufacturers, too) offers a large series of similar ICs, with different numbers of receivers and drivers, voltages, built-in or external capacitors, etc. E.g. The MAX232 and MAX232A need external capacitors for the internal voltage pump, while the MAX233 has these capacitors built-in. The MAX233 is also between three and ten times more expensive in electronic shops than the MAX232A because of its internal capacitors. It is also more difficult to get the MAX233 than the garden variety MAX232A.

A similar IC, the MAX3232 is nowadays available for low-power 3V logic.

V+(2) is also connected to V&lt;small&gt;CC&lt;/small&gt; via a capacitor (C3). V-(6) is connected to GND via a capacitor (C4). And GND(15) and V&lt;small&gt;CC&lt;/small&gt;(16) are also connected by a capacitor (C5), as close as possible to the pins.

== A Typical Application ==
[[File:RS-232 to TTL converters using MAX232.jpg|thumb|250px|right|RS-232 to TTL converters, using MAX232]]

The MAX232(A) has two receivers (converts from RS-232 to TTL voltage levels) and two drivers (converts from TTL logic to RS-232 voltage levels). This means only two of the RS-232 signals can be converted in each direction. The old MC1488/1489 combo provided four drivers and receivers.

Typically a pair of a driver/receiver of the MAX232 is used for

* TX and RX

and the second one for

* CTS and RTS.

There are not enough drivers/receivers in the MAX232 to also connect the DTR, DSR, and DCD signals. Usually these signals can be omitted when e.g. communicating with a PC's serial interface. If the DTE really requires these signals either a second MAX232 is needed, or some other IC from the MAX232 family can be used (if it can be found in consumer electronic shops at all). An alternative for DTR/DSR is also given below.

[http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX220-MAX249.pdf Maxim's data sheet] explains the MAX232 family in great detail, including the pin configuration and how to connect such an IC to external circuitry. This information can be used as-is in own design to get a working RS-232 interface. Maxim's data just misses one critical piece of information: How exactly to connect the RS-232 signals to the IC. So here is one possible example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|+'''MAX232 to RS232 DB9 Connection as a DCE'''
|'''MAX232 Pin Nbr.'''||'''MAX232 Pin Name'''||'''Signal'''||'''Voltage'''||'''DB9 Pin'''
|-
|  7 || T2&lt;small&gt;out&lt;/small&gt; || RTS || RS-232 || 8
|-

|-
|  9 || R2&lt;small&gt;out&lt;/small&gt; || CTS || TTL    || n/a
|-

|-

|-
| 13 || R1&lt;small&gt;in&lt;/small&gt;  || TX  || RS-232 || 3
|-
| 14 || T1&lt;small&gt;out&lt;/small&gt; || RX  || RS-232 || 2
|-
| 15 || GND                  || GND || 0      || 5
|}


In addition one can directly wire DTR (DB9 pin 4) to DSR (DB9 pin 6) without going through any circuitry. This gives automatic (brain dead) DSR acknowledgment of an incoming DTR signal.

Sometimes pin 6 of the MAX232 is hard wired to DCD (DB9 pin 1). This is not recommended. Pin 6 is the raw output of the voltage pump and inverter for the -10V voltage. Drawing currents from the pin leads to a rapid breakdown of the voltage, and as a consequence to a breakdown of the output voltage of the two RS-232 drivers. It is better to use software which doesn't care about DCD, but does  hardware-handshaking via CTS/RTS only.

The circuitry is completed by connecting five capacitors to the IC as it follows. The MAX232 needs 1.0µF capacitors, the MAX232A needs 0.1µF capacitors. MAX232 clones show similar differences. It is recommended to consult the corresponding data sheet. At least 16V capacitor types should be used. If electrolytic or tantalic capacitors are used, the polarity has to be observed. The first pin as listed in the following table is always where the plus pole of the capacitor should be connected to.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;

The 5V power supply is connected to

== Alternatives ==

=== Data Cables ===

With the rise of mobile phones so called ''data cables'' for these phones have also become popular. These are cables to connect the mobile phone to a serial interface of a computer{{Ref|ref-1}}. The interesting thing is that modern mobile phones work with 3.3V logic, and older phones with 5V logic on their data buses. So these data cables must and do convert the phone logic voltage levels to and from RS232 voltage levels.

No-name data cables have become rather cheap (as opposite to original phone-brand data cables). The cheap cables with their voltage converters can be used as an alternative to home-made MAX232-based circuitry. The advantage is that the cables occupy much less space (the converter is usually inside the RS232 plug). Such a cable also saves the effort to solder a circuitry board. Another advantage, which can also be a disadvantage of such a data cable is that they usually take their power from the RS232 connector. This saves an external power supply, but can also cause problems, because the RS232 interface is not designed to power some logic and the DTE might not provide enough power{{Ref|ref-2}}. Another disadvantage is that many of these cables just support RX and TX (one receiver, one driver), and not two drivers/receivers as the MAX232. So there is no hardware handshake possible. Finally, when using such a cable it should be made sure that they convert to the desired voltage (3.3V or 5V).
----
# {{Note|ref-1}} There are also data cables for [[Serial_Programming:Universal_Serial_Bus|USB]] ports, but these are of no interest here.
# {{Note|ref-2}} Some data cables are powered by the phone and not via the RS232 interface. In such a case an external power supply is still needed, to replace the one from the phone.


=== (Ab)using a USB &lt;-&gt; RS-232 Converter ===

USB to Serial interface cables often have two components: a USB transciever that outputs serial data; and a voltage shifter to produce standards-compliant RS-232 voltages. It is often possible to throw away (ignore, desolder, cut-out) the USB part of these cables, connect an external 5V power source (or abuse the RS-232 interface) to replace the power coming from the USB bus and to just use the RS-232 level-shifter. All this is probably as much work as using a MAX232A, although you get one RS-232 connector for free.

&lt;!-- 
     This module is about building an RS-232 with the MAX 232,
     and not about building a USB interface. 
     USB hardware hacks should perhaps better go to some own page.
--&gt;
If you consider a USB cable, it is also worthwhile to consider using USB directly, instead of RS-232. Many USB transceiver chips can be integrated directly into circuits, eliminating the need for voltage-shifting components. Parts such as the [http://www.ftdichip.com/ FTDI] FT232BM even have an input allowing designers to select 5V or 3.3V output levels. Most of these USB transceiver chips are available as surface-mount components only. But some vendors offer DIP-sized preassembled modules, often at competitive prices, and often with free or cheap drivers or driver development environments.

See [[Serial Programming:Universal Serial Bus]] for more on USB hardware, interfacing with USB devices and programming USB devices.

=== MAX232N ===

A [http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/max232.html Texas Instruments MAX232 (not A)] second-source. The '''N''' indicates the package (plastic dip), and not any special electric characteristics. This is a non-A MAX232, therefore it needs at least 1µF capacitors. It can sometimes be found rather cheap. TI also offers MAX3232s and a number of other RS-232 drivers/receivers, like MC148x.

=== Linear Technology LT1181A ===

[http://www.linear.com/pc/productDetail.jsp?navId=H0,C1,C1007,C1016,P1322 The LT1181A from Linear Technology] is very similar to the MAX232A. It has the exact same pin-layout, also uses 0.1µF capacitors, and can in general replace a MAX232A. However, for the hobbyist it is typically a little bit more difficult to get one, and they tend to be slightly more expensive than the original Maxim MAX232A.

=== Intersil HIN202 ===
[http://www.intersil.com/products/deviceinfo.asp?pn=HIN202 The Intersil HIN202] is yet another IC very similar to the MAX232A. It also has the same pin-layout (DIL package), uses 0.1 µF capacitors and can replace a MAX232A. The HIN202 is especially interesting when more I/O lines are needed (four pairs), since the manufacturer specifies that two HIN202's can share a single V+ and a single V- capacitor. So the resulting circuit saves two capacitors.

=== MC1488 and MC1489 ===

The MC1488/MC1489 ICs have already been mentioned. However, they are no real alternative to a MAX232 these days. A combo of these ICs has twice as many drivers/receivers, but the MC1488 driver requires a +12V, -12V power supply, and the MC1489 receiver a +5V power supply. That makes three power supplies instead of one for the MAX232. Unless the required ±12V supply lines are already available in a circuit, it is recommended to use either two MAX232s, or a single MAX238.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Crusaderx. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Crusaderx~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

A '''point''' is a dot that is so small that its height and width are actually zero!  This may seem too small.  So small that no such thing could ever really exist.  But it does fit with our intuition about the world.  Even though everything in the physical world around us of things larger than atoms, it is still very useful to talk about the centers of these atoms, or electrons.  A point can be thought of as the limit of dots whose size is decreasing.

{| style=&quot;width:100%; border-spacing:1em;&quot;
 |+ You might be surprised to know, but these are not points:
 |-
 | [[File:Disc Plain black.svg|32px|center]]
 | The reason that this shape is not a point is that it is too large, it has area. This is a 'ball'.
 |-
 | [[File:Disc Plain black.svg|16px|center]]
 | Even when taking a ball of half that size we don't get a point.
 |-
 | [[File:Disc Plain black.svg|8px|center]]
 | And that is too large as well...
 |}

A point is so small that even if we divide the size of these dots by 100, 1,000 or 1,000,000 it would still be much larger than a point. A point is considered to be ''infinitely small''. In order to get to the size of a point we should keep dividing the ball size by two &amp;ndash; forever. Don't try it at home.

A point has no length, width, or depth.  In fact, a point has no size at all.  A point seems to be too small to be useful. Luckily, as we will see when discussing [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Lines|lines]] we have plenty of them.  It may be best to think of a point as a location, as in a location where two lines cross.

Why define a point as an infinitely small dot? For one thing it has a very precise location, not just the center of a rough dot, but the point itself. Another reason is that if the drawing is made much bigger or smaller the point stays the same size. A point which is an infinitely small dot would be too small to see, so we must use a big old visible normal dot, or where two lines cross to represent it and its approximate location on paper.

When we name a point, we always use an uppercase letter.  Often we will use &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; for &quot;point&quot; if we can, and if have more than one dot, we will work our way through the alphabet and use &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. However, nowadays many people will start with any letter they like, although the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; still remains the best way.

If some points are on the same line, we call them 'colinear'. If they are on the same plane, they are 'coplanar'. Two points are always colinear. But a point can be collinear with several points.Two to three points are always coplanar. Of course this is tautological since the definition of a 'line' is 'two connected points', and the definition of a 'plane' is 'the surface specified by three points'.

==Lines==
A line is as wide as a point, infinitely thin, having an infinite number of points, (in a straight row), extending forever in both the directions. Remember that this is impossible to be constructed in real life, so usually we would simply draw a line (with thickness!) with an arrow on both ends.
Any two lines can intersect at only a single point. Lines that are on the same plane are 'coplanar'.

[[File:Geom lines lines 01.png|300px|center]]
[[File:Geom lines lines 02.png|300px|center]]

==Line segments==
A line segment, or segment, is a part of a line, which has two endpoints.  The endpoints give the line segment a fixed, or finite length.

[[File:Geom lines seg 01.png|300px|center]]
[[File:Geom lines seg 02.png|300px|center]]

Line segments AB, and CD, can be written as &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Geom lines seg 04.png|300px|center]]
[[File:Geom lines seg 05.png|300px|center]]
[[File:Geom lines seg 06.png|300px|center]]

==Rays==
A ray is a line segment that has only one endpoint.  A ray is infinite in one direction. That means that it goes on forever in one direction. As they are impossible to construct in real life, usually we will just draw a line with an arrowhead on one end. They can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{A B}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Geom lines ray 02.png|300px|center]]

==Intersecting lines==
Two lines '''intersect''' when they cross each other. They form vertically opposite angles, which we will learn later. The point where the lines intersect is called the point of intersection. If the angles produced are all right angles, the lines are called perpendicular lines. If two lines never intersect, they are called parallel lines. Parallel lines will be discussed in detail later.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean Cuisine]] 

==Ingredients==
*1 lb (450 g) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] (whatever part, suitable for grilling), thin sliced
*3 [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]], sliced in a bias
*4 button [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced (optional)
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], thinly sliced (optional)
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*4 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
*4 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1-2 tbsp minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 tbsp Mirin sauce (optional)

==Procedure==
#Slice the beef as thin as possible.
#Combine all the ingredients in a big bowl.
#Marinate beef and vegetables for at least 30 minutes.  Marinating overnight will get the best flavor and tenderization.
#Grill the beef.
#Serve with rice.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Use same amount of soy sauce and sugar.
*If you do this a day ahead, reduce the amount of soy sauce and don't forget to put it in a refrigerator.
*Use thinly-sliced beef, available specifically for Bulgogi in some grocery stores, for best results.
*You can grill this on a table top, with a shallow pan. You can also use just a normal fry pan.
*Grill with medium high heat and have the juice of beef and vegetables on rice.
*You may marinate the beef in cola (Coca-Cola works best) instead of using just sugar.  The extra liquid helps the meat to absorb the marinade more quickly. you can also use Mirin sauce instead of sugar.
*You can also put one finely chopped or grated Korean pear, aka Asian pear, aka Pear Apple into your marinade overnight in lieu of sugar or cola. This will help tenderize the meat.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean Cuisine]]
__NOTOC__
'''Kimchi''' (김치), also spelled '''kimchee''' or '''gimchi''', is a Korean dish of pickled [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], usually [[Cookbook:cabbage|napa cabbage]] Korean radish, and commonly served as a [[Cookbook:Side dishes|side dish]]. It is usually fermented in a brine of [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]] sauce, [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]] and [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli pepper]]. There are infinite varieties, at least as many as there are households. The following is a standard recipe for ''baechoo kimchi'' (napa-cabbage kimchi), a common type that is probably what most non-Koreans think of as kimchi.

==Ingredients==
*1 head [[Cookbook:Cabbage|napa cabbage]] (baechu, Chinese cabbage, wombok)
*½ [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], thin sliced
*¼ [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], thin julienne
*¼ Korean [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]] (muwoo), thin julienne
*4 [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]] (spring onions), cut into 3-cm pieces
*2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 tsp minced [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Gochugaru|go choo ga roo]] (Korean chili powder)
*2 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*½ cup sea salt (or any coarse salt)
*1 cup water
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|jeot gal]] (Korean fish sauce)

==Procedure==
#Quarter the napa cabbage, wash and drain.
#Mix ½ cup sea salt (or any coarse salt) and 1 cup water.
#Put cabbages in a salted water and take out one at a time to get salt down.
#In a container, add cabbages and pour salted water, set aside for at least 6–8 hours (overnight will be great).
#The cabbage should be soft enough to bend.
#Wash, drain well.
#Mix together ½ cup go choo ga roo (Korean chili powder), 2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar, ¼ cup jeot gal (Korean fish sauce), 2 tbsp minced garlic, and 1 tsp minced ginger.
#Mix in vegetables to the chilli powder mixture.
#Take one cabbage, stuff in above mixture to every layer. Try to fold in half. (must)
#With 2 outer leaves, wrap the whole thing securely.
#Put it in a airtight container.
#Let it sit on a kitchen counter for overnight.
#Put in a refrigerator for 2–3 days. (optional)
#Serve with rice. (optional)
NOTE: after a few days, you will notice some liquid. this is totally normal. it is a sign that the kimchi is more ripe now.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Korean radishes are large, about ½ to 1 kilogram. Japanese (daikon) radishes or a larger quantity of small European radishes could substitute.
*The brine can be varied to include many other ingredients.  Be creative.
*¼ cup jeot gal (Korean fish sauce) can be replaced with moderate amounts of salted shrimp, raw butterfish, or raw oysters.  Seafood can also be left out entirely although appropriate amount of salt needs to be added in place of missing jeot gal.  Alternative flavors can include Asian pears or tangerines.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called CRISTIAN GARCIA INFORMATICA. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name CRISTIAN GARCIA INFORMATICA~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

== metric values in recipes ==

please do not remove metric values in recipes.  Not everyone uses imperial measurments, so the metric measurments make the recipes more usefull to others.  Thanks. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:32, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

This is somewhat old but I am quite infuriated by your actions. You removed the metric measurement from the Pavlova recipe. As discussed in the Pavlova recipe, it is primarily a New Zealand and Australian recipe and Kiwis and Australians predominantly use metric. In this case, the fact that the original contributor used metric and you completely removed the metric makes it even worse. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 12:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

For your information, metric is the common and universally accepted name. You can say what you want, but it doesn't change the fact. It would just as similarly be silly to argue that you should't call CDs CDs because DVD, floppy discs, and other discs are also compact discs...

Also you can call them French units if your want, but they're the units used by the rest of the world, other then a few oddball countries such as the US and UK which still cling to the outdated notion of the British empire (and the imperial units). Sorry but the British empire is dead and the real world has moved on. Even the smarter ones in the UK and US use metric (I guess you like to think scientists aren't smart but of course without them you won't have computers, or cars, or the millions of other things you take for granted).

I'm please however that you've seen the error of your ways. Your welcome to add additional units. Although please remember that additional units should be that, additional units. If the original units were metric, these should remain the primary units unless there is a clear policy otherwise (which there isn't). [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 19:02, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

==Ingredients==
* a large handful of fresh [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* 8-12 cloves of garlic (depending on your preference/size of meal)
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 100-200g feta cheese
* 200g pitted kalamata olives
* a small package of snap peas
* 1-2 breasts [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (can substitute salmon or steak)
* approximately 500g linguine
* Pesto

==Procedure==
#Lightly sauté the garlic in a pan - this is not meant to completely cook it, but to take a little of the bite off of it. Chop the garlic up a bit in a food processor, then add the spinach bit by bit (stems may be left on if you like). When you have completed mixing the garlic and spinach together, add the olive oil and mix. Put into a bowl and set aside.
#Strip the snap peas of the stringy bits and the hard ends and place those aside in a bowl as well.
#Start the water on the stove at a medium temperature to prevent the water from boiling, but able to easily obtain a boil at your whim. Start the barbecue/grill and put the chicken (or other meat) on at a medium temperature. When it has heated up, put a bit of olive oil on each side to prevent sticking. When the meat is about a quarter done, you want to have the water boiling. Put the linguine in, and if you wish put a bit of olive oil in that as well for flavor and to prevent the pasta from sticking together.
#While you are doing this, put the snap peas in a small fry pan with some olive oil at a low-medium temperature to warm them up a bit.
#When the pasta and meat are cooked (try and get these finished cooking at the same time), slice the chicken into strips (in the case of the steak/salmon, it may be better to just leave it in fillet/steak form for presentation purposes). Strain the pasta, and put it in a fry pan along with some of the pesto (by portion) to heat the pesto up a bit. Make sure it is not at a high temperature, as that will cause the pasta to crisp up. When you have finished this, put it on a plate and top with feta and olives.
#Arrange the snap peas and meat strips on top as well, and there's your dinner!

Makes 3-5 portions.

== Variations ==
You may alter the pesto at will; it works equally well to either add sundried tomatoes to the spinach pesto, or, if you like, you could also just do a traditional basil pesto. Other variations on pesto include adding Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano (or other, softer Parmesan cheeses), or adding different kinds of nuts (pine nuts, almonds, etc) for a different taste to the pesto. In keeping with the tangy taste the kalamata olives bring to the pasta, sundried tomatoes really help enhance the flavor of the dish.

In this section, we review the definitions and applications of variables and expressions.  In case this is not review, we will attempt to go over the ideas carefully enough so that this section may serve as a first introduction.

==Types of Numbers==
In mathematics there are names for many different types of numbers and you've encountered lots of these types already and some of these types contain the others.  For instance we can start with the whole numbers such as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  Using subtraction we can build negative numbers by subtracting a bigger number from a smaller giving us an answer in the set {... -3, -2, -1, 0}. 

Using division we can identify fractions between 0 and 1 by dividing a bigger number by a smaller e.g. {1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...} or {-1/-2, -2/-3, -3/-4, ....}  We can also identify negative fractions between -1 and 0 by dividing a negative number by a positive or a positive number by a negative {-1/2, -2/3, -3/4, ...} or {1/-2,  2/-3, 3/-4, ...}. Every whole number can be written as a fraction, such as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 2 = \frac{2}{1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The rational numbers are exactly those numbers which can be written as fractions. 

Rational numbers are a subset of numbers we call real numbers.  Some calculators allow you to differentiate between rational numbers and real numbers by representing the rational number as a fraction.  If you use decimal notation the decimals in your rational number may go on forever, for example &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{3}=0.333\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.   The real numbers include all of the types of numbers mentioned before (whole numbers, negative numbers, fractions, etc.) and others that require special operations such as roots to represent.  These other numbers may not have any recognizable pattern to their digits, such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=1.41421356237\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.  But, at the end of the day, the real numbers act just like the rational numbers that you're already familiar with.  For those readers that are geometrically inclined, one may think of the real numbers as a line (or ruler), where every point on the line corresponds to exactly one number, as in the picture below.
[[Image:Real number line for Algebra book.svg|center|400px]]

==Variables and Constants==

When working with mathematics or science problems it is frequently necessary to talk about numbers whose value you do not know immediately.  For example, suppose you are asked how many 1 &amp;times; 1 squares fit inside a rectangle that measures 9 squares by 10 squares?  In this case the number we do not know is &quot;the number of squares.&quot;  Some people answer correctly right away by saying &quot;The number of squares that fit inside the rectangle is 90.&quot;  
But how did they find this?  They could say &quot;The number of squares in the rectangle is equal to the number of squares of its length times the number of squares of its width.  The rectangle is 9 squares long and 10 squares wide, so it contains 90 squares.&quot;   This is a lot of words.  We could express ourselves mathematically by writing:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{Area} &amp; = \text{Length} * \text{Width} \\
\text{Length} &amp; = 9 \text{ and } \text{Width} = 10 \\
\text{Area} &amp; = 9 * 10 \\
\text{Area} &amp; = 90
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For mathematicians, this is still a lot of writing.  Mathematicians usually choose to name each unknown with just a single letter, mostly out of a need for conciseness (that is, shortness), since writing one letter is easier than writing a word.  A '''variable''' is the letter (or symbol) we are using to represent an unknown number. We could rewrite the calculations above as:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{A} &amp;= L * W \\
\text{L} &amp; = 9 \mbox{ and } W = 10 \\
\text{A} &amp; = 9 * 10 \\
\text{A} &amp; = 90
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Evaluating expressions==
An ''expression'' is a collection of symbols you could put into a calculator and get a number. To be precise, an [[m:Expression|expression]] is a [[well-formed formula]], but don't worry about the formal details. Expressions are things we can evaluate and I like to call them &quot;numbers in fancy clothing.&quot; 

Consider the following examples of expressions and non-expressions:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{4} + 2 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an expression, since we can simply add &lt;math&gt; 4 + 2 &lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt; 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\text{(}4+10)/8 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is also an expression, since it can be evaluated to &lt;math&gt;14/8 = 7/4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{(}*3 + 2 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is not an expression. Note that &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is not being multiplied by anything, and there is no right parenthesis to match left one.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sqrt{-4}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

While &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-4}&lt;/math&gt; is not a real number, it '''is''' still an expression since it follows the rules of the order of operations.&lt;br&gt;

Now that you're familiar with what expressions look like, let's consider a practical example. A cup of coffee at my favorite café costs $2.00.  I drink 4 cups of coffee a day. I want to calculate how much money I spent on coffee this week, and in all of this year.  

Let's start with figuring out how much I spend on coffee in a week.  
*Let's call the total number of cups of coffee I drink in a week ''T''.  We can give a name to how much money I spend, lets call it ''C'' (for cost).  ''C'' is an expression, but we need a more useful one involving ''T''. Every cup of coffee costs $2.00, so:
*0 cups of coffee costs $0, as 0&amp;times;2 is 0.
*1 cup of coffee costs $2, as 1&amp;times;2 is 2.
*2 cups of coffee costs $4, as 2&amp;times;2 is 4.
*''T'' cups of coffee costs ... $2''T''. 

So, 2''T'' is an expression representing the cost of ''T'' cups of coffee.

This is the first step in figuring out how much I spend on coffee in a week.  To get further we need to know the value of T: how many cups of coffee I drink in a week.  If I drink 4 cups a day, and there are 7 days in a week, this must mean that
:''T'' = 4 &amp;times; 7 = 28.
By replacing T with the number we calculated we can see that 
:''C'' is the same as 2.00 &amp;times; 28 = 56.00.
So I spend $56.00 a week on coffee! Maybe I should cut back!

What about how much I spend in a year?  Well, we figure this out in the same way.  Let's first think about a year, if we keep our names the same we still have that 
:''C'' is the same as 2.00 &amp;times; ''T''.
But now there are 365 days in a year, so the total number of cups of coffee (that is the number ''T'') changes.  We can calculate it just as we did before, drinking 4 cups a day leads to:
:''T'' = 365 &amp;times; 4 = 1,460.

Now that we know the value of ''T'' we can see that:
:''C'' is the same as 2.00 &amp;times; 1,460 = 2,920.00.
Now I can see that I spend $2,920.00 a year on coffee.  Yes, I need to cut back!!  

Notice that solution of these two problems is basically the same, the only things that changes is the values of ''C'' and ''T''.  This is why they are called variables, because the exact numbers varied.  Some of the numbers we used in this calculation do not change.  For example, the number of days in a week is always 7.  We may still use a letter to represent the number of days in a week if we want, but since the number is not going to change, we simply leave it as 7.   Letters or symbols that represent specific unchanging numbers are called '''constants'''.

In practical situations what you think of as a constant sometimes depends on how you think about the problem.  A careful reader may point out that there are not always 365 days in a year: on leap years there are 366.  Since I was working out how much I spent for the year 2010, the number of days in the year is constant and equal to 365.  If I wanted to make a table of how much I spent on coffee in the last 10 years, then it might be better to use a variable to represent the number of days  in a year.  

Another example, which might be familiar from physics, is the amount of acceleration of a falling object due to gravity.  For most problems this acceleration is treated as a constant {{nowrap|1=  ''g'' = 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  However, for problems involving objects that aren't on Earth this may be a bad approximation. The value we used for g in equations concerning objects on other planets may not be considered constants.  The problems here are not going to ask us to worry about when it is OK to treat the acceleration due to gravity as a constant, as that is much more appropriate for a physics course.  For us, constants are going to be those numbers fixed in the problem and that do not change like the price of coffee in the example above or in some cases some very well known fixed numbers may come up (such as the number of cards in a deck, the number of days in a week, etc.).

Variables are typically written using letters, such as ''x'', ''t'', or ''C''. For cultural reasons ''x'' is an extremely common choice for the name of a variable.  But when naming a variable or constant yourself it is best to choose something connected to the problem such as ''C'' for cost, ''T'' for total, etc.  This makes it much easier to make sense of the equations you end up looking at. Constants are typically written as the numbers themselves, such as 2, -5, and 0.75, or in some cases may be represented by letters, such as ''g'' (from above) and [[Pi|&amp;pi;]]. 

As you can imagine, equations that come up are often more complicated than the equation in the preceding example.  We are going to need some vocabulary for the different parts of the equations we encounter.   For example, if I let ''G'' be the amount of gas I spend driving to the café each day, then the expression for how much I spend ''C'' might look like:
:{{nowrap|2.00&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;''T''&amp;ensp;+&amp;ensp;G&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;D}}
Now ''C'' is the sum of two things called ''terms''. In this case there are two terms in the expression, namely 2.00&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;''T'' and G&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;D.  A '''term''' of a sum is just one of the pieces we are adding together.  In the expression {{nowrap|2.00&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;''T''&amp;ensp;+&amp;ensp;G&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;D&amp;ensp;&amp;minus;&amp;ensp;7}} there are three terms. Two of the terms are {{nowrap|2.00&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;''T'' and G&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;D}}. There are two possibilities for handling {{nowrap|&amp;minus;&amp;ensp;7}}.  The first possibility is to consider subtraction the same as addition and consider 7 to be the third term.  The second possibility is that we think of subtracting 7 as adding &amp;minus;7.  In this case we might say that the terms are 2.00&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;''T'', G&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;D, and &amp;minus;7.  To be honest, it doesn't really matter much how we choose to think of things, but we should try to be consistent.  Since we used the word &quot;sum&quot; in the definition of term above, we shall try to consistently use the second possibility to describe terms that are subtracted instead of added.

==Implied Multiplication with Expressions==

There are many ways to indicate that two numbers should be multiplied.  You are probably most familiar with using the symbol &amp;times;, in equations such as {{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;times; 2 = 4}}.  But because mathematics developed in many places, there are other symbols that sometimes get used and this becomes particularly important in algebra.  Why have more than one notation?  Believe it or not, for convenience!   For cultural reasons the most common letter to choose for a variable is ''x'', but now things can look confusing when we try to write out expressions like {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;times; 2}}.  It is just an unfortunate fact of life that our variable and our multiplication symbol look '''a lot''' alike.  Add poor penmanship to this and you're asking for trouble!  There are two common ways to deal with this.  The first is to introduce another symbol for multiplication, namely a dot written in the middle of the line.  For example instead of writing {{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;times; 2 = 4}} one can write {{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;middot; 2 = 4}}.  Another even more common strategy is to do away with writing anything at all! Suppose I want to multiply ''x'' by 2. Since it can lead to confusion I do not want to write {{nowrap|2 &amp;times; ''x''}}.  I could write, with  our new dot notation {{nowrap| 2 &amp;middot; ''x''}}, or I could just be concise and decide you'll know what it means if I write 2''x''.  That's right, I skipped writing any symbol for multiplication at all!  This is known as ''implied'' multiplication, because I never really said I was multiplying, I just implied it.  This is by far the most common way to express multiplying in algebra.  

At first this may seem a crazy way to do things, but it works particularly well with our intuition about units.  We are taught from elementary school that if I have 1 apple and someone gives me 1 apple then I have 2 apples.  In the same way it seems very natural to write ''1x'' + ''1x'' = 2''x''.  If I have 1 ''x'' and someone gives me 1 ''x'' then I will just have 2 ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s.  Because variables have such a strong similarity to our units in simple examples like this, it has been culture to '''never''' place the variable before the number in implied multiplication.  While it may be in some technical sense correct, to write ''x''2 for the product of 2 and ''x'', people may '''not understand''' what it means.  So '''always place explicit numbers before the variables when using implied multiplication'''.  

Implied multiplication is also frequently used between two different variables, or even two whole expressions (provided you use parentheses).  So we may encounter expressions like ''xy'' for the product of ''x'' and ''y'', or ''x(a + b)'' for the product of ''x'' and ''a + b''.  Because implied multiplication is so common it gives us even more reason to use single letters for variables.  While it might have been nice to use a variable ''YC'' for the yearly cost for my coffee, if I were not very careful to explain what I meant some readers may think this represents some variable ''Y'' multiplied by another variable ''C''.  On the other hand in complicated situations with lots of variables sometimes it is worth risking confusion to choose variable names that make sense.  

Finally, you can use implied multiplication between two numbers.  Just try it, if we wanted to write {{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;times; 2 = 4}} using implied multiplication we would end up writing {{nowrap|1= 22 = 4}}, but twenty-two is not four! Instead, we write one or both constants in parentheses: ''2(2) = 4'' or ''(2)(2) = 4''. Both forms are correct. Follow what your teacher says when in doubt.

==Evaluating expressions==
We treat variables just like numbers — numbers that maybe we do not know at the beginning, but numbers nonetheless.  When we know what the numbers associated with a variable are we can figure out what some expression we have written before equals. Suppose we are asked to find the value of {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;minus; 5}}  when {{nowrap|1= ''x'' = 7}}.  To do this we '''substitute''' 7 for ''x''.  This means we rewrite the expression, except everywhere we would write ''x'' we write 7.  So we get {{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;minus; 5}}, and now we can use simple arithmetic to figure out that the expression equals 2.   If you look back to discussion analyzing my coffee drinking habits, you'll see see we substituted a few times already.  Let's look at some more examples.
{{TextBox|'''Problem.''' Find the value of {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;middot; ''y'' &amp;minus; 9}} when {{nowrap|1= ''x'' = 2}} and {{nowrap|1= ''y'' = 3}}.

''Solution.'' We will do this in two steps.  First we will substitute 2 for ''x'' to get:
:{{nowrap|2 &amp;middot; ''y'' &amp;minus; 9}}.
Now we will substitute 3 for ''y'' to get:
:{{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;middot; 3 &amp;minus; 9 = 6 &amp;minus; 9 = -3.}}
}}

In the last line, since we had gotten to a problem of arithmetic we simply used the rules of arithmetic we are already familiar with.  One time to be a little bit careful is when implied multiplication is involved.  Consider the following example.
We needed to use our precedence rules to work the simple arithmetic in the right order in order to figure out that the expression equals 2.   
{{TextBox|'''Problem.''' Evaluate {{nowrap|2''x'' + 2}} when {{nowrap|1= ''x'' = 4}}.

''Solution.'' Substituting 4 for ''x'' we get:
:{{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;middot; 4 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10}}.
}}

Notice a very subtle change when I rewrote the expression.  Specifically I ''inserted'' a multiplication symbol where there was an implied multiplication.  Imagine that I hadn't: the last line would have started 24&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, which is not what we meant!  We wanted to multiply ''x'' by 2, since ''x'' = 4, that means we wanted multiply 4 by 2.  The number 24 shouldn't be part of our calculation.

It is '''very important''' when evaluating expressions to follow the correct [[../Order of Operations/|order of operations]] (Don't forget &quot;'''P'''lease '''e'''xcuse '''m'''y '''d'''ear '''a'''unt '''S'''ally&quot;).  For example 
{{TextBox|1=
'''Problem.''' Simplify the expression {{nowrap|3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2''z''+''k'')}} given that {{nowrap| ''x'' is 2}}, {{nowrap| ''z'' is 1/2}} and {{nowrap| k is 1}}.

'''Solution.'''  Writing first by substituting for ''x'', we have
:{{nowrap|3 &amp;middot; 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;middot; (2''z''+''k'')}}
Now substiting for ''z''
:{{nowrap|3 &amp;middot; 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;middot; (2 &amp;middot; 1/2 + ''k'')}}
Finally we substitute for ''k'' to get:
:{{nowrap|3 &amp;middot; 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;middot; (2 &amp;middot; 1/2 + 1)}}.

First we need to figure out the value inside the parentheses, that is we need to calculate {{nowrap|2 &amp;middot; 1/2 + 1}}.  The correct order to do this in is to first multiply, then add.  That is {{nowrap|1= 2 &amp;middot; 1/2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2}}. 

Now that we have figured out what is inside the parentheses, the problem is now to calculate:
:{{nowrap|3 &amp;middot; 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;middot; (2)}}.

We do the exponentiation first to get
:{{nowrap|3 &amp;middot; 4 &amp;middot; (2)}}.

Now we simply multiply, and our answer is 24.

}}

==Parentheses==
Let's look at when it is OK to add or remove parentheses.  The purpose of parentheses is to establish precedence.  Precedence tells you which operation goes first.  The operation rules for precedence say to evaluate the parentheses first (PEMDAS!).  But, what can you do with &lt;math&gt;\frac{x + 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;?  &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have just one value; it has as many values as we choose to assign to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  This is where the distributive property shows its power. It allows us to rearrange the operations while maintaining precedence.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{x + 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} * (x+ 1) = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
So we can change our equation to
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Add &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; to both sides
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}- \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
And multiply both sides by the inverse of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}x * 2 = 0 * 2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x  = 0  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Parentheses allow us to ensure that we treat expressions that have variables as if they were a value.  For instance, if we want to know for which values the expression 
&lt;math&gt;  \frac{2}{x + 1} = 3 &lt;/math&gt; is true we need to use the properties of real numbers to place the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by itself on one side of the equals sign.  To do this we need to get &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt; out of the denominator of the fraction.  We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by &lt;math&gt;(x + 1)&lt;/math&gt;.  We don't know what the value of &lt;math&gt;(x + 1)&lt;/math&gt; is, but it will always be the same thing on both sides of the equation so it doesn't change the notion of equality.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (x + 1) * \frac{2}{x+ 1} = 3 * (x+ 1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We use the inverse property to re-write &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt; as multiplication.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (x + 1) * 2 * \frac{1}{x+ 1} = 3 * (x+ 1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

And the associative property to re-write the multiplication.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2* (x + 1) * \frac{1}{x+ 1} = 3 * (x + 1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

And the identity property to re-write &lt;math&gt;(x + 1) * \frac{1}{x+ 1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 * (1) = 3 * (x+ 1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since 2 * (1) has no variables we can evaluate it.  We use the distributive property to re-write 3 * (x+ 1)
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 = 3*x+ 3*1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 = 3*x+ 3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 - 3 = 3*x+ 3 -3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -1 = 3*x &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

And multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -1*\frac{1}{3}= 3*x*\frac{1}{3} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -\frac{1}{3}= x &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using parentheses and the properties of real numbers and equality we were able to get x alone to determine the only number for which our initial statement is true.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Prestonmcafee. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Prestonmcafee~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">World War I marks a dramatic watershed in the history of Europe and the world. Although it started as a minor skirmish in eastern Europe it soon escalated to the point that most of the world's major powers were involved in a war more destructive than any the world had ever known. The social and diplomatic consequences were enormous and felt across the world. Empires fell, political systems were severely tested, and many of the old mindsets were destroyed.

==Immediate Origins==
The reasons for the outbreak of war in August 1914 are diverse and varied. However, the immediate reasons for the outbreak are relatively simple. Gavrillo Princip, the member of a group working for Bosnian independence from [[w:Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]] shot the heir to the throne of that state, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife.

At the same time, many members of the Austro-Hungarian government were looking for an excuse to attack Serbia, and because of connections between the cause of Princip's slavic nationalist group and the supposed aims of the Serbian government, they felt this was the perfect excuse. They presented a list of demands to the Serbian government, which it was inclined to accept except for one demand which was expressly designed to be rejected. As a result Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.

The complicating factor in this situation was the interest of Russia in the region. Due to feelings of community, known as pan-slavism, which unified the people of Russia and Serbia. Russia felt that it could not allow an attack on Serbia to go unchecked. Although they made this clear, Austria-Hungary had assurances from Germany that they would support them in the case of a Russian attack, so the leadership felt confident that they could still defeat Serbia in time to handle a Russian attack.

However, because of Russia's defence treaty with France, Germany was more concerned by France than Russia. As a result they initiated a plan to defeat France before turning to Russia that involved an attack against Belgium. In the 19th century Britain had made assurances to Belgium that it would protect Belgium's neutrality, so after the German invasion Britain also declared war on Germany.

Thus, through a series of alliances all of Europe's major powers were brought into conflict, ostensibly over the boundaries of Serbia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

'''Kosher''' refers to that which is prepared in accordance with Jewish law.  Kosher foods are foods that practicing Jews are allowed to consume. The specific rules are enumerated in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah Torah], and refined in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud Talmud].

There are two groups of rules - what can be eaten and how it can be prepared.

If you want to keep things simple, serve a [[Cookbook:Vegetarian|vegetarian]] meal that excludes either dairy or eggs.

== What can be eaten ==

*Any fish that has ''both'' scales and fins. This means that shellfish are not kosher, and neither are fish like catfish.

*Any land animal that chews its cud ''and'' has split hooves. Sheep and cows are kosher animals, while pigs, horses, and dogs are not kosher. Pigs do have a split hoof, but they do not chew their cud, so they are not kosher.  Both deer and goats are kosher if properly slaughtered. There are also restrictions as to what parts of the animal may be eaten. Some parts may never be eaten and some are not normally processed as kosher meat in the United States, due to the additional labor involved.  Kosher hot dogs cannot contain some of the filler and miscellaneous scraps that are added to most non-kosher hot dogs.

*The Torah contains a list of non-kosher birds, predominantly scavengers and predators. Kosher birds include duck, chicken, and turkey. Ostrich is not kosher.

*There are some kosher insects, types of grasshopper or locust. Ashkenazi and most Sephardi groups have lost the tradition of which exact species are kosher, but Yemenites and some Mizrachi groups have maintained this tradition and can properly identify them (though to most Westerners the prospect of eating insects is not appealing, rendering this a largely academic point).

*There is a special, more strict set of rules for the period of Passover that excludes most wheat products and yeast.  The Ashkenaz community also forbids rice, corn, and beans.

*No blood of any kind is to be eaten.

*Eggs from kosher birds are kosher. Eggs are not used if any blood spots are found.

*Honey made by bees is kosher even though it is processed by a non-kosher insect.

*An animal that is sick or injured cannot be eaten. Roadkill is not kosher.

*All kosher animals must be slaughtered properly in order for the meat to be permissible.

*There are some restrictions on plants.  They must be checked for insects. Any beverages made from grapes, including grape juice and wine, require special processing and supervision to be kosher.

*Gelatin is usually made from non kosher animals' hooves or bones, but it is possible to get kosher gelatin either made from kosher fish, kosher animals or vegetable products.

*Ask a local rabbi for more details.

== How it can be prepared ==

*It is not enough for an animal to be kosher; the animal must also be slaughtered in a specific way as to minimise the amount of pain it feels.

*Meat must be &quot;kashered&quot;, which removes the blood from the meat. This is done either by [[Cookbook:Kosher Salt|salting]] or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]]. Most kosher meat that one can buy is already kashered.

*Milk and meat cannot be cooked or eaten together. This includes eating dairy and meat within certain time periods. Depending on the family's custom, this is 6 hours or 3 hours before consuming dairy products after meat products. Some hold that it is permissible to wash out your mouth before consuming meat products after dairy products, except for hard cheese, which requires the same waiting period as is required to eat dairy after meat. One must have two entirely different sets of cooking pots and table dishes for milk and meat. Both birds and mammals are considered meat, while fish, insects, and eggs are considered to be neither dairy or meat.  Fish can be eaten with meat or dairy, although some hold that one should not eat fish and meat off of the same dish. Some Jews of Sephardic backgrounds follow Maimonides' ruling, and do not mix fish with dairy products of any kind.

== Store-bought goods ==

The U or K within a circle are two of many symbols used by Jews in the USA to identify kosher products. A &quot;plain k&quot; [a K all by itself] does not mean that the food is certified kosher, but rather that the company declares it to be kosher. Many Jews do not accept &quot;plain k&quot; as a legitimate kashrut certification.

A list of many of the kosher certification agencies are found here:  http://www.kashrut.com/agencies/

Some Jews will not accept certain certifications, as interpretations and levels of observance vary from Jew to Jew.

== Notes ==
*If you are entertaining for people that you know or think may keep kosher, be sure to ask them about their personal rules, as there are many interpretations and subtle variations.  Depending on their observance, they may be fine eating a vegetarian dish cooked in your home, or may not be comfortable doing anything more than eating unprepared fruit. Strict Kashruth includes categorizing the cooking vessels, the serving containers, the cutlery and the cooking surfaces as kosher or non-kosher as well.  Generally, if a pot has been previously used to cook non-kosher meat, one cannot use it to produce a kosher meal.

*Here is a more detailed explanation of [[w:Kashrut|Kashrut]].

==The '''for''' loop==
The '''for loop''' is one of the basic looping structures in most modern programming languages. Like the ''[[Programming:PHP:while_loop |while loop]]'', '''for loops''' execute a given code block until a certain condition is met.

===Syntax===
The basic syntax of the for loop in PHP is similar to the [[C Programming/Control#For_loops|C]] syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 for([initialization]; [condition]; [step])
&lt;/source&gt;

''Initialization'' happens the first time the loop is run. It is used to initialize variables or perform other actions that are to be performed before the first execution of the body of the loop.&lt;br /&gt;
The ''condition'' is evaluated before each execution of the body of the loop; if the condition is true, the body of the loop will be executed, if it is false, the loop is exited and program execution resumes at the first line after the body of the loop.&lt;br /&gt;
''Step'' specifies an action that is to be performed after each execution of the loop body.

{{Code:PHPHTML
|Consider this example:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
for($i = 0; $i &lt; 5; $i++)
{
  echo($i . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;0&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
 0
 1
 2
 3
 4
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}
The loop can also be formatted without using [[Wikipedia:concatenation|concatenation]], according to personal preference:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
for($i = 0; $i &lt; 5; $i++)
{
  echo &quot;$i &lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explanation===

Within the for loop, it is indicated that &lt;code&gt;$i&lt;/code&gt; starts as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. When the loop runs for the first time, it prints the initial value of &lt;code&gt;$i&lt;/code&gt;, which in the case of the example is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. For every loop, the variable &lt;code&gt;$i&lt;/code&gt; is increased by one (denoted by the the &lt;code&gt;$i++&lt;/code&gt; [http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.increment.php incrementing step]). When &lt;code&gt;$i&lt;/code&gt; reaches &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; it is no longer less than &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; and therefore the loop stops.

Do note that the initialisation, condition and step for the for-loop can be left empty. In this case, the loop will continue indefinitely and subsequently a [http://uk.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.break.php break execution] can be utilised to stop the loop.

NOTE: In contrast to other languages like C, [[C Sharp Programming/Keywords/for|C#]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/for|C++]], or [[Java_Programming/Loop_blocks|Java]], the variable used in the for loop may have been initialised first in the line with the for statement, but it continues to exist after the loop has finished.

==Using for loops to traverse arrays==
In the section on while loops, the sort() example uses a while loop to print out the contents of the array. Generally programmers use '''for loops''' for this kind of job.

===Example===

NOTE: Use of indices like below is highly discouraged. Use the key-value for-loop construct.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$menu = array(&quot;Toast and jam&quot;, &quot;Bacon and eggs&quot;, &quot;Homefries&quot;, &quot;Skillet&quot;, &quot;Milk and cereal&quot;);
// Note to self: get breakfast after writing this article
$count = count($menu);
for($i = 0; $i &lt; $count; $i++)
{
  echo($i + 1 . &quot;. &quot; . $menu[$i] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, this can be formatted without concatenation, if you prefer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
for($i = 0; $i &lt; $count; $i++)
{
  $j = $i + 1;
  echo &quot;$j. {$menu[$i]} &lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explanation===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$count = count($menu);
&lt;/source&gt;

We define the count before the for loop for more efficient processing. This is because each time the for loop is run (whilst $i &lt; $count) it evaluates both sides of the equation and executes any functions. If we put $i &lt; count($menu), this would evaluate count($menu) each time the process is executed, which is costly when dealing with large arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
for($i = 0; $i &lt; $count; $i++)
&lt;/source&gt;

This line sets up the loop. It initializes the counter, $i, to 0 at the start, adds one every time the loop goes through, and checks that $i is less than the size of the array.

This can also be done using a second Initialization.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
for($i = 0, $count = count($menu); $i &lt; $count; $i++)
{
  echo($i + 1 . &quot;. &quot; . $menu[$i] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The echo statement is pretty self-explanatory, except perhaps the bit at the start, where we echo $i + 1. We do that because, as you may recall, arrays start at 0 and end at n - 1 (where n is their length), so to get a numbered list starting at one, we have to add one to the counter each time we print it.

Of course, as I mentioned before, both pieces of code produce the following output:

# Toast and jam ✓
# Bacon and eggs ✓
# Homefries ✓
# Skillet ✓
# Milk and cereal ✓

Believe it or not, there's actually a way to traverse arrays that requires even ''less'' typing. (And isn't that the goal?) Check out the [[Programming:PHP:foreach loop|'''foreach''' loop]] for another way of doing what we did here.

* 1 can (~2 cups) [[cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney beans]]
* 1 can (~2 cups) [[cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely minced
* 4 cloves [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], finely minced
* 6 dried [[cookbook:Chile Pepper|chilis]] (''chili pequins''), chopped
* [[cookbook:Mustard Seed|mustard seed]], salt, and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

== Procedure ==
Mix ingredients in pot; add three cans of water. Boil until done.

==Introduction==

Many students confuse Relativity Theory with a theory about the propagation of light.  According to modern Relativity Theory the constancy of the speed of light is a consequence of the geometry of spacetime rather than something specifically due to the properties of photons; but the statement &quot;the speed of light is constant&quot; often distracts the student into a consideration of light propagation.  This confusion is amplified by the importance assigned to interferometry experiments, such as the Michelson-Morley experiment, in most textbooks on Relativity Theory.

The history of theories of the propagation of light is an interesting topic in physics and was indeed important in the early days of Relativity Theory. In the seventeenth century two competing theories of light propagation were developed. Christiaan Huygens published a '''wave theory of light''' which was based on '''Huygen's principle''' whereby every point in a wavelike disturbance can give rise to further disturbances that spread out spherically. In contrast Newton considered that the propagation of light was due to the passage of small particles or &quot;corpuscles&quot; from the source to the illuminated object.  His theory is known as the '''corpuscular theory of light'''. Newton's theory was widely accepted until the nineteenth century.

In the early nineteenth century Thomas Young performed his '''Young's slits''' experiment and the interference pattern that occurred was explained in terms of diffraction due to the wave nature of light. The wave theory was accepted generally until the twentieth century when quantum theory confirmed that light had a corpuscular nature and that Huygen's principle could not be applied.

The idea of light as a disturbance of some medium, or '''aether''', that permeates the universe was problematical from its inception (US spelling: &quot;ether&quot;).  The first problem that arose was that the speed of light did not change with the velocity of the observer. If light were indeed a disturbance of some stationary medium then as the earth moves through the medium towards a light source the speed of light should appear to increase.  It was found however that the speed of light did not change as expected.  Each experiment on the velocity of light required corrections to existing theory and led to a variety of subsidiary theories such as the &quot;aether drag hypothesis&quot;. Ultimately it was experiments that were designed to investigate the properties of the aether that provided the first experimental evidence for Relativity Theory.

==The aether drag hypothesis==

The '''aether drag hypothesis''' was an early attempt to explain the way experiments such as Arago's experiment showed that the speed of light is constant.  The aether drag hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect.

According to the aether drag hypothesis light propagates in a special medium, the aether, that remains attached to things as they move. If this is the case then, no matter how fast the earth moves around the sun or rotates on its axis, light on the surface of the earth would travel at a constant velocity.  

[[File:Stellar aberration.svg|left|frame|''Stellar Aberration.'' If a telescope is travelling at high speed, only light incident at a particular angle can avoid hitting the walls of the telescope tube.]]

The primary reason the aether drag hypothesis is considered invalid is because of the occurrence of stellar aberration.  In stellar aberration the position of a star when viewed with a telescope swings each side of a central position by about 20.5 seconds of arc every six months.  This amount of swing is the amount expected when considering the speed of earth's travel in its orbit.  In 1871, [[:w:George Biddell Airy|George Biddell Airy]] demonstrated that stellar aberration occurs even when a telescope is filled with water.  It seems that if the aether drag hypothesis were true then stellar aberration would not occur because the light would be travelling in the aether which would be moving along with the telescope.

[[File:Aether drag analogy.svg|right|frame|The &quot;train analogy&quot; for the absence of aether drag.]]

If you visualize a bucket on a train about to enter a tunnel and a drop of water drips from the tunnel entrance into the bucket at the very centre, the drop will not hit the centre at the bottom of the bucket. The bucket is the tube of a telescope, the drop is a photon and the train is the earth. If aether is dragged then the droplet would be travelling with the train when it is dropped and would hit the centre of bucket at the bottom.

The amount of stellar aberration, ''&amp;alpha;'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;tan(\alpha) = v \delta t / c \delta t&lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;tan(\alpha) = v  / c&lt;/math&gt;

The speed at which the earth goes round the sun, v = 30 km/s, and the speed of light is c = 300,000,000 m/s which gives ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;20.5 seconds of arc every six months. This amount of aberration is observed and this contradicts the aether drag hypothesis.

In 1818, [[:w:Augustin Jean Fresnel|Augustin Jean Fresnel]] introduced a modification to the aether drag hypothesis that only applies to the interface between media. This was accepted during much of the nineteenth century but has now been replaced by special theory of relativity (see below).

The aether drag hypothesis is historically important because it was one of the reasons why Newton's corpuscular theory of light was replaced by the wave theory and it is used in early explanations of light propagation without relativity theory. It originated as a result of early attempts to measure the speed of light.

In 1810, [[:w:François Arago|François Arago]] realised that variations in the refractive index of a substance predicted by the corpuscular theory would provide a useful method for measuring the velocity of light. These predictions arose because the refractive index of a substance such as glass depends on the ratio of the velocities of light in air and in the glass. Arago attempted to measure the extent to which corpuscles of light would be refracted by a glass prism at the front of a telescope. He expected that there would be a range of different angles of refraction due to the variety of different velocities of the stars and the motion of the earth at different times of the day and year. Contrary to this expectation he found that that there was no difference in refraction between stars, between times of day or between seasons. All Arago observed was ordinary stellar aberration.

In 1818 Fresnel examined Arago's results using a wave theory of light. He realised that even if light were transmitted as waves the refractive index of the glass-air interface should have varied as the glass moved through the aether to strike the incoming waves at different velocities when the earth rotated and the seasons changed. 

Fresnel proposed that the glass prism would carry some of the aether along with it so that  &quot;...the aether is in excess inside the prism&quot;. He realised that the velocity of propagation of waves depends on the density of the medium so proposed that the velocity of light in the prism would need to be adjusted by an amount of 'drag'.

The velocity of light &lt;math&gt; v_n&lt;/math&gt; in the glass without any adjustment is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v_n = c / n &lt;/math&gt;

The drag adjustment &lt;math&gt; v_d&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v_d  = v (1 - \frac {\rho_e}{\rho_g}) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \rho_e&lt;/math&gt; is the aether density in the environment, &lt;math&gt;\rho_g&lt;/math&gt; is the aether density in the glass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the prism with respect to the aether.

The factor &lt;math&gt;(1 - \frac {\rho_e}{\rho_g})&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt; (1 - \frac{1}{n^2})&lt;/math&gt; because the refractive index, n, would be dependent on the density of the aether. This is known as the '''Fresnel drag coefficient'''.

The velocity of light in the glass is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {c}{n} + v (1 - \frac{1}{n^2}) &lt;/math&gt;

This correction was successful in explaining the null result of Arago's experiment. It introduces the concept of a largely stationary aether that is dragged by substances such as glass but not by air. Its success favoured the wave theory of light over the previous corpuscular theory.

The Fresnel drag coefficient was confirmed by an interferometer experiment performed by Fizeau.  Water was passed at high speed along two glass tubes that formed the optical paths of the interferometer and it was found that the fringe shifts were as predicted by the drag coefficient.

The special theory of relativity predicts the result of the Fizeau experiment from the velocity addition theorem without any need for an aether.

If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light relative to the Fizeau apparatus and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light relative to the water and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the water:

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac {c}{n} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {c/n + v}{1 + v/nc}&lt;/math&gt;

which, if v/c is small can be expanded using the binomial expansion to become:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {c}{n} + v (1 - \frac{1}{n^2}) &lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to Fresnel's equation.

It may appear as if Fresnel's analysis can be substituted for the relativistic approach, however, more recent work has shown that Fresnel's assumptions should lead to different amounts of aether drag for different frequencies of light and violate Snell's law (see Ferraro and Sforza (2005)).

The aether drag hypothesis was one of the arguments used in an attempt to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment before the widespread acceptance of the special theory of relativity.

The Fizeau experiment is consistent with relativity and approximately consistent with each individual body, such as prisms, lenses etc. dragging its own aether with it. This contradicts some modified versions of the aether drag hypothesis that argue that aether drag may happen on a global (or larger) scale and stellar aberration is merely transferred into the entrained &quot;bubble&quot; around the earth which then faithfully carries the modified angle of incidence directly to the observer.

==The Michelson-Morley experiment==

The '''Michelson-Morley experiment''', one of the most important and famous experiments in the history of physics, was performed in 1887 by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University, and is considered to be the first strong evidence against the theory of a luminiferous aether.

Physics theories of the late 19th century postulated that, just as water waves must have a medium to move across (water), and audible sound waves require a medium to move through (air), so also light waves require a medium, the &quot;luminiferous aether&quot;. The speed of light being so great, designing an experiment to detect the presence and properties of this aether took considerable thought. 

===Measuring aether===
[[Image:AetherWind.svg|left|thumb|300px|]] A depiction of the concept of the “aether wind”.
Each year, the Earth travels a tremendous distance in its orbit around the sun, at a speed of around 30 km/second, over 100,000 km per hour. It was reasoned that the Earth would at all times be moving through the aether and producing a detectable &quot;aether wind&quot;.  At any given point on the Earth's surface, the magnitude and direction of the wind would vary with time of day and season.  By analysing the effective wind at various different times, it should be possible to separate out components due to motion of the Earth relative to the Solar System from any due to the overall motion of that system.

The effect of the aether wind on light waves would be like the effect of wind on sound waves.  Sound waves travel at a constant speed relative to the medium that they are travelling through (this varies depending on the pressure, temperature etc (see sound), but is typically around 340 m/s).  So, if the speed of sound in our conditions is 340 m/s, when there is a 10 m/s wind relative to the ground, into the wind it will appear that sound is travelling at 330 m/s (340 - 10).  Downwind, it will appear that sound is travelling at 350 m/s (340 + 10).  Measuring the speed of sound compared to the ground in different directions will therefore enable us to calculate the speed of the air relative to the ground.

If the speed of the sound cannot be directly measured, an alternative method is to measure the time that the sound takes to bounce off of a reflector and return to the origin.  This is done parallel to the wind and perpendicular (since the direction of the wind is unknown before hand, just determine the time for several different directions).  The cumulative round trip effects of the wind in the two orientations slightly favors the sound travelling at right angles to it. Similarly, the effect of an aether wind on a beam of light would be for the beam to take slightly longer to travel round-trip in the direction parallel to the “wind” than to travel the same round-trip distance at right angles to it.

“Slightly” is key, in that, over a distance such as a few meters, the difference in time for the two round trips would be only about a millionth of a millionth of a second. At this point the only truly accurate measurements of the speed of light were those carried out by Albert Abraham Michelson, which had resulted in measurements accurate to a few meters per second. While a stunning achievement in its own right, this was certainly not nearly enough accuracy to be able to detect the aether.

===The experiments===

Michelson, though, had already seen a solution to this problem. His design, later known as an interferometer, sent a single source of white light through a half-silvered mirror that was used to split it into two beams travelling at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams travelled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle on small mirrors. They then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference based on the length of the arms. Any slight change in the amount of time the beams spent in transit would then be observed as a shift in the positions of the interference fringes. If the aether were stationary relative to the sun, then the Earth's motion would produce a shift of about 0.04 fringes.

Michelson had made several measurements with an experimental device in 1881, in which he noticed that the expected shift of 0.04 was not seen, and a smaller shift of about 0.02 was. However his apparatus was a prototype, and had experimental errors far too large to say anything about the aether wind. For a measurement of the aether wind, a much more accurate and tightly controlled experiment would have to be carried out. The prototype was, however, successful in demonstrating that the basic method was feasible.

[[Image:Michelson-morley.png|325px|thumb|right|A Michelson interferometer]]
He then combined forces with Edward Morley and spent a considerable amount of time and money creating an improved version with more than enough accuracy to detect the drift. In their experiment the light was repeatedly reflected back and forth along the arms, increasing the path length to 11m. At this length the drift would be about .4 fringes. To make that easily detectable the apparatus was located in a closed room in the basement of a stone building, eliminating most thermal and vibrational effects. Vibrations were further reduced by building the apparatus on top of a huge block of marble, which was then floated in a pool of mercury. They calculated that effects of about 1/100th of a fringe would be detectable.

The mercury pool allowed the device to be turned, so that it could be rotated through the entire range of possible angles to the &quot;aether wind&quot;. Even over a short period of time some sort of effect would be noticed simply by rotating the device, such that one arm rotated into the direction of the wind and the other away. Over longer periods day/night cycles or yearly cycles would also be easily measurable. 

During each full rotation of the device, each arm would be parallel to the wind twice (facing into and away from the wind) and perpendicular to the wind twice. This effect would show readings in a sine wave formation with two peaks and two troughs. Additionally if the wind was only from the earth's orbit around the sun, the wind would fully change directions east/west during a 12 hour period. In this ideal conceptualization, the sine wave of day/night readings would be in opposite phase.

Because it was assumed that the motion of the solar system would cause an additional component to the wind, the yearly cycles would be detectable as an alteration of the maginitude of the wind. An example of this effect is a helicopter flying forward. While on the ground, a helicopter's blades would be measured as travelling around at 50 km/h at the tips. However, if the helicopter is travelling forward at 50 km/h, there are points at which the tips of the blades are travelling 0 km/h and 100 km/h with respect to the air they are travelling through. This increases the magnitude of the lift on one side and decreases it on the other just as it would increase and decrease the magnitude of an ether wind on a yearly basis.

=== The most famous failed experiment ===

Ironically, after all this thought and preparation, the experiment became what might be called the most famous failed experiment to date. Instead of providing insight into the properties of the aether, Michelson and Morley's [http://www.anti-relativity.com/MM_Paper.pdf 1887 article] in the American Journal of Science reported the measurement to be as small as one-fortieth of the expected displacement but &quot;since the displacement is proportional to the square of the velocity&quot; they concluded that the measured velocity was approximately one-sixth of the expected velocity of the Earth's motion in orbit and  &quot;certainly less than one-fourth&quot;. Although this small &quot;velocity&quot; was measured, it was considered far too small to be used as evidence of aether,  it was later said to be within the range of an experimental error that would allow the speed to actually be zero.

Although Michelson and Morley went on to different experiments after their first publication in 1887, both remained active in the field. Other versions of the experiment were carried out with increasing sophistication. Kennedy and Illingsworth both modified the mirrors to include a half-wave &quot;step&quot;, eliminating the possibility of some sort of standing wave pattern within the apparatus. Illingsworth could detect changes on the order of 1/300th of a fringe, Kennedy up to 1/1500th. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate magnetostriction, while Michelson built one of non-expanding invar to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Others from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. All of these with the exception of Dayton Miller also returned what is considered a null result.

Morley was not convinced of his own results, and went on to conduct additional experiments with Dayton Miller. Miller worked on increasingly large experiments, culminating in one with a 32m (effective) arm length at an installation at the Mount Wilson observatory. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, he used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. He consistently measured a small positive effect that varied, as expected, with each rotation of the device, the sidereal day and on a yearly basis. The low magnitude of the results he attributed to aether entrainment (see below). His measurements amounted to only ~10 kps instead of the expected ~30 kps expected from the earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to ''partial'' entrainment, though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. 

Though Kennedy later also carried out an experiment at Mount Wilson, finding 1/10 the drift measured by Miller, and no seasonal effects,  Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928 (ref below). There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Lorentz recognised that the results, whatever their cause, did not quite tally with either his or Einstein's versions of special relativity. Einstein was not present at the meeting and felt the results could be dismissed as experimental error (see Shankland ref below).

In recent times versions of the MM experiment have become commonplace. Lasers and masers amplify light by repeatedly bouncing it back and forth inside a carefully tuned cavity, thereby inducing high-energy atoms in the cavity to give off more light. The result is an effective path length of kilometers. Better yet, the light emitted in one cavity can be used to start the same cascade in another set at right angles, thereby creating an interferometer of extreme accuracy.

The first such experiment was led by Charles H. Townes, one of the co-creators of the first maser. Their 1958 experiment put an upper limit on drift, including any possible experimental errors, of only 30 m/s. In 1974 a repeat with accurate lasers in the triangular Trimmer experiment reduced this to 0.025 m/s, and included tests of entrainment by placing one leg in glass. In 1979 the Brillet-Hall experiment put an upper limit of 30 m/s for any one direction, but reduced this to only 0.000001 m/s for a two-direction case (ie, still or partially entrained aether). A year long repeat known as Hils and Hall, published in 1990, reduced this to 2x10&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;.

===Fallout===

This result was rather astounding and not explainable by the then-current theory of wave propagation in a static aether. Several explanations were attempted, among them, that the experiment had a hidden flaw (apparently Michelson's initial belief), or that the Earth's gravitational field somehow &quot;dragged&quot; the aether around with it in such a way as locally to eliminate its effect. Miller would have argued that, in most if not all experiments other than his own, there was little possibility of detecting an aether wind since it was almost completely blocked out by the laboratory walls or by the apparatus itself.  Be this as it may, the idea of a simple aether, what became known as the ''First Postulate'', had been dealt a serious blow.

A number of experiments were carried out to investigate the concept of aether dragging, or ''entrainment''. The most convincing was carried out by Hamar, who placed one arm of the interferometer between two huge lead blocks. If aether were dragged by mass, the blocks would, it was theorised, have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen.

Walter Ritz's Emission theory (or ballistic theory), was also consistent with the results of the experiment, not requiring aether, more intuitive and paradox-free. This became known as the ''Second Postulate''. However it also led to several &quot;obvious&quot; optical effects that were not seen in astronomical photographs, notably in observations of binary stars in which the light from the two stars could be measured in an interferometer.

The Sagnac experiment placed the MM apparatus on a constantly rotating turntable. In doing so any ballistic theories such as Ritz's could be tested directly, as the light going one way around the device would have different length to travel than light going the other way (the eyepiece and mirrors would be moving toward/away from the light). In Ritz's theory there would be no shift, because the net velocity between the light source and detector was zero (they were both mounted on the turntable). However in this case an effect ''was'' seen, thereby eliminating any simple ballistic theory. This fringe-shift effect is used today in laser gyroscopes.

Another possible solution was found in the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction hypothesis. In this theory all objects physically contract along the line of motion relative to the aether, so while the light may indeed transit slower on that arm, it also ends up travelling a shorter distance that exactly cancels out the drift.

In 1932 the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment modified the Michelson-Morley experiment by making the path lengths of the split beam unequal, with one arm being very long. In this version the two ends of the experiment were at different velocities due to the rotation of the earth, so the contraction would not &quot;work out&quot; to exactly cancel the result. Once again, no effect was seen.

Ernst Mach was among the first physicists to suggest that the experiment actually amounted to a disproof of the aether theory.  The development of what became Einstein's special theory of relativity had the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction derived from the invariance postulate, and was also consistent with the apparently null results of most experiments (though not, as was recognised at the 1928 meeting, with Miller's observed seasonal effects). Today relativity is generally considered the &quot;solution&quot; to the MM null result.

The Trouton-Noble experiment is regarded as the electrostatic equivalent of the Michelson-Morley optical experiment, though whether or not it can ever be done with the necessary sensitivity is debatable. On the other hand, the 1908 Trouton-Rankine experiment that spelled the end of the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction hypothesis achieved an incredible sensitivity.

==Mathematical analysis of the Michelson Morley Experiment==

The Michelson interferometer splits light into rays that travel along two paths then recombines them. The recombined rays interfere with each other. If the path length changes in one of the arms the interference pattern will shift slightly, moving relative to the cross hairs in the telescope. The Michelson interferometer is arranged as an optical bench on a concrete block that floats on a large pool of mercury. This allows the whole apparatus to be rotated smoothly. 

If the earth were moving through an aether at the same velocity as it orbits the sun (30 km/sec) then Michelson and Morley calculated that a rotation of the apparatus should cause a shift in the fringe pattern. The basis of this calculation is given below.

[[image:relmm.gif]]

Consider the time taken &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; for light to travel along Path 1 in the illustration:

:&lt;math&gt;t_1 = \frac{L_f}{c-v} + \frac{L_f}{c+v}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_f}{c-v} + \frac{L_f}{c+v} = \frac{2L_fc}{c^2-v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

further rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2L_fc}{c^2-v^2} = \frac{2L_f}{c}\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

hence:

&lt;math&gt;t_1 = \frac{2L_f}{c}\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Considering Path 2, the light traces out two right angled triangles so:

:&lt;math&gt;ct_2 = 2 \sqrt{L_m^2 + (vt_2/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging:

:&lt;math&gt;t_2 = \frac{2L_m}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;t_2 =\frac{2L_m}{c} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is now easy to calculate the difference (&lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; between the times spent by the light in Path 1 and Path 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{L_m}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}-\frac{L_f}{1-v^2/c^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If the apparatus is rotated by 90 degrees the new time difference is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' = \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{L_m}{1-v^2/c^2}-\frac{L_f}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;L_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_f&lt;/math&gt; exchange roles. 

The interference fringes due to the time difference between the paths will be different after rotation if &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t^'&lt;/math&gt; are different. 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' - \Delta t = \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{L_m+L_f}{1-v^2/c^2}-\frac{L_f+L_m}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This difference between the two times can be calculated if the binomial expansions of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt; are used:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}= 1 + \frac{v^2}{c^2} + \left(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^2 + ....&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}= 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\left(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)^2 + ....&lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' - \Delta t \approx \frac{L_f + L_m}{c}\frac{v^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If the period of one vibration of the light is &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; then the number of fringes (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), that will move past the cross hairs of the telescope when the apparatus is rotated will be:

:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{\Delta t^' - \Delta t}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting the formula for &lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' - \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;n \approx \frac{L_f + L_m}{cT}\frac{v^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;cT&lt;/math&gt; for a light wave is the wavelength of the light ie: &lt;math&gt;cT = \lambda&lt;/math&gt; so:

:&lt;math&gt;n \approx \frac{L_f + L_m}{\lambda}\frac{v^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If the wavelength of the light is &lt;math&gt; 5 \times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; and the total path length is 20 metres then:

:&lt;math&gt;n = \left(\frac{20}{5 \times 10^{-7}}\right)10^{-8}&lt;/math&gt;

So the fringes will shift by 0.4 fringes (ie: 40%) when the apparatus is rotated.

However, no fringe shift is observed. The null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment is nowdays explained in terms of the constancy of the speed of light. The assumption that the light would have a velocity of &lt;math&gt;c-v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c+v&lt;/math&gt; depending on the direction relative to the hypothetical &quot;aether wind&quot; is false, the light always travels at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; between two points in a vacuum and the speed of light is not affected by any &quot;aether wind&quot;. This is because, in {special relativity} the Lorentz transforms induce a {length contraction}. Doing over the above calculations we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;L_f=L_m{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

(taking into consideration the length contraction)

It is now easy to recalculate the difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; between the times spent by the light in Path 1 and Path 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{L_m}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}-\frac{L_f}{1-v^2/c^2}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;L_f=L_m{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the apparatus is rotated by 90 degrees the new time difference is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' = \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{L_m}{1-v^2/c^2}-\frac{L_f}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

The interference fringes due to the time difference between the paths will be different after rotation if &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t^'&lt;/math&gt; are different. 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' - \Delta t = \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{L_m+L_f}{1-v^2/c^2}-\frac{L_f+L_m}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Wave propagation in moving medium===

To date, it is pointed out that the medium of light in Michelson-Morley experiment is the air. And the velocity of medium is zero. Therefore, 

:&lt;math&gt;t_1 = \frac{L}{c-v} + \frac{L_f}{c+v}=\frac{2L}{c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t_2=\frac{2L}{c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t=0&lt;/math&gt;

After apparatus rotated 90°, there is no interference movement. &lt;ref name=propagation&gt; The model of wave propagation in classical physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coherence length===

The coherence length of light rays from a source that has wavelengths that differ by &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;x =  \frac{\lambda^2}{2 \pi \Delta \lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

If path lengths differ by more than this amount then interference fringes will not be observed. White light has a wide range of wavelengths and interferometers using white light must have paths that are equal to within a small fraction of a millimetre for interference to occur. This means that the ideal light source for a Michelson Interferometer should be monochromatic and the arms should be as near as possible equal in length.

The calculation of the coherence length is based on the fact that interference fringes become unclear when light rays are about 60 degrees (about 1 radian or one sixth of a wavelength (&lt;math&gt;\approx 1/2\pi&lt;/math&gt;)) out of phase. This means that when two beams are:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

metres out of step they will no longer give a well defined interference pattern.  Suppose a light beam contains two wavelengths of light, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda + \Delta \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then in:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \Delta \lambda}&lt;/math&gt; 

cycles they will be &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt; out of phase.

The distance required for the two different wavelengths of light to be this much out of phase is the coherence length. Coherence length = number of cycles x  length of each cycle so:

coherence length = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda^2}{2 \pi \Delta \lambda}&lt;/math&gt; .

==Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction Hypothesis==

After the first Michelson-Morley experiments in 1881 there were several attempts to explain the null result. The most obvious point of attack is to propose that the path that is parallel to the direction of motion is contracted by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; in which case &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t^'&lt;/math&gt; would be identical and no fringe shift would occur.  This possibility was proposed in 1892 by Fitzgerald. Lorentz produced an &quot;electron theory of matter&quot; that would account for such a contraction.

Students sometimes make the mistake of assuming that the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction is equivalent to the Lorentz transformations. However, in the absence of any treatment of the time dilation effect the Lorentz-Fitgerald explanation would result in a fringe shift if the apparatus is moved between two different velocities.  The rotation of the earth allows this effect to be tested as the earth orbits the sun. Kennedy and Thorndike (1932) performed the Michelson-Morley experiment with a highly sensitive apparatus that could detect any effect due to the rotation of the earth; they found no effect. They concluded that both time dilation and Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction take place, thus confirming relativity theory.

If only the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction applied then the fringe shifts due to changes in velocity would be:  &lt;math&gt;n = (v_1^2 - v_2^2)/c^2 \times (L_f-L_m)/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Notice how the sensitivity of the experiment is dependent on the difference in path length &lt;math&gt;L_f-L_m&lt;/math&gt; and hence a long coherence length is required.

== Recent Michelson-Morley experiments ==

Optical tests of the isotropy of the speed of light have become commonplace. New technologies, including the use of lasers and masers, have significantly improved measurement precision.

=Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)=
&lt;!-- merge article ...--&gt;

== Learning objectives ==
Upon completion of this chapter, for CSS you will be able to 
* know the benefits of using CSS
* know the limitations of CSS, so you are able to find the best solution for your document
* know how to implement and use CSS on an XML document

== Introduction ==
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that describes the presentation form of a structured document. 

An XML or an HTML based document does not have a set style, but it consists of structured text without style information. How the document will look when printed on paper and viewed in a browser or maybe a cellphone is determined by a style sheet. 
A good way of making a document look consistent and easy to update is by using CSS,
which Wikipedia is a good example of.

==History of CSS==
Style sheets have been around in one form or another since the beginnings of HTML in the early 1990s. Various browsers included their own style language which could be used to customize the appearance of web documents. Originally, style sheets were targeted towards the end-user; early revisions of HTML did not provide many facilities for presentational attributes, so it was often up to the user to decide how web documents would appear.

As the HTML language grew, however, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. With these capabilities, style sheets became less important, and an external language for the purposes of defining style attributes was not widely accepted until the development of CSS.

The concept of Cascading Style Sheets was originally proposed in 1994 by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E5kon_Wium_Lie Håkon Wium Lie]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos Bert Bos] was at the time working on a browser called Argo which used its own style sheets; the two decided to work together to develop CSS.

A number of other style sheet languages had already been proposed, but CSS was the first to incorporate the idea of &quot;cascading&quot; -- the capability for a document's style to be inherited from more than one &quot;style sheet.&quot; This permitted a user's preferred style to override the site author's specified style in some areas, while inheriting, or &quot;cascading&quot; the author's style in other areas. The capability to cascade in this way permits both users and site authors added flexibility and control; it permitted a mixture of stylistic preferences.

Håkon's proposal was presented at the &quot;Mosaic and the Web&quot; conference in Chicago in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995. Around this time, the World Wide Web Consortium was being established; the W3C took an interest in the development of CSS, and organized a workshop toward that end. Håkon and Bert were the primary technical staff on the project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. By the end of 1996, CSS was nearly ready to become official. The CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December 1996.

Early in 1997, CSS was assigned its own working group within the W3C. The group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2, which was published as an official Recommendation in May 1998. CSS level 3 is still under development as of 2005.

== Why use CSS? ==

=== Cleaner Looking Code ===
A mass of HTML tags which manage design elements generally obscure the content of a page, making the code harder to read and maintain.  Using CSS, the content of the page is separated from the design, making content production in formats such as HTML, XHTML, and XML as easy as possible.
&lt;!-- Maybe include a comparison? --&gt; 

=== Pages Will Load Faster ===

Non-CSS design typically consists of more code than a CSS-designed website.

In a non-CSS design, the information about the design is reloaded every time a visitor accesses a new page.  Additionally, the finer points of design are executed awkwardly.  For example, a common method of defining the spacing of a web page is to use blank GIF images inside tables.

Using CSS keeps content and design separated, so much less code will be needed.  The CSS file loads only once per session, and is saved locally in the user's cache.  All information about dimensions is defined in this stylesheet, rendering awkward constructions like blank GIF images unnecessary.

Although an increasing amount of Internet users have broadband, the size of a web page can be important to users who are limited to dial-up connections.  Suppose a dial-up user accesses a company's website, and this visitor experiences lengthy loading times.  It is quite possible that the visitor would stop their visit or form an opinion of this company as &quot;slow.&quot;  In this way, a seemingly small difference could mean added revenue.

Furthermore, bandwidth is not free and most webhosting firms limit the amount used.  In fact, many hosts charge based on bandwidth usage, so less code could also reduce costs.

=== Redesign Becomes Trivial ===
&lt;!-- Merged from Programming:CSS, rewritten --&gt;
When used properly, CSS is a very powerful tool that gives a web architect complete control over a site's presentation.  It is a notation in which the rules of a design are governed.  This becomes very useful for a large website which requires a consistent appearance for every type of element (such as a title, a subtitle, a piece of code, or a paragraph).

For example, suppose a company has a 1,200 page website which took many months to complete.  The company then undergoes a rebranding and thus the font, the background, the style of hyperlinks, and so forth needs to be updated with the new corporate design.  If the site was engineered properly using CSS, this change would be as simple as editing the appropriate lines of a single CSS file (assuming it is an external stylesheet).  If CSS is not used, the code that manages the appearance is stored in each of the pages.  In order to update the design in this case, each file would have to be updated ''individually''.

&lt;!-- It's possible for a site to have multiple concurrent designs --&gt;

=== Graceful Degradation ===
{{Section expansion request}} &lt;!-- What's the right markup for WikiBooks? --&gt;

=== Accessibility ===
People with lowered vision or users with special web browsers, e.g. people that are blind, will probably like a CSS designed website better than one not designed using CSS.
Because CSS allows you to define the reading order separately from the visual layout it makes it easier for the special web browsers to read the page. Bear in mind that anyone who wears glasses or contact lenses can be considered to have lower vision.

Many designers lock the font size in pixels which prevents the user changing the font size. Good CSS design allows the user to increase or decrease the font size at will making pages more usable. A significant number of web surfers like to use a magnification of 300% or more.

Giving the user the opportunity to change the font size will not make any difference for the normal user, but it can make a difference for people that have lowered vision.
Ask yourself the question: who is the website made for? The visitors or the designer?

Websites designed with CSS tend to display better than table-based designs in the web browsers used in PDAs and cellphones. The use of cellphones for browsing will probably continue to increase. A table-based design will make web pages inaccessible to these users.

Be careful with your CSS designs. Misuse of absolute positioning and absolute rather than relative sizes can make your webpages less accessible rather than more accessible. A good table design is better than a bad CSS design.

=== Better results in search engines ===
Extensive use of tables confuses the search engines, they can actually get problems separating content from code. The search engine robots start reading on the top of the page, and they want to find out how relevant the webpage is as fast as possible.
Again, less code will make it easier for the search engines to find code that's relevant, and it will probably give your webpage a better ranking.

== Disadvantages of CSS ==
The use of CSS for styling has few disadvantages.
However some browsers, especially older ones, will sometimes present the page incorrectly.
When I was gathering information for this chapter it became clear to me that many experts think that formatting XML with CSS is not the future of the web. The main view is that XSL will be the new standard. So make sure you read through the previous chapter of this book one more time.
The formatting parts of XSL and CSS will be quite similar. For
example, you will be able to use all CSS1 and CSS2 properties and
values in XSL with the same meaning as in CSS.

== CSS levels ==
The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published in December 1996. Among its capabilities is support for:

* Typeface|Font properties such as typeface and emphasis
* Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements
* Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
* alignment (typesetting)|Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements
* Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
* Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes

The W3C maintains the [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1 CSS1 Recommendation].

CSS level 2 was developed by the W3C and published as a Recommendation in May 1998. A superset of CSS1, CSS2 includes a number of new capabilities, among them the absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows. The W3C maintains the [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/ CSS2 Recommendation].

CSS level 2 revision 1 or CSS 2.1 fixes errors in CSS2, removes poorly-supported features and adds already-implemented browser extensions to the specification. It's currently a [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/ Candidate Recommendation].

CSS level 3 is currently under development. The W3C maintains a [http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#table CSS3 progress report].

== CSS Syntax and Properties ==
*The section on selectors has moved to [[CSS Programming/Selectors]].
*The section on color has moved to [[CSS Programming/Color]].
*The section on text has moved to [[CSS Programming/Fonts and Text]].
*The section on borders has moved to [[CSS Programming/Box Model]].
*The section on positioning has moved to [[CSS Programming/Positioning]].

The following section contains a list of some of the most common CSS properties. A complete list can be found [http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/properties.html here].
The syntax for the use of CSS in an XML document is the same as that for HTML.
The difference is in how you link your CSS file to the XML document.
To do this you have to write &lt;code&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;''X.css''&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
before the root element of your XML document, where ''X.css'' of course is the name of the CSS file.

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, CSS is a set of rules that determines how elements in a document will be shown. The rule has two parts: a selector and a group of one or more declarations surrounded by braces (curly brackets): 

::selector { declaration; ...} 

The selector is normally the tag you wish to style. Here is an example of a simple rule containing a single declaration:&lt;br&gt;
::h1 { color: red; } 
Result: All h1-elements in the document are shown with the text color red.
=== The general syntax ===
Rules are usually defined like this:
::selector { declaration; ...} 
The declaration is formed like this:
::property: value;
Remember that there can be several declarations in one rule. A common mistake is to mix up colons, which separate the property and value of a declaration, and semicolons, which separate declarations.
A selector chooses the elements for which the rule applies and
the declaration sets the value for the different properties of the elements that are chosen.

Back to our example:
::h1 { color: red; }

In our example:

::selector is the element h1 
:: declaration color: red 
The property ''color'' gets the value ''red ''

Multiple declarations can be written either on a single line or over several lines, because whitespace collapses:

::h1 { color:red; background-color:white; }

or

::h1 {
::::color:red;
::::background-color:white;
::}

Details of the properties defined by CSS can be found at [[CSS Programming#CSS1 Properties]].

== Summary ==
'''Cascading Style Sheets''' (CSS), are used with webpages to define the view of information saved in HTML or XML. While XML and HTML create and preserve a documents structure, CSS is used to define the appearance and placement of objects within the document as well as its content. All of this information is saved in a separate file, the .css file. In the CSS file are textsize, background color, text types, e.g defined. The placement of pictures and other animations are also defined in the css file. If CSS is used correctly it would make a webpage a lot easier to create and even more important, to maintain. Because you will only have to make changes in the css file to make the whole website change.

== Date ==

===  Add months to a date value ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
if  day[P3F1] &gt; day[last.day[(P3F1 + (P3F2 * (365 / 12)))]]
then  date[day[last.day[(P3F1 + (P3F2 * (365 / 12)))]];
month[(P3F1 + (P3F2 * (365 / 12)))];
year[(P3F1 + (P3F2 * (365 / 12)))]]
else  date[day[P3F1];((((month[P3F1] + P3F2) -1) // 12) + 1);
(year[P3F1] + (P3F2 / 12))]
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P3F1 = Original Date
P3F2 = Month to Add

This formula equals day of month specified by # of months to add; however, if
day of month is &gt; destination month, then it is equal to the last day of the
destination month.

You could also add an the actual number of months in replace of P3F2.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Calculate age to the month ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
if  month[today] &gt; month[P#F#]
then  (year[today] - year[P#F#])
else  ((year[today] - year[P#F#]) - 1)
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = date field

Used to determine age to the month.  With this formula, a person is not another
year older until after the birthday month.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Calculate age to the year.  (Estimated Calculation) ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
((today - P#F#) / 365.25)
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = Birthdate Field

Used to determine age to the year.  Note: This formula may incorrectly state a
person's age if the date is within a week of birthdate.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Calculate Exact Age to the day.  (Most Accurate) ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
if  P#F# = 0
then  0
else  month[today] cases
case cv &lt; month[P#F#] of year[today] - year[P#F#] - 1      endof
case cv &gt; month[P#F#] of year[today] - year[P#F#]          endof
case cv = month[P#F#] of  if  day[today] &lt; day[P#F#]
then  year[today] - year[P#F#] - 1
else  year[today] - year[P#F#]
endif                               endof
endcases
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = Birthdate Field

Used to determine age to the year.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Convert date to numeric field (without dashes) ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
convert[&quot;N999999&quot;;
cat.c[substring[apply.format[&quot;N9999&quot;;year[P#F#]];3;2];
apply.format[&quot;N99&quot;;month[P#F#]];
apply.format[&quot;N99&quot;;day[P#F#]]]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = D99/99/9999 field.

This formula concatenates the year (only the last two digits), month, and day
into a numeric (N999999) field with no dashes or hyphens.  For example, 11/19/92
would appear as 921119.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Convert date to words and numbers ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
cat.c[
day.of.week[P#F#] cases
case cv = 1 of &quot;Monday&quot;    endof
case cv = 2 of &quot;Tuesday&quot;   endof
case cv = 3 of &quot;Wednesday&quot; endof
case cv = 4 of &quot;Thursday&quot;  endof
case cv = 5 of &quot;Friday&quot;    endof
case cv = 6 of &quot;Saturday&quot;  endof
case cv = 7 of &quot;Sunday&quot;    endof
endcases;
&quot;, &quot;;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
Formula to convert date text to date. The formula will convert the date in an
alpha field to a Julian date.  A date entered in the alpha field such as :
November 19, 1992 would appear in the date field as 11/19/1992.  A subset of the
month would also work, such as Nov 19, 1992.  Optionally, the user may enter Nov
1992 and the formula will assume the first day of the month.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Extract last two digits from date field ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
convert[&quot;N99&quot;;substring[apply.format[&quot;DYMD99/99/99&quot;;today];1;2]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
Use this formula on an N99 field to obtain the last two digits of the current
year.  To extract this from a date field, substitute the selected field for
TODAY in the apply.format function.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Find leap year ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
if (year[P1F1] // 4) = 0 then &quot;Leap&quot; else &quot;not Leap&quot; endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P1F1 = Date field.

If the year is divisible by 400 (without a remainder) then the formula will
return the word &quot;Leap&quot; meaning that it is a leap year; otherwise, the formula
will return &quot;not Leap&quot; meaning that it is not a leap year.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Reverse date sort ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
-today
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
The reverse date is used to sort records backwards so that the oldest date sorts
to the bottom of a list and the most recent date sorts to the top.  The formula
is simply a minus sign (-) in front of a date field that has been selected in a
formula.  (Ie. -P1F1 if P1F1 is a date field.)

The reverse date can be useful for reports and for sorting records for display
in a window.  The field (format G-ZZZZ9) containing the formula is generally
hidden so as to avoid end-user confusion.  Do not forget the negative sign on
the field format, or you will lose the inverse sort if you have to export and
import records.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== IF THEN ==

===  Example of nesting IF statements ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
if  P1F5 &lt; 12
then  &quot;Good Morning&quot;
else if  P1F5 &gt;= 12 and P1F5 &lt;= 17
then  &quot;Good Afternoon&quot;
else  &quot;Good Evening&quot;
endif
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
The IF statement assigns specific answers for specific conditions.

The Syntax:
IF condition
THEN expression
[ELSE expression]
ENDIF

Using the above syntax as an IF statement, any part of the formula within
brackets [] is optional, A condition is a limited expression (in other words, it
can only be an expression that produces either a true statement (1) or a false
statement (0)).

The following rules apply to the IF statement:
The condition must be true or false
If the condition listed is 1 (true), then the expression following
THEN is calculated by DataPerfect.
If the condition is 0 (false), then the expresssion following ELSE is
calculated.
If there is not an ELSE, a new value is not returned.

P1F1 in the example above is a time field defined as TZ9:99.  A data in a time
field is stored in military time.

The statement above says, if the value in P1F1 is less than 12:00pm then insert
the expression Good Morning.  Otherwise if the value in P1F1 is greater than
12:00pm and less than 5:00pm (or in the range of these two times) then insert
the expression of Good Afternoon.  Otherwise if the value in the time field is
less then 12:00pm then insert the expression &quot;Good Morning&quot;

Every IF statement must use ENDIF at the end of the formula.  For every
occurrence of an IF there must be a matching ENDIF and the end of the formula.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Numeric ==

===  Extracting decimals. ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;##&gt; // 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;##&gt; = a numeric value with a decimal.

This formula returns the decimal portion of the number.  Example: If &lt;##&gt;
contains the number 7.5476 the formula returns .5476.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Reverse digit orders. ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
convert[&quot;N999&quot;;
cat.t[substring[apply.format[&quot;N999&quot;;P#F#];3;1];
substring[apply.format[&quot;N999&quot;;P#F#];2;1];
substring[apply.format[&quot;N999&quot;;P#F#];1;1]]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P1F1 = N999 formatted field.

This formula reverses the order of data within a numeric field.
Example:  201 becomes 102
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Round up to the nearest nickel. ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
round[P#F#+.02;.05]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = G or H formatted value.

Rounds field value up to the nearest nickel.

Example: 80.21 becomes 80.25, 80.26 becomes 80.30, 80.20 becomes 80.20.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Sum field value for records in a report. ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
rv# + P#F#
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = Field to be totaled.
rv#  = Report Variable wherein the formula is contained.

Report Variable # should be defined in the Report Body of the report.  This
variable will add the current value in rv# to the value in the field and store
the results back into rv#.  This is useful when a total of a field is needed for
performing math functions in the Final Footer of the report.

Note: A couple of variations of this formula include the following:

rv# + 1   -- Counts the number of records in the report.

rv# = &quot;Ü&quot; -- Appends bars together.  Using this in a sub-report or with a
two-level footer can cause a bar-graph effect; just be careful to store a blank
(&quot; &quot;) in the First Page Header (or Two-Level Header) to start the bar over again
for the next sub-group.
&lt;/pre&gt;

case cv = &quot;U&quot; of &quot;U&quot; endof
default &quot; &quot;
endcases
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = the field with the formula.

Allows users to enter a limited range of data even when the range is not
sequential.  For example, in a gender field you only want an M or an F; but
since M and F are not next to each other in the alphabet you cannot set a
regular range check allowing only those two letters.  This formula will allow
only an M or F to be entered into the field.  In the case statement you are
allowing a &quot;Y&quot; for yes, an &quot;N&quot; for no, or a &quot;U&quot; for &quot;Unknown.&quot;  ::M can be added
to the formula field's format to make entry of one of the choices mandatory.

P1F2 = Alpha Numeric Account Number

This formula extracts only those records which are dated 11/16/92 or later,
except for those which are dated 11/20/92, and also have account numbers less
than 170000 or greater than 180000, but less than 900000.

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = field to search.
rv#  = report variable prompted for.

Create a prompt for report variable that requests a value to search for or an
asterisk (*) for all records.  If a literal value is entered then DataPerfect
will return all matching records, but if an asterisk is entered then all records
will be printed.

Do not use a formula that reads P#F#=RV# instead of the contains function as
DataPerfect will then look for an asterisk in the field contents.  Using the
contains[P#F#;rv#] tells the report to consider the asterisk a wildcard; and,
therefore, to find all records.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Search for a wildcard character (* or ?). ===

'''Description'''

&lt;pre&gt;
contains[P#F#;&quot;|%$%*%&quot;]

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = Alphanumeric Field.

Searches for an &quot;*&quot; in the field.

Note: You can temporarily change the wildcard characters for contains functions.
The pipe (|) indicates to DataPerfect that there will be a change.  The next
character represents the asterisk replacement and the third character represents
the question mark replacement. In this example % = * and $ = ?.

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = Postal code field.

This formula is designed to check the data entered in a Canadian postal code
field.  It confirms that the correct sequence of characters is entered in the
field.  (For example, A#A #A# where A = an alpha character and # equals a
numeric value.  Notice that there is a space between the two sets of three
characters.)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = the field that the text string is in.

This formula will uppercase the first character of every word for the first five
words in a text string.  After the fifth word it will append the remaining text
back onto the end of the string.  If you wish to increase the number of words
that at capitalized then you will need to add another repetition of the
&quot;apply.format...&quot; string.  This needs to come before the final substring
function set.  The third argument of the subfield function needs to increase by
one for each repetition.  Also a change would need to be made to the last line
of the above formula to read &quot;+ #&quot; where # equals the number of words that you
are changing and &quot;40&quot; equals the field length.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Capitalize the first letter of a field. ===

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = A30 field

This formula changes the first letter to uppercase and then appends the rest of
the field contents.  The first letter, if it is not already uppercase, will not
become uppercase until [Tab] is pressed to move off the current field (numbers
will be unchanged).  Arg3 in the substring code should be equal to one less than
the field length.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Determine Country. ===

endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = Alphanumeric field wherein a ZIP/postal code is stored.  (A U10 works
nicely.)

Determines if the first character of the code is an alpha character.  If it is,
then the country is Canada; otherwise it is USA.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Dot Leaders. ===

&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = As long as you want as long as there are more than enough dots
concatenated onto the end that you don't run out when you print/display the
contents of the field.

This formula concatenates the string in P#F# with a dot leader.  If the contents
of P#F# has an odd number of characters in it then there will be two spaces
between the string and the dots, otherwise there will only be one space.  (Note:
This is accomplished by not putting a semicolon (;) after the &quot;endif&quot; end before
the dots.)

This formula converts a numeric field to text using apply.format and then
extracts the area code only using the substring function.
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Remove leading blanks from an alphanumeric field ===

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
P#F# = A40 field.

This formula is used in a report variable in the report body of a report.  It is
used to correct data that has been incorrectly entered by adding blanks to the
beginning of a string.  The formula simply takes the string in P1F1 and
truncates and leading blanks.  This report variable should then be stored back
into the field from whence it came.
&lt;/pre&gt;

divide the value by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Convert military to regular time (string format). ===

'''Notes about the formula'''

&lt;pre&gt;
This formula needs to be entered on an alphanumeric i.e. A7 field.

P#F# = Time Field (TZ9:99)

If the time field is zero it is 12:00am.  (Time fields store their values as the
total number of seconds since 12 midnight.)  If the time entered is over 12:00
hours, it will subtract 12 hours from the time and add &quot;pm&quot; to the displayed
time.  (Eg. 13:00 is converted to 1:00pm, 14:00 is converted to 2:00pm, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Today, Web site Design is a very important part of current Graphic Design. The Eight C's of web design are basic things to keep in mind while designing web sites. These eight tips could also apply to other parts of Graphic design.
==Eight C's of website design==
*Context - Aesthetic and functional look and feel - contemporary, traditional, hip, edgy, utilitarian, emotional -- the &quot;how&quot; of site design. Color, humor, focus, graphics.
*Content - Any digital subject matter on the site: text, video, audio, and graphics -- the &quot;what&quot; of site design.
*Community - A feeling of membership in a group and a strong sense of involvement; shared common interests -- the &quot;why&quot; of site design.
*Customization - The site's ability to tailor itself to a user or to be personalized by each user -- the &quot;touch&quot; of site design.
*Communication - Dialog between the site and the user -- the &quot;muscle&quot; of site design.
*Connection - Extent of formal linkages between the site and other sites -- the networking of site design. This is becoming very important as people are becoming more comfortable with using web sites to gather information and make purchases.
*Commerce - The actual sale of goods and services on the site -- the commerce of site design. If the primary focus of the web site is to sell, this becomes paramount to the design.
*Color - Colors should be chosen to properly inspire feelings in a viewer. For example, a law firm that wants to set a trusting tone may use dark blues. Text must also contrast with background for easy reading.

Contains searches alphanumeric and text fields for a specified string.  Arg1 is the field/rv/string to be searched and arg2 is the string to be searched for.  Returns the integer 1 if the search is successful or a 0 if it is not.  Strings to be searched for should be enclosed in quotes if a hard-coded string; otherwise search strings may come from report variables or fields.  Wild cards (asterisks or question marks) may be used to find strings within text in a field, otherwise the string searched for will have to be the only thing in the field.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|
''Example''
|
If P1F1 = an alphanumeric or text field and &quot;*sold*&quot; is the search string, then contains[P1F1;&quot;*sold*&quot;] will return a 1 (true) if the string &quot;sold&quot; exists anywhere in P1F1 or 0 (false) if it does not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I like this book idea, this is something that I might be able to help with, unlike most of the other subjects. My background is in network engineering, but I must admit that I have only designed a few data centers, and they were not big and serious like what you are listing here. 

I have observed this done wrong; once a client had their racks installed so close to the wall that we couldnt easily get behind the racks to deal with the (never ending) cable hassles.

I found a $50 portable label machine to be my best friend. I like to tape a copy of the network map right onto the wall, and have a pencil (with eraser) velcro'ed to it. I encourage others to &quot;write on the map any time&quot;, and we occasionally update it. The map has the file path listed (not a URL of course) on it. &quot;revised [date]&quot; is below the title of every map.

I'm more of the networking guy than a contractor that does this type of work, but let me know if there is anything somebody like me can add to this book. note, I have not read thru it fully.

Definately remind the reader that documentation is &quot;billable hours&quot;, so they are financially modivated to do what we are notorious for putting off. I like to tell clients &quot;if I do my job correctly, I can get hit by a bus and my office can burn down, and you will have most of the information you need already documented by me, you will not discover after the fact that it's all stored in my head and what you have is obsolete. Therefore you will see me take time to document things. Computer folks are notorious for procrastinating when it comes to documenting a constantly changing network&quot;


--------------------------

Please, have at it!  One of the largest parts of the book is the organization and documentation sections.

== Making jams and jellies ==

A jam is a fruit conserve in which sugar and fruit chunks are boiled together. In a jelly, the juice is pressed or boiled out of the fruit, filtered and then boiled again with sugar to reduce and thicken it. It is important to keep in mind that some fruits are better for making jellies and others are better used in jams.  Generally speaking, it's easier to make a jam than it is to make a jelly.

== Recipe for Jam ==

Ingredients:
*a good quantity of soft, fleshy fruit like strawberries, peaches, cherries, plums, blueberries, brambles
*1 cup of sugar or sugar with added [[cookbook:pectin|pectin]] every 2 cups of fruit. 3 cups for bitter or sour fruits.
*1/4 cup of lemon juice or less
*1/2 teaspoon of butter

Instructions:
Clean the fruit, remove any stones, leaves or other incomestible parts, and wash it. If the fruit is not a small berry, then cut it up into small pieces. Crush the fruit.

Sprinkle the fruit with lemon juice and butter and stir well. After this, pour the mixture into a sufficiently large cooking pot. Traditionally a copper pot is used, but any other cooking pot will do fine. Bring the mixture slowly to the boil on a full rolling boil, stirring regularly. Pour in sugar. Depending on the fruit, you will need to boil the mixture for about an hour. The jam is ready when it is thick enough. Check this by pouring a drop of the jam onto a cold plate. It should turn sticky and not be too runny.

To preserve the jam well, you should pour it into glass flasks or containers that have been sterilized by boiling them in water. You can also pasteurize the containers by washing them with boiling water. The inside of lids as well as the flasks should be washed if the latter method is used. The jam should be poured rapidly into the still-hot containers. The containers should be sealed with lids. In this case it's best to let the air bubble that is in the flask traverse the still-hot jam by turning it upside-down after the lid has been placed on. This is to disinfect the air bubble. Or, instead of a lid, the jam can be protected by pouring molten paraffin on top of it, and closing of the jar with a paper that is held with a rubber band.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several spectroscopic techniques which can be used to identify organic molecules: infrared (IR), mass spectroscopy (MS) UV/visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

IR, NMR and UV/vis spectroscopy are based on observing the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by molecules. MS is based on measuring the mass of the molecule and any fragments of the molecule which may be produced in the MS instrument.

==UV/Visible Spectroscopy==
UV/Vis Spectroscopy uses ultraviolet and/or visible light to examine the electronic properties of molecules.  Irradiating a molecule with UV or Visible light of a specific wavelength can cause the electrons in a molecule to transition to an excited state.  This technique is most useful for analyzing molecules with conjugated systems or carbonyl bonds.

==NMR Spectroscopy==
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most useful analytical techniques for determining the structure of an organic compound. There are two main types of NMR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR (Proton NMR) and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR (Carbon NMR). NMR is based on the fact that the nuclei of atoms have a quantized property called spin. When a magnetic field is applied to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nucleus, the nucleus can align either with (spin +1/2) or against (spin -1/2) the applied magnetic field.

These two states have different potential energies and the energy difference depends on the strength of the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field about a nucleus, however, depends on the chemical environment around the nucleus. For example, the negatively charged electrons around and near the nucleus can shield the nucleus from the magnetic field, lowering the strength of the effective magnetic field felt by the nucleus. This, in turn, will lower the energy needed to transition between the +1/2 and -1/2 states. Therefore, the transition energy will be lower for nuclei attached to electron donating groups (such as alkyl groups) and higher for nuclei attached to electron withdrawing groups (such as a hydroxyl group).

In an NMR machine, the compound being analyzed is placed in a strong magnetic field and irradiated with radio waves to cause all the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei to occupy the higher energy -1/2 state. As the nuclei relax back to the +1/2 state, they release radio waves corresponding to the energy of the difference between the two spin states. The radio waves are recorded and analyzed by computer to give an intensity versus frequency plot of the sample. This information can then be used to determine the structure of the compound.




'''Aromatics in H-NMR'''
'''Electron Donating Groups vs. Electron Withdrawing Groups'''

On monosubstituted rings, electron donating groups resonate at high chemical shifts.  Electron donating groups increase the electron density by releasing electrons into a reaction center, thus stabilizing the carbocation.  An example of an electron donating group is methyl (-CH3).

Accordingly, electron withdrawing groups are represented at low chemical shifts.  Electron withdrawing groups pull electrons away from a reacting center.  This can stabilize an electron rich carbanion. Some examples of electron withdrawing groups are halogens (-Cl, -F) and carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Looking at the H NMR spectrum of ethyl benzene, we see that the methyl group is the most electron withdrawing, so it appears at the lowest chemical shift.  The aromatic phenyl group is the most electron donating, so it has the highest chemical shift.

'''Disubstituted Rings'''

The sum of integrated intensity values for the entire aromatic region shows how many substituents are attached to the ring, so a total value of 4 indicates that the ring has 2 substituents.  When a benzene ring has two substituent groups, each exerts an influence on following substitution reactions. The site at which a new substituent is introduced depends on the orientation of the existing groups and their individual directing effects.  For a disubstituted benzene ring, there are three possible NMR patterns.

Note that para-substituted rings usually show two symmetric sets of peaks that look like doublets.  

The order of these peaks is dependent on the nature of the two substituents.  For example, the three NMR spectra of chloronitrobenzene isomers are below:

=Mass Spectroscopy=

A mass spectroscope measures the exact mass of ions, relative to the charge.  Many times, some form of seperation is done beforehand, enabling a spectrum to be collected on a relatively pure sample.  An organic sample can be introduced into a mass spectroscope and ionised.  This also breaks some molecules into smaller fragments.

The resulting mass spectrum shows:

1) The heaviest ion is simply the ionised molecule itself. We can simply record its mass.

2) Other ions are fragments of the molecule and give information about its structure. Common fragments are:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''species'''
|'''formula'''
|'''mass'''
|-
|methyl
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|15
|-
|ethyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|29
|-
|phenyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|77
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=Infrared spectroscopy.=



Absorbing infrared radiation makes covalent bonds vibrate. Different types of bond absorb different wavelengths of infrared:
 
Instead of wavelength, infrared spectroscopists record the wavenumber; the number of waves that fit into 1 cm. (This is easily converted to the energy of the wave.)

For some reason the spectra are recorded backwards (from 4000 to 500 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is typical), often with a different scale below 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (to see the fingerprint region more clearly) and upside-down (% radiation transmitted is recorded instead of the absorbance of radiation).

The wavenumbers of the absorbed IR radiation are characteristic of many bonds, so IR spectroscopy can determine which functional groups are contained in the sample.  For example, the carbonyl (C=O) bond will absorb at 1650-1760cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Typical method ==

&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Infrared_spectroscopy|Wikipedia article.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IR_spectroscopy_apparatus.svg|thumbnail|centre|400px|Typical apparatus]]

A beam of infra-red light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. 

A reference is used for two reasons:
*This prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data

*This allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in).

The '''second derivative''', or second order derivative, is the derivative of the derivative of a function.  The derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; may be denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and its double (or &quot;second&quot;) derivative is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is read as &quot;f double prime of x,&quot; or &quot;The second derivative of f(x).&quot; Because the derivative of function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a function representing the slope of function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the double derivative is the function representing the slope of the first derivative function.

Furthermore, the '''third derivative''' is the derivative of the derivative of the derivative of a function, which can be represented by &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is read as &quot;''f'' triple prime of ''x''&quot;, or &quot;The third derivative of ''f''(''x'')&quot;. This can continue as long as the resulting derivative is itself differentiable, with the fourth derivative, the fifth derivative, and so on. Any derivative beyond the '''first derivative''' can be referred to as a '''higher order derivative'''.

==Notation==

Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; be a function in terms of ''x''.  The following are notations for higher order derivatives.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!2nd Derivative
!3rd Derivative
!4th Derivative
!''n''th Derivative
!Notes
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;f^{(4)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|Probably the most common notation.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3 f}{dx^3}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^4 f}{dx^4}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n f}{dx^n}&lt;/math&gt;
|Leibniz notation.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \left[ f(x) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3}{dx^3} \left[ f(x) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^4}{dx^4} \left[ f(x) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n}{dx^n} \left[ f(x) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|Another form of Leibniz notation.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;D^2f&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;D^3f&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;D^4f&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;D^nf&lt;/math&gt;
|Euler's notation.
|}

'''Warning''': You should not write &lt;math&gt;f^{n} (x)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate the nth derivative, as this is easily confused with the quantity &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; all raised to the nth power.

The Leibniz notation, which is useful because of its precision, follows from

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{df}{dx}\right) = \frac{d^2 f}{dx^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[w:Newton's notation|Newton's dot notation]] extends to the second derivative, &lt;math&gt;\ddot y&lt;/math&gt;, but typically no further in the applications where this notation is common.

==Examples==

'''Example 1:'''

 Find the third derivative of &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 4x^5 + 6x^3 + 2x + 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''x''.

Repeatedly apply the [[Calculus/Differentiation/Differentiation Defined#The_Power_Rule|Power Rule]] to find the derivatives.

* &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 20x^4 + 18x^2 + 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f''(x) = 80x^3 + 36x \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f'''(x) = 240x^2 + 36 \ &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 2:'''

 Find the third derivative of &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 12\sin x + \frac{1}{x+2} + 2x \ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''x''.

* &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = 12\cos x - \frac{1}{(x+2)^2} + 2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f''(x) = -12\sin x + \frac{2}{(x+2)^3} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f'''(x) = -12\cos x - \frac{6}{(x+2)^4} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Applications:'''

For applications of the second derivative in finding a curve's concavity and points of inflection, see &quot;[[Calculus/Extrema and Points of Inflection|Extrema and Points of Inflection]]&quot; and &quot;[[Calculus/Extreme Value Theorem|Extreme Value Theorem]]&quot;.

'''Sanskrit''' is an ancient language of the Indo-European family, from which is descended many languages found in northern India.  The language is also known as 'devabhaashaa' (language of the gods) or 'devavaani' (voice of the gods). Since the 10th century CE, Sanskrit has been primarily written in the Devanaagari script, but it is common for the language to be printed or written in Indian vernacular scripts.
The word Sanskrit is derived from the word 'samyak kritam' meaning &quot;polished&quot; or &quot;perfectly done&quot;.  The earliest form of Sanskrit is known as Vedic Sanskrit and was spoken by the people of India at he second millennium BCE.  Classical Sanskrit, mostly associated with religion, philosophy, and literature, emerged later in the 5th century BCE after PaaNini's extensive grammar codified the language.

Sanskrit has a rich literary tradition whose most famous poet and playwright is '''Kaalidaasa''', mostly known for his compositions '''''Meghadutam, Kumaarasambhavam, Abhijnaanasakuntalam,'' and ''Raghuvamsam'''''. The Vedaas are written in the Sanskrit language and are the roots of Vedic culture. They are considered to be a collection of great knowledge and spiritual puissance.
Now Samskrita Bharati an NGO has  taken initiative to popularize this language.{{BookCat}}</text>

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.10: Das Fest&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

This lesson deals with the Christmas time in the German language countries, where you learn some traditions and vocabularies about Christmas.
You'll also learn about &quot;there is&quot; and &quot;there are&quot; in German and about the dative case.

==Dialogue==
Read and listen to the following dialogue between mother and daughter: Roswitha and Anja. Both of them want to decorate for Christmas.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Dialogue|Decoration|Dekoration|134|2}}

*The English words ''there is'' and ''there are'' are both in German ''es gibt''. When you ask someone, if there's a snowman, you say '''Gibt es hier einen Schneemann?'''. Many German native speaker put the words '''gibt''' and '''es''' into '''gibt's'''.

==Weihnachten in Deutschland==

In Germany the advent season begins on Sunday four weeks before Christmas.
It's the day where many families decorate their houses or flats, begin to bake some biscuits and start to sing some Christmas carols.
One typical decoration is the advent wreath, which has four candles - one candle is lit in the first week, two candles in the second week, etc. - and normally stands on the dining table or on the coffee table.
Another tradition, especially for children, is the advent calendar that you hang on the wall. They've often got 24 doors and you're only allowed to open one a day.
Other typical Christmas decorations are a crib, a Räuchermann - a wooden figure that blows flavour of incense cones - in Northern Germany a Moosmann, Christmas pyramids and Schwibbogen and nutcrackers and poinsettias and much more.
Most Christmas markets start in the first week of Advent. There you can buy some little Christmas presents, decorations, ride some carnival rides, and often drink some hot spiced wine - the children drink punch for children, listen to carolers and enjoy a warm, snowy atmosphere.
On the 6th of December, German children celebrate St. Nicholas Day. The children put a boot in front of the door and wait until St. Nicholas brings little presents that are often sweets, walnuts, apples, tangerines and oranges. Bad children get birching by Knecht Ruprecht (which is now forbidden in Germany).
Pupils do a secret Santa with other pupils on the last school days before the Christmas holidays, which are often two or three weeks long.
St. Nicholas looks similar to Santa Claus who brings big presents on the evening of the 24th of December; in Southern Germany Christkind brings the presents.
Most families decorate their Christmas trees on this day with Christmas baubles and tinsel and candles and so forth.
After the Christmas dinner, the whole family sits next to the Christmas tree and exchanges gifts.

== To Do ==
This is a just a general list of things to work on or ideas to consider. Feel free to add, comment, or strike out items from the list.
* Customizing the Firefox interface
* feature set and differences between IE - perhaps this can help? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_Mozilla_Firefox]
* maybe we could add tips to make it more 'book-like'? does a tip box type thing exist in wikibooks?
* possibly organize our categories (mouse shortcuts could be merged w/ keyboard shortcuts)
: Very good idea--[[User:Midnightcomm|Midnightcomm]] 17:39, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
* external links - forums, extension/theme links, help
* plugins
* useful extensions - we can't expect a user to wade through hundreds of extensions
* safe-mode
* separate profiles
* pop-up blocking
* more images
* possibly a FAQ? (how to block ads, single window mode, change key combinations)?
* theme info

== Keyboard shortcut changes ==

For 1.0 PR some keyboard shortcuts will be changing:

* Download manager, Windows &amp; Mac OS X: Ctrl+J
* Download manager, Unix: none
* Web search, All platforms: Ctrl+K

Keyboard shortcuts:

Updated the main document since 1.0 PR's release. Page Info no longer seems to have a keyboard shortcut. Need confirmation from Mac OS X and Linux users that Backspace for Back and Shift+Backspace for Forward are Windows-only. Confirmation of other platform-specific keyboard shortcuts would be nice.

Perhaps a two-dimensional table with one column per OS would be better?

When you press the update extensions button, does it update extensions that you downloaded from sites other than mozilla update?  if i download one from extensionsmirror.nl or from a private website, does it get updated, too? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 20:10, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== The ultimate adblock.txt file ==

We should have an &quot;ultimate adblock.txt&quot; file here, in the style of this thread:  http://aasted.org/adblock/viewtopic.php?t=45 It should remove everything commonly considered ads, but not have any false positives.  Suitable for someone just installing Firefox for the first time.  A wiki is perfect for this because people can correct each other's bad entries (which will give false positives) and compress several entries into one with regular expressions.

We can start it off with something like this:

 [Adblock]
 *.ad.*
 */Banner/*
 */ad/*
 */adclick/* 
 *doubleclick.net* 

I think a better starting point would be http://www.pierceive.com/
It seems to be the best filter set available, and closest to an &quot;ultimate filter list&quot; (minus filters for certain things like trackers). Best to start with that and create a list of filters to be added in append mode.

Keep this quote in mind:

:''&quot;The idea of compiling the ultimate filter list is appealing, but may present problems. The reason for this is that Adblock works by matching the address of every blockable object against every filter in the list. In algorithmic terms, this scales as O(M*N).''

:''This is actually not a very effective way of doing it, but it's necessary because of the use of filters instead of just blacklisting certain servers, and as long as the list is kept small most of us will never notice any delays.''

:''What I'm trying to say is that compiling a huge list of every ad-directory on every server on the planet will scale extremely badly. The idea of creating a &quot;beginner's list&quot; is very good, though, but should perhaps be limited to containing very generic filters (*/ads/*, *doubleclick*, etc). At the moment, every filter-list should be adapted to the needs of the individual user and his surfing habits.&quot;''

We should point it out to that thread after it gets started, too. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:31, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I've hosted a pretty basic adblock file that was originally posted on TotalFark, and which I've improved slightly.

== 1.5 release? ==

Perhaps any new information should use the 1.5 RC or the latest nightlies instead of 1.0x, so that it won't need to be converted to reflect the new release.

There's a ton of information on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox Firefox in Wikipedia]. In fact, it's even been on the main page as a feature article. Most of it is encyclopedic information that won't be pertinent in a wikibook, but some things like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_Mozilla_Firefox Features of Firefox] will be very helpful. Some other things that we could use is history of Firefox and general tidbits of background information that would make this wikibook more complete.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Serial Programming}}

Just about every idea for communicating between computers involves &quot;data packets&quot;, especially when more than 2 computers are involved.

The idea is very similar to putting a check in an envelope to mail to the electricity company.
We take the data (the &quot;check&quot;) we want to send to a particular computer,
and we place it inside an &quot;envelope&quot; that includes the address of that particular computer.

A packet of data starts with a preamble, some address information, some other transmission-related information, followed by the raw data, and finishes up with a few more bytes of transmission-related error-detection information -- often a [[Wikipedia: Fletcher's checksum| Fletcher-32]] [[Wikipedia: checksum | checksum]].
We will talk more about what we do with this error-detection information in the next chapter, [[Serial Programming/Error Correction Methods]].

The accountant at the electricity company throws away the envelope when she gets the check.
She already knows the address of her own company. Does this mean the &quot;overhead&quot; of the envelope is useless ? No.

In a similar way, once a computer receives a packet, it immediately throws away the preamble. If the computer sees that the packet is addressed to itself, and has no errors, then it discards the wrapper and keeps the data.

Unfortunately, there are dozens of slightly different, incompatible protocols for data packets, because people pick slightly different ways to represent the address information and the error-detection information.

... gateways between incompatible protocols ...

=== Packet size tradeoffs ===

Protocol designers pick a maximum and minimum packet size based on many tradeoffs.
* packets should be &quot;small&quot; to prevent one transmitter transmitting a long packet from hogging the network.
* packets should be &quot;small&quot; so that a single error can be corrected by retransmitting one small packet rather than one large packet.
* packets should be &quot;large&quot; so more time is spent transmitting good data and less time is spent on overhead (preamble, header, footer, postamble, and between-packet gap).
* the packet header and trailing footer should be short, to reduce overhead.
* the footer should hold a large error-detection codeword field, because a shorter codeword is more likely to incorrectly accept an error-riddled packet (we discuss error-detection in more detail in the next chapter, [[../Error Correction Methods/|../Error Correction Methods/]]).
* making the packet header a little longer, so that meaningful fields fall on byte or word boundaries, rather than highly encoded bit fields, makes it easier for a CPU to interpret them, allowing lower-cost network hardware.
* making the packet header a little longer -- instead of a single error-detection field that covers the whole packet, we have one error-detection field for the header, and another error-detection field for the data -- allows a node to immediately reject a packet with a bit error in the destination address or the length field, avoiding needless processing. The same CRC polynomial is used for both. Such an &quot;extra&quot; CRC that covers only the header is used in several file formats&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; an optional feature of the gzip format, etc.

* fixed-size packets -- where all packets fall into a few length categories -- do not require a &quot;length&quot; field, and simplify buffer allocation, but waste &quot;internal&quot; data space on padding the last packet when you want to send data that is not an exact multiple of the fixed data size.

=== Start-of-packet and transparency tradeoffs ===

Unfortunately, it is impossible for any communication protocol to have all these nice-to-have features:
* transparency: data communication is transparent and &quot;8 bit clean&quot; -- (a) any possible data file can be transmitted, (b) byte sequences in the file always handled as data, and never mis-interpreted as something else, and (c) the destination receives the entire data file without error, without any additions or deletions.
* simple copy: forming packets is easiest if we simply blindly copy data from the source to the data field of the packet without change.
* unique start: the start-of-packet symbol is easy to recognize, because it is a known constant byte that never occurs anywhere else in the headers, header CRC, data payload, or data CRC.
* 8-bit: only uses 8-bit bytes.

Some communication protocols break transparency, requiring extra complexity elsewhere -- requiring higher network layers to implement work-arounds such as [[w:binary-to-text encoding]] or else suffer mysterious errors, as with the [[w:Time Independent Escape Sequence]].

Some communication protocols break &quot;8-bit&quot; -- i.e., in addition to the 256 possible bytes, they have &quot;extra symbols&quot;. Some communication protocols have just a few extra non-data symbols -- such as the &quot;long pause&quot; used as part of the Hayes escape sequence; the &quot;long break&quot; used as part of the [[w:SDI-12|SDI-12]] protocol; &quot;command characters&quot; or &quot;control symbols&quot; in 4B5B coding, 8b/10b encoding; etc. Other systems, such as 9-bit protocols,&lt;ref&gt;

transmit 9 bit symbols.
Typically the first 9-bit symbol of a packet has its high bit set to 1, waking up all nodes; then each node checks the destination address of the packet, and all nodes other than the addressed node go back to sleep. The rest of the data in the packet (and the ACK response) is transmitted as 9 bit symbols with the high bit cleared to 0, effectively 8 bit values, which is ignored by the sleeping nodes.
(This is similar to the way that all data bytes in a MIDI message are effectively 7 bit values; the high bit is set only on the first byte in a MIDI message).
Alas, some UARTs make it awkward,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
difficult, or impossible to send and receive such 9-bit characters.

Some communication protocols break &quot;unique start&quot; -- i.e., they allow the no-longer-unique start-of-packet symbol to occur elsewhere -- most often because we are sending a file that includes that byte, and &quot;simple copy&quot; puts that byte in the data payload. When a receiver is first turned on, or when cables are unplugged and later reconnected, or when noise corrupts what was intended to be the real start-of-packet symbol, the receiver will incorrectly interpret that data as the start-of-packet. Even though the receiver usually recognizes that something is wrong (checksum failure), a single such noise glitch may lead to a cascade of many lost packets, as the receiver goes back and forth between (incorrectly) interpreting that data byte in the payload as a start-of-packet, and then (incorrectly) interpreting a real start-of-packet symbol as payload data.
Even worse, such common problems may cause the receiver to lose track of where characters begin and end.
Early protocol designers believed that once synchronization has been lost, there must be a unique start-of-packet character sequence required to regain synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;
J. Robinson.
RFC 935.
&quot;Reliable link layer protocols&quot;.
1985.
quote:
&quot;once a header error has been detected, the count field
must be assumed to be invalid, and so there must be a unique
character sequence that introduces the next header in order that the
receiver can regain synchronization with the sender.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
Later protocol designers have designed a few protocols,
such as CRC-based framing,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: CRC-based framing]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
that not only break &quot;unique start&quot; --
allow the data payload contain the same byte sequence as the start-of-packet, supporting simple-copy transparency --
they don't even need a fixed unchanging start-of-packet character sequence.

In order to keep the &quot;unique start&quot; feature, many communication protocols break &quot;simple copy&quot;. This requires a little extra software and a little more time per packet than simply copying the data -- which is usually insignificant with modern processors.
The awkwardness comes from (a) making sure that the entire process -- the transmitter encoding/escaping a chunk of raw data into a packet payload that must not include the start-of-packet byte, and the receiver decoding/unescaping the packet payload into a chunk of raw data -- is completely transparent to any possible sequence of raw data bytes, even if those bytes include one or more start-of-packet bytes, and (b) since the encoded/escaped payload data inevitably requires more bytes than the raw data, we must make sure we don't overflow any buffers even with the worst possible expansion, and (c) unlike &quot;simple copy&quot; where a constant bitrate of payload data bits results in the same constant goodput of raw data bits, we must make sure that the system is designed to handle the variations in payload data bitrate or raw data bit goodput or both.
Some of this awkwardness can be reduced by using consistent-overhead byte stuffing (COBS).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf &quot;Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing&quot;] by Stuart Cheshire and Mary Baker, 1999.
&lt;/ref&gt;
rather than variable-overhead byte stuffing techniques such as the one used by
[[Serial_Programming/IP_Over_Serial_Connections#SLIP | SLIP]].

Calculate the CRC and append it to the packet *before* encoding both the raw data and the CRC with COBS.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== preamble ===

Two popular approaches to preambles are:

* The first transmitter sends just enough preamble bits for this hop's receiver to lock on. Then it sends the packet. That receiver, once it knows it needs to forward the packet another hop, transmits a fresh new full-size preamble over the next hop, followed by the data packet. The benefit is that a relatively short, fixed-length preamble is adequate no matter how many hops the data packet jumps over.

*  The first transmitter sends a much longer preamble, much longer than is really necessary for this hop's receiver to lock on. Then it sends the packet. That receiver, as soon at it detects the preamble, immediately transmits each incoming bit out the other port(s) until it gets to the end of the packet. The benefit is that relay nodes can be extremely simple, since they don't have to store any data. Preamble consumption ([[w:5-4-3 rule#Preamble consumption]]) makes the preamble get shorter and shorter after each hop -- too many bits lost and eventually there is not enough preamble bits to lock on and the entire packet is lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section covers the installation of a prolog compiler, loading your first program, and querying it. It then explains how to use facts and variables in your programs and queries.

== Getting Started ==

Before anything can be done, a prolog compiler and a text editor need to be installed on your system. A text editor will allow you to write your prolog programs and the prolog compiler (also known as the interpreter) will allow you to execute them.

''Prolog Compilers''

The following prolog implementations are free (at least for personal or educational use, be sure to read the terms). Simply download one and install it according to the instructions on the website:

:* B-Prolog 
:http://www.probp.com/
:A Prolog compiler for standard Prolog with extended features such as tabling and constraint solving. Supports many platforms.

:* SWI Prolog (recommended for use with this book)
:http://www.swi-prolog.org/
:A small and robust open-source implementation that is compliant with both Prolog standards (ISO and Edinburgh) and has many extra libraries and built-in predicates. There's even a separate toolkit for creating windows and graphics, called XPCE. Supports many platforms.
:* GNU Prolog
:http://www.gprolog.org/ (was: http://pauillac.inria.fr/~diaz/gnu-prolog/ )
:A relatively new open source implementation. Has support for Constraint Logic Programming, an extension of prolog.
:* Visual Prolog
:http://www.visual-prolog.com/
:A complete development environment for an Object-Oriented extension of Prolog.  Includes compiler, linker, text editor, graphical dialog editors, build system, debugger, large library, and much more

The following implementations aren't free:
:* SICSTUS Prolog
:http://www.sics.se/
:Probably the most well known professional prolog implementation and development suite. ISO-compliant, many libraries and support for constraint logic programming. Free for evaluation.
:* Quintus Prolog
:http://www.sics.se/quintus/
:An especially robust and dependable implementation intended for commercial use and research projects by the same company that makes SICSTUS. Free for evaluation.

''Text Editors''

The programs that you will write are simple text files, to be read and written with any text editor. Some prolog implementations come with their own editor, but for those that don't here's a list of text editors. These provide the basic function that are useful for writing prolog programs, such as indentation, bracket matching and some can even be adjusted to highlight the syntax of your prolog code.

:* Crimson Editor
:http://www.crimsoneditor.com/
:A free text-editor for windows with many features.
:* GNU Emacs
:http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html
:A free, open-source implementation of unix' classic text editor. May be difficult to understand, has lots of features.
:* Vim
:http://www.vim.org/
:A free, open-source implementation of Emacs' long-standing rival.
:* Textpad
:http://www.textpad.com/
:A windows text-editor with many features. Free for evaluation.
:* Eclipse Prolog Plugin
:http://eclipse.ime.usp.br/projetos/grad/plugin-prolog/index.html
:A free plugin for Eclipse.

== First Steps ==

Once you've installed your prolog implementation, it's time to write the first program and load it into the interpreter (mainly to see if everything works). Fire up your text editor and create a text file with just the following line in it:

 human(john).

Be precise, capitalization is important in prolog, as is the period. This will be your program (also known as the '''database''' or the '''knowledge base'''). Give it a nice name like prolog1.pl and save it. ''Note: The extension pl isn't officially associated with prolog and can cause conflicts if you're also programming in Perl, which uses .pl as well. If this is a problem you can use pro or pr or anything you like just as well.''
Now start your prolog interpreter. Most prolog interpreters will show you a window with some startup information and then the line 

 ?- 

with a cursor behind it. There is usually a menu for loading files into the interpreter. If there isn't, you can type the following to load your file:

 consult('FILEPATH').

And press enter. Once again, be precise, no capitals and remember the dot. Replace FILEPATH with the name and directory of your file. For instance if your file is located in C:\My Documents\Prolog\prolog1.pl then use 
 consult('c:/my documents/prolog/prolog1.pl').
or the shorthand
 ['c:/my documents/prolog/prolog1.pl'].

Note that the slashes are the other way around, since the backslash (\) has special meaning in Prolog (and most other languages). If you are using a UNIX based system such as Linux, the commands may look something like this

 consult('/home/yourName/prolog/prolog1.pl').
 ['/home/yourName/prolog/prolog1.pl'].

Your interpreter will now hopefully tell you that the file is loaded correctly. If it doesn't, consult the help file or manual of your implementations on how to consult files. 

Also, you can tell prolog interpreter to load file automatically, if running it with the key &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt;, like this&lt;ref&gt;Working with the SWI-Prolog, don't sure about other.&lt;/ref&gt;:
 prolog -s /home/yourName/prolog/prolog1.pl

After some information you will see

 ?-

To see if everything is working, type

 human(john).

(don't forget the period) and press Enter. Prolog will answer with a heartfelt 

 Yes.

Type 

 human(Who).

and prolog will answer

 Who = john

Press enter and prolog will end with Yes and give you back your command line.

To exit prolog, type

 halt.

== Syntax, Facts and Queries ==

The line '''human(john).''' in the previous example was a prolog sentence in the form of a predicate.  This type of sentence is called a fact. Predicates consist of one word of one or more characters, all lowercase, possibly followed by a number of terms. The following are examples of valid predicates:

 human(john)
 father(david, john)
 abc(def,ghi,jkl,m)
 tree
 p(a ,f ,d)

The terms (the 'words' within parentheses) can take many forms, but for now we will stick to constants. These are words, again all lowercase. The first character of both a predicate and a constant needs to be a letter.
Using predicates we can add facts to a program:

 human(john).
 human(suzie).
 human(eliza).
 man(david).
 man(john).
 woman(suzie).
 woman(eliza).
 parent(david, john).
 parent(john, eliza).
 parent(suzie, eliza).

Note the period '.' behind each line to show that the line is over. This is very important, if you forget it, your interpreter will not understand the program.
You should also be aware that the names chosen for the predicates and terms do not actually mean anything to the prolog interpreter. They're just chosen to show what meaning you have for the program. We could easily replace the word ''human'' with the word ''spaceship'' everywhere and the interpreter wouldn't know the difference.

If we load the above program into the interpreter we can run a ''query'' on it. If you type 
 
 human(john).

prolog will answer 

 Yes.

and if you type
 
 woman(john).

prolog will answer 

 No.

This also seems fairly obvious, but it's important to see it the right way. If you ask prolog '''human(john).''', it means you are asking prolog if this statement is true. Clearly prolog can't see from the statement whether it's true, so it consults your file. It checks all the lines in the program to see if anyone matches the statement and answers Yes if it finds one. If it doesn't, it answers No.
Note that if you ask

  ?- human(david).

Prolog will answer no, because we have not added that fact to the database. This is important: if prolog can't prove something from the program, it will consider it not true. This is known as the ''closed world assumption''.

== Variables ==

We'll update the program with '''human(david)''', so that all people in the database are human, and either a man or a woman

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 human(david).
 human(john).
 human(suzie).
 human(eliza).
 man(david).
 man(john).
 woman(suzie).
 woman(eliza).
 parent(david, john).
 parent(john, eliza).
 parent(suzie, eliza).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

What we have now is still not a very expressive language. We can gain a lot more expressiveness by using ''variables'' in our query. A variable is a word, just like terms and predicates, with the exception that it starts with an uppercase letter and can have both upper and lowercase characters after that. Consider the following query

 human(A).

Now, the term of the predicate is a variable. Prolog will try to '''bind''' a term to the variable. In other words, you are asking prolog what A needs to be for human(A) to be true.

 ?- human(A).

Prolog will answer

 A = john

Which is true, because the database contains the line '''human(john)'''. If you press enter, prolog will answer Yes and give you back your cursor. If you press semicolon (';') prolog will show you the rest of the possibilities

 A = suzie ;
 A = eliza ;
 No.

After eliza, prolog answers No, indicating that there are no further possibilities. 
If you query prolog with more than one variable it will show you all instantiations of the variables for which the query is true:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- parent(Parent, Child).

 Parent = david
 Child = john ;

 Parent = john
 Child = eliza ;

 Parent = suzie
 Child = eliza ;

 No
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

When prolog is asked a query with a variable it will check all lines of the program, and attempt to ''unify'' each predicate with the query. This means that it will check if the query matches the predicate when the variables are instantiated a certain way. It can unify '''human(A)''' with '''human(john)''' by making A john, but it can't unify '''man(A)''' with '''human(john)''', because the predicates don't match.

If we want to make it even more difficult for prolog we can use two predicates in our query, for instance:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- human(A), parent(B,A).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Now we are asking prolog for a human A who has a parent B. The comma means ''and'', indicating that both predicates need to be true, for the query to be true. To check this query, prolog will first find an instantiation to make the first predicate true--say it make A equal to john--and then it will try to make the second predicate true--with A equal to john. If it has found two instantiations for A and B that make both predicates true, it will return them to you. You can press Enter to end the program, or a semi-colon to see more options. 

Prolog may make a choice for A, to satisfy the first predicate that doesn't work with the second. Say it chooses '''A = suzie''' to satisfy '''human(A)'''; no choice for B will satisfy parent(B, suzie), so prolog will give up its choice of suzie for A, and try another name. This is called '''backtracking'''.

In the example above, prolog will first find '''human(david)''' in the program and unify A with david. To make the second predicate true, it needs to find an instantiation for '''parent(B, david)'''. It can't find any, so it will look for a new instantiation of human(A). It tries the next option: A = john. Now it needs to instantiate parent(B, john). It finds B = david in the line parent(david, john) and reports back to you
 
 A = john
 B = david 

If you press semicolon it will try to find a new instantiation for the second predicate. If that fails it will try to find a new instantiation for the first predicate and so forth until it runs out of options.

There is one special variable, called the ''anonymous'' variable, for which the underscore (_) character is used. When you use this character in a query, you basically say that you don't care how this variable is instantiated, ie you don't care which term it's bound to, as long as it's bound to something. If you ask prolog
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- parent(A, _). 
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Prolog will answer

 A = david;
 A = john;
 A = suzie;

It will not tell you how it instantiates _. However if you ask prolog
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- abc(_,_,_).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This will not be true by default, prolog needs to find an instantiation for all three anonymous variables in the database, such as abc(d,e,f). Since the predicate abc isn't in the database at all, the query fails. You can use the anonymous variable in your database as well. Putting 

 human(_).

In your database will mean that any term, whether it already exists or not, is human. So the query
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- human(_).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Would be true with the above fact in the database. Here the anonymous variable is used to state a property of all objects, instead of just one. If we want to state that a specific group of objects has a certain property, we need '''rules'''. The next section deals with this.

== Examples ==

The following program describes the public transport systems of some cities:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 transport(dresden, tram).
 transport(amsterdam, tram).
 transport(amsterdam, subway).
 transport(new_york, subway).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

We can ask prolog if there is a city which has both a tram system and a subway:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- transport(A, subway), transport(A, tram).
 A = amsterdam ;
 fail.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Exercises ==
(x) Find a Family Tree somewhere, or make one up (a real one will make it easier to check your answers). Implement part of the tree (around ten people) in a prolog program using the predicates '''woman/1''', '''man/1''', '''parent/2'''. The number behind the predicate describes how many arguments the predicate takes. So '''parent/2''' describes a predicate like parent(john, mary).

You can peruse [[w:Category:Family_trees]] for a suitable family tree.

Write prolog queries for the following commands and questions. Don't worry if some people are returned more than once. We'll discover how to deal with this later on.

# List the women in the database
# List the children in the database
# List all combinations of a father and his son.
# which women have both a father and a son in the database?

Can you think of a way to display those women that do not have a father listed in the database? Can you describe what you would need to write such a query?

The answers to select excercises can be found here: [[Prolog/Introduction/Answers]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Conworld]] : [[Conplanet]] : Geography

As with most conplanet creation, what you will do here depends on the degree of realism you want. This page assumes that you are going for a high level of realism; diversions from this are at your own discretion.

==Oceans and Continents==

On the Earth, the only real example we have of large bodies of water, ocean formation is tied closely with volcanism and tectonics. It appears that oceans are largely formed through water vapour expelled by volcanoes, as well as possibly from infalling comets. 

The exact shapes of the continents are seemingly random, but there do seem to be tendencies:

*Islands usually form over weak spots in tectonic plates (Hawai'i) or where continents have been torn, like taffy, leaving 'bits' behind.
*If the coastline is close to a source of glaciers, it will have a jagged coastline or a rocky beach.
*Sand that flows off of a coast could create shifting sandbars and sand islands, especially if it's in a sound.
*Parts of continental plates are under water, causing relatively shallow shelf seas.

==Prevailing Currents and Winds==
Having a good understanding of prevailing winds will also help you to [[Conplanet/Climate|model your planet's weather]].

==Mountain Ranges==
Mountains form on converging plate boundaries. Coastal Ranges are created by subducting oceanic plates thrusting up more magma below the crust. Volcanic peaks are formed by diverging or converging boundaries where magma is channelled through the crust. Age of mountains will have an effect on their appearance. For example: Sharp, angular summits will not exist in an ancient, eroded mountain chain, but will form in a newer, more active converging boundary.

==Rivers==
Notable characteristics about rivers:
*Rivers usually rise in mountains and then flow to the sea. 
*They always start in high elevations and move to lower elevations. 
*Rivers primarily flow from the seaward sides of mountain ranges to the ocean. 

That is why several important rivers start in the Himalayas and flow through India to the Pacific (the nearest ocean) rather than flowing through central Asia to the Arctic Ocean. (This is not exclusively true, though; the Mississippi, for example, starts from a rather nondescript lake in Minnesota and flows to the Gulf of Mexico, all the while going through relatively dry land. However, the Mississippi still travels downslope, and does not go to the relatively more distant Hudson Bay.)

Common mistakes of conworld creators in placing realistic rivers are:
*Major rivers splitting far from their mouths. Real rivers do not do this.
*Rivers going one side of a mountain range, through the mountains, to the other side. This would require rivers flowing from a low place to a high place. Going through pre-existing broad valleys is possible, but otherwise, the river would simply flow around the mountains.
*Rivers that start in the ocean. This does not happen in real life.
*Rivers flowing two ways out of the same lake. Again, this does not happen in real life. (Except for [[w:Gatun Lake|Gatun Lake]] and [[w:Balsam Lake (Ontario)|Balsam Lake]], but both lakes exist as part of canal systems).

==Elevation==
That the height of certain geographical features varies widely from those of others seems self-explanatory, but it is a feature of Congeography that many conworlders forget to include.  Knowing the elevation of certain areas on a given conmap can help with mapping rivers (as mentioned above), modeling a place's weather, and can even indirectly affect the culture of that area (due to advantages or disadvantages in location).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!

My name is James Booker (hence the username, eh?). I live in a town called [[w:heanor|Heanor]] in the county of [[w:derbyshire|Derbyshire]], [[w:england|England]]. Derbyshire is one of many counties in the mid-regions of England known as the [[w:midlands|Midlands]].

==History==

I joined Wikibooks on the 1st September 2004, and Wikipedia a few weeks before that. I instantly fell in love with the Wikipedia ethic, but found that anything I could contribute to the Wikipedia seemed to already have been done, and so I started looking at the sister projects, where I discovered Wikibooks and the Wikiversity! Since then I only really use Wikipedia as content-reference for Wikibooks.

==Interests==

My interests are computer programming in PHP, C++, Delphi and a multitude of other languages. I enjoy playing my PS2 and GameCube (I'm an obsessive of the Final Fantasy series, and intend on setting up the complete guidebook here to the entire series) and spending as much time as possible with my fiancé, Rebecca.

My aims in being here are to help expand the Wikibooks project to the point that complete authoratitive texts can be enjoyed by students from all over the world.

==My Bookshelf==
Wikibooks/Schools I either read or contribute to.

'''Eggplant Pasta''' – This tasty vegetable stew is great served with your favorite pasta.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] (aubergine)
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
*2 tins of peeled [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]
*handfuls of fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
*dried [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]] ([[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Capsicum|capsicum]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]) – often sold pre-mixed.
*fresh [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*[[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] (your favourite)

Serves 4.

==Procedure==
#Slice eggplant and cover in salt. Leave for at least 30 minutes.
#Rinse salt away, then squeeze until almost dry (this removes sourness).
#Cut into chip-sized pieces and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] in oil.
#Add onion and cook briefly.
#Add all other ingredients and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for 30 minutes.
#Serve with freshly cooked pasta.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The amounts of the various ingredients are not really important. Experiment and adjust to taste.
*It is often better to prepare the vegetables the night before as this gives time for the flavours of the chili pepper, garlic, and herbs to diffuse through the mix.
*Spiral pasta is a good choice as it holds the sauce to itself.

==Warnings==
*Always wash your hands after handling chili peppers. Be especially careful not to touch your eyes.

== Memory model ==

Every process in Unix has an address space that looks like this:

 global vars
 --
 text segment
 --
 heap
 --
 stack

Remember the low memory is at the top, and the high memory is at the bottom.  So when items are added to the stack, and it grows upwards, each element has a lower memory address.

== Unix processes ==

=== fork() is your friend ===

You should know what this does:

 main()
 {
     int i, cpid;
     cpid = fork();
     if (cpid &lt; 0) exit(1);
     else if (cpid == 0) {
         /* this is the child process. */
         for (i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) printf(&quot;child: %d\n&quot;, i);
         exit(0);
     }
     else {
         /* this is parent process */
         for (i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) printf(&quot;parent: %d\n&quot;, i);
         waitpid(cpid);
     }
 return 0;
 }

The call to fork creates a new process with an entire new address space.  That means a copy is made of everything: new global vars, new text code, new heap, and new stack.  Even object dynamically allocated with malloc are copied.  Remember that the pointers to those dynamically-allocated objects are set based on relative addressing, so even the new copied memory is allocated somewhere else, the pointers into the heap still work.

=== process states ===

The four most popular UNIX process states are ready, waiting, running, and zombie.  The first three are easy.  Zombie processes are child processes that have completed and are waiting for their parents to clean them up.  Usually parents clean up completed (zombie) child processes by calling wait or waitpid.

If the parent process dies before the child process finishes, eventually the root process will come around and clean them up.

== Pipes ==

=== simple example ===

So, after fork(), if each process has its own memory space, how to set up communication?  With pipes!  Each process may have its own file descriptor table, but they still reference the same files.

Example pipe code, where child reads and parent writes:

''NOTE: feel free to add in all that error-checking goodness, but try to keep the point obvious''

 int p[2];
 pipe(p); /* call by address. */
 cpid = fork();
 if (cpid &lt; 0) exit(1);
 
 /* child process */
 if (cpid == 0) {
     close(p[1]); /* child won't need to write, so close. */
     read(p[0], buf, len);
     close(p[0]);
     _exit(0); /* read man 3 exit and man _exit to understand the difference. */
 }
 
 /* parent */
 else {
     close(p[0]); /* parents can be so close-minded! */
     write(p[1], buf, len);
     close(p[1]);
     waitpid(cpid);
 }

Study and understand the above code.

=== Implementing a very simple shell with pipes ===

We've all done stuff like this at the command line:

 $ ls -l | sort | head

But how does that work?  In MS-DOS, this functionality was implemented sort of like this:

 ls -l &gt; /tmpfile1
 sort /tmpfile1 &gt; /tmpfile2
 head /tmpfile2

The three tasks were run sequentially, rather than concurrently.  This is bad if the output of the first program is enormous, and this setup certainly can't handle an infinite stream of data.

You can implement the ls -l | sort | head stuff in C.  To keep it manageable, the following code implements &quot;ls | wc -l&quot; instead:

 int pipes[2];
 pipe(pipes);
 
 int pid = fork();
 if(pid &lt; 0) /* Check for error */
 {
     fprintf(stderr, &quot;fork unsuccessful.&quot;);
     exit(1);
 }
 if(0 == pid) /* We are the child */
 {
     /*
      * We don't need the writing end of the pipe.  This closes it.
      */
     close(pipes[1]);
     
     /*
      * Duplicate our output pipe to file descriptor 0.
      * This means that anything that would normally be read from stdin
      * is now read from the pipe.
      */
     dup2(pipes[0], 0);
     
     /*
      * We've duplicated the pipe, so there is no need to leave this copy
      * hanging around.
      */
     close(pipes[0]);
     
     /*
      * Execute the &quot;wc -l&quot; command.  This replaces our process.
      */
     execlp(&quot;wc&quot;, &quot;wc&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;, (char*)0);
 }
 else /* We must be the parent */
 {
     /*
      * We don't need the reading end of the pipe.  This closes it.
      */
     close(pipes[0]);
     
     /*
      * This duplicates the pipe into stdout.  This means that standard
      * output is redirected into the pipe.
      */
     dup2(pipes[1], 1);
     
     /*
      * Since we've duplicated this end of the pipe, we won't need it
      * anymore.
      */
     close(pipes[1]);
     
     /*
      * We're done setting up.  This replaces us with the &quot;ls&quot; part of the
      * command.
      */
     execlp(&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;ls&quot;, (char*)0);
 }

=== Implementing I/O redirection with pipes ===
Another classic:

 ls -l &gt; out.txt

How can you do?

''TODO: finish''

err?

== Threads ==


[[wikipedia:Thread (computer science)|wikipedia thread article]]

Threads share memory, processes don't.  They both allow programs to do multiple things simultaneously (concurrently).  Most of the time on Linux, when people talk about threads, they're really talking about POSIX threads, aka pthreads.  

=== Simple pthread example ===

Example pthread code:
 
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 
 int i; /* i is global, so it is visible to all functions. */
 
 static void *foo()
 {
     int k;
     for (k=0; k&lt;10; k++) {
         sleep(1);
         printf(&quot;thread foo: %d.\n&quot;, i++);
     }
     return NULL;
 }
 
 static void *bar()
 {
     int k;
     for (k=0; k&lt;10; k++) {
         sleep(1);
         printf(&quot;thread bar: %d.\n&quot;, i++);
     }
     return NULL;
 }
 
 int main() {
    int x;
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    x = pthread_create(&amp;t1, NULL, foo, NULL);
    if (x != 0) printf(&quot;pthread foo failed.\n&quot;);
    x = pthread_create(&amp;t2, NULL, bar, NULL);
    if (x != 0) printf(&quot;pthread bar failed.\n&quot;);
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    printf(&quot;all pthreads finished.\n&quot;);
    return 0;
 }

This is a slice of the output:

 $ ./pthreadfun 
 thread foo: 0.
 thread bar: 1.
 thread foo: 2.
 ...
 thread foo: 18.
 thread bar: 19.
 all pthreads finished.

Hopefully the main point is jumping out at you.  Foo and bar alternately increment up the global integer i.

==== Exercise ====

Rewrite the above code to use fork() and create two processes rather than two threads.  Then find what is the maximum value of i and explain the difference with this threaded version.

=== Kernel threads vs. user threads ===

pthreads are kernel-space threads, meaning that the OS scheduler is aware of the multiple threads.  Each thread has an entry in the OS schedule table.

There are also user-level threads, where the kernel is unaware of the threads.  The process must handle scheduling itself.  User-level threads require two-level scheduling:

 OS scheduler handles all processes
 Process handles all threads.

One user-level thread can block all the other threads for the process if the programmer isn't careful.  If a user-level thread makes some blocking system call, then the OS will suspend that process until that system call returns.

User threads have the advantage of allowing switching between threads in a process much more quickly than kernel-level threads.  The process does the context-switching itself.

=== Solaris hybrid threads ===

Sun Solaris version 2.3 offered hybrid threads which attempt to combine the speed of user-level threads with the advantages of kernel-level threads.  The hybrid threads minimize the OS scheduling cost of switching between threads at the kernel level, but they also allow a thread to make a blocking system call without blocking the entire process.

The system allowed for threads and lightweight processes.  The OS scheduler only saw the lightweight processes.  Each thread is attached to a lightweight process.  Threads can share a process, so one application with multiple threads may appear to the OS scheduler as a single process.

In a program with two threads both bound to a single process, if thread 1 makes a blocking system call, then the OS will block the process.  Meanwhile, in order to allow thread 2 to still run, the OS will create new process, detach thread 2 from the first process, and then attach it to the new process.

=== critical sections and mutexes ===

If threads are going to share vars, you need to be careful they don't both try to alter memory simultaneously.

Consider this classic C code:

 i++;

This looks like one operation (add one to i), but it translates to three operations in assembly code:

 lda i;  load the value stored in var i into the eax register.
 inc;    increment up the eax register.
 sta i;  store the value in the eax register into the var i.

''Read the C programming appendix in this book for more information on how to convert a C program to assembly using gcc.''

Since threads share memory, it is possible for one thread to start to do something, then get suspended by the OS scheduler.

Imagine if two threads exist and i is a global integer, initially set to 99.  Each thread wants to increment up i by one, so each thread will do the three assembly steps above.  After we are finished, we expect to find i set to 101. 

First thread 1 starts:

 lda i;    eax register holds 99.
 inc i;    now, eax holds 100.

Now, imagine at this point the OS scheduler suspends thread 1 and starts thread 2:

 lda i;    load 99 from i into eax.  This is bad!!!
 inc i;    increment eax to 100.
 sta i;    store 100 into i.

And then, the OS allows thread 1 to finish:

 sta i;    store eax into i.  but eax only has 100!

So now you see how two threads accessing common variables can be risky.  The worst part about this bug is that it will be inconsistent and hard to reproduce.  The i++ statement is called a '''critical section''' because we need to makes sure that only one thread has access to the variable in that section.

One solution is to use some kind of lock, like this, in each thread:

     lock(ilock);
     i++;
     unlock(ilock);

Then if thread1 gets suspended, and thread2 starts, it will block on the lock(ilock) call.  To do this for real, we can use mutexes.  A mutex is like a semaphore that only has values of 1 or 0.  The threads in this code will lock and unlock a mutex before trying to increment up i, so you avoid the above problem.

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
 
 pthread_mutex_t ilock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
 int i;
 
 static void *f1()
 {
     pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;ilock);
     i++;
     pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;ilock);
     return NULL;
 }
 
 static void *f2()
 {
     pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;ilock);
     i++;
     pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;ilock);
     return NULL;
 }
 
 int main()
 {
     pthread_t t1, t2;
     int x;
     i = 99;
     x = pthread_create(&amp;t1, NULL, f1, NULL);
     if (x != 0) printf(&quot;pthread foo failed.\n&quot;);
     x = pthread_create(&amp;t2, NULL, f2, NULL);
     if (x != 0) printf(&quot;pthread bar failed.\n&quot;);
     pthread_join(t1, NULL);
     pthread_join(t2, NULL);
     printf(&quot;all pthreads finished.\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;i set to %d.\n&quot;, i);
     return 0;
 }

That's it!

Another solution to this problem is to use a &quot;increment&quot; instruction that really is atomic.
(The &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;unlock&quot; functions use just such an atomic instruction).
Such atomic functions (and how they can be used to avoid data corruption and deadlocks) are discussed at [[Wikipedia:Lock-free and wait-free algorithms]].

=== Producer and Consumer model ===
This hobgoblin shows up all the time in the real world.  The chef makes bowls of soup for the diner.  The chef has to wait for the diner to ask for soup, and the diner has to wait for the chef to announce the soup is ready.  If you ain't careful, you can end up with a '''deadlock''' which is just as nasty as it sounds. 

A deadlock involves two processes (p1 and p2) and two resources (r1 and r2).  Each process needs exclusive access to both resources to finish.  The deadlock happens when p1 holds r1 and waits for r2 to be released, and p2 holds r2 and waits for r1.  As you can see, neither process can continue.

This pseudocode illustrates how to set up a producer/consumer system and not fear deadlocks:

 /*  
 
 static soupbuffer buff;
 semaphore moreplease, soupisready;
 
 producerthread()
 {
     lock(moreplease);       wait until the kids ask for more.
     cooksoup(buff);         refill the soup pot.
     unlock(soupisready);    announce that soup is ready.
 }
 
 consumerthread()
 {
     lock(soupisready);      wait until the soup is ready.
     eatsoup(buff);          empty the soup pot.
     unlock(moreplease);     ask for more soup.
 }
                                                                                                              
 */

== Shared memory ==

System V provides shared memory.  One process can allocate some memory as shared memory, then other processes can attach to that memory, and these processes can communicate.

one process can use shmget to allocate memory.  then that process can use shmat to aim a pointer at that memory.

another process can use shmat to attach a pointer to that same memory.

shmdt will detach the pointer from shared memory.

shmctl can be used to free the allocated memory.

You can use &lt;code&gt;ipcs&lt;/code&gt; to check on any allocated shared memory, which is a nice way to check if your program freed all allocated memory. &lt;code&gt;ipcrm&lt;/code&gt; will delete allocated shared memory.

== Signals ==

Signals are neat.  When you hit Ctrl+C to kill a process, you're really sending SIGINT to that process.  Similarly, Ctrl+Z sends SIGTSTP and `kill -9 ''pid''` sends the 9th signal, SIGKILL.  The full listing of available signals is in the seventh section of the manual pages (`man -s 7 signal`).

=== signal handlers ===

When a process receives a signal, the corresponding function is invoked.  In the case of SIGKILL, the function causes the code to exit.  Many of these signals can be trapped and reassigned to a custom function as illustrated in the following code:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 
 void sighandler(void)
 {
     printf(&quot;i am un-SIGINT-able!\n&quot;);
 }
 
 int main()
 {
     signal(SIGINT, sighandler);
     perror(&quot;signal&quot;);
     while (1) {
         printf(&quot;sleeping...\n&quot;);
         sleep(1);
     }
     return 0;
 }

Compile and run the program above and then try to kill it with Ctrl+c.  Now, try to kill the program with `kill -s SIGKILL ''pid''`.

When Ctrl+c is pressed, the process is sent the SIGINT signal; however instead of terminating, the custom function  '''sighandler''' is invoked.  Since the SIGKILL signal is not trapped, the code exited normally.  

The signal() function will not let you write a handler for SIGKILL.

In HP-UX, after the signal arrives, the signal handler is forgotten for that signal.  So, often inside the signal handler, it re-registers it self as the handler:
 void sighandler(void)
 {
     printf(&quot;i am un-SIGINT-able!\n&quot;);
     signal(SIGINT, sighandler);
 }

In Linux, this is not necessary.

=== sigalarm ===

The SIGALRM signal can be raised by the alarm() function, so it's a good way to generate a signal inside your program.  The below code illustrates:

 signal(SIGALRM, onintr);
 alarm(3);
 while (1) ; /* run forever. */
 
 void onintr()
 {
     printf(&quot;3 second violation.\n&quot;);
     alarm(3);
 }

This program will run until you kill it.

=== Signals and setjmp/longjmp ===

This code calls the SIGALARM handler when the process receives the SIGALARM signal, and then inside the handler, jumps out of the handler without returning.

 jmp_buf env;
 main()
 {
     setjmp(env);
     signal(SIGALRM, onintr);
 }
 void onintr()
 {
     printf(&quot;SIGALRM handler...\n&quot;);
     longjmp(env);
 }

There's an issue that might not be obvious.  After a process gets a signal, then it calls the signal handler.  If another signal comes in while the first signal is still being processed, the process will ignore that second signal.  The OS &quot;blocks&quot; the signal while the handler is running.

When the handler finishes, as part of its return, the OS allows the process to get new signals.

If we jump out of a function with longjmp, then the signal handler will never return, and the process will never hear any new signals of that type coming in.  However, don't worry!  You can manually '''unblock''' the signal and then jump out.

This alternate handler shows how:

 void handler()
 {
     sigset_t set;
     sigempty(&amp;set);
     sigaddset(&amp;set, SIGALRM);
     sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &amp;set, NULL);
     printf(&quot;3 second\n&quot;);
     longjmp(env);
 }

You can use the functions sigsetjmp and siglongjmp to jump out of a signal handler and optionally reset the signal mask.  The below code shows an example.  You'll have to use Ctrl-C to end the program:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
 #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 
 sigjmp_buf env;
 
 void sh()
 {
     printf(&quot;handler received signal.\n&quot;);
     siglongjmp(env, 99);
 }
 
 int main ()
 {
     int k;
     k = sigsetjmp(env, 1);
     if (k == 0) {
         printf(&quot;setting alarm for 4 seconds in the future.\n&quot;);
         signal(SIGALRM, sh);
         alarm(4);
         while (1) {
             printf(&quot;sleeping...\n&quot;);
             sleep(1);
         }
     }
     else {
         printf(&quot;k: %d.\n&quot;, k);
         alarm(3);
         printf(&quot;set alarm for another 3 seconds in the future.\n&quot;);
         while (1) {
             printf(&quot;sleeping...\n&quot;);
             sleep(1);
         }
     }
     return 0;
 }

=== Signals and pause ===
If you want to wait for an event, but don't want to resort to some kind of spin lock, you can use the &lt;code&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt; function to suspend a running process until a signal occurs.

Example code:

 #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 void sh()
 {
     printf(&quot;Caught SIGALRM\n&quot;);
 }
 
 int main()
 {
     signal(SIGALRM, sh);
     printf(&quot;Registered sh as a SIGALRM signal handler.\n&quot;
            &quot;BTW, sh is %d and &amp;sh is %d.\n&quot; , (int) sh, (int) &amp;sh);
     alarm(3);
     printf(&quot;Alarm scheduled in three seconds.  Calling pause()...\n&quot;);
     printf(&quot;RAHUL IS IN WIKIPEDIA WEBSITE AT CHITKARA UNIVERSITY NEAR CHANDIGARH&quot;);
     pause();
 
     printf(&quot;pause() must have returned.\n&quot;);
     return 0;
 }

Also notice that the second print statement casts the function sh to an integer, and also casts the address of sh as an integer.  Here's the output of the program:

 $ ./pausefun
 Registered sh as a SIGALRM signal handler.
 BTW, sh is 134513700 and &amp;sh is 134513700.
 Alarm scheduled in three seconds.  Calling pause()...
 Caught SIGALRM
 pause() must have returned.

Notice that sh after being cast to an integer is the same as the address of sh.  That 134513700 is the memory address in the text section of the sh function.  Although it may seem a little strange at first, from the OS point of view, functions are really just another kind of data.

== Message passing ==

message passing is distinct from communication via pipes because the receiver can select a particular message from the message queue.  With pipes, the receiver just grabs some number of bytes off the front.

The type arg allows priority scheduling.  If the 4th arg of msgrcv is &gt; 0, then system will find the first message with the type equal to that specified 4th arg.

If type is &lt; 0, then system will find the first message with the lowest type where type is below the absolute value of type.

If we have these messages:
 Name:Type
 A:400
 B:200
 C:300
 D:200
 E:100

Then type -250 would return B.

The following two programs show message passing.

     msg2 = msgget(KEY2, PERM);
     if (msg1 == -1 || msg2 == -1) perror(&quot;mpi2 msgget&quot;);
 
     /* send message to mpi1. */
     printf(&quot;mpi2 about to send message \&quot;%s\&quot; to message queue %d.\n&quot;, m1.msg, msg2);
     msgsnd(msg2, &amp;m1, 64, 0);
 
     /* send message to mpi2. */
     strcpy(m2.msg, &quot;...&quot;);
     /*
     msgrcv(msg2, &amp;m2, 64, 0, 0);
     */
     i = msgrcv(msg1, &amp;m2, 64, 0, 0);
     if (i == -1) perror(&quot;mpi2 msgrcv&quot;);
     printf(&quot;mpi2 received msg: \&quot;%s\&quot; from message queue %d with return code %d.\n&quot;, m2.msg, msg1, i);
 
     /* cleanup. */
     msgctl(msg1, IPC_RMID, (struct msqid_ds *) 0);
     msgctl(msg2, IPC_RMID, (struct msqid_ds *) 0);
 
     return 0;
 }


Now compile mpi1.c into mpi1 and compile mpi2.c as mpi2:
 $ gcc -o mpi1 mpi1.c
 $ gcc -o mpi2 mpi2.c

Now run mpi1 in background and then run mpi2:
 $ ./mpi1 &amp;

 $ ./mpi2
 mpi2 about to send message &quot;Indians will win...&quot; to message queue 2195457.
 mpi1 received msg: &quot;Indians will win...&quot; from message queue 2195457.
 mpi1 about to send &quot;I doubt&quot; to message queue 2162688.
 mpi1 sent &quot;I doubt&quot; to message queue 2162688 with return code 0.
 mpi2 received msg: &quot;I doubt&quot; from message queue 2162688 with return code 64.
 [1]+  Done                    ./mpi1

== All about the stack ==

This section describes what happens in the stack and registers when one function calls another function and passes a few parameters.

Imagine we have this C code:

 void foo(x, y, z)
 {
     int i, j;
 }
 int a, b, c;
 a = 4;
 b = 5;
 c = 6;
 foo(a, b, c);

 
Behind the scenes, first c gets pushed, then b, then a, then the return address of the calling function.  This is what the stack looks like (the stuff at the top was the most recently pushed object):

  -8    j
  -4    i
   0  ebp
  +4   return address
  +8    a
 +12    b
 +16    c

=== segfaults revealed! ===

We've all seen this lovely error:
 $ ./try
 Segmentation fault

Most of the time, you find out something like is the problem:
 char ss[3];
 strcpy(ss, &quot;this is a way too long string!\n&quot;);

After this command: char ss[3]; the stack can fit three characters into one 4-byte word.

  -4          ; this is the space (4 bytes, 1 word) allocated for ss[3].
   0     ebp
  +4     r.a.

Now watch what happens when the strcpy() command fills in the stack:

 -4      't', 'h', 'i' ,'s'   ; we can fit the first 4 chars here, but the rest spill over.
  0      ' ', 'i', 's', ' a'  ; ACK!  we just overwrote the old base pointer!
 +4      ' ', 'w', 'a', 'y',  ; now we're doomed; when this function calls it will try to hop to
                              ; the return address stored here, but that has been overwritten.

So hopefully it is more clear what a segfault is.  Your program is trying to hop to a memory address outside the process memory, and the OS puts the smack down.

== Networking ==

=== OSI reference ===
7 layers:

* application
* presentation
* session
* transport
* network
* data link
* physical

In Unix, the first three (application, presentation, and session) are often bundled together.

Imagine that a network looks like this:

 A---Router1---Router2---B.

If a process (application) on A wants to communicate with a process on B, this is sort of what happens: 

The transport layer adds A's port and B's RPC server port.

The network layer adds A's IP address and B's IP address.

Any communication from A must go through the two routers first.

The data link layer adds A's mac address and router 1's mac address.

The physical layer converts the frame into the physical signal.

When the message is received by router 1, the frame is read in and sent to the bottom of the OSI model.  Router 1's mac address is removed and replaced with Router 2's mac address.

== The UNIX file system ==

=== Inodes ===

Each directory is actually a file.  That file lists the names of files and subdirectories in that directory.  It associates names to inodes.

Each inode has the following data:
* userID
* groupID
* mode
* timestamp (accessed, created, modified all tracked separately)
* link count
* file size
* direct pointers to 10 data blocks that contain file contents
* single indirect pointer to a data block that points to data blocks that contain the file contents
* double indirect pointer to a data block ...

=== Addressing ===

Since each inode has 10 direct address pointers, if a file is small enough to fit on 10 data blocks or less, then the inode can use direct addressing.

If we assume that we use 4 bytes to specify the disk address, then we can have 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; different addresses.  If we set the data block size to 4 kb, then one data block can hold 1000 addresses.  So, with single indirect addressing, we can point to a file that uses 1000 data blocks of data.

Therefore, the maximum allowed file size for single indirect addressing (assuming 4kb data blocks and 4byte addresses) is 4 megabytes (1000 data blocks * 4 kb per data block).

Easy formula: data block size / disk address = max file size.

Of course, in double or triple (or quadruple, quintuple, etc.) addressing, you just gotta take the analysis out further.


{|
|-
! File Size
! Blocks Used
|-
| 1 block || 1 block used via direct addressing.
|-
| 11 blocks
| 12 blocks used: 10 blocks of data via direct addressing,&lt;br&gt; 1 block for indirect addressing, and 1 for data.
|-
| 150 blocks
| 10 blocks via direct addressing,&lt;br&gt; 1 + 128 blocks through single addressing,&lt;br&gt; 1 + 1 + 12 1 double indirect + indirect + 12 data blocks
|}

There are advantages and disadvantages of small vs. large data blocks.  Lots of small files and big data blocks causes low utilization.  For example, your &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file may only have 300 bytes of data, but it has to use at least one data block, so if your data block is 4kb in size, well, that's a lot of wasted space.

However, small blocks lead to big files being scattered out across lots of data blocks, and so the hard drive reader has to skip all over the place gathering up the data.  Large data blocks reduce fragmentation.

As the number of blocks per file increases, disk IO cost increases.

=== Linking ===

Each directory has a table that maps file names to inode numbers.  A file can have any number of names associated with it.  Each inode keeps track of its link count.  The command &lt;code&gt;rm foo.txt&lt;/code&gt; edits the directory and removes the entry that maps foo.txt to a particular inode.  If that inode has zero links, then it is deleted.

You might want to read the man page for ln at this point to understand the difference between soft and hard links.

=== RAID ===

Compared to a monolithic system, a distributed system can have a much lower chance that the system will fail today -- even though the distributed system has a much higher chance that one part will fail today.
High-availability distributed systems use techniques inspired by RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) to tolerate a failure in any one part, without loss of data or functionality.

* [[minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss]]
* [[LPI Linux Certification/Configuring RAID]]

=== The set-user-ID bit ===

The set-user-ID bit (sometimes shortened to '''setuid''' or simply '''suid''') alters how the OS handles permissions.  For example, the &lt;code&gt;chsh&lt;/code&gt; command allows a user to change her login shell, like from bash to tcsh.  The login shell for each user is stored in /etc/passwd, but users don't have write access.  So how can a user run chsh and change that file?  The answer is with suid bits.  Look at the permissions on chsh:

 $ ls -l `which chsh`
 -rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root        28088 2004-11-02 16:51 /usr/bin/chsh

So, what is that '''s''' in there for?  That, my friend, is the set-user-ID bit, which means that this program runs as if it were executed by root.

A program with the setuid bit set (or the similar setgid bit) will be run with the privileges of the program's owning user or group respectively.

== Remote Procedure Calls ==

Remote procedure calls (RPC) are a way hiding all the details of running a process on a far away remote machine.

If A wants to make a remote procedure call on host B, then A needs B's RPC server port.

An RPC frame includes:
* function number
* parameters

The command &lt;code&gt;rpcinfo&lt;/code&gt; will list what RPC services are running on the machine.

Generally developing RPC program involves eight steps:

* Build and test conventional application.

* Divide the program by choosing a set of procedures to move to a remote machine.  Place the selected procedures in a separate file.

* Write a rpcgen specification file for the remote program. Choose a program number and version number.  The specification file should be named with a .x suffix.  For example, a remote database program could have a spec file of &lt;code&gt;rdb.x.&lt;/code&gt;

* Run rpcgen command to check the specification file. If the file is valid, rpcgen will generate source code that will be used to build the client and server.  Example: 
 rpcgen -C rdb.x  
will generate 4 output files: &lt;code&gt;rdb.h rdb_clnt.c rdb_svc.c rdb_xdr.c&lt;/code&gt;

* Write stub interface routines for the client and server side. You can use the code developed in step 1.  For example, you might write a &lt;code&gt;rdb.c&lt;/code&gt; file that handles the client interface, and a &lt;code&gt;rdb_svc_proc.c&lt;/code&gt; to handle the work on the server side.

* Compile and link the client program.
 gcc -o rdb rdb.c rdb_clnt.c rdb_xdr.c

* Compile and link the server program.
 gcc -o rdb_svc rdb_svc_proc.c rdb_svc.c rdb_xdr.c

* Start server and invoke client.

== Distributed Algorithms ==

Properties of distributed algorithms
* Information can be scattered among machines.
* Each process makes decisions based on local information.
* Machines can share information.
* A single point of failure should not cause the entire system to crash.
* Machines can't rely on a single common clock or global time.

A simple example of how non-global clocks cause problems:
# you compile foo.c (via make) to foo.o on machine A.
# you log in to machine B, which has a clock that is 15 minutes behind B.
# You edit foo.c again, then run make.  make compares the timestamp on foo.o to foo.c and foo.o is still newer, so make will not recompile foo.o.

=== Synchronization ===

Physical clocks agree with &quot;real time&quot; like Universal Coordinated Time.

Logical clocks don't worry about being accurate to some global standard.  Instead, all machines in a system try to agree with each other.

Keeping a local physical clock synchronized is challenging because even if the machine can contact the authoritative time server, there is some propagation delay.  

How often does a machine need to request an update from a time server?  Assume that the machine has a clock &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; that increments at rate &lt;math&gt;dC&lt;/math&gt;.

The UTC clock &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; increments at rate &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;dC/dt = 1&lt;/math&gt; then the local physical clock C is perfect and doesn't need to be updated.

If &lt;math&gt;dC/dt &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; then the local physical clock C runs at a faster rate.

If &lt;math&gt;dC/dt &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; then the local physical clock C runs at a slower rate then the time server.

&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; represents the maximum drift rate specified by a manufacturer.

&lt;math&gt;1 - \rho &lt;= dC/dt &lt;= 1 + \rho&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; represents the maximum tolerable error.  every &lt;math&gt;\delta/\rho&lt;/math&gt; period, a machine must request an update.

As the error tolerance &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; increases, update frequency falls.  As drift rate &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; goes up, the update frequency goes up also.

== Appendix A: C language overview ==

=== setjmp and longjump ===

Use these to do what C++, python, Java, etc. does with throwing exceptions.  First call setjmp to set a location to jump to.  Then other functions can call longjump to exit the current function and how to the location specified in setjmp.

=== functions with variable-length arguments ===

In other words, how does printf(...) work?

=== conditional compilation ===

One example:
 main()
 {
     #ifdef DEBUG
         printf(&quot;this is a debug statement!\n&quot;);
     #endif
 }    

 $ gcc -DDEBUG prog.c; ./a.out
 this is a debug statement!

 $gcc prog.c; ./a.out
 $

In the second compilation, the printf block ain't included.

Another similar trick is used to prevent the same header file from being included repeatedly.  It is common for one C program to have multiple .c files which include multiple .h files.  You can put this code at the top of your .h file to prevent the same .h file from being included redundantly:

 #ifndef _FOO_H
 #define _FOO_H 1
 
 /* function foo is a worn-out cliche. */
 int foo();
 
 #endif

=== make and makefiles ===

Four type of statements are allowed in Makefiles: macros, dependency rules, commands, and comments.  Here's a trivial example makefile:

 CC = /usr/bin/gcc
 CFLAGS = -Wall -pedantic -g
 
 #saves me the trouble of typing all those flags.
 
 proxy: proxy.c proxy.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) proxy proxy.c
 
 debug-proxy: proxy.c proxy.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -DDEBUG -o proxy proxy.c
  
 clean:
    /bin/rm -f *~ httpd a.out httpd.log proxy proxy.log CACHE.*


I can run any statement by typing make and the name.  Or by default, make will run the first rule it hits if it gets no arg.

 $ make           # runs make proxy
 $ make clean     #runs /bin/rm -f ....

Macros are accessible after being declared by either $(CFLAGS) or ${CFLAGS}.  $CFLAGS is not valid.  If the macro is one letter, like

 A = a.out

Then $A is valid.  But you should stay away from that anyway, because lots of the single-char macros already have meaning.

Each tab underneath a dependency rule starts a new shell, so if you want to change shell stuff, you gotta do it all on one line:

 bogus:
     echo $$PWD; cd ..; echo $$PWD;
     echo $$PWD;

The output:

 $ make bogus 
 echo $PWD; cd ..; echo $PWD
 /home/student/wiwilson/cis620
 /home/student/wiwilson
 echo $pwd

BTW, if you want to suppress the default echoing of the commands, put an @ at the beginning:

 bored:
     echo &quot;meh&quot;
     @echo &quot;snah&quot;

And here's the output:

 $ make bored
 echo &quot;meh&quot;
 meh
 snah

How one make command can recursively call make in subdirectories:

 SRCDIR = src1 src2
 OBJ    = src1/f1.o src2/f2.o
 
 snake: ${SRCDIR} ${OBJ}
     ${CC} -o snake ${OBJ}
 
 ${SRCDIR}: /tmp
     cd $@; make

This confused me at first.  The $@ symbol refers to the target for the rule, in this case, the ${SRCDIR}.

You can use makedepend inside a makefile to resolve all that hairy .h stuff automatically:

 CFILES = main.c foo.c bar.c
 
 depend:
     makedepend $(CFILES)
 # don't edit below here.

''TODO: show example before and after Makefile.''

If you have lots and lots of files and you want to compile them all into objects, this rule works:

 .c.o:
     $(CC) -c $&lt;


=== Converting C to assembly ===

 gcc -S try.c

This will convert your program to assembly code, using GNU syntax.  gcc will create a file called try.s

 gcc -S -masm=intel try.c

This will convert your code to assembly code using intel syntax.  This may only work on intel CPUs.

You can convert try.s to an executable like so:

 gcc try.s

And you can even compile the executable for use with gdb:

 gcc -g try.s

And then you can step through the underlying assembly code in gdb.  Hurray!

== Appendix B: Solutions to Exercises ==

=== 4.1.1 POSIX Threads ===

The task for this exercise was to rewrite the example code to use fork() rather than threads. You should have something similar to this:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
 
 int main()
 {
     /*
      * The name of our process.  This lets us tell the difference when we
      * do output.
      */
     const char* name;
 
     /*
      * Our counter variable.  Because this is all in one function, it need not
      * be global.
      */
     int i;
     i = 0;
     
     pid_t pid = fork();
     if(pid == 0)
     {
         name = &quot;Child&quot;;
     }
     else
     {
         name = &quot;Parent&quot;;
     }
 
     /* Our output loop. */
     int j;
     for(j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++)
     {
         sleep(1);
         printf(&quot;%s process: %d\n&quot;, name, i);
         i++;
     }
     
     return 0;
 }

You were also asked in what way the output was different, and why.
In the version that made use of POSIX Threads, the counter was incremented twice each second: once by each thread.  When fork() was used, it was only incremented once.  The reason for this is that when fork() is called, the child process writes to its own copy of the counter.  When threads are used, however, both threads share their memory space.  This means that they are both writing to the same copy of the counter, and it is incremented twice.

A good deal of real world problems can be represented by various equations. Often, we will have more than one equation for a given problem. 

=Substitution=
Substitution uses letters, such as x, y, or z, as representations of unknown values.  These letters are used in both equations and expressions as tools to solve many different types of problems.  In some cases, the value of the letter is known.  If so, by using the substitution method, a numerical value replaces the letter given.  Then, after the letter is replaced by a number, the expression or equation is simplified.

==Introductory Examples==
===People &amp; Feet===
In a room of people we know there are twice as many feet as people, and we can represent this with the equation &lt;math&gt;f = 2p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of feet, and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of people. Knowing there are 20 people, then we can make another equation &lt;math&gt;p = 20&lt;/math&gt;. Listing out the two equations we have:

{|| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; font-size: large;&quot; valign=top|
|&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2p&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 20&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;|&lt;p&gt;Substituting for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we get the equation&lt;/p&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 \times 20&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 40&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So we know there are 40 feet.

===Houses &amp; Floorspace===
Other situations can get more complex though. Suppose that your neighbor's house is 1.5 times as large as yours, but if you don't count your neighbor's 50 square unit basement, they are the same size. How many square units are the respective houses? Let &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be the area of your entire floor, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the area of your neighbor's floor. The problem can represented by the two equations.

{|| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; font-size: large;&quot; valign=top|
|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=1.5y&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=n-50&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here, you have two equations as before, but this time they both have two variables, while in the last example, one equation had one variable and the other had two. However, you can still use substitution though you just have to substitute with the equation's expression instead of a constant. Now we substitute &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the second equation for the right-hand side of the first equation:

{|| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; font-size: large;&quot; valign=top|
|&lt;math&gt;1.5y - 50&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= y&lt;/math&gt;
|''Subtract y from both sides''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;0.5y - 50&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt;
|''Add 50 to both sides''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;0.5y&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 50&lt;/math&gt;
|''Multiply both sides by 2''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 100&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now we can substitute the area of your floor into the first equation to get the area of your neighbours floor:

{|| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; font-size: large;&quot; valign=top|
|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;= 1.5 \times 100&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=150&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Systems of Linear Equations==
Above we covered two real world examples (albeit simplified) that systems of equations are useful for solving. Equations composed of two or more linear functions are called [[w:Linear equation|Linear equations]]. Sets of these linear equations are called [[w:System of linear equations|System of linear equations]]. Simply put, linear equations can only be solved if the number of [[w:Variables|Variables]] is equal to or less than the number of equations provided. The most common way of solving systems of equations is to use substitution, as shown above. However, we can represent the equations using [[w:Matrix (mathematics)|matrices,]] allowing us to see patterns easier and perform operations more easily. Lets start with a set of 3 equations:

{|| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; font-size: large;&quot; valign=top|
|&lt;math&gt;x + 2y + 3z&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 12&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y + z&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 17&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;3x + y + 2z&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 19&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The matrix on the left represents the coefficients of the variables, and is called a [[w:coefficient matrix|coefficient matrix]]. On the right the right-hand side of the equation is included in the matrix, giving us what is called an [[w:augmented matrix|augmented matrix]].

{|| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; font-size: large;&quot; valign=top|
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \vdots &amp; 12 \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; \vdots &amp; 17 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \vdots &amp; 19 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Solving the above equation would look like the table on the left below normally, whereas the matrix solution would look like the table on the right.

Logic has a long history, and is one of the central tenets of western thought. Going back to the ancient philosophers, logic has been the attempt to devise a system for ascertaining truth via thought. Logic falls under the category of deductive reasoning, meaning it is used to establish truth based upon already established truths, called postulates or axioms.

The oldest and most influential axiom system would be from Euclid's Elements, the classic geometry text, which ranks as one of the most important books of all time. Euclid starts off his first book with 23 definitions and 5 postulates. The postulates basically describe what can be done with an unmarked ruler and a compass. For instance, the first postulate says that a line can be drawn between two points. The second says that lines can be extended, and the third says that circles can be drawn with a center and a given radius.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mj ivan. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mj ivan~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you look out from an empty field into a dark sky, you will get the impression that you are standing on a flat plate, enclosed by a giant dome. Depth perception fails us for the distant objects we see in the sky. This creates the appearance that all of the stars have the same distance.

The stars appear to move together across the sky during the night, rising in the east and setting in the west, as if they are affixed to the inside of a dome. Because of this, many ancient civilizations believed that a dome really did enclose the Earth. Only a few centuries ago astronomers came to realize that the stars are actually very far away, scattered throughout the Milky Way Galaxy, rather than attached to the inside of a vast sphere.

The old idea remains useful, however. The concept of the '''celestial sphere''' provides a simple way of thinking about the appearance of the stars from Earth without the complication of a more realistic model of the universe. Working with the celestial sphere offers a convenient way of describing what we see from Earth. When we refer to the celestial sphere, we are imagining that everything we see on the sky is set on the inside of a huge spherical shell that surrounds the Earth. We will use the reference points of the celestial sphere as the basis for several coordinate systems used to place celestial locations with respect to one another and to us.

The celestial sphere is an imaginary hollow globe that encloses the Earth. The sphere has no defined size. It can be taken to be infinite (or at least really big), with an infinitesimal Earth at the center. The observer is always taken to be at the center of the celestial sphere, even though the observer isn't at the center of the Earth. Our particular position among the stars gives us a particular view. Brighter stars appear closer; stars in nearly the same direction appear nearby each other, even if they are separated by great distances. Our first and most basic look out into the universe is completely stripped of any depth perception.

The celestial sphere can be seen from either of two perspectives. In one perspective, the celestial sphere itself remains still while the Earth turns inside it. In the other perspective, the Earth stands still and the celestial sphere rotates once per day. To an observer on Earth, these two perspectives appear the same. As we think about how we would expect to perceive the rotation of the Earth, we can use this second perspective to guide us.

Everything we see in the sky, we see as though projected onto the celestial sphere. The stars in the constellation Orion, for example, are at a variety of distances, but the differences are imperceptible to us on Earth. Orion's pattern would disappear if we could view it from any other angle or if we could perceive the depth, because the stars would project differently.

Because depth perception is lost, measurements of size are much more difficult. The Sun and the Moon look about the same size in the sky, even though the Sun is really much larger. The Sun appears to be the same size as the moon because the Sun is much farther away simply because the Sun is both 400 times larger in diameter and 400 times farther away than the Moon.

[[Image:Hand Angles.svg|thumb|170px|left|To gauge angles of distant objects, hold your hand at arms length and compare the appearance of the distant object to the size of your hand. If you can just cover the object with your index finger, then you know that the object subtends about one degree.]]

Although we can't easily measure the ''physical'' sizes of celestial objects, we can measure their ''apparent'' sizes. We do this by measuring the angle an object subtends in the sky. The Sun and the Moon, for example, subtend an angular diameter of half a degree. Most objects in the sky are smaller than this, so it is often convenient to use a smaller measure of angle. For this purpose, astronomers use '''arc minutes''' and '''arc seconds'''. There are sixty arc minutes in a degree, and sixty arc seconds in an arc minute. Angles this small are near or beyond the limits of ordinary human vision, but they become useful when using a telescope to make observations.

For casual stargazing, observers think about much larger angles. You can easily measure these angles when stargazing by using your hand, held at arms length with fingers outstretched, as your ruler. From arm's length, your index finger has a width of about one degree, your palm measures about ten degrees across, and your full finger-span is about 25°. This can be useful for estimating the position of a star in the sky, or for gauging the angular separation of two stars.

While the apparent movement of a star across the sky each night, with the celestial sphere, is great, the measurement of an object's movement across the Celestial Sphere as the object drifts through space, is called '''proper motion''', and is measured in arc seconds per year.

To begin thinking about the view of the sky from Earth, we will identify a few points of reference that are fixed to the ground and of importance to astronomers. Some of these are widely known from common experience.

[[Image:Great Circle.svg|right|thumb|213px|The circle drawn at the top is not an example of a great circle because it is not centered on the center of Earth. The upper circle is called a &quot;small circle.&quot; The circle at bottom is a great circle because its center is the same as the center of Earth.]]

*A '''great circle''' is a circle drawn on the celestial sphere (or any sphere) which has the center of the Earth as its center. On the Earth, the equator is an example of a great circle. Other lines of latitude are not great circles because their center is not at the center of Earth. Lines of longitude are all great circles because they are always centered on Earth's center. A great circle is the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere.
*The '''horizon''' is where earth and sky meet. It is the boundary between the portion of the sky that is blocked by the Earth and the portion that is visible. There is a distinction between the ''local horizon'', which is defined by real objects specific to the observer's location such as trees or buildings, and the ''idealized horizon'', which is what the local horizon would be if the ground were completely flat and there were no obstructions. For hypothetical or idealized cases, astronomers use the idealized horizon.
*A star's '''altitude''' is the angle between it and the horizon.
*The '''cardinal points''' are points on the celestial sphere that are on the horizon and due north, south, east and west. The North point, for example, is the point due north on the horizon.
*The '''zenith''' is the point in the sky directly overhead. It is necessarily true that any point on the horizon is 90° from the zenith.
*The '''meridian''' is the great circle that passes through the North point, the South point, and the zenith and lies on the celestial sphere.

[[image:Celestial Sphere.bjb.svg|thumb|438px|The celestial sphere for an observer at mid-northern latitudes.]]

To any observer, regardless of location, these markers stay in the same positions relative to the observer. The zenith is always directly overhead, the horizon is always level, and so on. Observers standing at different places on Earth will have a different view of the sky. An observer in Singapore might see the Sun at the zenith while another observer in New York would not see the Sun at all. These reference points change with the location of the observer.

There are also reference points that are fixed in the sky.  These fixed reference points don't move with respect to the stars, but different observers see them in different positions. They are the basis for the fixed coordinate systems that we discuss later. For now, we will identify only the two most useful of these &amp;mdash; the '''celestial poles''' and the '''celestial equator'''.

The celestial equator is an extension of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere. If you stand on Earth's equator, the celestial equator will always be directly overhead and pass through the zenith. It will run from the East point up to the zenith and down again to the West point. Anywhere you stand on Earth, the celestial equator will intersect the East and West points on the horizon. The nearer you are to the equator, the nearer the celestial equator come to the zenith. At the North Pole or the South Pole, the celestial equator lines up with the horizon.

Like the celestial equator, the celestial poles are an extension of the Earth's pole onto the celestial sphere. The North Pole extends out into space to create the North Celestial Pole. Likewise the South Pole creates the South Celestial Pole. In the Northern Hemisphere, only the North Celestial Pole is visible because the South Celestial Pole is below the horizon. In the Southern Hemisphere, only the South Celestial Pole is visible. At the equator, the North Celestial and South Celestial Poles would lie on the horizon where the meridian intersects the horizon.

Polaris is called the &quot;North Star.&quot; It can be found at the last star on the &quot;handle&quot; of the Small Dipper. The last two stars of the &quot;cup&quot; of the Big Dipper are called the Guardians (or &quot;Pointers&quot;), and point to Polaris in the sky. Polaris is special because the Earth's North Pole points almost exactly towards it. This means that Polaris will always appear to be due north to any observer, and it will always stay in the same position on the sky.

Often, beginning stargazers assume that Polaris must be a very bright or prominent star. This is not really the case. Polaris is only remarkable because it is almost exactly in line with Earth's axis of rotation. Because of this, Polaris always remains at nearly the same place in the sky. For example, Shakespeare made reference to Polaris in the play ''Julius Caesar'':

:I am constant as the northern star,
:Of whose true fixed and resting quality
:There is no fellow in the firmament.
::Julius Caesar, William Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', III.1.65-68

Though it must be pointed out that Shakespeare actually got it wrong. At the time Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar Polaris was indeed the pole star but in Julius Ceasar's time Polaris was not the pole star.

[[Image:Polaris Altitude.svg|left|thumb|200px|This diagram shows that the altitude of Polaris above the horizon is the same as the observer's latitude. Note that the lines drawn to Polaris are parallel because Polaris is very far away. The direction to Polaris from the center of Earth is very nearly the same as from the observer's position.]]

The fact that Polaris always stays in the same position due north has given it much fame. It also makes Polaris a useful reference point for navigation &amp;mdash; Using geometry, it is easy to show that the angle Polaris or the celestial pole makes with the horizon is equal to the observer's latitude. In the diagram, the angle &lt;math&gt;\angle d&lt;/math&gt; is the observer's latitude. The pole and the equator are at right angles, so
:&lt;math&gt;\angle d + \angle a = 90^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;
or &lt;math&gt;\angle a = 90^\circ - \angle d.&lt;/math&gt; Since the angles in a triangle add to 180°, we know that
:&lt;math&gt;\angle a + \angle b + 90^\circ = 180^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;
When we combine these two equations, we have &lt;math&gt;\angle b = \angle d&lt;/math&gt;. The angles &lt;math&gt;\angle b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle c&lt;/math&gt; are alternate interior angles, so
:&lt;math&gt;\angle b = \angle c&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\angle d = \angle c,&lt;/math&gt;
which means that the angle between the pole and the horizon is the same as the observer's latitude. This fact was once used by navigators at sea, who could easily find their latitude by measuring the position of Polaris.

Like many things in astronomy, the celestial sphere can be very difficult to visualize because of its three dimensional geometry. A visit to a planetarium or a session under the night sky can be very helpful to you in developing a conceptual understanding of the celestial sphere. In the absence of the opportunity for these, it can be helpful to try to draw diagrams such as the one at the beginning of this section for yourself.

To begin drawing a celestial sphere such as the one above, you only need to know the latitude of the observer. Then imagine that the spot where the observer is standing is the &quot;top of the world&quot;; draw circle for the earth, and draw an observer standing at the top. Now draw a much larger circle around that; this represents the celestial sphere. 

Since our observer is always on top of the Earth, the features on the celestial sphere that are defined relative to the ground will always be in the same position on the sphere. The zenith is the point directly above the observer's head, at the top of the celestial sphere.

The next important reference is the horizon. The horizon will be horizontal on the diagram. Remember that the celestial sphere has no specific size relative to the Earth, regardless of how you've drawn it. Draw the horizon across the middle of the celestial sphere, so that it's center is the same as the center of Earth. Markers such as the horizon are always idealized, so it doesn't matter whether your observer's view of the sky is actually cut off at the position marked by the horizon.

The next reference points we'd like to place are the North Celestial Pole and the South Celestial Pole. Think about what the orientation of the pole should be given the observer's latitude. If the observer is at the equator, the pole should go horizontally through the Earth. If the observer is at one of the poles, the pole should go through the Earth vertically. Extend the Earth's poles out to the celestial sphere and mark the intersections as the North Celestial Pole and the South Celestial Pole.

If we're in the northern hemisphere, the North Celestial Pole will be above the northernmost point on the horizon, and the South Celestial Pole will be on the opposite side of the celestial sphere, below the horizon. If we're in the southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed. Remember to check that the angle the horizon makes with the pole is about the same as the observer's latitude.

For any given latitude, one can build an appropriate celestial sphere. First, consider the sky in relation to the earth. Take the north and south poles and extend them into the sky; these become the north and south celestial poles. The Earth's equator can be projected outward to form the celestial equator. We'll get something that looks like the picture above.

[[File:Observers Horizon.svg]]

[[image:Draw Celestial Sphere.bjb.svg]]

When you're done, you should have a celestial sphere very like the one at the top of this section.

A celestial sphere forms the basis for the application of many coordinate systems.  For example, the horizon and the celestial meridian together form the reference circles for giving the position of stars in terms of altitude and azimuth, making it easier for one to find them on the night sky. The celestial sphere is also a natural system for describing the motion of the sun. In order to explore these concepts, however, it is necessary to understand just how the celestial sphere changes for an observer at a given latitude. As we consider the daily rotation of the Earth, we'll see that your perception of the daily motion depends very much on your latitude.

As you look at the sky, your mind will naturally identify obvious patterns. The Big Dipper and Orion are two very prominent groupings of stars, and others stand out all over the celestial sphere. These '''asterisms''' are guideposts to the night sky. You can use them to keep your bearings when you look at the sky. The appearance of the night sky has remained much the same for millennia. Many of the ancient civilizations across the globe invented stories about the sky.

Often, the groups of stars are called '''constellations'''. Constellations have a very long history in astronomy, dating back thousands of years. Early in the twentieth century, a list of constellations was formally established by the International Astronomical Union, a widely recognized body of astronomers. The IAU identified constellations that would be used in astronomy and defined specific boundaries to unambiguously establish which constellations each star belonged to. It's easy to learn a few of the most prominent constellations so that you can find your way around the night sky. Beginning with a few easy-to-find landmarks you can find the rest by using familiar stars as guideposts.

Another useful guide in the sky is the '''ecliptic'''. The ecliptic is an imaginary line in the sky that the sun draws. The ecliptic is even with the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun; thus, all of the main planets and the moon should be found relatively close or on the ecliptic, because the solar system is mostly flat. Also, along the ecliptic are the 12 constellations of the zodiac. Thus, by finding some of the main zodiac constellations in the night sky, one can determine if certain objects they see may or may not be planets by whether or not they lie on the ecliptic.

Suppose you are an astronomer in America. You observe an exciting event (say, a supernova) in the sky and would like to tell your colleagues in Europe about it. Suppose the supernova appeared at your zenith. You can't tell astronomers in Europe to look at their zenith because their zenith points in a different direction. You might tell them which constellation to look in. This might not work, though, because it might be too hard to find the supernova by searching an entire constellation. The best solution would be to give them an exact position by using a coordinate system.

On Earth, you can specify a location using latitude and longitude. This system works by measuring the angles separating the location from two great circles on Earth (namely, the equator and the prime meridian). Coordinate systems in the sky work in the same way.

The equatorial coordinate system is the most commonly used. The equatorial system defines two coordinates: '''right ascension''' and '''declination''', based on the axis of the Earth's rotation. The declination is the angle of an object north or south of the celestial equator. Declination on the celestial sphere corresponds to latitude on the Earth. The right ascension of an object is defined by the position of a point on the celestial sphere called the vernal equinox. The further an object is east of the vernal equinox, the greater its right ascension.


A coordinate system is a system designed to establish positions with respect to given reference points. The coordinate system consists of one or more reference points, the styles of measurement (linear measurement or angular measurement) from those reference points, and the directions (or axes) in which those measurements will be taken. In astronomy, various coordinate systems are used to precisely define the locations of astronomical objects.


Latitude and longitude are used to locate a certain position on the Earth's surface. The lines of latitude (horizontal) and the lines of longitude (vertical) make up an invisible grid over the earth. Lines of latitude are called parallels. Lines of longitude aren't completely straight (they run from the exact point of the north pole to the exact point of the south pole) so they are called meridians. 0 degrees latitude is the Earth's middle, called the equator. 0 degrees longitude was tricky because there really is no middle of the earth vertically. It was finally agreed that the observatory in Greenwich, U.K. would be 0 degrees longitude due to its significant role in scientific discoveries and creating latitude and longitude. 0 degrees longitude is called the prime meridian.

Latitude and longitude are measured in degrees. One degree is about 69 miles. There are sixty minutes (') in a degree and sixty seconds (&quot;) in a minute. These tiny units make GPS's (Global Positioning Systems) much more exact.

There are a few main lines of latitude:the Arctic Circle, the Antarctic Circle, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. The Antarctic Circle is 66.5 degrees south of the equator and it marks the temperate zone from the Antarctic zone. The Arctic Circle is an exact mirror in the north. The Tropic of Cancer separates the tropics from the temperate zone. It is 23.5 degrees north of the equator. It is mirrored in the south by the Tropic of Capricorn.

=== Horizontal coordinate system ===

One of the simplest ways of placing a star on the night sky is the coordinate system based on altitude and azimuth, thus called the Alt-Az or horizontal coordinate system. The reference circles for this system are the horizon and the celestial meridian, both of which may be most easily graphed for a given location using the celestial sphere.

In simplest terms, the altitude is the angle made from the position of the celestial object (e.g. star) to the point nearest it on the horizon. The azimuth is the angle from the northernmost point of the horizon (which is also its intersection with the celestial meridian) to the point on the horizon nearest the celestial object. Usually azimuth is measured eastwards from due north. So east has az=90°, south has az=180°, west has az=270° and north has az=360° (or 0°).
An object's altitude and azimuth change as the earth rotates.

=== Equatorial coordinate system ===

The equatorial coordinate system is another system that uses two angles to place an object on the sky: right ascension and declination.

=== Ecliptic coordinate system ===

The ecliptic coordinate system is based on the ecliptic plane, i.e., the plane which contains our Sun and Earth's average orbit around it, which is tilted at 23°26' from the plane of Earth's equator. The great circle at which this plane intersects the celestial sphere is the ecliptic, and one of the coordinates used in the ecliptic coordinate system, the ecliptic latitude, describes how far an object is to ecliptic north or to ecliptic south of this circle. On this circle lies the point of the vernal equinox (also called the first point of Aries); ecliptic longitude is measured as the angle of an object relative to this point to ecliptic east. Ecliptic latitude is generally indicated by ''φ'', whereas ecliptic longitude is usually indicated by ''λ''.

=== Galactic coordinate system ===

As a member of the Milky Way Galaxy, we have a clear view  of the Milky Way from Earth. Since we are inside the Milky Way, we don't see the galaxy's spiral arms, central bulge and so forth directly as we do for other galaxies. Instead, the Milky Way completely encircles us. We see the Milky Way as a band of faint starlight forming a ring around us on the celestial sphere. The disk of the galaxy forms this ring, and the bulge forms a bright patch in the ring. You can easily see the Milky Way's faint band from a dark, rural location.

Our galaxy defines another useful coordinate system &amp;mdash; the '''galactic coordinate system'''. This system works just like the others we've discussed. It also uses two coordinates to specify the position of an object on the celestial sphere. The galactic coordinate system first defines a galactic latitude, the angle an object makes with the galactic equator. The galactic equator has been selected to run through the center of the Milky Way's band. The second coordinate is galactic longitude, which is the angular separation of the object from the galaxy's &quot;prime meridian,&quot; the great circle that passes through the Galactic center and the galactic poles. The galactic coordinate system is useful for describing an object's position with respect to the galaxy's center. For example, if an object has high galactic latitude, you might expect it to be less obstructed by interstellar dust.

=== Transformations between coordinate systems ===
[[Image:Law-of-haversines.svg|right|thumb|A spherical triangle solved by the law of cosines.]]
One can use the principles of spherical trigonometry as applied to triangles on the celestial sphere to derive formulas for transforming coordinates in one system to those in another. These formulas generally rely on the spherical law of cosines, known also as the cosine rule for sides. By substituting various angles on the celestial sphere for the angles in the law of cosines and by thereafter applying basic trigonometric identities, most of the formulas necessary for coordinate transformations can be found. The law of cosines is stated thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(c) = \cos(a) \cos(b) + \sin(a) \sin(b) \cos(C). \,&lt;/math&gt;

To transform from horizontal to equatorial coordinates, the relevant formulas are as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;Dec = \arcsin\left[\sin(Alt) \sin(Lat) + \cos(Alt) \cos(Lat) \cos(Az)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;RA = LST - \arccos\left[{\sin(Alt) - \sin(Dec) \sin(Lat) \over \cos(Dec) \cos(Lat)}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RA'' is the right ascension, ''Dec'' is the declination, ''LST'' is the local sidereal time, ''Alt'' is the altitude, ''Az'' is the azimuth, and ''Lat'' is the observer's latitude. Using the same symbols and formulas, one can also derive formulas to transform from equatorial to horizontal coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;Alt = \arcsin\left[\sin(Dec) \sin(Lat) + \cos(Dec) \cos(Lat) \cos(LST - RA)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Az = \arccos\left[{\sin(Dec) - \sin(Alt) \sin(Lat) \over \cos(Alt) \cos(Lat)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Transformation from equatorial to ecliptic coordinate systems can similarly be accomplished using the following formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arcsin\left[\sin(Dec) \cos(\epsilon) - \cos(Dec) \sin(\epsilon) \sin(RA)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \arcsin\left[{\sin(Dec) - \sin(\phi) \cos(\epsilon) \over \cos(\phi) \sin(\epsilon)}\right] = \arctan\left[{\sin(RA) \cos(\epsilon) + \tan(Dec) \sin(\epsilon) \over \cos(RA)}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RA'' is the right ascension, ''Dec'' is the declination, ''φ'' is the ecliptic latitude, ''λ'' is the ecliptic longitude, and ''ε'' is the tilt of Earth's axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Again, using the same formulas and symbols, new formulas for transforming ecliptic to equatorial coordinate systems can be found:

:&lt;math&gt;Dec = \arcsin\left[\sin(\phi) \cos(\epsilon) + \cos(\phi) \sin(\epsilon) \sin(\lambda)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;RA = \arcsin\left[{\sin(Dec) \cos(\epsilon) - \sin(\phi) \over \cos(Dec) \sin(\epsilon)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Estimates of the number of galaxies in the universe range from 10 billion to over 100 billion. [http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/TopazMurray.shtml]

According to '''Hubble's Law''', galaxies are red-shifted. This means that they're moving away from us.

The most common form of classification for galaxies is based on the visible structure of the galaxy, organized in a form called the '''Hubble Diagram'''.  The Hubble diagram is a pictoral representation of galaxy types developed by Edwin Hubble. It is also called the tuning-fork diagram as a result of its shape. Galaxy types are divided as follows:


{|
|-
|
 ||  || ||  || / || Sa || Sb || Sc
|-
| E0 || ... || E7 || S0 || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  || || Ir 
|-
|
 ||  || ||  || \ || SBa || SBb || SBc
|}

where E0 to E7 are elliptical galaxies, S0 is a transitional type, Sa to Sc are spiral galaxies, SBa to SBc are barred spiral galaxies, and Ir are irregular galaxies.

: 
* Elliptical galaxies have an ellipsoidal form, with a fairly even distribution of stars throughout. The number gives the degree of eccentricity: E0 galaxies are nearly spherical, while E7 are greatly elongated.
* S0 galaxies appear to have a disk-like structure with a central spherical &quot;bulge&quot; projecting from it. They do not show any spiral structure.
* Spiral galaxies have a central &quot;bulge&quot; and an outlying &quot;disk&quot;; the disk is notable for having spiral &quot;arms&quot; within it, centered on the bulge. Sa galaxies have very &quot;tightly wound&quot; arms, while Sc galaxies are very loose spirals.
[[Image:M31bobo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Andromeda Galaxy is a spiral galaxy within the Andromeda constellation.]]
* As spiral galaxies mature, the center becomes red. The arms are bluish.
* Barred spiral galaxies have a similar sort of spiral structure to spiral galaxies, but instead of emanating from the bulge, the arms project out from the ends of a &quot;bar&quot; running through the bulge, like ribbons on either end of a baton. Again, SBa to SBc refer to how &quot;tightly wound&quot; these arms are.
* Irregular galaxies show no clearly discernable or regular shape. (E.g. the large and small Magellanic Clouds, which can be seen from Earth's southern hemisphere.)

Hubble based his classification on photographs of the galaxies through the telescopes of the time. He originally believed that elliptical galaxies were an early form, which might later evolved into spirals; our current understanding suggests that the situation is roughly opposite.

More modern observations of galaxies have given us the following information about these types:
:
* Elliptical galaxies are generally fairly low in gas and dust, and are composed mostly of older stars.
* Spiral galaxies generally have plentiful supplies of gas and dust, and have a broad mix of older and younger stars.
* Irregular galaxies are fairly rich in gas, dust, and young stars. 

From this, astronomers have constructed a theory of galaxy evolution which suggests that ellipticals are, in fact, the result of collisions between spiral and/or irregular galaxies, which strip out much of the gas and dust and randomize the orbits of the stars.

Young galaxies are more blue, while old galaxies are more red.

I'm not sure the &quot;IRAF&quot; entry under &quot;Tools of Astronomy&quot; was what the person originally outlining the page had in mind. In the normal course of instruction, the principles of light and gravity, as they relate to astronomy, would be discussed in such a section - not the tools for image reduction per se.  A section for astronomical techniques could be added, of course.  [[User:April Follies|April Follies]] 04:50, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Cleanup of this Wikibook ==

I added the RfD to this page, and the subsequent discussion on [[WB:RFD]], because I feel that many of the modules in this Wikibook are much better written and better monitored on Wikipedia.  As this current is organized, this Wikibook is a fork of the Wikipedia Astronomy Wikiproject and not coherantly organized into a textbook at all but is instead a Macropedia.

Keep in mind, what I'm proposing is entirely my own idea on how a Wikibook should be organized, and you can certainly argue against what I'm saying here and suggest this is patent nonsense.  I am however trying to improve Wikibooks in general one little part at a time.

What we need to start with here is to restart this Wikibook with a formal outline that introduces astrophysics concepts in a chronological order (for teaching... not necessarily the order they were discovered) instead of a bunch of independent modules.  Some key sections would include the following:

*Cosmology - How the universe began and where it may ultimately go
*History of Astronomy - Kepler, Brahe, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, ect.
*Philosophical movement from Earth-centered universe to Sun-centered universe to no-center of the Universe.
*Why we know what we know about stars and planets:
**H-R Diagrams
**Stellar Parallax
**Spectral classifications
**Distance measurement
**Planetary probes (Voyager, Cassini, Pioneer, etc.)
*Basic Newtonian laws of Motion
*And many more astronomy topics

A much earlier RfD was started about [[Mercury]] because it was a blatant copy &amp; paste from a NASA website.  In that case, because it was public domain and Wikibooks was a much younger project simply in need of content, the article was allowed to remain.  I am now challenging that presumption, and suggesting that this whole Wikibook needs a major cleanup including deletion of many of the current set of modules and essentially &quot;starting over again&quot; but this time to become a real textbook about Astronomy.

Any of the sections on planets that go into deeper detail than the Wikpedia articles shoud be independent Wikibooks in their own right, being added to an Astronomy bookshelf instead.  Anything less should stay on Wikipedia, unless it is a clear stub that shows regular progress to becoming its own book.

I'm also going to try and get some support from the Astronomy Wikiproject crew, as they may have some suggestions of their own on this topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:11, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that this material should be reorganized to more closely resemble a traditional astronomy textbook, but I don't think it makes sense to put cosmology (meaning the complete treatment of cosmology) at the very front. A &quot;you are here&quot; type of chapter seems much more sensible, and that's probably what you have in mind anyway. A lot of cleanup seems to be needed around here. The biggest problems I see are:

:Is having external links for content good policy? Maybe we can find out whether the author of that material is willing to publish under GFDL. If not, is it better to keep the link, move it to a list, or remove it entirely?

:Over the past month or so the planets section has been &quot;supplemented&quot; with ephemerides and other tables. These don't seem at all appropriate -- they're way too long and too cryptic for an introductory text. I've gone ahead and removed these. Apologies to whoever put these up... Is there some more appropriate place for them?

:The organization of the book past the first few chapters should probably be fleshed out.

:I'll be thinking about this as I have time, which doesn't happen too often. Thanks very much to the earlier contributors, and for your comments, Rob. --[[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 20:14, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

[[Transwiki:Astronomy for beginners]] is now available for merger into this wikibook. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 04:44, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

== renaming chapters of the Astronomy book ==

Here's my plan:
* Make up new names for each module, that match the latest [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]], and put them on this [[Astronomy]] page. (They will, of course, all be red, since they don't exist yet).
* Temporarily, every link will be doubled -- one blue, one red.
* Slowly move each module to a better name.
* Once all the doubled links turn blue, delete all the old names (that now only point to redirects).

Just letting you know what I'm doing.
I hope this makes sense.
--[[User:70.189.75.148|70.189.75.148]] 07:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

:Sounds great. Remember that articles should be moved from the &quot;move&quot; tab at the top of each page, rather than copied and pasted. --[[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 04:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== RfD for [[Astronomical events]] ==

This is just an FYI to anybody involved with this Astronomy Wikibook.  I've added a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|RfD]] notice to try and decide as a community where to put this sort of content.  There is also [[s:Wikisource:Proposed deletions#January 2006|discussion on Wikisource]] about this same content that is currently duplicated there.  Feedback in both places is encouraged.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:19, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:Wikisource decided to keep Moon, Ceres, Pallas and Juno, so the proposed deletion is [[s:Wikisource:Proposed deletions/Archives/2006/01#Moon, Ceres, Pallas and Juno|now in the archives]].

:I changed [[Astronomy]] to link to [[Wikisource:Astronomical events]] instead of our copy. I plan to make links from that Wikisource page to Moon, Ceres, Pallas, and Juno. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:52, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

==Consistency in chapter names==

Currently quite a few of the chapter or subchapter names in the table of contents do not coincide with the names on the actual pages.  I propose that they be made the same, either by changing the one to coincide with the other, or by combining them into an expanded name in each case.  [[User:Douglas W. Mitchell|Douglas W.

It seems that the book would benefit from a section about amateur astronomy. Definition and simple guide including how to access available resources, for instance the new [http://venus.datsi.fi.upm.es/gloria/index.php/en/ &quot;GLObal Robotic-telescopes Intelligent Array&quot; (GLORIA)] that will be the first free and open- access [http://www.gizmag.com/gloria-internet-astronomy-project/20196/ network of robotic telescopes of the world].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:38, 19 October 2011 (UTC)

== Kepler’s third law have a mistake ==

=== Kepler’s third law have a mistake ===

In astronomy, Kepler’s laws give a description of the motion of planets around the Sun. Kepler's laws are only valid when not affected by the gravity of other planets, however，Kepler’s third law does not follow this restriction. For this reason, It simply has no use at all in our Solar System. Kepler's third law assumes that all planets are not affected by the gravity of other planets and the orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.This is not true. If the planet did not affected by the gravity of other planets, then the orbit of every planet is a circle. The orbit of the planet have an ellipse only because affected by the gravity of other planets. , Kepler’s third law, T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/a&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;=K, only good for comets and not for our Solar System, for this mistake we have a new third law as T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(ab)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;=K.


=== I will add three new laws: ===

=== Fourth law: === 

In solar system, All planets, no matter their size, their mass, their shape, their radius should follow (ab)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =1,

Where T is Orbit Period,
a is the semi-major respect to earth
b is the semi-minor respect to earth

=== Fifth law: === 

In solar system, every precession of the orbits of planets has different precession with different ellipses. Every different ellipse has its orbital eccentricity between maximum e and 0. And all different ellipses have the same area, include circle of e=0.

=== For example: ===
The precession of the orbit of Mercury is 11.83 degree/ century. Every year have different ellipse between e= 0.20563069 and e=0, but every different ellipse or circle has the same area.

=== Sixth law: ===
&lt;br /&gt;
To determine whether it is a planet or not, it is not according their size, their mass, their radius, or their shape, but one must fulfill the fourth law.

=== For example: ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Planet   !! Orbit Period !! (ab)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; !! ((ab)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;)/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Mercury  || 0.2408467   || 0.387  || 0.999197859

=== Conclusion: ===


1. Obviously, Pluto does not follow the forth law, therefore, Pluto is not a planet, not even a dwarf planet. It is not because it is small, or other reasons, but because it is not fulfill with the fourth law. Therefore, it is not one of the family.


2. There are two reasons that why Pluto does not belong to the solar system. Pluto may be a comet or half a comet, because

A. Pluto is an alien, may come from other galaxies.

B. Pluto may joint with a planet and a member of the other galaxies.


3. A planet cannot be discriminated because of their size, their mass, their radius, their color, or that they are ugly not round . As long as they fulfill with the fourth law, They are planets. Otherwise they are not planet.</text>

Why do we have seasons?  A little thought will suggest that it can't have much to do with the Earth's distance from the sun, as that would affect the Southern and Northern Hemispheres at the same time. (In fact, the Earth is slightly nearer to the sun around December than at other times of the year.) Why, then are there seasons?

Every year the Earth completes one orbit of the Sun. We see this observe the effect as the change of the seasons and the movement of the constellations. Over the course of a year, the Sun moves through a great circle on the celestial sphere, tracing out the same path year after year. This path is called the '''ecliptic'''. The ecliptic is not only the path of the Sun in the sky, it also marks the plane of the Earth's orbit of the Sun. 
The planets orbit the Sun in different planes but near to the ecliptic.

[[image:earthtilt.jpg|thumb|left|560px|The Earth is tilted with respect to the ecliptic plane by 23.5°]]

The axis of the Earth's rotation is tilted by 23½° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. Globes are typically built with an inclined rotation axis. The 23½° North latitude is marked as the Tropic of Cancer and the 23½° South latitude is marked as the Tropic of Capricorn. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun will pass directly over head only between June 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 22&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; along the Tropic of Cancer. That day is called the day of the summer maximum or Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun will pass directly over head only once between December 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; along the Tropic of Capricorn. Anywhere between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, the Sun will pass directly overhead at least twice during the year, but the Sun will never pass overhead for people living outside the tropics. Within the Tropics, over the course of a year, the Sun's position in the sky changes, beginning in the southern sky about December 21, moving to the northern sky in mid-year, and ending the year back in the southern sky.

The tilt of Earth's rotation axis causes a 23½° tilt of the great circle of the ecliptic with respect to the Earth's equator. The ecliptic and the equator intersect at two points, but are otherwise separated by up to 23½°. When the sun lies at one of the intersections, it is directly overhead somewhere on the equator. This occurs at the '''equinox''', and the points on the sky where the equinox intersects the equator are also called equinoxes. Once every year, the Sun passes through the equator going north. This happens in late March &amp;mdash; the &quot;vernal&quot; or &quot;spring&quot; equinox. The &quot;autumnal&quot; equinox occurs when the Sun passes through the equator in late September. 

On the equinox days, the day and night are equally long. This is the origin of the name equinox, which is from Latin for &quot;equal night.&quot; On the day of the equinox, the Sun rises due east and sets due west. It doesn't rise to directly overhead, though, except for observers on the Equator. The equinoxes are the only days of the year that have twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of dark. After the vernal equinox, moving into Northern summertime, the Sun begins rising in the northeast and sets in the northwest. Days in the Northern Hemisphere become longer, while days in the Southern Hemisphere become shorter.

The points at which the Sun is at its greatest distance from the equator are called the '''solstices'''. The solstices mark the longest and shortest day of the year. The longest day of the year is the summer solstice and the shortest day is the winter solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice occurs when the Sun is farthest north, while the winter solstice occurs at the Sun's southernmost point. In the Southern Hemisphere, the solstices are reversed.

Viewed from space, we see that the Earth's tilt changes the exposure of different parts of the Earth to the Sun. Observers in the Northern Hemisphere will see the Sun at its lowest position in the southern sky, about December 21. They see it this way because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun and the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away. About June 22, the situation is reversed, with the Northern Hemisphere pointed toward the Sun, and the Sun will be in its extreme high point in the sky at solar noon. For an observer in the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun will appear at its lowest point in the sky in the north, about June 22, while the Sun will appear at its high point in the sky about December 21. One effect of this phenomenon is that during the months of Northern Hemisphere summer, the North Pole will be able to receive sunlight twenty-four hours a day. The Sun will remain visible through much of the autumn, passing below the horizon at the autumnal equinox. As winter sets in at the North Pole, the Sun will not be seen for six months, while that portion of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun.

As one moves toward the Earth's equator from either pole, this effect becomes less severe. At the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, one will only see a 24-hour sunlit day on the summer solstice. Further toward the equator, days will get longer during the summer and shorter during the winter; the nearer to the equator, however, the less difference there will be between the number of hours of illumination and night hours. At the equator, there's practically no difference between the length of day all through the year.

Clearly, the annual motion of the Earth around the Sun is the cause of Earth's seasons. What effect gives rise to this seasonal change is less obvious. At first glance, one might think that winter occurs when the Earth is farther from the Sun. If we realize the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have winter at different times of year, we see that this can't be right. Also, the Earth's orbit is very nearly circular. The change in the Earth's orbital distance is much too small to have a noticeable effect on Earth's climate.

Certainly the length of time each day during which sunlight falls on a particular location has a great deal to do with the seasonal changes in temperature. However, another effect less obvious, but more influential is the angle at which the sunlight hits a region. At the equator, there is little difference throughout the year as the Sun varies by 23.5 degrees on either side of the vertical. The length of the ray's path on Dec 21 at solar noon is increased by a factor of only 1.1 from a direct vertical path and the reduction of the sunlight is small. The more direct radiation gives the maximum amount of heat and energy to the earth where it falls, and therefore these areas will receive the most warmth. Away from the equator, however, the Earth's tilt means that sunlight is not received so directly and a greater amount of the Sun's energy is blocked by the longer path it takes through the atmosphere. At 50 degrees north latitude, the path the Sun's rays travel through the atmosphere on Dec 21, at solar noon, will be increased by a factor of 3.5 from a direct vertical path. In general, the rays will come at an angle that depends on the time of day, the latitude of the region from the equator, and the position of Earth in its orbit.

The constellations in the ecliptic, the '''zodiac''', have a long history in the tradition of astrology. In most newspapers, you can read a (completely unscientific) prediction of your future or some personal advice, specific to your birthday. Each entry is associated with one of the constellations of the zodiac and a range of birth dates. In the tradition of astrology, the constellation the Sun occupied on your birthday, your &quot;sign,&quot; reveals information about your personality and your future.

Interestingly, the dates given for each constellation in the newspaper don't match the Sun's position in the sky for those dates. There is a  mismatch between the date in the newspaper and the real position of the Sun of a little more than a month. The mismatch appears because the dates corresponding to each sign were set thousands of years ago. Over the course of thousands of years, the Earth &quot;wobbles&quot; on its axis, causing the calendar and the positions of the stars in the sky to shift. This wobble is caused by the pull on the equator by the sun and moon, and is called '''precession'''. It affects the positions of all the constellations with respect to the equinoxes and the pole.

The precession of the Earth is like the movement of a top. If you spin a top with the axis tilted, the axis will slowly rotate as the top spins. Likewise, the Earth's axis remains tilted at 23½°, but the orientation of this tilt changes over the course of thousands of years.

Since precession changes the direction in which Earth's pole points, it also changes which star is the North Star, if any. Earlier, we quoted Shakespeare, who referenced Polaris in ''Julius Caesar'', describing it as the northern star. Strictly, this would be incorrect. Polaris was not &quot;fixed&quot; in the sky in Julius Caesar's time because Earth's axis was pointed differently, toward the Big Dipper.

Precession is a slow drift, and a difficult motion to detect. The motion of the stars from precession only becomes noticeable to the unaided eye after many, many years of careful observation, although it becomes very quickly noticeable through a telescope. The Greek astronomer Hipparchus was the first to measure the precession by comparing his own observations to observations collected a century and a half before.

Precession changes the position of the Earth in its orbit for the solstices and the equinoxes. As the Earth's axis turns over, the moment when it points most closely towards the Sun changes, and so the seasons change. If a calendar didn't account for this, the seasons would drift as the axis precessed. Eventually, the Northern Hemisphere would be cold in July and warm in January, and the Southern Hemisphere would have warm July weather and cold January weather. The calendar takes the extra motion of precession into account by using the '''tropical year''' as its basis. The year as we usually define it is a '''sidereal year''', the time it takes for the Earth to make one orbit around the Sun. In one year, as we usually measure it, the Earth really completes a little more than a full orbit around the Sun. During a sidereal year, the Sun moves fully around the sky and back into the same position with respect to the stars. In a tropical year, the Sun goes from the Vernal Equinox, around the sky, and back to the Vernal Equinox again. During this time, the equinox has shifted slightly in its position, so that a tropical year is a bit shorter than a sidereal year.

It's easy to identify the progression of the calendar if you take careful notice of the sky. Next time you see sunrise or sunset, take notice of whether the Sun is setting due west or just north or south of west. Many ancient cultures watched the motion of the Sun carefully and over long periods of time. Using simple techniques and tools, they were able to measure periods like the length of a year very accurately. Ancient people who took notice of celestial motion would have found that the summer solstice occurred every 365 days. They would also notice that the solstice was delayed an extra day every four years. This is the reason for the leap year in the modern calendar. The delay occurs because the length of the year is a little more than 365 days &amp;mdash; closer to 365¼ days long. By taking some simple observations over a period of a few years, it is possible to measure the length of a year to surprising accuracy using this technique.

Solar calendars have been used throughout history. The ancient Babylonians thought the year had only 360 days, and made their calendar accordingly. The Islamic calendar is lunar, and is 11 (1/2) days different than the solar calendar. The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar.

Our modern calendar is handed down to us from the Ancient Roman civilization. The calendar took its first mature form as the '''Julian calendar''', almost exactly the same as the one used today. It had 365 days in a year, with a 366-day leap year every four years. In the Julian calendar, years divisible by 4 &amp;mdash; such as 1992, 1996, and 2008 &amp;mdash; are leap years. This gave the Julian calendar an average of 365¼ days per year, which is very close to the true 365.2422 day length for a tropical year. 

Although the drift of the Julian calendar is slow, the error in the calendar had accumulated enough by the sixteenth century that the Catholic Church became concerned about the drift's effect on the date of the celebration of Easter. The Italian chronologer Aloisius Lilius invented modifications to the Julian calendar to correct the difference. Pope Gregory XI instituted the new calendar, now named the '''Gregorian calendar''', in the year 1582. 

The Gregorian calendar was identical to the Julian calendar except that the leap year was skipped on years not divisible by 400. In the years 1600, 2000, and 2400, there would be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, but not 1800, 1900, or 2100. This produced a year of average length 365.2425 days, much closer to the correct value than the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar accumulates only 3 days of error over 10,000 years.

=== Discussion questions ===

1) On the date of the summer solstice, the sun is overhead on the Tropic of Cancer, and on the date of the winter solstice the sun is overhead on the Tropic of Capricorn.  Draw a quick sketch that shows the relative positions of the sun and the earth on those dates.

2) On the date when the sun is overhead on the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun is actually located in the constellation of Sagittarius.  So why did the Greeks name Tropic of Capricorn the Tropic of Capricorn instead of the Tropic of Sagittarius?

Just like the stars and planets, the Moon doesn't stay fixed in the sky but slowly moves as the Earth rotates and as the Moon moves through its orbit about the Earth. To someone taking a casual glance at the Moon, it seems as fixed as the stars. But observation of either the Moon or the stars over a period of several hours will reveal their diurnal (daily) motion across the sky. The Moon rises and sets each day. An observer who watches the Moon over the course of many days will notice the Moon moving not only with the stars, but among them. Every month, the Moon completes one fewer pass across the sky than the stars have completed. We see this because of the Moon's orbit about the Earth. As the Moon progresses through its orbit, its rising and setting times change. Each day, the Moon rises and sets fifty minutes later than the day before. 

The moon usually takes 27 days to rotate once on its axis. So any place on the surface of the moon experiences about 13 days of sunlight, followed by 13 days of darkness. Temperatures on the Moon range from -153 C at night to 253 C during the day. For example if you were standing on the surface of the moon during sunlight hours it would be blazing hot.  When the sun goes down, the temperature automatically drop 250 degrees in just a matter of moments. Furthermore, there are craters around the North and South poles of the moon which never seen the sunlight. These dark places would always be as cool as -153 C. However, there are nearby mountain peaks that are covered in continuous sunlight, and would always be hot.

The &quot;dividing line&quot; between the light and dark halves of the globe is called the terminator, as it terminates the area of darkness (and also that of daylight).

Typically, one-half of the Moon will be lit up by the Sun, while the half facing away from the Sun remains dark. (The only exception occurs during a lunar eclipse, when the Earth blocks the light falling on the lit side of the Moon.) The part illuminated by the Sun is not, it should be emphasized, always the same portion of the Moon's surface! Like the Earth, the Moon turns on its axis, exposing different areas at different times. In combination with the orbital revolution of the Moon around the Earth, this phenomenon creates the phases of the Moon as seen from Earth. The phrase &quot;Dark side of the Moon&quot; arose before the age of artificial satellites and the back side of the Moon could not be observed. Hence, the that one side was unknown or &quot;dark&quot;.

The tilt of the moon’s spin axis is only 1.54 degrees and as a result, lunar seasons are barely noticeable in most locations on the Moon. However, at the North and South poles, the height of the sun above the horizon varies by more than 3 degrees over the course of the year. In other words, it affects the percentage of sunlit regions and surface temperatures at the poles. Furthermore, the coldest areas are located in doubly shadowed regions inside small craters, in which they are located within the permanently shadowed regions of larger craters. Temperatures are as low as 35K (-238 C or -397 F) in these areas, even at noon on the warmest day of the year.

Some half of the Moon is always illuminated but the fraction of the illuminated part or the Moon's phases directly depend on the relative positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. Simply put, it's a matter of how much of the daylight side of the Moon we can see from our current viewing angle. The phase will depend on how much of the side facing toward us is illuminated at any given time. The sketch below illustrates the phases of the moon for various Earth-Moon-Sun positions (the Sun is presumed to be off of the diagram to the right):

[[Image:Lunar-Phase-Diagram.png]]

Next to each &quot;Moon&quot; is a black-and-white sketch of the phase as it would be seen from Earth when the Moon is in that position. When the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, the sunlit side of the Moon is facing completely away from us, and therefore we have the dark &quot;New Moon&quot;. When the Moon reaches the other side of the Earth, the sunlit side will be fully toward us, and we have the &quot;Full Moon&quot;. As the Moon moves from New to Full and the sunlit side grows increasingly large, we say the Moon is waxing; as we see less, in the decline from Full to New Moon, we say it is waning.

Midway between the Full Moon and New Moon, half of the sunlit side of the Moon is visible from the Earth. Because a half of the half illuminated Moon can be seen, this is referred to as a &quot;quarter Moon&quot;. When the Moon is waxing and reaches this position, it's called the &quot;first quarter Moon&quot;; when waning, the &quot;third quarter Moon.&quot; When less than a quarter-moon is visible, it's referred to as a &quot;crescent Moon&quot; - waxing crescent or waning crescent, as appropriate. When more than a quarter-moon is visible, it's referred to as a &quot;gibbous moon&quot;, again, waxing or waning.

The Moon's orbit and rotation speed is just such that the Moon always shows the same side to Earth, aside from only a slight &quot;wobble.&quot; The pattern of markings on the side facing Earth is very familiar in history and culture. Western society has long imagined a face in the markings &amp;mdash; the &quot;Man in the Moon.&quot; Other cultures have seen a woman, a rabbit, a frog or other creatures. The Moon always shows this same face to Earth because its rotation is &quot;locked&quot; with its orbit, for reasons we will see later, when we discuss gravity. More precisely, the time it takes for the Moon to complete a trip in its orbit is the same as the time it takes for the Moon to rotate once around its axis. Because we see the Moon moving around us, it appears as though the Moon isn't turning at all.

If you stood on the Moon and looked up at Earth in the sky, you would see that it never rises, never sets, and never moves in the sky at all. Imagine, for example, standing at the middle of the face of the Moon that we see. From there, the Earth would always remain straight overhead. If you stood at the edge of the face we see from Earth &amp;mdash; the &quot;limb&quot; &amp;mdash; you would always see the Earth on your horizon.

Up to now, we have considered the time for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth to be the same as the time for it to pass once through its series of phases, but this is not quite right. The Moon's phase at a particular point in its orbit changes as the Earth goes around the Sun. Once the Earth has gone halfway around the Sun, the position of the Moon for a given phase has also moved halfway around the orbit, since the Sun is on the opposite side. Thus, it takes a little longer for the Moon to go through its phases than it does for it to go through its orbit about the Earth. 

Suppose a full moon marks the beginning of both the period of the orbit of the Moon about the Earth and the period of the orbit of the Earth about the Sun. At the time of full Moon, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned. Once the Moon returns to that position in its orbit, the Earth has moved a little around the Sun. Now, the Moon is not aligned with the Earth and the Sun. It takes about two days before the Moon has moved back into alignment with the Earth and Sun line (synodic month). The time for the Moon to complete an orbit, called a '''sidereal month''', is about 27 days and 8 hours. The time to move through its phases, a '''synodic month''', is about 29 days and 12 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Children's rights have only attracted attention relatively late in human history; the first awareness came in the 19th century in regard to child labor. The United Nations adopted a convention about The Rights of the Child in 1989 (significantly, before and since, the only convention to be adopted universally), which has encouraged lawyers and others interested in children's rights to contribute to the debate and give their knowledge and interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a Hybrid Course ==

&quot;Hybrid&quot; is the name commonly used nationwide to describe courses that combine face-to-face classroom instruction with computer-based learning. Hybrid courses move a significant part of course learning online and, as a result, reduce the amount of classroom seat time.
The goal of Hybrid courses is to join the best features of in-class teaching with the best features of online learning to promote active independent learning and reduce class seat time.

== Hybrid Course Advantages ==

Hybrid courses offer a number of advantages over face-to face teaching and totally online courses. Instructors from other colleges have reported that the hybrid course model allows them to accomplish course learning objectives more successfully than traditional courses do. Some faculty have noted increased interaction and contact from many of their students and between the students and themselves. Studies have shown that students and instructors liked the greater convenience afforded by the hybrid course model, which allows coursework to be scheduled flexibly and erases the time spent commuting and finding parking. Time flexibility was overwhelmingly the most popular feature of the hybrid courses for the students. 

*Convenience: coursework accommodates students’ schedules, commuting time is decreased. Interaction: Hybrid instructors report increased interaction and contact among students and between the instructor and the students. 

*Flexibility: instructors can accomplish certain learning objectives more successfully than in traditional courses because of the flexibility of the Hybrid model. Rachel Spilka explains this point in her article, [http://www.uwsa.edu/ttt/articles/spilka.htm Approximately &quot;Real World&quot; Learning with the Hybrid Model] Teaching With Technology Today, March 20, 2002.
 
*Increased learning: faculty almost universally report their students learn more in the Hybrid format than they do in traditional class sections. Instructors report that students write better papers, perform better on exams, produce higher quality projects, and are capable of more meaningful discussions on course material. 

*Increased retention: data collected from the University of Central Florida (UCF) shows student retention in Hybrid courses is better than retention in totally online courses and equivalent to that of face-to-face courses.

== Hybrid Course Challenges ==
Instructors and Institutions planning to develop Hybrid courses will face some challenges, which include:
 
'''''Creating a formal faculty development program for teaching Hybrid courses'''''
 
Without preparation most instructors will simply transfer traditional course content to the web. Thus, the first essential step is to create a formal Hybrid Course Faculty Development Program. Faculty need to learn how to redesign their courses and how to teach well online. 

We offer the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Learning Technology Center’s Model Program as a blueprint for developing your own faculty development program. http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/LTC/model-program.html 
 
'''''Allocating the necessary time for instructors to redesign traditional courses into Hybrids''''' 

Course redesign is time-consuming. Faculty need sufficient time to develop their new courses and enhance their instructional skills. This is especially true for first-time Hybrid course teachers.  A six-month lead-time for preparation, redesign and course development is the minimal time needed by most instructors to create their first Hybrid courses.
 
'''''Preparing students to learn effectively in Hybrid courses'' ''' 

Just as faculty need preparation to teach Hybrid courses, students need preparation to learn in Hybrid courses! Students have some difficulty grasping the “Hybrid” learning concept.  They are delighted by its convenience but are affronted by their perception of its additional work. We learned that students do not equate time spent in lectures as “work” but DO perceive the online assignments that replace the lectures as “work”.  Students need instructors to explain (repeatedly) the Hybrid course concept and why the instructor has chosen this model. Students also need time management skills to succeed in a Hybrid course. See following site for student issues regarding Hybrids:   http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/LTC/student-issues.html

I see you are more active at wikipedia, so I have written you a  [[wikipedia:User:Jeandré|message there.]] &lt;br&gt;--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 13:32, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jeandré. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jeandré~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== [[Algorithm_implementation/Search/Binary_search#Python]] ==

I see that you do Python contributions for [[Algorithm implementation]]. So could you fix [[Algorithm_implementation/Search/Binary_search#Python]]? My ranting where done mostly in the hope that some Python contributer fixes the code and other language contributors pick up the idea of &quot;test drivers&quot;. The [[Algorithms]] book actualy demands that within its &quot;[[Algorithms/Guidelines for Contributors|Guidelines for Contributors]]&quot; (&quot;Implementations should be tested well and include test cases.&quot;).

I suspect - from my little Python knowlede - that the last line where not copied and

 center  = left + (right - left) / 2;

might do the trick. But that would untested.

: Unfortunately, no — I've transwikied some code, but the only contribution I've made personally has been a Java heapsort (tested!).  I'm not yet familiar with Python.  The current state of the book is rather embarrassing; as I've mentioned, right now it's much more of a code dump than a book.  Hopefully I'll get around to putting some serious effort into this, or find some recruits to work on it, which will include code testing. ~&amp;nbsp;[[User:Booyabazooka|Booya &lt;sup&gt;Bazooka&lt;/sup&gt;]] 06:58, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

:This is a very readable primer - well done! I think that it should be split up into separate pages, though, for ease of navigation. --[[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 23:53, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Templates for Examples and Exercises ==

To improve the visual structure of the document, I have colour-coded the examples and exercises. If you'd like to do the same, here's how.

{{Example|1=
Here we would include some examples. 

Short examples (a few words in length) can still be included in the main text, but longer examples should use this format.
}}


{{Exercises|1=
Here we would include some exercises for the student to work through on their own.

Here's one way to include answers: {{H:title|Here's the answer!|
Hover your mouse over this text to see the answer}}
}}

== Great Primer ==

Great primer, but I agree... Better if split into pages... 
Thomas Kinney

== Really Excellent ==

Firstly, this is brilliant.  Well done.  

I understand the other comments about splitting the pages, however, I prefer it as it is.  I can print it in one go.  Also, when I click on a link in the contents at the start of the page, it brings me to the relevant section - so, I have not had any difficulty navigating.  But split up or left as it is, I'll be happy.  Marie

== Let Sleeping Dogs Lie ==

The language is dead.

Watching people struggle and stutter their way through the language on TG4 is a joke. Starting every sentence with either &quot;agus&quot; or worse still, &quot;well&quot; or &quot;you know&quot; makes me laugh. Adverts mostly in English. American movies with no Irish sub-titles. The occasional fluent speaker who likes to race the autocue as some sort of proof that they can speak the language and nobody else can.

A language's modern day relevance can be judged by how it interacts with the modern world. Start by translating maths, computing and scientific books into Irish and then we might have something of use to the nation. The only contemporary texts are Harry Potter and diddly-dee music and that's a waste of time.

Consign this language to a history book!

:1. TG4 does not represent the 'mainstream' of Gaelic speakers and writers.
:2. If their staff choose to use poor grammar, that is a reflection of the quality
:   of their workers and TG4 itself, not the language.
:3. Adverts in English is a poor choice on their part, but that has no relevance
:   whatsoever in discussing Gaelic here at Wikibooks.
:4. American films almost never include Gaelic subtitles. This is not surprising
:   to anyone who has even a rudimentary sense of economic trends in capitalist
:   economies: it simply would not be profitable to include Gaelic subtitles, and
:   the companies that produce American films generally are concerned with a profit
:   margin rather than the quality of the products they provide.
:5. A language's modern day relevance is not solely judged by how it 'interacts with 
:   the modern day world', as you say. This is disingenuous as best, and downright
:   narrow thinking in truth. Not to mention that your statement has no value since
:   it refers to very broad and generic concepts with no real meaning or frame of
:   reference.
:6. Translating textbooks into Irish Gaelic will require either dedicated and 
:   qualified professionals who both understand Gaelic as well as understand the
:   material they are editing. Since the market for academic texts is already a 
:   marginal/fringe one, who is going to do this? Very few. It makes no sense to
:   do so, and this has little or nothing to do with whether Gaelic is a living 
:   language- how many textbooks do you know of that are translated into Shanghaiese,
:   for example? 
:7. Your contempt for the Irish Gaelic language does nothing to assist our work here.
:   Please feel free to either write constructive comments or leave. Personally, I 
:   hope you choose the latter option.

== no it's not ==
Irish isn't dead, as a student, non-gaeilgeor, in Galway, not from a Gaeltacht, I was shocked at home much Gaeilge was being spoken in the city, you can take almost any class in the college though Irish also.

Irish courses are available to everyone, and all buildings are named in irish and english, with the Irish name being prodominately used.

(Also split it into pages!)

== Big Deal! ==

So the arse end of Ireland (Galway) has a smattering of Irish. If you look closely at TG4 you can see many interviewees on Nuacht reading idiot boards and even stumbling their way through that.

Unless relevant subjects like maths, sciences and technology are taught in Irish and at least 100 miles from Connemara then the language has no stickiness and no relevance in today's world.

: Yes, Galway has many Gaelic speakers. So does Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and really
: most of the old Kingdom of Connaught as a whole. Leinster too for that matter.
:
: You also seem to convieniently forget about the tens of thousands of Gaelic
: users outside of Ireland. 
:
: I use Gaelic on a daily basis. I live in America, which is at least a few thousand
: kilometres away from Connemara. I personally have taught over fifty people in the
: basics of Irish, and given at least half of those advanced lessons. There are over
: one-hundred Irish speakers within fifteen miles of where I live, and over two
: thousand in just this one state of the USA at the last count... and there are 
: many more just in the USA.  
:
: Textbooks are readily available in Irish Gaelic. They are not sold in your
: local Tesco, obviously, but they are for sale without much searching.
:
: In sum: try making a *relevant* point that has a factual basis.

== Agreed!==

There is no place for a dead language and the learning of it.  I say we get rid of anything with Latin or Ancient Greek or Sanskrit.  Heck, I think English will probably be dead in 200 years anyways, let's go ahead and start writing in some future form.

Give me a break.  Work on!


== Not a dead language, but even if it was, that's still not a good reason not to teach it ==

Irish Gaelic isn't dead - there are still people who speak it as a first language or a fluent second language

Secondly, even if was a dead language, that doesn't mean it isn't worth learning. If no-one learnt ancient Greek and Hebrew, how could the Bible have been translated into English? And if no-one learnt old Norse, how could we have an English version of Beowulf? And if no-one learnt about dead or moribund or minor languages, how could our knowledge about languages and language families and changes in language increase?

But anyway, back to the first point - Irish Gaelic isn't a dead language!

It seems to that the people who have written &quot;Agreed!&quot;, &quot;Big deal!&quot; and &quot;Let sleeping dogs lie&quot; have no idea what they're talking about.

: Of course, if you read the actual message, the &quot;Agreed!&quot; was a joke. [[User:24.1.88.161|24.1.88.161]] 16:39, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

----
This page is to discuss the accompanying Wikibook on Irish - it really isn't the place to discuss the validity of Irish. There are plenty of places to do that if you so desire. Kindly let the conversation end here. --[[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 00:27, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Remove Introduction, split into pages ==

I have removed the introduction while someone writes a new one. It doesn't read well and is inconsequential. I'd also vote for splitting the document into pages. Can we also provide a full version for easy printing? I've seen that on other Wikibooks.

-Martin

== Irregular verbs ==

bí has two present tenses bíonn agus tá

== Great progress ==

It's thrilling to see the progress that has been made on this wikibook since I started it. Much has been contributed by people I &quot;know&quot; throught the 'net, and much by people I don't know. Go raibh maile maith agaibh!
--[[User:Mhwombat|muddle-headed wombat]] 01:25, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== genitive==

Is the genitive plural simply not used a lot or is it simply mostly equal to the nominative? Also does the gen plur of women (mban I believe) deserve mention?

''TO DO: 'introduce IPA?''

No, dont just introduce it, just '''''use'''' it. PLEASE!!!!
Pronouncing Irish is really the biggest stumbling block to learning it. Even more so if English is taken as the departing point. (Please,please don't)

Yes there are non-anglophones who would love to learn it and no we may not struggle with dh or gh or palatellisation as anglo's do.

af:Gebruiker:Jcwf (mothertongue: Dutch).

==Encouragement==
I just want to offer a few words of encouragement to all the people who contribute to this particular wikibook.  As a brand new learner of Irish, I, unfortunately, did not find the book in its present form usable--there are way too many omissions and inconsistencies to make it a good starting point to someone who had no previous experience with the language (and by ''no previous experience'' I mean absolutely that--none at all!).  I do, however, find the whole idea and the existing primer absolutely outstanding.  Considering how little information is generally available to learners of Irish, this book may become a precious life saver to those of us who are learning the language with no access to native speakers, native media, or decent learning materials (heck, even the selection of self-teaching materials one can ''buy'' is ridiculously slim!).  This book may still be in need a lot of work, but, please, ''do'' keep it up!  Your efforts are really appreciated, and I certainly hope not by me alone.--[[User:Ag Foghlaim|Ag Foghlaim]] 18:30, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

I agree. It would also be nice to have formal lessons rather than just an explanation of grammar with occasional exercises. It's easier to learn grammar, develop your vocabulary and actually become able to have a conversation when you're confronted with (easy) texts that gradually introduce grammar features. &lt;br&gt;
In case anybody isn't sure how to go about writing lessons, there's a Wikibook on that topic that also explains some basic didactic notions. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 17:20, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Divide into Chapters ==

I think the current text is stupendous. My only suggestion is to take each main heading (''ie. History, Spelling, Nouns'') and give them their own seperate page. These subpages or chapters would all be linked to the main page. This would make the Wikibook easier to use and navigate. [[User:Yorktown1776|Yorktown1776]] 19:05, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
:But not to print!--[[User:Ag Foghlaim|Ag Foghlaim]] 14:19, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
::Sooner or later we're going to have to split it into subpages. I have plans of someday listing ''all'' declension and conjugation types from both Classical Irish and the Modern Standard here, and when that happens it will just be too big to keep on one page. [[User:Angr|Angr]] 17:44, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

== Formatting Needed ==

Well done to those people who did all this work, but this book is very un-readable. If we take as an example the German Wikibook, that is done in a clear, welcoming manner with pictures, nice writing, lesson plans and so on. This page is just one big stream of information about Irish. I'm new to Wikibooks so I don't know how to format this stuff, but I want to find out, if someone wants to point in the direction that'd be helpful. Also, sound clips from native speakers are needed for pronunciation, the transcription system, while a good attempt isn't really useful from an academic point of view, we really need IPA. Sorry if I sound like I'm complaining, i'm trying to give constructive criticism so that whoever's working on this page can make it better. - 'as yet unregistered wikibook user'

:ok, I'm registered and I'm starting making lessons using the [[Spanish]] wikibook as a template. It's likely I will start this now and come back to it later, gradually doing less and less work, so it'ld be great if there was someone else here to pick up my slack. - [[User:Dalta|Dalta]] 21:13, 2 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lisp syntax is very simple and easy to understand.  A list is a series of atoms surrounded by parentheses, and the first atom of a list is a function.  Any atoms after the first are parameters of the function.  An example Lisp expression to add the numbers 1 and 2 together might look like this:
 (+ 1 2)
As you can see, the expression is a list.  The first atom is +, which is also a function to be evaluated.  1 and 2 are the parameters of the + function.

You can also use a list as a parameter of a function like this, which adds the numbers 1 and 2 together, but somewhat more fancily:
 (+ 1 (+ 1 1))
In this example, the second parameter of the + function is a list.  The first atom is a function: +.  So the inner list is evaluated to two (1+1=2), and then that result is used as the second parameter of the outer list, which then gives the result 3.

There are of course many other functions in Lisp.  Some of the most basic are these: +, -, /, *, quote, set, and cons.  It should be obvious what the +, -, *, and / functions do and how they work.

The quote function returns its first argument, unevaluated.  This is useful for passing a form (expression) to a function, without first evaluating that form (expression).
 (quote (param1 param2))
would return
 (param1 param2)

quote can also be abbreviated as '.  
' goes &quot;outside&quot; the list that it acts on.  So
 '(param1 param2)
would return
 (param1 param2)
just like in the first example.

The cons function constructs a list by adding an item to a list. Adding an item to the empty list '() creates a new list.
 (cons 1 '())
returns
 (1)

 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))
returns
 (1 2 3)
Many of the attributes of Lisp are due to the fact that lists are constructed of conses.

== Variables ==

In Lisp, there are several ways to set a variable.  Here are the most common.

Setq sets a variable to a given value.  If the variable doesn't exist, then it is created.  All variables created with setq are global.  Setq works like this:
 (setq variable-name &lt;value&gt;)

An example bit o' code using setq would be this:
 (setq camel &quot;I am a camel!&quot;)
 (print camel)
Which should print &quot;I am a camel!&quot; when it executes.

Assuming you already have an Apache server (or compatible server that reads a shebang! line - more on this in a moment) and a perl installation running, it is fairly simple to start running a perl program on the internet.

First, you must have some way to access the program. Here we will deal with form data and submission, so we will assume that your form code in HTML has a property saying ACTION=&quot;''programname.cgi''&quot;.

== The Initial Setup ==

CGI scripts begin like any other Perl program, with a &quot;shebang&quot;, something like:

 #!/usr/bin/perl

(see [[Perl Programming/First Programs]] for details)

Next load the CGI module:

 use CGI;

The CGI module makes our work easy because it has pre-programmed functions in it for internet use. Then we must create a handle to CGI - something that allows us to access the functions. We do this with:

 my $query = CGI-&gt;new();

This means that the variable $query is loading the CGI standard functions.

Now that our program is setup using the CGI module, it should look something like this:

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 use CGI;
 my $query = CGI-&gt;new();

So we have a program, it just doesn't do anything yet, and will actually cause a server error because the server has no output or any idea of what kind of output to display even if it had some.

== Retrieving Information ==

Before we tell the server what to do with our output, we need to retrieve our input. To do this, we use the $query variable we declared earlier. Say we have a text box in the form that is named &quot;Name&quot; and we want to find out what was typed there. To do this, we put the following line of code in our program:

 my $Name = $query-&gt;param('Name');

Now, this line of code introduces us to the param() function (for &quot;parameter&quot;). The param() function can do quite a few handy tricks for us, all of them nice ways to retrieve our variables. It processes all of the http coding so all we get is a nice clean variable. Another note, you aren't required to use $Name as your variable. It's simply more convenient to only remember one name for the same variable. Still, use what's best for you.

== Output ==

Now we must create our header information. CGI even makes THIS easy for us. Instead of memorizing a bunch of mime-type declarations (which you may do as well), all we must do is type:

 print $query-&gt;header();

and it prints out our header information. A note about headers. Inside the parenthesis, we may specify parameters like cookies to send to the user's browser. This becomes very useful later. For now we will just stick to the headers.

The last thing you need to put (though the program will run, displaying a blank page without it) is some output. Let's simply have it display the user's name back to him/her. This would look like.

 print &quot; You said your name was: $Name&quot;;

== The Finished Code ==

So we now have a complete program that processes a form, using only 6 lines of code. Isn't Perl great? The final code looks like this:

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 use CGI;
 my $query = new CGI;
 
 my $Name = $query-&gt;param('Name');
 
 print $query-&gt;header();
  
 print &quot;You said your name was: &quot;, $query-&gt;escapeHTML($Name);

When put into perspective, we can see that the $query variable is a very important connection to the  CGI module as it tells perl that the function you are referencing belongs to CGI; Again, you may declare any variable name in the place of $query so long as you are consistent, though you will find many developers use $query or $q.  Also note the use of the escapeHTML method to avoid any [[w:en:HTML injection|HTML injection]] problems.

Final note. Make sure you change /usr/bin/perl to the path of your perl installation (assuming that is not it) so perl will execute properly

== Frameworks ==
There are a number of CGI frameworks to help with common CGI programming tasks:

* [http://cgi-app.org/index.cgi CGI::Application]
* [http://www.catalystframework.org/ Catalyst]

Mystical system also known as tassawuf. Most people are familiar with the whirling dervishes of Turkey. Stemming from an [http://pages.britishlibrary.net/edjason/friends/ Islamic lineage], with influences from [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. Sufism influenced the development of Sikhism and the Bahá'í religion. It encouraged the transfer of knowledge from Greek to Arabic development and is influential in architecture such as the Taj Mahal, pioneering the use of coffee, the concept of zero in mathematics, scientific methodology, gardening, medicine, craft, literature and depth psychology. As it becomes better known by Westerners its influential and highly developed researches are gaining widespread acclaim and adoption.

= Sufism =

The diversity of Islamic sects including Sunni, Shi, Wahabi, Ismailism, and so on find common ground in opposing or integrating with Sufism (dependent on prevailing political, religious and other influences). This is a reflection of their prevailing interest.

Sufism is based on these rules.

;Shariat
:First of all strictly follow the Islamic rules(sharia).

;Tareekat
:After following Sharia, one will be start learning Tareekat (Islamic Spiritualism) under a spiritual teacher (Shaikh or Peer)

;Ma'arifat 
:After practicing Tarakiat, one will get the real understanding of the Spiritualism by his own experience and it is called Ma'arifat.

;Haqeeqat
:And after all this, finally he finds the real truth(Haqeeat) about ALLAH.


The purpose of Sufism is to purify the inner or spirit to highest maximum level and prepare yourself to be very close to God (Allah). 

According to sufi system, one has to select a spiritual teacher called Shaikh or Peer who will lead and guide him throughout all the way. The student is called &quot;Salik&quot; (The Learner or The Seeker of True Path&quot;). 

Selecting the Shaikh or peer is called &quot;Bait&quot;. One first has to check the character of the Shaikh or Peer that he is truly following Sharia or not. A man not following Islamic sharia cannot be a true Shaikh.

Then Shaikh judges the spiritual level the salik and advise him Azkar(Kalima, Darood, Quranic Verses etc) to recite for a specific number of time daily. These Azkar include the praise of ALLAH and thus have effect of &quot;Noor&quot;(Holy Light). The repetitions of these Azkar and strictly following Islamic sharia collects more and more Noor into the heart(Qulb) of salik and purifies his spirit(Rooh). During the recitation of Azkar, salik has to pay full attention to ALLAH, and thus to reach a state where he will be able to ignore everything except ALLAH. This concentration to ALLAH is also practiced during five prayers(Salat or Namaz). This also fulfills the Hadith of Prophet Mohammad, according to that &quot;Offer the Prayer in a way like you are looking at ALLAH, or if not possible then at least in a way like ALLAH is looking at you&quot;.

Increase in the concentration raises the spiritual level of the Salik and he starts observing the things that others do not even feel. This strengthens his believe in ALLAH takes him more and more closer to ALLAH.

= Main Schools =
= Azeemi =
The Azeemia Sufi order was founded in Pakistan in 1960 by Qalander BaBa Auliya, strengthened &amp; currently headed by Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi.
In order to meet the demands of present times a system, which could fulfill the spiritual needs of man of the modern era in a scientific way, was needed. Silsela-e-Azeemia has been founded for the very purpose of fulfillment of man's spiritual needs of this era. Rising above the orthodox, conventional and traditional ways of spiritual education modern techniques have been formulated to pace up with the modern era of sciences. Because of unorthodox approach and modern ideology this 'Silsila' is spreading rapidly the world over.

Cognizer of Allah, Proclaimer of Reality, Knower of the Secrets of Spacelessness, Possessor of Insinuated knowledge, Master of the Invisible Controls, Founder Leader of Silsila-e-Azeemia, Hassan Ukhra Muhammad Azeem Burkhiya, His Divine Grace Qalander Baba Auliya founded this Silsila after having its approval from the Holy Prophet (PBUH) in July 1960. The name of the 'silsila' (the spiritual order) goes after the name of its founder.

Silsila-e-Azeemia encompasses both the spiritual sections viz. Spiritual Association (sulook) and the Raptness (juzb). His Divine Grace Qalander Baba Auliya has been benefited from twenty-one salasil and enjoys the very special distinction of being the Khanwada (to whom the thinking pattern of the founder leader of a silsila is transferred) of eleven salasil.
Discipleship of the traditional style and orthodox manner is not there in this silsila. No particular dress or typical appearance is suggested here. Only sincere interest and devotion for spirituality is the basic criteria for ones association with the silsila. Disciples in this silsila are called friends. Instead of austere and rigorous rituals simple brief and easy-to-perform lessons and exercises have been introduced. Basis of the education is that worshipping style and method which was exercised by the Holy Prophet (PBUH) in the cave of Hira for a long time. Practice of this exercise of meditation helps the spiritual associate to start his journey in the spiritual realm.

More one advances on these paths more enlightened is one's thinking. Wakefulness starts prevailing upon one's unconscious and the sight becomes strong enough to penetrate the realities of the mysteries. And he becomes a man with cognition rather than a staunch worshipper with a temper. Since the founder leader of the silsila was in a very prominent position of the spiritual administration and enjoyed a high rank of Qalanderiyat therefore Silsila-e-Azeemia also has the shades of Qalanderiyat.

People from various schools of thoughts, for instance Shias, Sunnies, Deubandies, Barailvies used to visit him to pay him the tributes he deserved. People associated with different silsilas also called upon him to quench their thirst for spirituality. Whosoever had a chance to be with him for a while was benefited by the grace of Allah, the most High. Lucky was he who could attract the benevolent attention of His Divine Grace Qalander Baba Auliya. Those who had an opportunity of having an association with him were fortunate to be bestowed with a changed thinking approach, which eventually enabled them to cognize the ultimate reality.

The Eternal Being for spreading light creates people whose mission is to preach about the instability of this material world. They become instrumental in introducing the Lord Creator and teach to have an established relationship with Him.

Gist of the teachings of His Divine Grace Qalander Baba Auliya is that man has not been created to remain in pursuit of livelihood only or for earning bread to eat and to wear clothes but the first and foremost purpose of his creation is that he should recognize his own self and have an intimate introduction with his Benefactor, the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him) because of whose blessings we are fortunate enough and deviation from whose teachings have made us the most unfortunate and degraded nation of all.

At present 78 Muraqba Halls (Centers of Spiritual learning) in Pakistan and abroad, i.e. in U.K., U.S.A., Norway, Holland, Denmark and U.A.E. etc. are operating to serve the creatures of Allah, the Almighty.

About seven thousand letters seeking solutions for problems and difficulties are replied from Markazi Muraqba Hall, Karachi as a free service. Besides this the monthly Roohani Digest, Karachi and Roohani Digest International, London; the organs of silsila offer and suggest remedies of complicated diseases, mental ailments, psychological problems by prescribing Certain Appellations of Allah, Quranic Verses and or methods of chromo-therapy.

One needs somebody who has walked the walk and knows the road, who knows the way, and dangers. The line of teachers go back to Oveys al-Gharani from Yemen, a companion and receiver of truth directly from prophet Mohammad PBUH, even though he never met Him in person, Prophet used to say : &quot;&quot;I smell Rahman (GOD) from Yemen&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; His name is Oveys, Follow him step by step, for he is the rescuer of my nation (omma)&quot;&quot;.

{{Wikipedia|Chishti Order}}

The high status accorded women and the respect and welcome of people following religions other than Islam enabled this school to flourish in multi-cultural India in particular during the Moghul Empire. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti was the most popular saint of this order who migrated to India from Arabia on an instruction from Prophet Muhammad. Lakhs of people followed him and this sufi order spread across India&lt;br&gt;
This sect believes in Wahdat-Ul-Wajood, i.e Everything in existence is due to the existence of Allah, &amp; Allah is present in everything&quot;.

The [[w:Naqshbandi|Naqshbandi]] Sufi Order has many branches all tracing their lineage back to Shah Naqshbandi. Depending upon the specific linage the related orders profess a wide range of ideologies. One of the largest branches established by Shaykh Nazim Al-Haqqani and carried on by Shaykh Muhammad Adil is located in Lefke Cyprus where hundreds of thousands, of mostly converts to Islam, have visited over the many years. The Naqshbandi order led by Shaykh Muhammad Adil is a very moderate group that welcomes persons of all faiths. What is unique about this order is they never charge anyone to visit. The branch in the United States of America following this order among other locations is the [http://www.healingheartssufidargah.com Healing Hearts Sufi Dargah] in Norwich, Connecticut.

This sect is one of the branches of two famous sects of sufism namely Quadri and Chishti Iftekhari. This was lead by His Holiness Hazrat Sayyed Akbar Ali Shah --&gt; Hazrat Sayyed Mohd. Iftikhar Ali Shah --&gt; Hazrath Syed Moinullha Hussaini Saha - Hazrath Syed Mohammed WaliAllah Hussaini Sha - Hazrat Sayyed Noorullah Husaini Shah --&gt;Hazrat Sayyed Faridullah Husaini Shah (--&gt;and Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah . After this the disciples of Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah ( still follow his path and teachings which is common even today like Khatm-e-Khwajgan which is recited weekly. After Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah left this world Hazrat Khwaja Haamid ali Shah Sahab (rehmatullah Alihi) took over the responsiblities of spreading &amp; propogating the teachings of his Peer. Hazrat Ghulam Ali Shah was nominated as Sajjadah Nasheen to handle &amp; accomplish all the duties of Dargah Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah located at Moti Karanja Aurangabad. Sajjadah Hazrat Ghulam Ali Shah Sahab has published one book named Fahem-wa-Amal which is a complete composition and collection of the teachings of Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah . Till today one can feel the pureness and greatness of the teachings of Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah  which is kept alive by Hazrat Khwaja Haamid Ali Shah Sahab (rehmatullah Alihi). During the life of Khwaja Haamid Ali Shah Sahab (rehmatullah alihi), millions of people came &amp; joined Khankaah on the hands of Khwaja Haamid Ali Shah (rehmatullah alihi) many of which include Hindu community poeple also. Khwaja Sahab (r.a) left Hazrat Dr. Shah Zakir Hamid Sahab (maddazillahul Aali) as his sajjadah nasheen to guide &amp; keep his teachings alive. Khwaja Sahab(r.a) declared his wish during his life alomost 35 to 40 years ago before leaving this world that he should be kept at Kalam, dist Usmanabad. Therefore today the shrine of Hazrat Khwaja Haamid Ali Shah Sahab (r.a) at Kalam is the centre of attraction to all his mureeds &amp; followers &amp; lovers. Khwaja Sahab(r.a) has asked not to celebrate his Urs rather he has asked to celebrate Jashne Miladun Nabi (sallalaho Alahi wa sallam) at his shrine.
Therefore as per his wish every mureed be old or young, man or woman, gather at Shrine of Khwaja Haamid Ali Shah Sahab (r.a) to celebrate Eide Miladunnabi. Where they remain for 3 days &amp; listen to teachings of Khwaja Sahab through his Khulfae Kiram under the guidance of Sajjadah Nasheen Hazrat Dr. Shah Zakir Hamid Sahab (maddazilahul Aali).

Hazrat Khwaja Haamid Ali Shah Sahab (r.a) is said to be shadow of his Peer-O-Murshid Hazrat Hamid Ali Shah  since Hazrat Haamid Ali Shah has truly and faithfully followed teachings and has made a great effort in making more deciples &amp; turning peoples towards right path of Sufism which is said to be Rooh of Islam. Hazrat Haamid Ali Shah Sahab says He has never turned his back to his Peer's teachings since he was 23 of age. Hazrat haamid Ali Shah remains on a continuous tour through out India especially Maharashtra, to make people understand teachings of his Peer-O-Murshid. He has never been seen resting at one place Aurangabad Sharif which is his native. Hazrat says '''&quot;I am greatfull to my lord my peer that he has given me this opportunity to serve peoples with his teachings&quot;.''' He also thanks to Sajjadah Hazrat Ghulam Ali Shah Sahab for his support through out in spreading teachings. According to Hazrat(Haamid Ali Shah Sahab), he is born on this earth only to service &amp; please his Peer-O-Murshid by spreading truth of Islam via Sufism.

These teachings are called Tareeqat since the tareeqah(method)of knowing God is followed in sequence &amp; in chain from Peer to Peer till Hazrat Ali (RA) &amp; then finally Huzur Muhammed (SAWS). This teaching is also termed as ILM-E-SEENA(knowledge of heart) which is the knowledge that is transfered from Seena to Seena(heart to heart) from Prophet Muhammed (SAWS) to our Peer-o-Murshid. Tareeqat is therefore based on Tasawwuf. Tasawwuf is nothing but condition of heart. It is recommended to follow tareeqat after completing shariyat.
Shariyat is knowledge of Halaal &amp; Haraam (do's &amp; don'ts). It shows us the way how to behave &amp; how to appear in society as a muslim ummath. It is based on 5 pillars of Islam namely--&gt;namaz, roza, Hajj, zakath &amp; jehaad.
Tareeqath is knowledge of what should be our attitude towards these 5 prayers &amp; what should be the condition of our heart while praying.
Ma'arifat: After combining both in right proportion &amp; manner one achieves &amp; attains a position called Ma'arifat. The one who attains Ma'arifat is called Aarif meaning the one who has known Allah.
Haqeeqat When Aarif can hold himself firmly on this position then there itself his soul gets enlightened with Haqeeqat. It is again a top level of Ma'arifat where there is no hijaab(wall or hurdle) between Aarif &amp; Allah.
All these levels are followed in chain &amp; fall one after other.

Shariyat is said to be the body &amp; tareeqt, ma'aarifat, haqiqat are said to be its soul. Body is useless without soul &amp; soul cannot do anything without its body. So both are interdependent &amp; holds great importance with each other. Shariyat is for oneself for our own on how to behave &amp; how to live, what to do &amp; what not to do. Shariyat is for knowing our limits or knowing our self, Tariqat is to follow Peer &amp; know Peer in order to attain his spirit, Ma'rifat is to know Huzoor Muhammed(SAW) &amp; attain his love then Haqiqat is to know Allah Almighty &amp; to attain his knowledge &amp; meet him.

Therefore a Mureed has to be complete &amp; true in Shariyaat then only he can achieve levels falling after it. Our Dada Peer Hazrat Sayyed Iftekhar Ali Shah (RA) has said &amp; which is very famous in sufis that '''&quot;Jiski Shariyat me baal barabar kami reh gayi to uski Tariqat me baal barabar gunjaish nahi hai&quot;'''
These teachings were said to be taught by Prophet Muhammed (SAWS) to his Sahabas . 
Just think seriously on this: Today why Ummath is on decline &amp; is defeated every where in world though we are very large in number, Why? Answer is that we have divided ourselves because our groups follow either only Shariyath or Tareeqat alone. The group who emphasis on Shariyat is empty from its soul i.e Tareeqath &amp; another group which follows Tareeqath has no relation with Shariyat. Therefore both groups live &amp; end their lives meaning less. This is where Shaitaan (Satan) wins &amp; we help him win by dividing ourselves &amp; by not following true islam which is still present &amp; alive with Sufi's, Sahib-e-dil, Buzurgaan-e-deen in khankaah-e-Aluliya. Where they are taught lessons of Love &amp; how to defeat Shaiytan by defeating our evil will.
Sahabas use to hold great love for their Peer-o-Murshid Huzoor Muhammed (SAWS) &amp; so they use to follow each &amp; every task with out any delay &amp; problem. Today ummath lacks the spirit of Love &amp; therefore every where Ummath is declining in faith &amp; spirit.
Ummath has to therefore follow the path of Sahabees &amp; have to become Mureed to attain the faith in true sense. One needs somebody who has walked the walk and knows the road, who knows the way, and dangers, the rehbar rehnuma i.e. Peer-o-Murshid.Since the time Ummath has stopped becoming disciples of Peer-o-Murshid they got divided &amp; Shaitan has got chance to play around with them. Huzur Peer-o-Murshid Hazrat Haamid Ali Shah Sahab says '''&quot;Shaitan lets momin do every good work but never let him become a Mureed because he knows if he becomes Mureed then he will be safe from Shaitan's hands&quot;.''' Muslims have been divided just because they dont have a common faith because they dont have common teacher i.e. they don't follow a common path by becoming Mureed. Hazrat Ghaus-e-Azam  had said that '''&quot;jiska koi Peer nahi uska Peer Shaitan hai&quot;.''' Today we can see truth of his sayings. The Islam that we understand is not islam as our thought capacity is very limited &amp; we tend to percieve as per our boundaries with help of what ever we read or hear. It is here where we get targeted by Shaitan. We need to follow the path &amp; walk on the path where Murshid has walked &amp; has seen all the ups &amp; downs &amp; dangers. It is called Tariqat. Shaitan has wrongly spread the thought that Followers of Peeri Mureedi are (Ma'azAllah)doing shirks &amp; they are bending in front of Gair Allah. This is where he (shaitan)has succeeded in dividing us in name of Shirk. Shirk is the one which he did by denying Allah &amp; not doing Sajdah to Adam (A.S). He now wants all of Muslims to fall prey to same mistake. He made a mistake by Defining Adam Gair Allah i.e. different from Allah, where as none of the existence in this world or universe is different from Allah. Every thing exist just because of Allah rabbul Izzat.
Other form of weapon of Shaitan is Bida'at. Bida'at means new invention or new methodology. Sufis are not at all doing any Bida'at rather they are following the same old method which Huzur (SAW) has directed us to &amp; has verily said '''&quot;My Sahabas are like stars, follow them if you want to walk in right direction&quot;.''' Sahabas followed Their Peer-o-Murshid Huzur (SAW), then Tab'aeen followed Sahabas, Tabe Taba'een followed Taba'eens, Auliya follow Tabe Taba'eens &amp; so on till my Peer-o-Murshid Hazrat Haamid Ali Shah Sahab. Therefore Peeri Mureedi is actually following the path of Sahabas which is obeying Rasool Allah (SAW). Ummath is no where now because they are not obeying Rasool (SAW). One can never attain the wisdom of Sahabas untill &amp; unless he follows his Peer. Therefore it is mandatory for one to become Mureed (desciple)to become a Momin the way Rasool Allah (SAW) wants us to be.
Earlier some 200 years ago every Muslim use to become deciple (Mureed) of Peer &amp; it was taken as a very compulsory to have Peer-o-Murshid else that man was not treated as a good Muslim in community even if he use to follow all rules of Shariyat. This was because every one was worried as per the saying of Huzur Gaus-e-Azam (RA) &amp; didn’t wanted to be disciple of Shaitan. This air of shirk &amp; Bid'aat has polluted the true &amp; very pure Islamic concept of soul purification &amp; thus has stoped Muslims from becoming true Momin. Hazrat Sayyed Akbar Ali Shah (RA) traveled from Shahjahan pur to Hyderabad in search of Peer &amp; finaly reached khankah of Hazrat Sayyed Shah Shajaul Haqqani (RA). Similarly Hazrat Sayyed Iftekhar Ali Shah(RA) spent 12 years in Ajmer at Dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishty as he was keen on becoming mureed of Khwaja sahab. He use to sweep the floor of dargah &amp; mosque &amp; lighten the candles. This he did for 12 years &amp; finally one day he saw Khawaja Ajmeri in his dreams saying '''&quot;go to Hyderabad &amp; become mureed of Sayyed Akbar Ali Shah&quot;''' He insisted i want to bcome your Mureed, Khwaja sahab replied &quot;''' Akbar Ali is me &amp; i am Akbar Ali. Go &amp; become his desciple.&quot;''' Hazrat Iftekhar Ali Saha(RA)then travelled to Hydrabad &amp; he was welcomed by Hazrat Akbar Ali Shah (RA) as he was also intimated by Khwaja Ajmeri about arival of Hazrat Iftikhar(RA). Hazrat Iftikhar Ali Shah(RA) when became mureed he then gained great name &amp; fame among suifs &amp; is still remembered by his mystical poetries &amp; ashars where he has defined his travel of within himself &amp; then reaching his spirit in Diwan-e-Watan. Watan was his takhallus(token name).
One of his famous ashar from his poem: ''''Mai jab hi tak tha ke teri jalwa peerai naa thi. Jo namud-e-Haq se mitt jata hai wo batill hu mai. Meaning: I was there in side my body till time there was no sign of my Peer, I am that falsehood which vanishes with birth of truth. Murid is false hood &amp; Peer is truth.'''' If we will read biography of other Auliya's we will come to know that every one had Murshid &amp; they had tried hard to find them in their life. They were all eager to adopt path of Tassawwuf &amp; walk the way of Suluk.

Tasawwuf is the core of eiman (true faith) and not something extra. Suluk is the essence of that iman which every Muslim claims to have, on condition that he experiences the sweetness of it in his heart. This same Shari’ah which was taught to us by the Messenger of Allah is actually suluk and tariqah, on condition that the effect moves from the body parts on to the heart and ‘amal becomes the result of the heart being attached to it.

A sick person doesn’t feel hungry at all. He forces himself to eat because of the doctor’s instructions, also that his body can develop strength to fight the sickness. Another person who is healthy eats because he desires and enjoys food. Both are eating to live and both are benefiting from the food. On the surface there seems to be no difference between the two, but in reality there is a great difference. The sick person has to subject his nature (force himself) to consume food while the healthy person subjects the food to his nature (tab’iyyah).

By this example understand the difference between a person who makes ‘ibadah but has to force himself and the sahib al-nisbah wali (perfect and perfected saint) who makes the same ‘ibadah due to the desire and longing of his heart.

If the doctor did not force the sick person to eat, he would not have eaten and not felt any guilt, remorse and grief. Although the result of not eating will have its detrimental effects later but presently he is happy to leave food. On the other hand, the healthy person, if he doesn’t eat, suffers immediately, becomes weak and will be unable to do anything until and unless he eats.

'''This perfect health is called tariqah, which the heart acquires. The spiritual food is called Shari’ah which one should be truly desirous of and be able to sacrifice for it.'''

Yes, initially one has to apply force and pressure. Later it will develop into this stage insha’Allah where one enjoys being nurtured by the Shari’ah.

The heart is like a mirror, which reflects the tajalliyah (divine lustres). For this to happen, the heart has to be cleansed and polished. This clean and polished condition has to be maintained through mujahadah (constant effort and sacrifice) that will keep away the darkness of sin and evil character. When the dust, grime and rust are removed, then this person is now constantly engaged in dhikr and fikr and is constantly attentive towards Allah Most High. The result of this attentiveness is the reflection on the mirror (the heart) is formed. The joy and pleasure of this condition is beyond words. When this mirror gains light from the Giver of Light (Allah Most High) then it lights up the world. This is the same light that emanated from the noble heart of the Messenger of Allah  which lit up the world. This light from his noble heart spread to others who had purified their hearts. They in turn spread it to others. This light of guidance taken from the light of Nubuwwah (Prophethood) is found in every era and is still present although fourteen hundred years have passed.

The carriers of this light are the Awliya (the friends of Allah), and there have been and there are still hundreds of them. From among this illuminated, fortunate, blessed and pristine group (in our times) are &quot;Hazrat Haamid Ali Shah Sahab &amp; Hazrat Gulam ali Shah Sahab&quot; May Allah raise us with them on the Day of Judgment. Amin Ya Rabb al-’Alamin.

None of the Auliya Allah is without Murshid because this is the only way to gain Ma'arifat &amp; Haqiqat of Allah Subhanhuta'aala.

== Quaddiri ==

A system derived by &amp; from His Holiness Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jilani  &amp; his deciples. They belive &quot; Wahdat-UL-Shahud, i.e Everything in existence is due to presence of Allah &amp; every thing gives shadat of Allah's Existance&quot;.

== Rufi ==

= Philosophy =

Universal suffrage and inspired and exhalted love. A stress on ascetic practices such as night vigils, fasting and zhikr (prayer repetitions). Important ideas are kismet (fate) and baraka (spiritual grace or power). Great emphasis is placed on the tariqa (circle) of the teachers influence. By alignment with a tradition or path, the qualities and transmissions associated with a particular methodology develop. Students travel through different stations (phases) during which qualities are stabilised. Conditions of ecstasy and sobriety alternate and are eventually superseded. Some groups such as the kalandars are renowned for inducing altered states of consciousness.

=== Influences ===

=== Poetry ===

=== Dance ===
Sufism practice may include the performance of a prayer dance, in a circle wearing big frocks and their traditional caps on their head, through which they commune with Allah.

=== Western Developments ===

The first noticeable development of Sufi ideology came from the Persian religion of Zoroasta and the mystical teachings of the Jews and the Christians.This idealogy of SUFISM was totally changed when it was blended with Greek ideas and the obvious major heritage and lineage of the Hadith and Koran.
Much cross-cultural integration of Sufism came from the French and Spanish colonies of the Islamic empires.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Xmnemonic. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Xmnemonic~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dhuss. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dhuss~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Manifold Learning==
===Preface===
Two main framework:
* Global framework: MDS, Isomap &lt;br/&gt;
* Local framework: LLE, Laplace Eigenmap, Hessian Eigenmap, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
===Manifold===

'''Summary.'''
&lt;br/&gt;
A '''manifold''' is a space that is
locally like &lt;math&gt;\reals^n&lt;/math&gt;, however lacking a preferred system of
coordinates. Furthermore, a manifold can have global topological
properties, such as non-contractible Curve, that distinguish it from
the topologically trivial &lt;math&gt;\reals^n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Standard Definition.'''
&lt;br/&gt;
An &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional topological manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a second countable, Hausdorff
topological space (For connected manifolds, the assumption that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is
second-countable is logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; being paracompact, or
equivalently to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; being metrizable. The topological hypotheses in the definition of a manifold are needed
to exclude certain counter-intuitive pathologies. Standard
illustrations of these pathologies are given by the '''long line'''
(lack of paracompactness) and the '''forked line''' (points cannot be
separated). These pathologies are fully described in Spivak.) that is locally homeomorphic to open subsets of
&lt;math&gt;\reals^n&lt;/math&gt;.

A differential manifold is a topological manifold with some additional
structure information. A ''chart'', also known as a '''system of coordinates''', is a continuous injection from an open subset of
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\reals^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let
&lt;math&gt;\alpha: U_\alpha \rightarrow \reals^n,&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\beta:U_\beta\rightarrow\reals^n&lt;/math&gt; be two charts with overlapping
domains. The continuous injection &lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta\circ\alpha^{-1}: \alpha(U_\alpha\cap
U_\beta)\rightarrow\reals^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
is called a \emph{transition function},
and also called a \emph{a change of coordinates}. An '''atlas'''
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of charts &lt;math&gt;\alpha:U_\alpha\rightarrow\reals^n&lt;/math&gt;
whose domains cover &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = \bigcup_{\alpha} U_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Note that each transition function
is really just &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real-valued functions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real variables, and so
we can ask whether these are continuously differentiable. The atlas
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; defines a differential structure on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, if every transition
functions corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable.

More generally, for &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,\infty,\omega&lt;/math&gt;, the atlas &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is
said to define a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^k&lt;/math&gt; differential structure, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to be
of class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^k&lt;/math&gt;, if all the transition functions are &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times
continuously differentiable, or real analytic in the case of
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^\omega&lt;/math&gt;. Two differential structures of class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C^k}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are
said to be isomorphic if the union of the corresponding atlases is
also a &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^k&lt;/math&gt; atlas, i.e. if all the new transition functions arising
from the merger of the two atlases remain of class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^k&lt;/math&gt;. More
generally, two &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^k&lt;/math&gt; manifolds &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are said to be
diffeomorphic, i.e. have equivalent differential structure, if there
exists a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:M\to N&lt;/math&gt; such that the atlas of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is
equivalent to the atlas obtained as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;-pullbacks of charts on &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

The atlas allows us to define differentiable mappings to and from a
manifold. Let &lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f:U\rightarrow\reals,\quad U\subset M&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
be a continuous function. For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; we define
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_\alpha: V \rightarrow \reals,\quad V\subset\reals^n,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
called the
representation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; relative to chart &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, as the suitably
restricted composition
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_\alpha = f\circ \alpha^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We judge &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be differentiable if all
the representations &lt;math&gt;f_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are differentiable. A path
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma: I\rightarrow M,\quad I\subset\reals&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
is judged to be differentiable, if for all differentiable
functions
&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the suitably restricted composition &lt;math&gt;f\circ\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a
differentiable function from &lt;math&gt;\reals&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\reals&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, given
manifolds &lt;math&gt;M, N&lt;/math&gt;, we judge a continuous mapping &lt;math&gt;\phi:M\rightarrow
N&lt;/math&gt;
between them to be differentiable if for all differentiable
functions
&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the suitably restricted composition &lt;math&gt;f\circ\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a
differentiable function on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

===Isomap===
Basic idea: replace Euclidean distance with geodesic distance in MDS &lt;br/&gt;
1. Construct neighborhood graph &lt;br/&gt;
2. Compute shortest paths (geodesic distance) &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This can be done using Dijkstra algorithm&lt;br/&gt;
3. Construct ''d''-dimensional embedding &lt;br/&gt;
This can be done using classical MDS algorithm&lt;br/&gt;
Minimize the stress:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(Y)=\sum_{i&lt;j}f_{ij}|d_{ij}-\delta_{ij}|^2&lt;/math&gt;
Various ''stress'' of MDS results in variants of Isomap, such as C-Isomap&lt;br/&gt;
Isomap Website: [[http://isomap.stanford.edu/]]

===LLE===
Basic idea: Only worry about representing the distances between local points. &lt;br/&gt;
====Construct neighborhood graph====
====Compute neighborhood weights====
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J(W_{i})=\left\vert x_{i}-\sum_{j}W_{ij}Y_{j}\right\vert ^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\min_{W_i}{J(W_i)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
st. &lt;math&gt;W{ii}=0, W{ij}&gt;0, \sum_j{W_{ij}}=1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

====Construct ''d''-dimensional embedding====

Reconstruction Error: &lt;br/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi (Y)=\sum_{i}\left\vert
y_{i}-\sum_{j}W_{ij}Y_{j}\right\vert ^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

with constrain:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i}Y_{i} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}Y_{i}Y_{i}^{\top } = I
&lt;/math&gt;
LLE Website: [[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~roweis/lle/]]

===Laplace Eigenmap===
&lt;br/&gt;

===Hessian Eigenmap===
&lt;br/&gt;
1. Identify neighbors &lt;br/&gt;
2. Obtain tangent coordinates &lt;br/&gt;
3. Develop quadratic form &lt;br/&gt;
4. Find approximate null space &lt;br/&gt;
5. Find basis for null space &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;
===Charting/co-ordination===
Find low-dimensional local neighbourhoods on the manifold, then mix the neighbourhoods while trying to minimize distortion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Curl is a language for creating web documents with almost any sort of content, from simple formatted text to complex interactive applets.
The goal of Curl is to provide a smoother transition between formatting and programming.

{{ Wikipedia | Curl (programming language) }}
Curl, the programming language, is often confused with cURL.
The cURL open source download utility is a completely different and independent project.

== History ==

'''Curl''' (programming language) is a web content language from the DARPA project at MIT which resulted in the WWW organization (w3c.org).

Curl was spun-off by MIT as a corporation but is now owned by SCSK Corporation with home pages at

http://www.curl.com and at http://www.curlap.com

== Features ==

Curl is a hybrid functional language supporting declarative layout (as in HTML), styling as in CSS, scripting (as in JavaScript/ECMAScript),  and is object-oriented (as in C++/Java/Smalltalk but also has multiple inheritance) and yet is also multi-paradigm (classes are optional) and permits anonymous procedures (closures, as in Smalltalk, JavaScript, Ruby and Groovy); it also has macros as in other functional languages.
Curl shares the feature of LISP, Scheme and Rebol being homoiconic: Curl can itself be consumed by Curl as structured data or as functions and other declarations.

Without some historical context, Curl might look like an integration of Java, HTML, JavaScript and flash to create a simple language suitable for next generation on line client sided computing.

* Free for non commercial usage 
* Support for real time ray tracing and quaternion functions
* Very simple, comparable to text editing HTML, unlike Lisp and 'C' (dependent on skill level of user)
* Script is compiled on the user/client side  
* Multi-paradigm web-content language with classes, functional programming and declarative features resulting in a language comparable to combined JavaScript+CSS+HTML+Java
* Fast client-side computing with client-side persistent data
* Accessible to beginners yet capable of advanced programming and linking to other languages

Curl is named after a pair of curly braces these . . . {}

It is a programming language designed for such things as

* web applications with a desktop application-style GUI
* client side (that means your computer) processing
* occasionally-connected computing
* asynchronous-http request processing
* client-side data persistence (such as configuration options and bread-crumbs)

Curl has some similarities with Java and JavaScript but is expression-based like Icon or Rebol.
Curl applets can serve as a replacement for HTML web pages.  Curl applets can also be embedded.  Curl could be viewed as HTML+CSS+JavaScript+Java - but all rolled into one language and combined in a unified environment with a multi-paradigm semantics including the Declarative, Procedural and Object-Oriented.

HTML (the text file web page language which browsers obtain from servers to display most pages on the web) can be comprised of JavaScript, CSS, Flash, scriptlets,  XML among other elements.  Curl was designed to be one language equivalent to all of the former.  It can provide rich Internet application (RIA) with AJAX and live in an SOA (Curl comes with a SOAP API.)

Curl can display as well as Adobe Acrobat PDF (increasingly being used) and of course is dynamic and interactive and is an alternative to ADOBE Flex(FLASH + ActionScript), Microsoft Silverlight or SUN JavaFX.

Curl is a mature web content platform now available as Curl6 (but known internally as Curl7.) Curl is used in both Japan and Korea and announced a re-launch in North America in 2007 but it does require a browser plugin, the SURGE RTE (Runtime Engine) and had license restrictions.

In 2008, internet users may have become more accustomed to web browser plugins than they were in 2001 when Curl Corporation formed.

Curl content requires Curl software in order to be displayed.  Just as HTML pages need a browser or PDF files need the Acrobat plug-in, Curl applets need the Curl Surge Plug-in and Runtime Environment.  Once you have the plug-in you can load Curl load pages from web servers rather as you would load HTML pages and using the same HTTP protocol (in IE7, running at the WinInet level.)

The nearest equivalents may be [[Zope]], [[Subject:.NET programming|.NET]], [[Java]] or [[Javascript]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome]] to Wikibooks.  I'd like to ask you why you moved your user page ([[User:Hfgong]]) into a new pseudonamespace called &quot;Draft:&quot;?  This can cause problems for people trying to leave you notes, as user pages should be in the &quot;User:&quot; namespace.  More information about this can be found in [[Help:Pages#Namespaces]].  In a little bit I'm going to move the page back to the User namespace, unless there's a good reason it shouldn't be there.

Have a good day, [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:03, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Thank you for your attention ==

I am a newbie, I just want to save a draft version of my article.

:That's no problem.  Normally, drafts of modules that we don't think are ready to &quot;go live&quot; are saved as subpages of our personal userpage. For exapmle, [[WikiDraft:Hfgong]] could be saved at [[/Manifold Learning]] (which creates a page entitled [[User:Hfgong/Manifold Learning]]).  When you think it is ready for publication, you can then move it to its final location using the '''move''' tab at the top of the screen, and then possilby request that the resulting redirect from the subpage be deleted at [[wikibooks:votes for deletion]].

:Another place were experimentation is encouraged is the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]], although the sandbox is commonly edited by many people, so changes made there are likely to be edited over quickly.  I hope you enjoy editing here at wikibooks, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me at [[User talk:Gentgeen|my talk page]] or ask the general community at the [[wikibooks:staff lounge|staff lounge]].

:[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 11:51, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:PS, to sign comments in talk pages, use the tilde (~).  Three tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) signs your name, and four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) signs and includes a date and time stamp (that is what I did above). [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

== I See ==

That's great.
Thank you again!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Idioms==

===Handling self-assignment in an assignment operator===
&lt;tt&gt;T::operator=&lt;/tt&gt; that handles the case where the LHS and the RHS refer to the same object.

 T&amp; '''operator'''= ('''const''' T&amp; that)
 {
     '''if''' ('''this''' == &amp;that)
         '''return''' *'''this''';
 
     ''// handle assignment here''
 
     '''return''' *'''this''';
 }

Notes:
*Keep in mind the differences between ''identity'' (the LHS and the RHS are the same object) and ''equality'' (the LHS and the RHS have the same value). &lt;tt&gt;T::operator=&lt;/tt&gt; has to protect itself against ''identity'' since then, the code for assigning can conveniently and safely assume that the LHS and the RHS refer to different objects.
*There are other techniques that are superior but not applicable in all situations. For example, if all the members of the class &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; (say, &lt;tt&gt;mem1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;mem2&lt;/tt&gt;, ..., &lt;tt&gt;memN&lt;/tt&gt;) provide a &lt;tt&gt;swap&lt;/tt&gt; function, one could use the following code instead:

 T&amp; '''operator'''= (T that)
 {
     ''// ''that'' is constructed by the copy constructor''
 
     mem1.swap (that.mem1);
     mem2.swap (that.mem2);
 
     ...
 
     memN.swap (that.memN);
 
     ''// now what were originally ''this-&gt;mem1'', ''this-&gt;mem2'', etc. get
     ''// destroyed when ''that'' gets destroyed, and ''that.mem1'', etc. are
     ''// retained in ''*'''this'''
 
     '''return''' *'''this''';
 }

===Pointer To Implementation (pImpl)===
The &quot;pointer to implementation&quot; (pImpl) idiom, also called the &quot;opaque pointer&quot; idiom, is a method of providing data and thus further implementation abstraction for Classes.

In C++ you have to declare member variables within the class definition which is then public and that this is necessary so that an appropriate memory space is allocated means that abstraction of implementation is not possible in &quot;all&quot; classes.

However, at the cost of an extra pointer dereference and function call, you can have this level of abstraction through the Pointer to Implementation.

 class Book
 {
 public:
   void print();
 private:
   std::string  m_Contents;
 }

So somebody who works with the Book class only really needs to know about print(), but what happens if you wish to add more detail to your book class.

 class Book
 {
 public:
   void print();
 private:
   std::string  m_Contents;
   std::string  m_Title;
 }

Now all the users of book have to recompile because the object they know about got bigger, yet they still only call print().

pImpl would implement the following pattern so that this would not be a problem.

 /* public.h */
 class Book
 {
 public:
   Book();
   ~Book();
   void print();
 private:
   class BookImpl;
   BookImpl* m_p;
 }

and in a separate 'internal' header
 /* private.h */
 #include &quot;public.h&quot;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 class Book::BookImpl
 {
 public:
   void print();
 private:
   std::string  m_Contents;
   std::string  m_Title;
 }

The body of the Book class then would look something like

 Book::Book()
 {
   m_p = new BookImpl();
 }
 
 Book::~Book()
 {
   delete m_p;
 }
 
 void Book::print()
 {
   m_p-&gt;print();
 }
 
 /* then BookImpl functions */
 
 void Book::BookImpl::print()
 {
   std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;print from BookImpl&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 }

then invoked from a main function:

 int main()
 {
   Book *b = new Book();
   b-&gt;print();
   delete b;
 }

You could also use std::unique_ptr&lt;BookImpl&gt; or equivalent to manage the internal pointer.

==Synopsis==
\relax

==Description==
Donald Knuth describes this as telling TeX to &quot;do nothing.&quot; This seems like a pointless control sequence at first thought. However, some control sequences act on tokens that follow it, and \relax tells TeX to stop accepting new tokens for this control sequence. This is sometimes necessary to resolve otherwise ambiguous expressions.

==Examples==
The following piece of code looks just fine, but...
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Number &amp; Text \\
  [a] &amp; lorem ipsum \\
  [b] &amp; lorem ipsum \\
  \end{tabular}

... TeX throws an Error ''&quot;! Missing number, treated as zero. &lt;to be read again&gt; a&quot;''. TeX just ignores the end-of-line and reads the tokens &quot;\\[a]&quot; as \\[''length'']. To stop TeX reading into such things just tell it to \relax
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Number &amp; Text \\ \relax
  [a] &amp; lorem ipsum \\ \relax
  [b] &amp; lorem ipsum \\
  \end{tabular}

so TeX (and you) keep it cool.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*grave voice*&lt;/nowiki&gt; There's something important I'de like to talk to you about. Have a seat.&lt;br /&gt;
You recently added all the &quot;unsung heroes&quot; to the list of wikibookians? This appears to be a mistake. Specifically, they are no longer unsung.&lt;br /&gt;
We take mistakes very seriously here at... Wikibooks, you understand that? You clearly ought to have written &quot;unsung&quot; and then ''immediately'' have edited the page to remove the &quot;unsung&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Those who make mistakea, as you have, are traditionally forced to sit and eat... pear soup. Have fun. I will be back soon to make sure you finish your bowl, and be sure not to wander out into the rest of Wikibooks! I am Watching you.

:I don't know about pear soup, but ''eating'' is something I really hate. I'm already forced to eat daily (if not by my mom, by the urge to survive until I could contribute more to the 'pedia and the 'books). Couldn't you have thought of some less cruel punishment? Boo, hoo! :-( -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:16, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::...I have tangerine soup. It's being voted at the moment whether it should be an official punishment, but... fine.

:::I hope [[User:80.185.161.162]] got the same punishment for [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikibooks:Wikibookians&amp;diff=38190&amp;oldid=37813 this]. I strongly believe in equality, esp. w.r.t. punishments. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:12, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Paddu: for what reason do you ask me to wait before editing the C++ wikibook?  (Also, feel free to contact me via e-mail; jdennett&lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; should reach me.

----
I'm completely lost too. An internal fork is wholly undesirable, and it just makes a mess of the contributions. What ''I'' would do (I doubt this would carry water, given the circumstances) would be basically to start over, possibly moving the stuff we have currently to talk or subpages and reconstructing the book with structure in mind, since everything appears to be a bit of an amorphous mess. I'll be somewhat busy until the end of the week, but I can try and help out after this if need be. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:40, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== C++ copyright issues ==

If there are sections of Wikipedia articles in that page, and no credit is given, then yes, those are copyright violations.  I'm not familiar with the book, or the subject, really, so if you can document a few sections of the article that are copied from Wikipedia, that'd be good. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:58, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Moved from Panic's talkpage... ==

OK, now that you've read all my messages here, please look at the replies in [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] if you've not already done so &amp; if you care for my opinion. Thanks! -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 16:09, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
We are talking books (not articles or encyclopedic descriptions), there can and I hope there will be many more books about C++ and there may already exist other books on the same subject on wikibooks, I do agree that forking was not good but as you requested me to leave and you were first contributing to it, I did respect your creative control, (I really don't have the time to continue arguing with you on every point) you argue more on mood points that you do contribute any content, I have now stopped contributing (directly to C Plus Plus) your are free to revert it to my first contribution as was indicated on the talk page if you wish... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:38, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:No creative control, or whatever is tolerated here. Everyone is allowed to edit everything. I didn't ask you to leave. You could either impose your ideas elsewhere or use wikibooks as per the wiki way, so you've a choice. You shouldn't impose your ideas on wikibooks. Note that I'm more worried about your spoiling talk pages and making my comments &amp; suggestions less visible than yours, than about your forking and other alterations to the article. The article would survive much longer than your wikilife so I don't bother about it (for now at least), but your removal/relocation of my comments affects the reachability of my ideas. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 07:43, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==C++==
Hi Paddu, I moved the C++ page because -/- is not + sign. Notice there's a module &quot;Visual C (plus plus)&quot;. I think it's logical to follow such convention, when a symbol can't be used then sound out the symbol. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 11:54, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:There's a [[Programming:C plus plus]] for a long time now. This one is just a &quot;rival&quot; fork started by User:Panic2k4. Ideally we ought to consolidate everything into one page &amp; then delete other forks. But until then having more pages is counter-productive. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 12:00, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::I see your point. I hope an admin will be able to merge the pages and delete any duplicates. I know this has been mentioned but please think of a way to divide the main page into chapters in separate pages. If your team can come up with a chapters structure, then the book will be more functional. The main page is overcluttered. Thanks -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 13:01, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::Yeah of course I meant to say page/group of pages. I'm in favour of multiple-pages. But when talking about forks I tend to call the group of pages a page. I hope I haven't made this mistake in many places, or people might think I'm in favour of single page! -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:30, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::Hmm, my fault for not sticking to the topic of the &quot;Talk page&quot; issue. On that issue, there shouldn't be a replicated talk page on another module page. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 15:24, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Hi Paddu, I'm just letting you know before I save the edit for &quot;C plus plus&quot; page that I'm trying out the convention used by [[Lucid Dreaming]] where it lists the contents of module pages like the Table of Contents you'd find in a book. The purpose of this is also to try and get Panic2k4 to see that dividing the main page into separate pages is aesthetically pleasing, unburdens the page size and load time, and that it's possible to display everything on the main page (contents listing not actual contents) -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 22:39, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Are you sure?  C++ could use the help ==

You wrote elsewhere &quot;I don't think I can find enough time and patience to work on the C++ wikibook,&quot; and I have to respect that decision (after all, I've walked away once, and nearly twice).  However: some of us would appreciate your help if you have nay time, even if it's only to offer opinions or edit things you dislike rather than contributing significant new material.  I don't know for how long I'll have time to contribute to the C++ Programming book again, but for now I have time, and I'm feeling optimistic that we can make it a good deal better in a relatively short period of time.  It's your call, nobody's under any obligation to help here, but some people are more useful than others.  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 08:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
:I replied to invitations to come back posted at [[w:User talk:Paddu]] at [[User talk:SB_Johnny]]. If you'd like my opinions on specific issues, you can point me to those and I'll be glad to help.
:One opinion I would like to offer is that I think we should start with C++-style arrays/lists using STL classes and talk about C-style arrays and pointers at a later &quot;advanced&quot; stage of the book (I'm not sure how that is arranged now). I also noticed that in the TOC, unions appear before classes, whereas I'd consider unions too as an &quot;advanced&quot; topic since initially while learning classes, etc. one shouldn't be worried about memory layout, etc.
:Thanks! -- 18:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

::Fair enough; I agree that I'd like to present C++ in more of a &quot;top-down&quot; approach, and have discussed this with [[User::Darklama]].  This includes, for example, presenting RAII and the standard containers classes in the memory management chapter before giving details of new/delete/malloc/free etc, and preferring to use std::string before talking about raw arrays.  There are concerns that it's a lot of work to adjust material and presentation order to suit that, but frankly I'm prepared to put in work if we can make a good, top-down book, but not much if it's going to be a traditional bottom-up, &quot;C++ as C with extras&quot; text.  (You might note that there are two TOCs now, linking to the same underlying material; a kind of mini-fork of contents tables, which hopefully might be resolved eventually.)  Anyway, thanks for your response. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 19:40, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

::I've replied to your note on my talk page; I agree on preferring to make namespace use more explicit. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 20:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

== Issues ==

It has been 2 years, so your issues with copyright violations may have resolved itself, through many changed. [[C++ Programming/Authors]] acknowledges that some work was taken from Wikipedia and other sources. As far as Ownership issues are concerned there is attempt to address that issue now. I've added a section to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] about ownership if you wish to read it and provide constructive critisism on it. Failing that there is also text that appears below the edit box when editing a page that has been present for a long time:

== /comments_on_Panic2k4 ==

On [[User:Paddu/comments on Panic2k4]] I notice your talking about mapping between old names and to their new name. I'm not sure what your asking be done. Are you asking that links in the archives be updated to reflect their current page names? The page that you mention was deleted could be merged into the current Variables page and thus restore your contributions and everyone else who contributed to that page before it was copied pasted. Which I think would be the right thing to do. What do you think about that? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

I don't think it will be necessary for you to leave Wikibooks again. While Panic may make threats, I would point out that is one of the problems that other people are having with him as well, not just you. I think its pretty safe to say his threats are empty threats and any attempt on his part to carry out his threats and control the situation will only reafferm what people have been saying. I would like to suggest you not let his words effect what you do and just focus on what you came here to do. Personally I think his behavior even within this process can and perhaps should be used as additional examples of his dealings with other people if not already noticed by the person responsible for making the decision.--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:28, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

I would also urge you to consider not leaving Wikibooks. Panic threatened to make the page messy; if he does, like darklama said, it will confirm at least some of the accusations that people have made. I think it was highly inappropriate of him to make vague threats on that page. Your help on the C++ Wikibooks is valuable &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 01:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges]] ==

I would like to ask you politely to perhaps move that portion of what you wrote to the main &quot;project&quot; side of this page instead.  You brought up several key points that certainly have expressed some concerns and problems in your dealing with Panic, and I think it is reasonable to make them a part of this record.

As far as Panic's remarks, go ahead and cull them from your remarks as they were really more objections about the process you used than anything directly said.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

I guess my comment would be that you should remove anything you do not approve of that is yours.

== Forking proposal ==

I noticed you had taken part in the policy discussion about forking, and wonder if you might weigh in at [[Wikibooks:Forking proposal]], which is about the technical side of making good forks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

__NOTOC__
'''''Mish qingjji me barbunja''''', '''Veal with large lima beans''', is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Albania|Albanian]] dish.

==Ingredients==
*1 1/2 lb [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
*1 ounce [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], grated
*[[Cookbook:Water|water]], to cover
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
*1 8-ounce can diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 1/2 lb of large [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|lima beans]]

==Procedure==
#Select shoulder parts of the veal and cut them into 1&quot; cubes. Wash the meat thoroughly with cold water, drain, and place in a pot together with butter and onions. Stir-fry for a few minutes. 
#As the meat is frying, add water until the pieces are covered. Add salt, pepper, and only two to three tablespoons of tomatoes (note: tomatoes can be cut into pieces to the size of your choice). Cover the pot and let the meat boil.
#In the meantime, cut the ends off the lima beans and clean them well (you also cut them in half if you desire). Add the beans to the meat after it has been boiling for several minutes. Also add water until everything in the pot is covered. 
#When the beans are done boiling, add the rest of the tomatoes. Then let the stew boil for a few more minutes so that the liquid can thicken.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Please note that tomatoes should not be added all at once in the beginning since they don't allow the lima beans to boil at the right pace. If you would rather use fresh tomatoes, when you add the beans, add whole tomatoes instead of cut ones.

A simple [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] recipe; works well for thin crusts.

==Ingredients==

* warm water. ''about 100 degrees (38.00 C). try one [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] per pizza. If the batter is thin and runny like [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] batter, that's too much water, so add a little [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] to thicken it.  If you can touch the batter with your finger and not stick to it, that's too dry, so add a little water''
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] ''about 2 cups per pizza.'' ''Note that it must be at least 60%-70% white flour.  It would be heavy and wouldn't rise as much if you get too much [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] and [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] in the batter.''
* [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]. ''a 1/4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] package in the grocery store makes about 2 12&quot; pizzas.''
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. ''you need very little for the yeast, but about 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] per pizza tastes good,''
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]. ''very little; a few shakes from the salt shaker is enough for 1 pizza.''

* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable]], [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn]], or [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]]. ''about .1 to .2 cup per pizza.''

A few more ingredients in the batter make it interesting:
* [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]
* [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] and [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] spices.

==Procedure==
#Mix water, yeast, flour, and salt in a large mixing bowl. The dough rises to become about 50% larger, so use a big bowl. Set the mixing bowl so it is sitting in hot water, or place on top of a warm oven. Let rise for 20-30 minutes. Don't worry if it only rose 10% or 20%, it'll still work.
#Put vegetable oil on the pans, then sprinkle cornmeal on the oil. Put a glop of the batter on each pan and spread it so it is about .25 inch thick, with the edge .5 inch. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough so it doesn't stick to your hands.   
#Add pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings (optional, see [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] article)
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|425°F]] for about 15 to 20 minutes. Rotate every 5 minutes and move to upper or lower shelves as necessary: After 10 minutes slide a large knife under the crust. If it is dark brown, move it to a higher shelf so it doesn't burn while the top finishes cooking. If it is white or light tan, move to lower shelf so you get a crispy crust before the cheese starts turning brown on top.

On your first try,  try just one or two pizzas.  Then you can adjust it 
next time as necessary.

==Problems==
If:
; the crust isn't done in the middle : You have it too thick.
; the crust burned on the bottom : Either you had it too close to the bottom (use 2nd shelf, not lowest),  or didn't move it to a higher shelf in time. Some stoves are hotter than the thermostat, so try 400 next time.
; the crust is soggy : Water from fresh tomatoes, pineapples, and onions, can seep into the crust, so take it easy on those.
; pizza is too greasy :  Reduce oil in batter. Oil on pan needs to be film covering the pan so it doesn't burn, but it doesn't need to pool on the surface.   Some toppings (pepperoni, sausage, even cheese) will melt grease into the pizzas; try smaller pieces.  
; vegetables are overdone (e.g., dried up mushrooms, bitter peppers, soggy onion) : Vegetables don't need 20 minutes. Put them on halfway through so they still have a little texture left. Some vegetables, especially broccoli, work better when protected by a coating of oil.
; cheese is brown and dried out on top : Pizza was cooked too close to top element in oven; never use top shelf.
; crust is not very light : Use less whole wheat flour or cornmeal in the batter.  Use more yeast.

[[File:Oreo milkshake for dinner.jpg|thumb|An oreo milkshake]]

'''Milkshakes''' are beverages made by blending  cream and milk with other ingredients added for color and flavor.

== Classic Vanilla Milkshake ==

=== Ingredients ===

* 2 cups (480ml) vanilla [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]]
* 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|whole milk]]
* 1/4 cup (60ml) [[Cookbook:Half &amp; half|half &amp; half]]
* 2 1/2 tablespoons (35g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]

=== Procedure ===

Pour the milk, ice cream, and half &amp; half in a blender and partially blend, then add the sugar and flavoring until thoroughly mixed.

Serves: 1

== Oreo Milkshake ==

=== Ingredients ===

* 2 c. vanilla ice cream
* 1 c. milk
* about 6-8 Oreo cookies

=== Procedure ===

# Put ice cream in a cup and add a little milk (for thicker) and more milk (for less thick).
# Mix with a spoon until its smooth. If your cup is not filled to your desire add more ice cream and milk.
# Crush Oreos into a desired size. Put into milkshake and stir until thoroughly mixed in.
# Add anything else to the top such as &quot;magic shell&quot; or whipped cream and sprinkles

Serves: 1 or 3 if you want to share

== Banana Milkshake ==

===Ingredients===

*1 large or 2 small bananas
*vanilla ice cream
*milk
*sugar

===Procedure===

Blend the banana, ice cream and sugar, add milk until you find your desired consistency, and blend again till smooth and creamy.

An optional but tasty addition is to add a pinch of cinnamon as well.

== Super Foamy ==

The ''Super Foamy'' is a highly viscous milkshake with a smooth, airy texture. It is low-fat and, for a shake, high-fiber. Best of it all, due to its thickness it's easy to eat one's fill on a single portion. With the prototype recipe provided here, variations can be made by adding different flavors such as vanilla, banana or strawberry.

===Prototype ingredients===
*1 teaspoon locust bean gum powder (2 grams)
*1 tablespoon inulin powder (10 grams)
*2 tablespoons sweet [[Cookbook:Whey|whey]] powder (10 grams)
*200 ml [[Cookbook:Milk|skimmed milk]] (0.1 % fat)

===Procedure===
*Mix the locust bean gum powder, inulin powder and the sweet whey powder together. 
*Add the resulting powder to the skimmed milk.
*Using an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]], whip for 2 minutes until the product has turned to a fine foam. While whipping, move the whisks up and down so that air gets whipped under the shake. 

===Different tastes===
*Add the syrup or flavor of your desire.
*When using [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] for creating a chocolate milkshake, do not use the mixer to spread the flavor but use a spoon instead. The fat in the powder could cause the foam to collapse. 
*[[Cookbook:Sweeteners|Artificial sugar substitutes]] are best for giving the shake a sweet taste.

===Notes===
*One serving equals approximately 700 ml in volume and 104 kcal in energy.
*The locust bean gum acts as the [[Cookbook:Thickener|thickening agent]].
*The inulin gives the shake a smooth, &quot;mouthful&quot; texture.
*Any sources of fat must be excluded for the foam to build up. Therefore, the milk must be very low fat.
*''[[Cookbook:Whey|Whey drink powders]]'' are readily available on the market. They contain around 95 % sweet whey powder with flavor and sweeteners added. They can be used to substitute the pure sweet whey powder.
*The sweet whey powder (along with the milk) acts as the component producing the foam. Instead of the sweet whey powder you can use a fresh [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]] from a medium sized egg.

== Chocolate Shake==

===Ingredients===

*3 cups vanilla ice cream
*1 cup chocolate milk
*3 heaping tablespoons chocolate powder

*2 medium sized chocolates

===Procedure===

Pour all ingredients into the blender and blend until well mixed. Ice cream and chocolate milk can be added to change the consistency. Crushed Oreo cookies can be added after blending if desired.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called DX. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name DX~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The assumption that a Computer == IA32 PC is a bit strange. Maybe generalize it a bit? Or else a general description of a Von Neumann computer architecture and then other sections which show how this is implemented in different designs? 

Please note also that you can make computers which are radically different from the Von Neumann architecture. Thinking Machines Connection Machine comes to mind. At least point out what you mean with ''computer'' in this book.

== Duplicating Wikipedia information? ==

I've checked in a few updates to this book recently but it strikes me that a lot of this information is already in the Wikipedia.  Are there any policies on pulling stuff in from Wikipedia?  Obviously it's OK licensing-wise but could make maintenance somewhat tricky, since there'll be two copies of the information...  Any thoughts / suggestions?

== Target audience ? ==

Are we simply describing what all these components *do*, for the target audience of people who considering buying system A vs. system B and need help decoding the specifications ?

Or are we going to go on and describe how to install/replace these components, for the target audience of people who are considering upgrading their computer, and perhaps building an entire system from scratch ?

== Suggestion ==

Hi,

I've a suggestion on how to improve this page. I remember my computer hardware course at EPFL 5 years ago. Although the material was a bit old (678k oriented), the general layout was very good, beginning by a very general description speaking about CPU, Memory, IO and their connecting buses. I suggest doing something like this for this page. The IA32 oriented part could be a section.

Another question not really connected to this, but is there any kind of support for vector graphic in wikipedia's based wikis? It would be cool to be able to put svg graphics for schematic. It would also be cool to have a standard graphic line.

Steph

--[[User:Nct|Nct]] 09:03, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Yes, SVG is supported. See [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/SVG]] for lots of examples of svg images on a wikibook page. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 02:12, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== RAM ==
This info. &quot;RAM is needed because hard drives are too slow to operate with the speed of a microprocessor.&quot; Does ''not'' seem correct. RAM is '''required''' to hold programs and data for the CPU to access it. HDD is for ''''permanent'''' storage, not for working with data or executing programs.

The data in the RAM is being ''constantly'' changed, such as screen displays. I don't see how it would be possible to operate ''directly'' from the hard drive. It would NEVER be fast enough as the data has to go though several(?) interfaces &amp; cables. 

Remember a HDD is a ''mechanical'' device. CPU are running at billions of operations per second. Even a Solid State (Flash RAM) Hard Drive possibly couldn't keep up. AND Flash RAM has a limited number of Read/ Write cyles. (Less than a HDD?)

You can run a computer without a HDD. But NOT without RAM. Person who wrote this may be being confused by use of HDD for virtual 'memory'?

I moved ''Brown Sugar'' module to ''Brown sugar''. I'm sorry if that's inconvenient for anyone, but I was trying to rationalise it with the main Sweeteners page. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 11:30, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:That messed up the Sugar page. The duplication is stupid anyway. I'll get the individual sugars off of the Sweeteners page, and obviously restore this. In general, the Cookbook frequently suffers from such duplication. Just a few weeks ago I sorted out the differences between the Fish page and the Seafood page, removing a list of fish from the Seafood page to prevent future problems.

===The Problem===

Consider the following SQL query in PHP:

 $result=mysql_query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=&quot;'.$_GET['username'].'&quot;');

The query selects all rows from the users table where the username is equal to the one put in the query string. If you look carefully, you'll realise that the statement is vulnerable to SQL Injection - quotes in &lt;code&gt;$_GET['username']&lt;/code&gt; are not escaped, and thus will be concatenated as part of the statement, which can allow malicious behaviour.

Consider what would happen if &lt;code&gt;$_GET['username']&lt;/code&gt; was the following: &lt;code&gt;&quot; OR 1 OR username = &quot;&lt;/code&gt; (a double-quote, followed by a textual &quot; OR 1 OR username = &quot; followed by another double-quote). When concatenated into the original expression, you have a query that looks like this: &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = &quot;&quot; OR 1 OR username = &quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The seemingly redundant &lt;code&gt;OR username = &quot;&lt;/code&gt; part added is to ensure that the SQL statement evaluates without error. Otherwise, a hanging double quote would be left at the end of the statement.

This selects all rows from the users table.

===The Solution===

Never trust user provided data, process this data only after validation; as a rule, this is done by pattern matching. In the example below, the username is restricted to alphanumerical chars plus underscore and to a length between eight and 20 chars - modify as needed.
&lt;pre&gt;
 if (preg_match(&quot;/^\w{8,20}$/&quot;, $_GET['username'], $matches))
   $result = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=$matches[0]&quot;);
 else // we don't bother querying the database
   echo &quot;username not accepted&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

For increased security, you might want to abort the script's execution replacing &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;exit()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;die()&lt;/code&gt;.

This issue still applies when using checkboxes, radio buttons, select lists, etc. Any browser request(even &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;) can be replicated through telnet, duplicate sites, javascript, or code (even PHP), so always be cautious of any restrictions set on client-side code.

==Use of &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string()&lt;/code&gt;==

PHP provides you with a function to deal with user input in MySQL, and that is &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string(string unescaped_string[, resource link_identifier])&lt;/code&gt;. This script escapes all potentially dangerous characters in the string provided and returns the escaped string such that it may be safe to put into a MySQL query. However, if you do not sanitize input prior to passing it to &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string()&lt;/code&gt; function you still may have SQL injection vectors. For example; &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; would not protect against an SQL injection vector such as the following: 

&lt;pre&gt;
  $result = &quot;SELECT fields FROM table WHERE id = &quot;.mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['id']);
&lt;/pre&gt;

If &lt;code&gt;$_POST['id']&lt;/code&gt; contained &lt;code&gt;23 OR 1=1&lt;/code&gt; then the resulting query would be:

&lt;pre&gt;
  SELECT fields FROM table WHERE id = 23 OR 1=1
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is a valid SQL injection vector.

(The original function, &lt;code&gt;mysql_escape_string&lt;/code&gt;, did not take the current character set in account for escaping the string, nor accepted the connection argument. It is deprecated since PHP 4.3.0.)

For example, consider one of the examples above:

 $result=mysql_query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=&quot;'.$_GET['username'].'&quot;');

This could be escaped as follows:

 $result=mysql_query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=&quot;'.mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['username']).'&quot;');

This way, if the user tried to inject another statement such as a &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt;, it would harmlessly be interpreted as part of the WHERE clause parameter as expected:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE username = '\';DELETE FROM `forum` WHERE title != \''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The backslashes added by &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string&lt;/code&gt; make MySQL interpret them as actual single quote characters rather than as part of the SQL statement.

Note that MySQL does not allow stacking of queries so the &lt;code&gt;;DELETE FROM table&lt;/code&gt; attack would not work anyway

== Use Parameterized Statements ==

The [http://pear.php.net/package/DB PEAR's DB package] provides a prepare/execute mechanism to do parameterized statements.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
require_once(&quot;DB.php&quot;);
$db = &amp;DB::connect(&quot;mysql://user:pass@host/database1&quot;);
$p = $db-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?&quot;);
$db-&gt;execute( $p, array($_GET['username']) );
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

The query() method, also do the same as prepare/execute,

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
$db-&gt;query( &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?&quot;, array($_GET['username']) );
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

The prepare/execute will automatically call &lt;code&gt;mysql_real_escape_string()&lt;/code&gt; as discussed in the above section.

&lt;!-- below is copied/modified from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&amp;oldid=253029027 --&gt;
In PHP version 5 and MySQL version 4.1 and above, it is also possible to use prepared statements through &lt;code&gt;mysqli&lt;/code&gt; extension&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.php.net/mysqli Official documentation for Mysqli extension], php.net.&lt;/ref&gt;. Example&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mattbango.com/articles/prepared-statements-in-php-and-mysqli Prepared Statements in PHP and MySQLi], Matt Bango.&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$db = new mysqli(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;database&quot;);
$stmt = $db -&gt; prepare(&quot;SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=? AND password=?&quot;);
$stmt -&gt; bind_param(&quot;ss&quot;, $user, $pass);
$stmt -&gt; execute(); 
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!-- end copied/modified from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&amp;oldid=253029027 --&gt;

Similarly, you could use the built-in [http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php PDO Class] in PHP5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Scytale cipher''' is a type of transposition cipher used since the 7th century BCE. The first recorded use of the scytale cipher was by the Spartans and the ancient Greeks who used it to transport battle information between generals.

== Encryption Using the Scytale ==
The scytale encryption system relies on rods of wood with equal radiuses. The system is a symmetric key system where the radius of the rod is the key.

After establishing keys a messenger winds a strip of leather around the rod. Then he writes the message going across the rod, so that when he unwinds the leather the letters have been jumbled in a meaningless fashion.

Example:
Suppose the rod allows you to write 4 letters around it in one circle and 5 letters down the side.
Clear text: &quot;Help me I am under attack&quot;
To encrypt one simply writes across the leather...

 _____________________________________________________________
     |  |   |   |   |   |   |
     |  | H | E | L | P | M |  
     |__| E | I | A | M | U |__ 
        | N | D | E | R | A |  |
        | T | T | A | C | K |  |
        |   |   |   |   |   |  |
 ______________________________________________________________

so the cipher text becomes, &quot;HENTEIDTLAEAPMRCMUAK&quot; after unwinding.

== Decryption Using the Scytale ==
To decrypt all you must do is wrap the leather strip around the rod and read across. 
Example:
ciphertext: &quot;HENTEIDTLAEAPMRCMUAK&quot;
Every fourth letter will appear on the same line so the cipher text becomes
 HELPM...return to the beginning once you reach the end and skip used letters. ...EIAMUNDERATTACK. 
Insert spaces and the plain text returns, &quot;Help me I am under attack&quot;

==Switch Cases==

===How They Work===
Here's an example of a simple game where a user enters a $user_command and different functions are run as a result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if($user_command == &quot;n&quot;)
{
  go_north();
}
else if($user_command == &quot;e&quot;)
{
  go_east();
}
else if($user_command == &quot;s&quot;)
{
  go_south();
}
else if($user_command == &quot;w&quot;)
{
  go_west();
}
else
{
  do_something_else();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Clearly, there's a lot of repeated code here. The switch case structure allows you to avoid this redundant code. It allows programmers to repeatedly compare the value of a certain variable to a list of possible values and execute code based on the result. This is the syntax for a switch case statement, compared to the same code written using if statements:

{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
! '''if statement style''' !! '''switch case style'''
|- 
| width=50%|
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  if($firstvariable == 'comparison1' 
      || $firstvariable == 'comparison2')
  {
    doSomething();
    doSomethingElse();
  }
  else if ($firstvariable == 'comparison3')
  {
    doAThirdThing();
  }
  else
  {
    launchMissiles();
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
| width=50%|
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  // Look at how much switch case saves you!
  switch($firstvariable)
  {
  case 'comparison1':
  case 'comparison2':
    doSomething();
    doSomethingElse();
    break;
  
  case 'comparison3':
    doAThirdThing();
    break;
  
  default: 
    launchMissiles();
    break;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The switch case style will save you from retyping $firstvariable, and make your code look cleaner (especially, if that code is a long chain of simple if statements). Returning to our zorkmid sample program, we have:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
! '''Original Code''' !! '''Switch-Case Code'''
|- 
| width=50%|
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  if($user_command == &quot;n&quot;)
  {
    go_north();
  }
  else if($user_command == &quot;e&quot;)
  {
    go_east();
  }
  else if($user_command == &quot;s&quot;)
  {
    go_south();
  }
  else if($user_command == &quot;w&quot;)
  {
    go_west();
  }
  else
  {
    do_something_else();
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
| width=50%|
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  switch($user_command)
  {
    case 'n':
      go_north();
      break;
    case 'e':
      go_east();
      break;
    case 's':
      go_south();
      break;
    case 'w':
      go_west();
      break;
    default:
      do_something_else();
      break;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

===Syntax===

  switch($var)
  {
  case [value]:
    [code]
    break;
  
  case [value]:
    [code]
    break;
  
  ...
  
  default:
    [code]
    break;
  }

In this example, $var is the first variable to be compared. This variable is then compared against each case statement from the top down, until it finds a match. At that point, the code will excecute until a break statement is reached (that will allow you to leave the case statement entirely).

===Important Warning about Using Switch Case Statements===
Don't forget to use break when you mean break! If you forget, you might run functions you don't intend to. However, there are circumstances where leaving breaks out can be useful. Consider this example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  switch ($n) {
  case 0:
  case 1:
  case 2:
    //only executes, if $n is 0, 1 or 2
    doSomethingForNumbers2OrSmaller();
    break;
  case 3:
    //only executes, if $n is 3
    doSomethingForNumber3();
  default:
    //only executes, if $n is 3 or above
    doSomethingForNumbers3OrBigger();
    break;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This kind of coding is sometimes frowned upon, since it's not always as clear to see what the code is meant to do. Also, consider commenting case statements that aren't supposed to have a break; statement before the next case, so when others look at your code, they know not to add a break. In such a case, it is good programming practice to add comments to breakless cases so that it is clear that the break has been omitted deliberately:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  switch ($n) {
  case 0:
    // Falls through!
  case 1:
    doSomethingForLargeNumbers();
    // Falls through!
  case 2:
    doSomethingForSmallerNumbers();
    break;
  …
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Sun''' is an ordinary star that was born out of a cloud of matter called the primordial nebula 4½ thousand million years ago (4.5 billion years), along with the 8 known planets in our corner of space called the [[General Astronomy/The Solar System|Solar System]]. The Sun is mainly composed of Hydrogen, a much smaller amount of Helium together with other chemical elements. It is a globe of intensely hot plasma, 1,391,785,000 Km in diameter, more than a million times bigger than our Earth. It shines through an atomic process called nuclear-fusion: four bits of Hydrogen join to 4 bits of Helium; the Sun gives off heat and light, and loses solid material into space. This all happens every second and our Sun loses 4 million tonnes of matter during that brief time. The Sun's centre has a temperature of 15 million degrees centigrade, cooling to 6 thousand degrees at its gaseous surface.
Our Sun is not motionless in space; in fact, it has two kinds of motion. One is a seemingly straight-line motion in the direction of the constellation Hercules at the rate of about 12 Km per second. But since the Sun is a part of the Milky Way system, and since our Milky Way galaxy rotates slowly around its own centre, the Sun also moves at the rate of 175 Km per second as part of the rotating Milky Way system.

Our Sun is one star in 100,000 million, which goes to make up our galaxy, the Milky Way. Some stars are small and dim while others are super-giants by comparison. Our Milky Way is shaped like two fried eggs back to back and is a noticeable spiral formation of stars. In terms of size, our galaxy is huge, at the speed of light of 300,000 Km a second it takes 4.2 years to travel to Earth from our nearest star - Proxima Centauri. On this scale it takes a single pulse of light 100,000 years to travel across the length of our galaxy from end to end. 

As the Sun ages, it gradually expands and cools; although; prior to that period, the Sun will &quot;burn&quot; helium or other even heavier elements as the core of the Sun reaches higher and higher temperatures and densities. As a result of the Sun's increased temperature life on Earth will cease.  The extreme heat generated will be catastrophic for Earth: the oceans will boil away and life as we know it will end.  Long before the Sun reaches the Red Giant phase, the surface of the Earth will literally be molten as the temperature of the Sun increases.  It is estimated that the Sun's brilliancy will increase by 10% over the next 1.1 billion years or more, and in about 6.5 billion years, our aging star will have doubled its present luminosity.

Eight billion years from now, when the Sun does reach the Red Giant phase, the Sun's radius will extend beyond the present orbit of Venus, causing the total destruction of Earth.

Our own Sun will continue to shine for generations to come, until its supply of Hydrogen fuel is used up, and then its central regions will shrink as different fusion reactions compensate. The Sun will then expand into a huge red-giant star eating up all of the planets from Mercury to Mars (Earth included), and vaporising the atmospheres of the remaining gas giant planets until these too are destroyed. Fortunately by this time our human race will have became technically advanced, so we will have set off on journeys to find safe havens on other planets among the stars - Star Trek style.

The sun’s brilliant surface layer is called the Photosphere (which means the ‘sphere-of-light’). Incorrect observation of the Sun causes blindness because of the tremendous amount of visible and invisible light coming off of its surface. 

Sunspots are appropriately named. They appear as spots on the disk of the Sun. A sunspot will have a very dark central region known as the umbra. It is often surrounded by a less dark halo known as the penumbra.

The umbra is dark because it is cooler (around 3,500°C) than the surrounding sunscape (around 5,500°C). They appear move across the Sun as the Sun spins on its axis. Because the Sun is gaseous in nature and behaves like a fluid it does not spin as a rigid body. A spot near the equator will take about 25 days to complete one rotation. A spot near a pole, if there were ever one there, will take over a month to make the trip. Collections of sunspot sketches over a period of several years reveal the 11-year cycle of sunspots. Over that period the numbers of spots goes from a maximum to a minimum and back.

There also appears to be a relationship with the size and number of sunspots and Earth’s weather. During the Maunder minimum 1645-1715 there were no observable sunspots and Britain plunged into a mini ice age. However in resent years 2003 – 2004 there have been large sunspot numbers with some unusually large sunspots. This has coincided with hot summers and is believed to be one of the causes for global warming.

In addition to heat and light, the Sun also generates solar wind, a stream of ionized particles that radiates outward through the solar system at high speeds. One of the effects of solar wind is that it forces the tails of comets to point away from the Sun.

The solar wind also interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, causing the aurora and other phenomena. Solar flares — eruptions — of hydrogen gas on the surface of the Sun can also cause disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field.

The chromosphere is above the photosphere. Solar energy passes through this region on its way out from the centre of the Sun.

Faculae and flares arise in the chromosphere. Faculae are bright luminous hydrogen clouds, which form above regions where sunspots are about to form. Flares are bright filaments of hot gas emerging from sunspot regions.

Sunspots are dark depressions on the photosphere with a typical temperature of 4,000°C. In 1998, scientists observed for the first time solar flares producing seismic waves in the Sun's interior that resemble those created by earthquakes. They observed a flare-generated solar quake equivalent to an 11.3 magnitude earthquake. It contained about 40,000 times the energy released in the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

The corona is the outer part of the Sun's atmosphere. It is in this region that prominences appear. Prominences are immense clouds of glowing gas that erupt from the upper chromosphere. The outer region of the corona stretches far into space and consists of particles travelling slowly away from the Sun. The corona can only be seen during total solar eclipses.

Eclipses occur when the Sun, Earth and Moon line up. They are rare because the Moon usually passes above or below the imaginary line connecting Earth and the Sun. In a solar eclipse the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun. This can only happen when the phase of the Moon is &quot;new.&quot; That occurs because for Earth-based observers, the far side of the Moon is illuminated while the side facing Earth is in darkness. The Moon like any sphere, casts a shadow. A solar eclipse occurs when that shadow sweeps across Earth. The black cone is called the umbra. An observer anywhere inside that region is completely in shade. None of the Sun is visible from there.

Surrounding the umbra is the penumbra. An observer there will see some, but not all, of the Sun. Outside of these regions all of the Sun is visible. Note that the tip of the umbra barely touches Earth. At the current time the position of the Moon relative to the Sun is such that the Moon, which is 400 times smaller that the Sun, is 400 times closer! This means that the two objects appear to be the same size in the sky. Only observers at the tip of the umbral cone will see a total solar eclipse. A large number of observers across the globe will see a partial solar eclipse if they are in the penumbra.
 
An annular eclipse is a special partial solar eclipse. Because the Moon's orbit around Earth is an ellipse, not a circle, the Moon's distance from Earth varies. When the Moon is far from Earth it appears slightly smaller in the sky. (Earth's orbit around the Sun is also an ellipse, and during January, Earth is at its closest point to the Sun. The Sun's size is slightly larger than during the rest of the year.) With a &quot;small&quot; Moon and a &quot;large&quot; Sun the Moon will not completely block out the Sun. The umbra does not touch Earth. An observer would have to be above the surface of Earth to see a total eclipse. For individuals in just the right location, the Sun appears as a ring (annulus) around the silhouetted Moon.

In a lunar eclipse the Moon moves into Earth's shadow. They can only occur when the moon is &quot;full.&quot; Observers on the night side of Earth see the Moon take on a reddish hue as it moves into Earth's umbra. If the entire disk of the Moon moves into the umbra it is a total lunar eclipse. If only a portion does, then it is a partial lunar eclipse.

Penumbral lunar eclipses are very difficult to detect because the Moon dims only slightly while moving through that region. Lunar eclipses are more common than solar eclipses. Total eclipses of the Sun and Moon are partial before and after totality.

Moving away from the sun at the centre of our solar system we arrive at the closest planet, Mercury, while there are eight known planets altogether including Earth. A planet is a sizeable body that orbits around a star. A planet also has no light of its own and therefore is only visible by reflecting starlight, in our case sunlight off its surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section deals with Rules, a general way to state when a predicate is true. 

== Rules ==

So far we haven't really been doing any programming, just defining objects and their properties. The first step to programming in prolog is the use of '''rules'''. With rules we state that a predicate is true, provided that other predicates are true. A rule looks like this:

 a :- b, c, d.

This says that a is true, if b, c and d are true. If we have the following database

 a :- b, c, d.
 b.
 c.
 d :- e.
 e.

and we were to ask prolog if a is true
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- a.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
prolog would take the query (or goal) a and from that generate the ''sub-goals'' b, c and d. It can see that b and c are true, directly, as they are stated as facts, but d is only true if e is true, which leads to another sub-goal, e. Since e is also a fact, prolog will answer yes.

== Rules with Variables ==

We can use predicates with terms as well.

 car(corvette) :- haswheels(corvette), haswindows(corvette).

states that a corvette is a car if it has wheels and windows. This isn't a very useful statement, as we could also simply state that a corvette is a car with 
 
 car(corvette).

We can however use variables in rules. This way we can state, for instance that anything is a car provided that it has wheels and windows:

 car(A) :- haswheels(A), haswindows(A).
 haswheels(corvette).
 haswindows(corvette).

The first line states that for car(A) to be true, haswheels(A) and haswindows(A) need to be true. If prolog is asked whether a corvette is a car with 

 ?- car(corvette).

it will bind A to corvette, and get the sub-goals '''haswheels(corvette)''' and '''haswindows(corvette)'''. If it can prove both these goals (which it can), then car(corvette) must be true.
When using variables in a program it's important to note that a variable doesn't mean anything beyond the sentence it's in. If two sentences use the variable A, it's not the same variable. For example:

 bird(A) :- hasfeathers(A).
 dog(A) :- barks(A).

The A in the first line simply shows that the term of the predicate bird needs to be the same as the term of the predicate hasfeathers, it has nothing to do with the A in the second line.

Now we can return to our original program and add some rules.
 
 human(david).
 human(john).
 human(suzie).
 human(eliza).
 man(david).
 man(john).
 woman(suzie).
 woman(eliza).
 parent(david, john).
 parent(john, eliza).
 parent(suzie, eliza).
 
 father(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), man(X).
 mother(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), woman(X).

We can ask prolog who is the father of eliza:
 
 ?- father(X, eliza).
 
 X = john ;
 No

Or to list all fathers in the database and their respective children:

 ?- father(Father, Child).
 
 Father = david
 Child = john ;
 
 Father = john
 Child = eliza ;
 
 No

== Examples ==

 ?- mother(Mother,Child).
 
 Mother = suzie
 Child = eliza ;
 
 No

== Exercises ==

----

If you've used any other programming language, you may be familiar with recursion, which refers to a function calling itself. Prolog is particularly well suited for recursion, although in our case, it will be a predicate referring to itself, rather than a function. Go to the next section to see how and why this is done.

In Roman and Greek mythology, '''the planet Mercury''' played an important role in the religious life of many ancient civilizations. In Roman religion, Mercury was god of commerce and messenger of the gods, identified with the Greek Hermes. He was honoured at the Mercuralia, a festival held in May and attended primarily by traders and merchants.

Mercury is the closest planet to our sun lying at a mean distance of 57.909 million km and has a equatorial radius of 2,439 km, so that not only is Mercury slightly more than 1,367.6 km larger than the moon, it also looks very similar because the planet is covered with impact craters. The other unique attribute of Mercury is that the planet is almost entirely spherical since the planet’s polar diameter is the about the same as its equatorial diameter.

The planet is inclined on its axis at a mere 0.01º which is the lowest of all the planets in our solar system. Mercury is upright in its orbital path around the sun which takes only 87.968 days (115.88 Synodic days) to complete, as the planet rushes through space at 47.87 km/s.

The orbital inclination of Mercury is 7º. If it were possible to visit Mercury, the pole star would be the tenth magnitude star TYCHO 4215-996-1 in the northern constellation of Draco, the dragon.

The first attempts by amateur astronomers to measure the length of the planet’s solar day by observing and mapping surface markings, were quite wide of the mark; furthermore, only true measurements made by earthbound radar and spacecraft visiting Mercury, found the true figure to be 4,222.6 hours. Therefore Mercury’s solar day is almost 176 earth days in length, and about twice as long as the planet’s year. Mercury rotates on its axis three times while it circles the Sun twice in synchronous rotation. The planet's sidereal day - the time it takes to rotate on its axis - is 1,407.6 hours, or 58.785 earth days, in length.

Prehistoric man probably saw Mercury; the first recorded observation was by Timocharis in 265 BC. The early Greeks believed that the east and west elongations of Mercury represented two separate objects which they called Hermes (evening star) and Apollo (morning star). When later the Greeks recognized that Mercury was one object, they designated it Hermes, the messenger of the gods, and god of twilight and dawn who announced the rising of Zeus. The ancient Egyptians however, first discovered that Mercury (called by them Sabkou) orbited the Sun.

To the Teutonic people Mercury was known as Woden, and our anglicized version of the midweek day Wednesday is derived from the original Woden's Day. The present name Mercury is derived directly from the Latin name Mercurius, which is the Roman designation for the Greek name Hermes.

Because Mercury and its neighbour the planet Venus are inferior planets - that is, they lie inside earth’s orbit - they are both able to display phases like our Moon, as they travel around the sun. The Italian astronomer Zupus first observed the phases of Mercury in 1639. Hevelius later observed them independently in 1644.

Another phenomenon associated with Mercury and Venus is a planetary transit, which takes place when Mercury (or Venus) passes between the Earth and the Sun. On such rare occasions, the inferior planet may be seen as a small black disk passing slowly across the Sun’s brilliant surface in transit. The transit of Mercury was first predicted by Kepler in 1630 and was observed by Gassendi.

The first recorded observations of the surface markings were by Schroter and Harding in 1800. In the same year, Schroter incorrectly measured a rotation period of 24 hours with a rotation axis inclined 70° to the orbital plane. Another incorrect rotation period of 88 days determined by Schiaparelli 80 years later was not corrected until the advent of recent radar observations, which in turn were confirmed by measurements made by the first Mercury space craft visitor Mariner 10. 

It had been thought that the planet Mercury had no atmosphere whatsoever because of its low escape velocity of 4.3 km/s and its close proximity to the Sun, since the rapid movement of any atmospheric atoms would be greater than its escape velocity. However, visiting spacecraft, in particular Mariner 10, did detect a tenuous atmosphere - or &quot;exosphere&quot; - with a total mass of less than 1,000 kilograms. It has a measured composition of: 42% oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 29% sodium (Na), 22% hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 6% helium (He) and 0.5% potassium (K). There were also very low traces of water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, despite the average surface temperature of Mercury being 169 degrees Celsius. However, the atmosphere is still essentially a vacuum in every sense of the word.

Although Mercury is remarkably similar to the Moon, it is different from it in many respects. This was unexpected, based on observations from Earth prior the Mariner 10 mission. On the one hand it was known that Mercury reflects sunlight and radar waves in the same manner, as does the Moon.

This similarity combined with the probable absence of any appreciable atmosphere suggested a cratered surface and a lunar-like regolith of pulverized rock mantling the surface of the planet as the result of meteoritic bombardment. On the other hand, the bulk density of the planet was known to be almost the same as that of Earth and about 60 percent greater than that of the Moon, implying that Mercury was a body greatly enriched in the heavy elements and, like Earth, perhaps having an iron-rich core.

The surface of Mercury, like that of the Moon, was found to be pockmarked with impact craters. However, not expected was the discovery that Mercury, unlike the Moon, has a weak but nevertheless Earth-like magnetic field whose origin is undoubtedly related to a large iron-rich core. Paradoxically, Mercury has a Moon-like exterior and an Earth-like interior.

Craters and basins dominate the illuminated surface observed by Mariner 10 as it first approached Mercury. This region of Mercury shows a heavily cratered surface that at first glance could be mistaken for the lunar highlands. In marked contrast to this view of Mercury, the surface photographed after the flyby, as the spacecraft receded from Mercury, exhibited features totally different from those shown on the incoming views, including large basins and extensive relatively smooth areas with few craters.

The smooth surfaces are clearly younger than the heavily cratered ground seen in the incoming views of Mercury. The most striking feature in this region of the planet is a huge circular basin, 1300 km in diameter that was undoubtedly produced from a tremendous impact comparable to the event that formed the Imbrium basin on the Moon. This prominent Mercurial feature, named Caloris Planitia - or Caloris Basin - is filled with material forming a smooth surface or plain that appears similar in many respects to the lunar Maria.

Mercury, much like the Moon, can thus present two totally different faces; one is a heavily cratered surface like the highlands on the backside of the Moon, and the second shows a region of large basins filled with smooth plains similar to the front side of the Moon.

Both the heavily cratered regions of Mercury and the craters themselves, however, differ from their lunar counterparts.

Mercury's heavily cratered surfaces exhibit relatively smooth areas or plains between the craters and basins, whereas the lunar highlands display closely packed and overlapping craters. In many cases, these &quot;intercrater&quot; plains appear to predate that time when most of the large Mercurial craters were formed. 

The lunar and Mercurial heavily cratered surfaces are probably different because the force of gravity on Mercury is twice that on the Moon. The ballistic range of material ejected from a primary crater on Mercury is less than that on the Moon and, consequently, covers, depending on the ejection velocity, an area from a fifth to a twentieth smaller for craters of the same size.

As a result, ejecta deposits and secondary craters on Mercury are confined more closely around the primary crater than on the Moon; thus, the early cratering record stored in the surface features of Mercury may be better preserved than on the Moon. Ejecta-forming secondary craters from the most recent large basin events on the Moon have been superposed on the earlier record of primary craters, increasing the density of craters and obliterating the earlier activity.

The difference in the gravity fields is also probably responsible for the variation in the geometry of craters of the same size on the two bodies. In both cases, the smallest craters are bowl-shaped and with increasing size exhibit central peaks and develop terraces on their inner walls.

At the larger sizes, the central peaks become complex structures and undergo a transition into an inner mountain ring that is concentric with the crater rim.

Although this progressive change in crater geometry is the same on both the Moon and Mercury, the change from one type to another occurs with smaller diameters on Mercury and apparently reflects gravitationally induced modifications to the original excavation crater.

An additional important difference between the heavily cratered surfaces of Mercury and the Moon are the lobate scarps or cliffs that are several kilometres high and extend for hundreds of kilometres across the Mercurial surface. 

The scarp named Discovery is one of the best examples of this feature. Its shape and transection relationships suggest that scarps are thrust faults resulting from compressive stresses, perhaps due to cooling and shrinkage of the iron-rich core, and causing crustal shortening on a global scale.

Regardless of the mechanism for forming these escarpments, their presence in the large, well preserved craters establishes an approximate relative time scale for their age and eliminates the possibility that planet-wide melting or Earth-like movement of crustal plates has taken place since the heavily cratered ground was created.

The extensive areas of smooth surfaces or plains on Mercury have been classified into three types. The most widespread type forms a level to gently rolling ground between and around large craters and basins.

These &quot;intercrater&quot; plains are characterized by an extremely high density of superimposed small (5 to 10 km) craters, which are frequently elongate, shallow, and suggestive of being of secondary origin. A second type, &quot;hummocky&quot; plains, occurs within a broad ring that is 600 to 800 km wide and circumscribes the Caloris Planitia. These plains consist of low, closely spaced to scattered hills, and have been interpreted to be material ejected during the cratering event that produced the Caloris basin. &quot;Smooth&quot; plains are the third type and form relatively level tracts with a very low population of craters, both within and external to Caloris Planitia as well as in some of the smaller basins (e.g., Borealis Planitia in the Borealis quadrangle).

The smooth plains are similar to the lunar maria and, if analogous, result from extensive lava flows that would reflect an extended period of volcanism on Mercury after the Caloris event. In addition to the cratered surfaces and plains regions, several other distinctive topographic features occur.

A system of linear hills and valleys that extends up to 300 kilometres cuts through, or modifies, some parts of the heavily cratered areas in the Discovery quadrangle. These valleys are scalloped and range up to 10 km wide.

The best example of this type of feature extends more than 1000 km to the northeast from the mountainous rim, Caloris Montes, in the Shakespeare quadrangle. Both examples are similar to the so-called lunar Imbrium sculpture.

It is generally believed that this type of lineated surface feature resulted from excavations by secondary projectiles when the large basins were formed and, possibly, fracturing and faulting of the planet's crust during the basin formation. The basin associated with the lineations in the Discovery quadrangle is unknown, but it may be found in the darkened hemisphere that was hidden from Mariner 10's cameras.

Some of the most peculiar and interesting landforms seen on Mercury are in another region in the Discovery quadrangle that has been termed &quot;hilly and lineated.&quot; The hills are 5 to 10 km wide and vary from a few hundred meters up to almost 2 km in height. This region included many old degraded craters whose rims have been broken up into hills and valleys. Similar surfaces are known at two sites on the Moon. In all three cases, the regions are antipodal to the youngest large basins (Imbrium and Orientale on the Moon and Caloris on Mercury).

For this reason, there could be a genetic relationship between the formation of the basins and the hilly and lineated terrain.

It has been suggested that seismic waves generated by the basin impacts are focused in the antipodal region and are the cause of the peculiar surfaces.

Well-defined bright streaks or ray systems radiating away from craters constitute another distinctive feature of the Mercurial surface, again in remarkable similarity to the Moon. The rays cut across and are superposed on all other surface features, indicating that the source craters are the youngest topographic features on the surface of Mercury. 

Despite some differences, the striking duplication of surface features between Mercury and the Moon suggests that although an absolute time scale for the development of the Mercurial surface must remain uncertain, the relative sequence of events for the two bodies must have been very similar, if not contemporary. The greatest uncertainty in the Mercurial absolute time scale is: When did the heavy bombardment forming the heavily cratered surfaces (lunar highlands) and the large basins (lunar Imbrium and Orientale) come to an end'?

Within these uncertainties, Mercury's evolution can be divided into five stages or epochs. The first epoch includes the interval of time at the earliest stage of the solar system, condensation of the solar nebula into solids, and the accumulation of the solid material into the main mass of Mercury. 

It is not known whether the planet accumulated heterogeneously or homogeneously; i.e., whether it formed directly as an iron core with a silicate crust, or whether the proto-Mercury was initially a mixture of iron and silicates which subsequently melted and separated into the core and crust configuration. Regardless of how the planet accumulated, all crustal melting must have been completed well before the craters in the heavily cratered surfaces were formed to have preserved their shapes and geometries to the present time.

Moreover, if Mercury ever had been enveloped in an atmosphere either during or immediately after accumulation, aeolian degradation of craters would have occurred, similar to that seen on Mars.

Because such degradation has not been recognized, any atmosphere must have disappeared before the oldest cratered surfaces were formed.

The second epoch following accumulation and chemical separation was a period of heavy bombardment by large objects from an unknown source that produced the heavily cratered surfaces and the large basins; this epoch was terminated by the time of the Caloris event. It is not certain whether this last period of heavy bombardment was the terminal phase of the accumulation of Mercury, or if it was the second episode of bombardment unrelated to the accretionary phase. The &quot;intercrater&quot; plains probably represent an older surface that predates this second epoch, or they may have been emplaced during the period of heavy bombardment. Because the lobate scarps are prevalent in the intercrater areas and sometimes pass through and deform some of the older craters, core shrinkage and crustal shortening may have occurred during the end of the first epoch and extended into at least the early part of the second.

The Caloris basin was a massive event marking the onset of the third epoch. It produced the mountainous ring Caloris Montes and the basin Caloris Planitia, as well as the ejecta deposits and sculpturing of the older heavily cratered surface that can be traced more than 1000 km from the ring of mountains. If the Caloris basin were contemporary with our Moon's two youngest basins, Imbrium and Orientale, an absolute time for the Caloris event would be about 4 billion years ago.

The start of the fourth epoch followed an indeterminate but probably short, period after the Caloris event. During this time broad plains were formed, most probably as a result of widespread volcanism grossly similar to that which produced the lunar maria. It has been suggested, however, that the smooth plains surrounding the Caloris Planitia (i.e., the Suisei, Odin, and Tir Planitia) are ejecta from Caloris that were melted by the impact. If the smooth plains are analogous to lunar maria, this fourth epoch may represent the period from four to 3 billion years ago. If the plains are impact melt, they must be contemporary with the Caloris event, about 4 billion years in age.

The fifth and final epoch in what can be recognized in Mercurial history probably extends from about 3 billion years ago to the present. Little has happened on Mercury during this period except for a light &quot;dusting&quot; of meteoritic debris that has produced many of the prominent rayed craters. The crater population on the smooth plains is very similar to that on the lunar Maria.

The apparent similarity in the sequence of events for the Moon and Mercury is especially significant for interpreting and understanding evolutionary processes of the terrestrial planets.

It is now clear that Mercury, in common not only with the Moon, but also with Mars, was subjected to an early, intense crater-producing bombardment (including basin events) that was followed by volcanism and, in turn, by a greatly reduced impact flux.

== '''Ice on Mercury''' ==


Mercury would seem to be one of the least likely places in the solar system to find ice. The closest planet to the Sun has temperatures, which can reach over 700 °C. The local day on the surface of Mercury is 176 earth-days, so the surface is slowly rotating under a relentless assault from the Sun. Nonetheless, Earth-based radar imaging of Mercury has revealed areas of high radar reflectivity near the north and south poles, which could be indicative of the presence of ice in these regions. There appear to be dozens of these areas with generally circular shapes. Presumably, the ice is located within permanently shadowed craters near the poles, where it may be cold enough for ice to exist over long periods of time. The discovery of ice on the Earth's moon, and on Mars, can only serve to strengthen the arguments for ice on Mercury.

Ice is highly radar reflective and the radar reflections off ice tend to be highly depolarized, unlike typical silicate rock that comprises the bulk of Mercury's surface. While not as highly reflective as other icy solar system objects, such as on Jupiter’s moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, these areas are still significantly more reflective than silicate material. Moreover, the depolarized nature of the reflections is also an indicator of water ice. The Arecibo results show that the radar reflective areas are concentrated in crater-sized spots. At the South Pole, the location of the largest area appears coincident with the large crater Chao Meng-Fu and the smaller areas with other identified craters. At the North Pole much of the area containing the radar bright spots was not imaged, and cannot be correlated with any known craters.

However, for the imaged areas at both poles most of the areas have been loosely correlated with known craters. Craters near the poles could provide the permanent, or near permanent, shading required for ice to exist on Mercury.

The radar results indicate the reflective areas are probably relatively uncontaminated ice. However, the lower reflectivity compared to pure ice features indicates the ice may be covered by a thin layer of dust or soil or else does not completely cover the crater floor. Note that no direct unequivocal detection of ice has been made.

The coincidence of the radar bright areas with large, possibly permanently shadowed, polar craters is strong circumstantial evidence for ice.

However, the radar reflections could be explained by an enhancement of some other radar reflective material, such as metal sulphides or other metallic condensates, or precipitated sodium ions

Investigations of Mercury were done from Earth using the Arecibo radio telescope, the Goldstone antenna, and the Very Large Array (VLA). The Goldstone/VLA study used the NASA Deep Space Network 70-m Goldstone dish antenna to transmit 8.51 GHz, 460 kW, right circularly polarized radar waves towards Mercury. The National Radio Astronomy Observatories 26 VLA antennas received the reflections. Calibration and processing of the radar returns showed radar-bright (high radar reflectivity) with depolarized signatures at the North Pole. The Arecibo observations were made by transmitting an S-band (2.4 GHz), 420 kW, circularly polarized coded radar wave at Mercury. The wave reflects off Mercury back to Earth. The wave is both transmitted and received by the Arecibo radio telescope.

Filtering and processing the return signal gives a radar reflectivity map of Mercury's surface with a resolution of approximately 15 km. About 20 anomalously reflective and highly depolarized features were observed at the north and south poles.

As mentioned above, all provinces on Mercury are exposed to the Sun for almost 90 earth-days at a time, and can reach temperatures over 700 °C. Additionally, Mercury has no ambient atmosphere and has very low gravity.

Water ice on the surface of Mercury is exposed directly to vacuum, and will rapidly sublime and escape into space unless it is kept cold at all times. This implies that the ice can never be exposed to direct sunlight.

The only locations on the surface of Mercury where this is possible would seem to be near the poles (Mercury’s South Pole is shown here), where the floors of some craters might be deep enough to afford permanent shading. Whether such permanently shadowed craters exist on Mercury is still problematic. The only close-up images we have of Mercury were taken by the Mariner 10 spacecraft on three close passes in 1974 and 1975.

The same hemisphere of Mercury was sunlit on each of these passes, so nearly half the planet has never been imaged, and no determination can be made of what polar areas, if any, are permanently shadowed. However, theoretical studies assuming typical crater dimensions show that craters near the poles should have areas that never rise above about 102 °C and that even flat surfaces at the poles would not exceed about 167 °C. Other studies also indicate that water ice in polar craters on Mercury could be stable over the age of the solar system.

There are only two significant sources for ice on Mercury: meteorite bombardment and planetary out gassing. Meteorites, especially in the past, potentially carried large amounts of water to Mercury's surface. Out gassing of water from the planet's interior could also provide a non-negligible flux of water to the surface, although this is speculative.

The permanently shadowed regions near Mercury's poles should act as &quot;cold-traps&quot; so that any water, which found its way to these regions, would freeze on the surface and remain. (The possibility that the ice is relatively uncontaminated may indicate that each deposit was laid down in one or a small number of rapid events, such as a large comet impact.) Meteorites, which impacted near the poles and water, which out gassed in that region, could have been easily trapped.

== Solar Wind ==

The planet Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, our nearby star, which gives off a huge amount of light and heat. The Sun also has significant super hot plasma burst from its surface known as prominences, and upper atmosphere called Coronal Mass Ejections.

The charged atomic particles then move at great speed through the solar system. Mercury therefore is the planet that is regularly in the line of fire, so that its surface is constantly bathed by the solar wind. While the planet’s atmosphere is too thin and rarefied to erode Mercrian surface features, the solar wind does appear to have an affect, albeit slowly, over eons of time.

== '''Transit of Mercury Phenomena''' ==

A transit is the passage of a planet across the Sun's bright disk. At this time, the planet can be seen as a small black disk slowly moving in front of the Sun.

The orbits of Mercury and Venus lie inside Earth's orbit, so they are the only planets that can pass between Earth and Sun to produce a transit. Transits are very rare astronomical events. In the case of Mercury, there are on average thirteen transits each century. A transit of Mercury occurs only if the planet is in inferior conjunction with the Sun (between Earth and Sun) and is also crossing through Earth's orbital plane (the Ecliptic). During the present period in Earth's history, Mercury's orbit crosses Earth's orbital plane in early May and early November each year. If Mercury is passing between the Earth and Sun at that time, a transit will be seen. 

During the seven-century period 1601 to 2065, Earth experiences 94 transits of Mercury across the Sun. These events can be organized into two groups: All Transits = 94 = 100.0%. May (Descending Node) = 31 = 33.0 %. November (Ascending Node) = 63  = 67.0 %

Mercury's orbit is highly eccentric (''e'' = 0.2056). This causes the planet's distance from the Sun to vary from 46 to 70 million kilometres. At perihelion, Mercury's orbital velocity (59.0 km/s) is over 50% faster than it is at aphelion (38.9 km/s).

Furthermore, the planet's orbit is tipped 7 degrees to Earth's around the Sun. Such a wildly varying and inclined orbit has important consequences on the characteristics and frequency of Mercury's transits.

During May transits, the apparent diameters of the Sun and Mercury are 1902 and 12 arc-seconds, respectively. Thus, Mercury appears to be 1/158 the size of the Sun. In contrast, the apparent diameters of the Sun and Mercury during November transits are 1937 and 10 arcseconds, respectively. So then Mercury appears to be 1/194 the size of the Sun. Consecutive transits of Mercury appear to be separated by 3.5, 7, 9.5, 10, or 13 years.

The pattern is rather complex because of Mercury's elliptical orbit. The shorter periods are a consequence of several longer harmonics between the orbital periods of Mercury and Earth. The 13-year period is of particular note because it corresponds to nearly 54 orbits of Mercury around the Sun (it falls short of a perfect fit by just 2.01 days). A longer period of 33 years (10 + 10 + 13) produces an even better fit, which corresponds to 137 orbits of Mercury minus 1.67 days. If one combines the 13 year and 33 year periods together, the 46-year total equals 191 orbits of Mercury plus only 0.34 days. 

A useful way to organize Mercury's transits is by grouping them into series where each member is separated by 16,802 days or 46 years (= sum of 13 and 33 years). Thus, the transits of 1957, 2003 and 2049 belong to one series, while the transits of 1960, 2006 and 2052 belong to another series. May transits occur about a month after Mercury's aphelion passage so the planet is travelling at close to its minimum velocity?

The planet's relative position with respect to the Sun shifts by approximately 200 arcseconds with each transit. This rapidly evolving geometry means that transit series, which occur in May only, last about 10 cycles or 414 years. In comparison, November transits occur just a few days before Mercury reaches perihelion so the planet is travelling at nearly its maximum orbital velocity. Mercury's relative position with respect to the Sun shifts by only about 100 arcseconds with each transit, so November series last about twice as long as a May series. For example, Series 8 (November at Ascending Node) began in 1776 and will run through 2604 for a total of 19 transits spanning 828 years. For comparison, Series 9 (May at Descending Node) began just recently in 1957 and will run through 2371 for a total of 10 transits spanning 414 years. At any one time, there can be about six transit series running concurrently. But since the November series last twice as long as the May series, there are twice as many transits in November as there are in May. Mercury's transit series are quite analogous to the Saros series for solar and lunar eclipses although they are shorter and tend not have as many events in each series.

Hi, my name's Chris; I'm a certified survival instructor. I've been talking with the folks at 'Pedia and they directed me here. As of now, this 'book has some good, some bad, (just like anything) but I think we can turn it into a PB'ing treatise. Right now, unfortunately, I have work to do - but I'll be back to start pouring info in. First I gotta get that work done and then organise my thoughts - which could take awhile, ha ha. 07:09, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC) I'm not accounted for here; on Wikipedia I'm user Esseye

hi i don't know who started this book but i just added a few things hope you don't mind.

yeah, good work you should change the namespaces


not wikibooks.org/wiki/food

wikibooks.org/wiki/outdoor_survival_food
----
Should the whole book be in the form of disconnected statements and ideas? I think having things in point form, while good for teaching, may not be the best format for a book.
: In a wikibook you might have both: Have a quick checklist, and a more elaborate explanatory section. Go ahead and fill the sections! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:41, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Completeness?==
I think the completeness statements on this are very exaggerated.
There is a hell of a lot more information to be put into sections with even 3/4 of a marking. For example techniques to find water in different environments. [[User:Bandraoi|Bandraoi]] 13:57, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

== Area of coverage ==

Hi.  I'm just passing through, but since you're just starting out, I'd like to suggest making an effort to talk about survival in a variety of different environments, or being explicit that you're only talking about a few.  There are a lot of places where your first priority would be to keep cool, not to keep warm.  [[User:70.17.206.197|70.17.206.197]] 04:40, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

== Mergers ==

I was looking around at all the different books on Outdoor/Wilderness Survival and thought that they should all be combined together into one big book. This would provide easier access to the information with less hassle. As I find more rouge article I will either merge them or if they are more then a stub will put up a merge suggestion. I am new to WikiBooks and if any one has any feedback for me it would be appriciated. [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 13:50, 5 September 2007 (UTC)

:I agree. [[Guide to Wilderness Survival]] is very small and has not had any real edits for over a year. [[User:Redfalcon|Redfalcon]], the user who created it hasn't done any edits on Wikibooks since 2005. [[Transwiki:How to light a fire]] is an orphaned page, and this book could probably give it a good home. However, [[First Aid/Wilderness First Aid]] Probably doesn't need to be merged, it goes well with the wikibook it's in, and this wikibook already has a big page on First Aid. But for [[Guide to Wilderness Survival]], I say: just start merging it. - [[User:Teaandcrumpets|Teaandcrumpets]] 20:42, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

:Actually, it looks to me like the only thing we need from [[Guide to Wilderness Survival]] is the water page. The rest of the pages have little or no information. In fact, I would consider that book for deletion, as the original author seems to have no interest in it. - [[User:Teaandcrumpets|Teaandcrumpets]] 21:11, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

== Replacement/revamping of entire book ==

I think this whole book should be replaced or merged with US Army Field Manual 21-76. The Field Manual is in the public domain, is already complete, and is much more comprehensive than whatever is here already. [[User:Ksd5|Siddharth Patil]] ([[User talk:Ksd5|talk]]) 20:51, 1 April 2008 (UTC)

== Merge with [[When It Hits the Fan]] ==
The content of this stub of a project will be at home there, and reduce duplication of content. Since this book has been without edits for a long time it would benefit from the activity on the new location.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:41, 16 October 2011 (UTC)

:On 28 October 2011‎ [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Outdoor_Survival&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=2202206&amp;oldid=2184416 removed the merge tag] with the comment &quot;different sort of scope&quot; and on the target project only to as &quot;disagree with merger&quot;. I have contacted the Wikibookian directly and requested participation in this discussion.

:In regards to the argument of &quot;different sort of scope&quot; of the projects I agree that the scope implied on the Outdoor Survival project title is not the same, but complementary to the objective of &quot;When It Hits the Fan&quot;. It also doesn't address the problem of Outdoor Survival being an abandoned stub that is replicating other existing projects, in any case I will extend the timing to execute the merge in case this is pursued or any other point is raised.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:58, 28 October 2011 (UTC)

(copying from my discussion page) Outdoor survival is a strictly more general subject then the subject of &quot;When it hits the fan&quot;, and so their scope and audience is rather different. It makes sense to study outdoor survival if you intend to spend lots time in the woods (say hiking the whole Appalachian trail) but your not particularly concerned about difficult survival situations. As I understand when it hit the fan it discusses (local) apocalyptic situations which one intends to survive. I would agree that understanding that some understanding of surviving outdoors may help in some of these situations, and not in others. To give an example of potentially different audiences, boy scouts are more likely to be interested in outdoor survival to meet the requirements of a badge, but be less interested in When it hits the fan.  If we decided to merge this because it is not being developed further, may I suggest [[Backpack Camping and Woodland Survival]] might be a more natural fit.

::Is there any objection still pending ? The content merge will not be destructive, if anyone later wants to pursue the specific subject they can.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:00, 16 January 2016 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bigger is better.  Just don't burn down any forests.

* Three of anything is the international standard for distress (three gun shots,  three fires,  three flares, etc.)

* Carry a whistle,  it takes less energy and is louder than shouting

* To prepare for rescue make three signal fires in a triangular pattern make them huge if you have the resources.  Check them daily to make sure they are ready to light or in a desperate situation light them even if you can not see any one searching for you!

* Make black smoke by burning the tires of your car or especially car oil. Plastic can also work (it may not be environmentally friendly but it's OK just this once. Also note that not all plastic will burn or give off smoke.)

* Make white smoke by burning fresh leaves

* Pick the smoke color that would show up best against your background.  (in snowy conditions a black fire,  a dark forest... a white fire)

* Ground Signals. Write out SOS or HELP. Huge as possible at least 30 feet wide but bigger think 300 feet is better. Bright as Possible. Use clothes, tents, tarps, ect. If using natural materials try to get as much color contrast as possible. Put it in the open away from trees.

* Reflection. If you remember shining light in peoples eyes in class with your watch this is the same idea. Use you watch, mirror, anything that works to shine light off the sun on distant locations or planes. Reflect in bursts of three.

* Combine all these three methods to do any thing to make your self as visible as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many debates about what makes a survival kit.  Below is a list of useful items to have with you. Remember to there is more to being prepared than a survival kit. Each person has their own personal needs, which can drastically change the following suggestions.

Items in bold can easily be carried in a small back pack whenever you go into the outdoors even for just part of a day. The other items should be brought on any trips longer than a day.

* '''Water''' is an absolute must! Your body can not survive without fresh, clean water!!!
* '''cell phone''' with a charged battery (charge it once a month to make sure that it does not lose its charge over a few months.  Also note that you may not be able to get a signal if you are in the wild.) or
* Portable CB radio (handheld CB radios have very limited range)
* A container that should be something in which you can boil water and cook. Stainless steel is best. If you have to, remember you can boil water in almost anything, even straight in the water bottle.
* '''Knife ''' with a solid blade and a tang that goes down into the handle (a good knife is very important). A knife that has the blade and handle made of one solid piece of metal (like a dive knife) is even better. There are many uses for a knife, such as carving, safety, marking, etc.
* Knife sharpener (a dull knife is dangerous) 
* '''Flint and steel striker''' (in case matches fail)
* '''Waterproof / Windproof matches''' (get good ones)
* '''Disposable lighter''', such as a Bic&amp;trade;
* '''Water purification''' tablets or pump (Tablets may be more practical, as pumps can be expensive, and take up a lot of space.)
* '''Water tight container''' (a heavy duty zip lock freezer bag will do)
* '''High calorie food''' light and non perishable. (Nuts, energy bars, and peanut butter work well). When out in the wild, you will need a larger calorie intake.
* '''sighting mirror''' to use for signaling or fire starting
* '''Whistle'''
* '''Beanie ''' to keep you warm you lose lots of heat from your head in hot environments a wide brimmed hat.
* sunscreen and lip balm
* Bug repellent
* Bright plastic marking tape (to leave a trail for others to follow)
*  waterproof nylon tarp
* '''Poncho''', big plastic bag will do
* '''Emergency &quot;space bag, blanket&quot;''' sleeping bag made of mylar (it's only about a 2&quot; cube and works by reflecting your body heat). If you have room in your kit for two, that's even better. Put one on the ground then put a layer of leaves then the second blanket and then wrap yourself up in the layers. Or use one as a tent and the other as a blanket.
* Parachute cord (at least 20 feet)
* Folding portable cooking stove and solid fuel tablets (it is also small and inexpensive)
* '''Map of the area''', the best one being a topographic
* '''Compass''' Remember you can tell direction using the sun to some degree of accuracy: Sun rises in the East sets in the West.
* '''Money and Spare change for phone calls'''
* '''Anti-diarrheal medicine''' (as drinking from a potentially unsafe water source carries the risk of sometimes-fatal dehydration)'''
* '''Aspirin or similar medicine''' with anti-inflammatory, fever-reducing and pain-relieving qualities. (Acetaminophen, brand name Tylenol&amp;trade;, Ibuprofen, brand name Advil&amp;trade;)
* '''Self-adhesive bandages &amp; Cotton balls''' (such as Band-Aids&amp;trade; brand) Cotton balls work well for swabs as well as tinder for starting a fire.
* '''Watch''' to keep track of the time
* '''Survival or First Aid Book''' provides fire starting materials( paper), helps relax by reading may tell you what you need to survive.
* '''Flash Light''' The led kind are very light and last a long time. Make sure to have extra batteries or a shake recharge flash light.
* '''Collapsible camp-cup and 4-foot square of clear, flexible, thin-gauge plastic sheeting like the kind used as paint drop-clothes''' The plastic sheeting is used to '''''make water'''''.  This is done by digging a small hole about two feet in diameter and six inches deep.  The dimensions are not critical.  Once the hole is ready, place any water-bearing organic matter such as grass or leaves in the hole in a thin layer along the bottom.  Place the cup in the center of the hole.  Place the plastic sheet over the hole and weight it down around the edges with dirt and/or rocks.  Take a small rock and place it above the cup, so that the plastic dimples down ''directly over the cup''.  As the sun begins to heat the contents of the hole, the water vapor steams out of the organic matter, condenses on the plastic, and drips down the dimple and into the cup.  This works, but it takes time.  Remember, '''any''' organic, water-bearing matter will work - including waste products.  The water produced will be pure since it is distilled.
* And finally, '''Confidence'''


The important thing here is that you make your survival kit small and light enough that you bring it with you if you travel in rural areas leave it in your car.

Another important aspect of the survival kit is the container in which it is carried.  The kit above in bold should not have to be that big or heavy but a good backpack of some sort is important for ease of carrying, energy savings, and for the comfort of the survivalist.

The other items you should have on longer trips may be heavier and need to be carried in a pack meant for back packing or kept in your car.

You can also keep a survival kit where you live for general emergencies.
