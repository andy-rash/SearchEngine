== Het alfabet ~ The alphabet ==

The Dutch alphabet, like English, consists of 26 basic letters. However, there are also a number of letter combinations. The following table includes a listing of all these letters and a guide to their pronunciation.  As in English, letter sounds can differ depending upon where within a word the letter occurs.  The first pronunciation given below (second column) is that in English of the letter (or combination) itself. Reading down this column and pronouncing the &quot;English&quot; words will recite the alphabet ''in het Nederlands'' (in Dutch). Note that letter order is exactly the same as in English, but pronunciation is '''not the same''' for many of the letters. Trouble areas for Anglophones are marked in &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;

==Diacritics==
Diacritics are not very numerous in Dutch and they are mostly limited to loans, but the orthography does for example demand a '''diaeresis''', mostly on ë and ï in words like ''geërgerd, geïnteresseerd''. It marks the boundary of two syllables and is fairly common. It is not to be confused with the German umlaut that only occurs on a few German loans like ''überhaupt''.

Less commonly, the orthography also allows '''stress marks''' to be added. Acute accents can be used for that purpose, but only then if:
#special and unusual emphasis in sentence is to be indicated, e.g. to express surprise
#: ''Heb je een áúto?!''
#the context leaves doubt about the identity of the word:
#:''Een school doorlópen is niet hetzelfde als een school dóórlopen.''

There are some 200 words and word forms [https://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/Categorie:Klemtoonhomogram_in_het_Nederlands that occur in two forms that only differ in stress pattern,] where that can be an issue.

For diphthongs and doubled vowels both vowels are marked as in ''áúto''. In principle this holds for the digraph ''ij'' as well. The ''j'' should also get an acute, but computers usually do not facilitate that. Here we will write ''íj'' if the need arises. 

A stress mark is not be confused with an accent grave, aigu or circonflex as it can occur on the more numerous French loans like ''café'', ''à propos'' or ''maîtresse''. Interestingly Dutch orthography maintains the ''î'' in the latter, although French dropped it in 1990. The grave is also used on the verb ''blèren''. It is an indigenous onomatopoeia that mimics the bleating of sheep with an unusual long [ɛ:] sound.

:{{knp2|blèren}}

The cedille is rare but occurs in a few French and Portuguese loans like ''façade, Curaçao''

A useful tip is to install a Dutch international keyboard. For Microsoft operating systems [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306560 this] will tell you how to proceed.

== Nederlandse uitspraak ~ Dutch Pronunciation Guide ==

=== Klinkers ===

Dutch has quite a few vowels (13). To be well understood by a native speaker it is imperative to master them, which can be quite challenge for native speakers of languages that rely more on their many consonants such as Russian. One general observation is that they are always pronounced as more or less ''pure'' (or only slightly diphthongized) vowels as in French, never quite as drawled or 'chewed upon' as in many varieties of English. Admittedly this does vary from speaker to speaker and region to region, but for Anglophones it is certainly advisable to limit the 'drawling'.

Most vowels occur in ''pairs'' that are traditionally indicated by the terms '''short''' and '''long'''. Unfortunately, this nomenclature is rather misleading because the difference is not so much a matter of length, but rather a difference in the position of the tongue root ('''lax''' vs. '''tense''', or in Dutch: gedekt and open, '''covered''' and '''open''').

{| border=1 rules=all  margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:0.5em; width:25em; border:#99B3FF solid 1px;border-color:#99B3FF;&quot; id=toc

| width=33%|/u/ as oo, but rounded
|-
| width=33%|eu - -  deuk
| colspan= 2 width=33%|/ø/ as German Möwe
|-
|}


In addition there is a neutral vowel that occurs in almost all unstressed syllables, the schwa /{{IPA|ə}}/ as is does more or less in English as well. It is spelled with an 'e', so that this letter has three meanings: the above two in stressed syllables, the schwa in unstressed ones.

====The u====
Notice the value of the open letter 'u' in Dutch. As in French it denotes the /y/ sound. Thus, in German it corresponds to ü. 

{|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|{{knop|vuur}} vuur||{{knop|stuur}} stuur||{{knop|ruw}} ruw||{{knop|molecuul|}} molecuul||{{knop|u}} u||{{knop|Veluwe}} Veluwe
|}
It is relatively rare in Dutch because most words that used to have it have shifted it to the diphthong ''ui''. It occurs mostly at the end of words like ''u'', ''nu'' or in front of a w or r: ''ruw'', ''stuur''.

::Trick: If you can whistle: whistle a high note, freeze your mouth in the position it is in and sing. You'll produce a /y/-sound. The trick is to have the tongue far in the front of the mouth and the lips rounded.

The covered one resembles the u in putt, but not quite. It is a rounded version of the schwa.

{|style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|{{knp2|hut}}||{{knp2|pluk}}||{{knp2|druk}}||{{knp2|kunde}}||{{knp2|tulp}}||{{knp2|stuf}}
|}

====The oe====
This combination represents the [u] sound in German Mut or Spanish tu. Its spelling 'oe' is a real Dutch oddity. Most languages use 'u' as German and Latin. (French uses 'ou', English often used 'oo', although it does have words like ''shoe''). The Dutch /u/ sound is '''strongly rounded''' and dark with the tongue pretty far retracted back in the mouth. American 'oo' sounds tend to be intermediary between /u/ and /y/  and that is &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;a problem&lt;/font&gt;. Compare:

{|
|{{knop|voer}} voer||{{knop|stoer}} stoer||{{knp2|koet}}
|-
|{{knop|vuur}} vuur||{{knop|stuur}} stuur||{{knp2|kluut}}
|}

====The eu====
This combination represents another difficult vowel for Anglophones. In German it is written as ö as in Möwe. In IPA as [ø].

{|
|{{knop|leuk}} leuk||{{knop|reus}} reus||{{knp2|leuze}}||{{knp2|kleumen}}
|}

Before &quot;r&quot; vowels have a tendency to be modified:

{|
|{{knp2|geur}}||{{knp2|steur}}
|}

===The spelling rule===
The vowels oe and eu are single, but as we saw above five vowels occur in open/covered pairs: a,e,i,o,u.
There is a systematic way in the spelling to indicate which of the two varieties is intended. 
*An open syllable ending in a vowel has the 'long' open variety,
*A closed syllable ending in one or more consonants has the 'short' covered variety..

;Example:
:{{knp2|na}}  /na/   : open syllable - open vowel
:{{knp2|nat}} /{{IPA|nɑt}}/ : closed syllable - covered vowel

If a conflict arises, either the vowel or the consonant is doubled:
{{Knop|alt=Dutch_pronunciation_zak|altogg=OGG}}
:za'''a'''k - zaken  both have /a/ (business - businesses)
:zak  - zak'''k'''en both have /{{IPA|ɑ}}/ (bag- bags)


Notice how the formation of the plural necessitates a good mastery of this principle. The vowels oe and eu do not exhibit the dual quality of the other vowels. 

The case of the letter i is a bit special. There has been a double ''ii'' in the past but to avoid confusion with a hand-written u it was replaced by ''ij''. Afterwards the long /i:/ sound it represented became a diphthong /{{IPA|ɛɪ̯}}/ (although many dialects retain /i/). To write the long /i/ sound Dutch mostly uses -ie.

{|
|{{knp2|rit}}||{{knp2|riet}}
|}

The covered version as in ''rit'' corresponds more to the English sound in ''will'' or ''rid'', than to the German sound in ''mit'' or ''Kind''.

As said above, the distinction 'short'-'long' has little to do with pure length, because the change from open to closed is much more important. There is an exception. In front of -r the long vowel may indeed just be the same vowel held a bit longer:

:{{knop|bord}} bord : /{{IPA|bɔrt}}/
:{{knop|boord}} boord: /{{IPA|bɔːrt}}/

In front of -r there are a few other oddities:


:{{Knop|keel}}''keel'' - /kel/
:{{knop|keer}}''keer'' - /{{IPA|kɪːr}}/

:{{Knop|keus}} ''keus'' - /køs/
:{{Knop|keur}} ''keur'' - /kœːr/

===Diphthongs===


:ei and ij are both /ɛɪ̯/ 
{|
|{{knop|ijs}} ijs||{{knop|lijnrijderij}} lijnrijderij||{{knop|bijzijn}} bijzijn
|}

:au and ou are both /au/ as in English ''now''
{|
|{{knop|oud}} oud||{{knop|kauwen}} kauwen||{{knop|blauw}} blauw
|}

:ui is /ʌy/ needs to be learned by ear, it is a bit like in French l'oeil.
{|
|{{knop|ui}} ui||{{knop|uitje}} uitje||{{knop|puin}} puin||{{knp2|kruipen}}||{{knp2|uitsluiten}}
|}

:aai is /aɪ̯/ 
{|
|{{knop|aai}} aai||{{knop|zaait}} zaait
|}

:ooi is /oɪ̯/
{|
|{{knop|ooi}} ooi||{{knop|mooier}} mooier
|}

:ieu is /iu/ or /iy/
{|
|{{knop|kieuw}} kieuw||{{knop|nieuws}} nieuws
|}

:eeu is /eu/
{|
|{{knop|geeuw}} geeuw||{{knop|schreeuw}} schreeuw
|}

:uw is /yu/
{|
|{{knop|kluwen}} kluwen||{{knop|duwen}} duwen
|}

Diphthongs like /ɔɪ̯/ (as in English ''toy'') or /ɑɪ̯/ (as in English ''my'') are not used in the standard language. In various dialects they do occur and producing them is often frowned upon. They are considered 'lower class' in many circles.

In unstressed syllables like the suffix -lijk the ij represents a schwa.
{|
|{{knop|lelijk}} lelijk||{{knop|degelijk}} degelijk
|}

=== Medeklinkers ===

Most consonants in Dutch are pronounced more or less the same way as in English but there are a number of notable exceptions. First of all a number of phonemes that English has are simply missing in Dutch. Phonemes are sounds that suffice in marking one word as different from the other.

===Missing phonemes===

:/θ/ : ''th'' as in  ''th''ing.
:/ð/ : ''th'' as in ''th''at.
:/g/ : ''g'' as in ''g''ood.
Please avoid these sounds when speaking Dutch.

Even /ʃ/ : ''sh'' as in ''sh''ip is not really a native Dutch sound, but it occurs in quite a few loans from various sources (Frisian, English, German, French) and as most Dutch people learn English these days they are quite familiar with it. The same thing goes for /ʒ/ as in gara'''g'''e and their affricate versions as in /ʧ/ in '''ch'''urch or /ʤ/ '''Ge'''orge. None of them are native to Dutch.

===The g, ch and sch problem===

The spelling sch- can be rather confusing for people familiar with some German. In German it is used to write the /ʃ/ sound, where English uses sh-. In Dutch the sch- combination also occurs quite frequently but is pronounced rather differently. In most cases it presents a combination of s+ch where the latter is the voiceless velar fricative /x/ as heard in German ''Bach'' or Scottish ''loch''.

:schip : /{{IPA|sxɪp}}/ 

In older versions of the orthography (prior to 1947) the combination -sch represented a simple /s/ sound in final position. The guttural &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/font&gt; at the end had gone &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;mute&lt;/font&gt;. (Originally it represented a k- sound as it still does in some dialects and in Frisian). The final -s&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/font&gt; spelling is still used for one rather common ending: -is&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/font&gt; and also in numerous geographical names as they have never been altered in spelling:

{{Knop|alt=Dutch_pronunciation_sch_g|altogg=OGG}}
:chaotis&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/font&gt;:  /{{IPA|xa'otis}}/ (not: /{{IPA|xa'otiʃ}}/
:'s-Hertogenbos&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/font&gt; : /{{IPA|sɛrtoɣən'bɔs}}/ , (not: /{{IPA|ʃɛr'togənboʃ}}/ )

In principle Dutch has both a voiceless and a voiced velar fricative and the letter 'g' represents the voiced one and the combination 'ch' the voiceless one. However, the number of words where this creates a phonemic distinction is very small:

:logen /{{IPA|'loɣən}}/  contrasts with:  loochen  /{{IPA|'loxən}}/

It depends on the region whether this distinction is actually made in the spoken language. Around Amsterdam it would not be, further south the phoneme 'g' is often pronounced as a voiced palatal fricative, so that the difference becomes more pronounced.

Worldwide, the voiced /ɣ/ sound is pretty rare. It only occurs in a few languages like Arabic and Gaelic. As many native speakers do not use it either, it is recommended not to bother about it and use the voiceless /x/ for both, unless your mother tongue happens to have the difference.

===The Dutch &quot;r&quot;===
[[File:Bereikbaarheidskaart.png|thumb|300px|The Randstad showing the accessibility of jobs]] 
Another, similar, problem for English-speaking learners is the Dutch &quot;r&quot;.  Essentially there are two, both of which were historically trilled.
====Alveolar====
The first, alveolar [r], is the &quot;rolling&quot; trilled &quot;r&quot; also used in Spanish, produced with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge. This sound was considered standard only a few decades ago and is still used by quite a few speakers. That includes the author of this book, who grew up at the southern edge of the Randstad, the Drechtsteden region, as well as many people outside the Randstad, including Flanders.

====Uvular====
However, particularly in the Randstad, the rolling alveolar [r] is gradually replaced by a voiced velar or uvular trill [R], which is also used in many dialects of German; it is also similar to the French &quot;r&quot;, but is voiced and articulated somewhat further forward (it is less &quot;throaty&quot;). Both the alveolar and the uvular /r/ sounds are often not trilled when spoken by native speakers; the alveolar [r] is more often a light tap, while the uvular [R] can turn into a fricative or approximant. This also presents a considerable challenge for those unaccustomed to the sound when they are confronted with words like ''groot'' (&quot;big&quot;). The first two sounds tend to blend to one lengthy velar/uvular /x:ot/ or /ɣ:ot/, which may cause confusion with words like ''rood'' (red) and  ''goot'' (gutter).

====Approximant====
A third type of /r/ currently making inroads into Dutch is ''Gooise R'', named after the Gooi area in the Netherlands, where Dutch television is produced (Hilversum) and this speech feature is popularly thought to have originated. This concerns an approximant sound, not unlike American /r/ in words such as ''bar'', without trilling or friction.

===Voiceless consonants===
{|
|{{knp2|poot}}||{{knp2|kaap}}||{{knp2|fuut}}||{{knp2|schaaf}}
|}
: p represents /p/, but unlike in English it is never aspirated.
: ''poot'' /pot/, ''kaap'' /kap/
: f represents /f/ as in English
: ''fuut'' /fyt/, ''schaaf'' /sxaf/
{|
|{{knp2|toe}}||{{knp2|beter}}||{{knp2|thee}}
|}
: t represents /t/ a true dental. Unlike UK-English it is not aspirated and unlike US-English it does not become a /d/ in the middle of a word.
: th is retained in the spelling in some words, but it simply represents /t/
: ''toe'' /tu/, ''beter'' /'betər/
: s represents /s/
::{{knop|samen}} ''samen'': /'samən/
: in few cases it can be a /z/ sound but much less frequently so than in German:
::{{knop|organisatie}} organisatie:  /ɔrɣani''''z'''atsi/  

The latter word also contains an exception on the rule that t represents /t/. In the ending -tie (corresponding to -tion) it is pronounced as a quick /ʦ/ combination, as in Russian &quot;ц&quot;.


:k represents /k/. again it is '''never aspirated''' as often happens in English or German.
:''kop'' /kɔp/ , ''kraak'' /krak/
In contrast to English it is not silent in combinations like kn-: ''knie''' /kni/

:ch represents /x/ as discussed above, except in recent English loans. This phoneme is quite common.
:''schraag'' /sxrax/, ''schichtig'' /sxɪxtəx/
{|
|{{knp2|kop}}||{{knp2|kraak}}||{{knp2|schraag}}||{{knp2|schichtig}}
|}

===Devoicing and assimilation===

As in German, but unlike English all consonants at the ends of words are devoiced (''..at the ents off worts are devoist...''). You may hear that phenomenon when people speak English with a strong Dutch accent.
:zaad: /za'''t'''/
Assimilation with the previous word often devoices the consonant in initial position as well:
:het zaad: /t'''s'''at/

The neutral article ''het'' is often reduced to a prefixed t-sound in the spoken language and occasionally rendered as such in the written language as: 't. Het zaad -&gt; 't zaad.

Notice however that both the /z/ and the /d/ reappear in the plural:

:de zaden: /də 'za'''d'''ən/

Contrary to d, the letters v and z are not written in the final position in such cases:

: de vaas - de vazen:  /də vas - də 'vazən/
: de graaf - de graven /də ɣraf - də 'ɣravən/

===Voiced consonants===

Apart from the devoicing effects Dutch has the following voiced consonants:
{|
|{{knp2|baas}}||{{knp2|bevel}}||{{knp2|dader}}||{{knp2|ziezo}}||{{knp2|gegraven}}
|}

:b represents /b/ as in English
:''baas'' /bas/
:v represents /v/ as in English, although its voicing is less emphatic
:''bevel'' /bə'vɛl/
:d represents /d/ as in English
:''dader'' /'dadər/
:z represents /z/ as in English
:ziezo! /'zizo/
:g represents /ɣ/ not /g/ as in English (see above)
:gegraven /ɣəɣravən/, ''gracht'' /ɣrɑxt/

Around Amsterdam the tendency to devoice is so strong that /v/ /ɣ/ and /z/ are seldom heard. People use /f/, /x/ and /s/ instead.

===Liquids, nasals, clusters===

:m represents /m/ as in English
:''mooi'' /moi/
:w represents /ʋ/, it is a ''labiodental'' approximant, not a bilabial one. Bring your upper teeth close to your lower lip and produce sound without breath. Put otherwise: produce a v-sound without breath. Speakers from e.g. Surinam often do use the bilabial version.
:''water'' /ʋatər/

Thus, in the Netherlands f, v and w are all pronounced with the upper teeth resting on the lower lips but there is a distinction in voicing and in aspiration (blowing)

{|
|{{knp2|faal}}||{{knp2|vaal}}||{{knp2|Waal}}

In ''erwt'' /ɛrt/ (pea) the w is silent for most speakers, but in initial wr- (''wraak'' /vrak/ or /ʋrak/) w tends to sound more like /v/. 

{|
|{{knp2|erwt}}||{{knp2|gerw}}||{{knp2|wreken}}||{{knp2|wrak}}||{{knp2|wringen}}
|}

Although the pronunciation of &quot;w&quot; varies, it is ''not silent'' as in English. For the combination kn- the same holds: the 'k' is clearly pronounced:

{|
|{{knp2|knaap}}||{{knp2|knijpen}}
|}

:n represents /n/ as in English
:''nonnetje'' /'nɔnət&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ə/ (/'nɔnəcə/)

Many plurals (including the plural forms of the verb) have an ending -en. For many speakers this is pronounced as /-ə/ and the final n is dropped, but this is not true for all speakers. It depends strongly on the region of the speech area you are in. Around Amsterdam it is certainly  /-ə/, but in Groningen or in West-Flanders it is a syllabic /-n/ instead. It also depends on how well people are trying to articulate or on the next word. If the latter starts with a vowel the -n is more likely to be pronounced.

:ng /ŋ/ as in English ''sing'', never /ŋg/ as in ''finger'' (the latter uses a /g/ that Dutch does not have). It does not occur in initial position, much like in English. 
:''vinger'' /vɪŋər/

Even in loans the /ŋg/ tends to be avoided: mango : /'mɑnɣo/ or /'mɑŋɣo/

{|
|{{knp2|vinger}}||{{knp2|zanger}}||{{knp2|mango}}
|}

:nk /ŋk/ as in English sink (This involves a /k/ sound that Dutch does have)

:j represents a /j/ sound, which in English usually written as ''y''. The English j as in Jack is virtually unknown.

:jacht: /jɑxt/, borrowed into English as: yacht.

{{knp2|jacht}}

In combination with i it forms a diphthong: ij. Although this is a two letter combination, both letters get capitalized at the beginning of a sentence: ijs -&gt; IJs (ice). /ɛis/.
The suffix -je that forms the rather ubiquitous diminutives tends to palatellize the previous consonants or even fuse to a palatal stop all together in rapid speech.
:''blaadje'' /'blat&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ə/ (/'blacə/ 

{|
|{{knp2|blaadje}}||{{knp2|stadje}}
|}

:y is not a native Dutch letter but it occurs in loans where it is pronounced /i/ or /j/.

{|
|{{knp2|yoghurt}}||{{knp2|yoga}}||{{knp2|hyacint}}
|}


:l represents an /l/ that is neither velarized (dark) as most English l's are, nor is it the slender variety as in German, French (or Irish). It is neutral and in between.
:''lila'' /'lila/

{{knp2|lila}}

:r can represent a variety of sounds. A rolled 'r' /r/ was more or less the norm, but is heard less and less. A variety of uvular forms is taking its place. Retroflex ones (as in US English) sound distinctly foreign.

:h represents /ɦ/ a ''voiced'' version of the h-sound commonly heard in English and German. It only occurs in initial position of a syllable.
:''behang'' /bə'ɦɑŋ/, ''herfst'' /ɦɛrfst/

{|
|{{knp2|behang}}||{{knp2|herfst}}
|}


:the glottal stop ` is not rendered in the ortography, unless by a hyphen, e.g. in na-apen /na`apən/. 

It is much less used than in German, e.g. theater: /te'jatər/ rather than /te`atər/.

{|
|{{knp2|na-apen}}||{{knp2|theater}}
|}

Clusters of consonants are common in Dutch although perhaps less so than in language like Russian. Usually speakers will pronounce all the consonants in the cluster, but if clusters are consecutive, e.g. in compound words, some elision may occur. E.g. in the compound ''vaststellen'' typically only one 'st' is actually pronounced. Clusters can occur both initially and finally in a syllable:

:''st''aal
:fee''st''
:''sp''ek
:we''sp''

Common initial clusters: bl-, br-, chl- chr-, dr-, dw-, fl-, fn-, fr-, gl-, gn-, gr-, kl-, kn-, kr-, kw-, pl-, pr-, sch-, schr-, sf-, sj-, sk-, sl-, sm-, sn-, sp-, spl-, spr-, tr-, tw-, vl-, vr-, wr-, zw-

=== Syllable Stress ===

Dutch is -like English and German but unlike French- a typical stress language. One syllable tends to get all the attention. It is at the same time loud, long and high in pitch and it never has a schwa ə. Instead it has a full vowel or a diphthong. Unstressed syllables tend to be short, low, soft and usually have a schwa, although there are exceptions.

Stress is not represented in the spelling unless ambiguity can arise for native speakers. In that case acutes can be added, otherwise orthographic rules demand that they be omitted. For non-native speakers this is a bit of a problem, but often an educated guess can be made which syllable is the stressed one.

Because the schwa is written as a ''e'' in the orthography it is often quite clear where the stress falls in a word:

{|
|{{knp2|verlaten}}
|}
: verlaten : /vər'&lt;u&gt;la&lt;/u&gt;tən/ has only one non-schwa syllable &lt;u&gt;la&lt;/u&gt; and sure enough that is where the stress goes. 

Unfortunately for the non-native speaker the letter e is also used for other purposes.

{|
|{{knp2|verleden}}
|}

:verleden : /vər'&lt;u&gt;le&lt;/u&gt;dən/

The middle -e represent a full /e/ sound (as the ai in bait), but that is only clear for a native speaker. But with a bit of knowledge of grammar it will be clear that /led/ is the root of a verb (lijden actually) and that ver- is a prefix and -en the suffix. In general, the root of a verb (or noun) will get the stress in Dutch.

Of course, there are complicated cases:
{|
|{{knp2|december}}
|}

:december : /d&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'s&lt;u&gt;ɛ&lt;/u&gt;mb&lt;u&gt;ə&lt;/u&gt;r/

It's a word which has three e's, each pronounced differently. The first syllable has a full [e] even though it is not stressed.

Of course there are cases where stress is not clear even for native speakers; a good example are the separable and non-separable verbs, e.g. the verb doorlopen can be either dóórlopen or doorlópen with a different conjugation and different meaning.

In such cases Dutch spelling does allow stress patterns to be written with an acute, but only if otherwise confusion might arise.

Some words and names can have rather surprising stress patterns:

:Veluwe is Véluwe /'&lt;u&gt;ve&lt;/u&gt;lyə/ for example, not Velúwe and Enschede is Énschedé, not Enschéde. In names ending in -dam the stress is usually on that syllable: Amsterdám, Rotterdám, unless a contrast is made between them &quot;niet Ámsterdam maar Rótterdam&quot;

{|
|{{knp2|Veluwe}}||{{knp2|Enschede}}||{{knp2|Amsterdam}}||{{knp2|Rotterdam}}
|}

===Capitalization===

The rules for capitalization in Dutch are similar to those in English. Capitalization occurs at the beginning of a sentence. ''Eigennamen''  (proper names, e.g., of persons, organisations, countries etc.) are capitalized, but ''soortnamen'' (generic names) are not.

As mentioned above, when a word beginning with '''ij''' has to be capitalized, both letters become capitals, e.g. '''IJ'''sselmeer.

==Exercise==

|{{knop|vindt}}
|{{knop|u}}
|{{knop|het}}
|{{knop|leuk}}
|{{knop|in}}
|{{knop|Muiden}}

=Introduction=

In this chapter, we start to practice working with XML using XML documents, schemas, and stylesheets.  An XML document organizes data and information in a structured, hierarchical format.  An XML schema provides standards and rules for the structure of a given XML document.  An XML schema also enables data transfer.  An XSL (XML stylesheet) allows unique presentations of the material found within an XML document.

In the first chapter, ''Introduction to XML'', you learned what XML is, why it is useful, and how it is used. So, now you want to create your very own XML documents. In this chapter, we will show you the basic components used to create an XML document. This chapter is the foundation for all subsequent chapters--it is a little lengthy, but don't be intimidated. We will take you through the fundamentals of XML documents.


This chapter is divided into three parts:
* XML Document
* XML Schema
* XML Stylesheets (XSL)


As you learned in the previous chapter, the XML Schema and Stylesheet are essentially specialized XML Documents. Within each of these three parts we will examine the layout and components required to create the document. There are links at the end of the XML document, schema, and stylesheet sections that show you how to create the documents using an XML editor. At the bottom of the page there is a link to Exercises for this chapter and a link to the Answers.  

The first thing you will need before starting to create XML documents is a problem--something you want to solve by using XML to store and share data or information. You need some entity you can collect information about and then access in a variety of formats. So, we created one for you.

To develop an XML document and schema, start with a data model depicting the reality of the actual data that is exchanged. Once a high fidelity model has been created, the data model can be readily converted to an XML document and schema. In this chapter, we start with a very simple situation and in successive chapters extend the complexity to teach you more features of XML.

Our starting point is a single entity, CITY, which is shown in the following figure. While our focus is on this single entity, to map CITY to an XML schema, we need to have an entity that contains CITY. In this case, we have created TOURGUIDE. Think of a TOURGUIDE as containing many cities, and in this case TOURGUIDE has no attributes nor an identifier. It is just a container for data about cities.

=XML document=

An XML document is a file containing XML code and syntax.  XML documents have an .xml file extension.

We will examine the features &amp; components of the XML document.


* Prologue (XML Declaration)
* Elements
* Attributes
* Rules to follow
* Well-formed &amp; Valid XML documents


Below is a sample XML document using our TourGuide model.  We will refer to it as we describe the parts of an XML document.

'''Exhibit 2: XML document for city entity'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;tourGuide xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='city.xsd'&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
        &lt;cityName&gt;Belmopan&lt;/cityName&gt;
        &lt;adminUnit&gt;Cayo&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
        &lt;country&gt;Belize&lt;/country&gt;
        &lt;population&gt;11100&lt;/population&gt;
        &lt;area&gt;5&lt;/area&gt;
        &lt;elevation&gt;130&lt;/elevation&gt;
        &lt;longitude&gt;88.44&lt;/longitude&gt;
        &lt;latitude&gt;17.27&lt;/latitude&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Belmopan is the capital of Belize&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;history&gt;Belmopan was established following the devastation of the
           former capital, Belize City, by Hurricane Hattie in 1965. High 
           ground and open space influenced the choice and ground-breaking 
           began in 1966.  By 1970 most government offices and operations had 
           already moved to the new location.
        &lt;/history&gt;
    &lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
        &lt;cityName&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/cityName&gt;
        &lt;adminUnit&gt;Selangor&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
        &lt;country&gt;Malaysia&lt;/country&gt;
        &lt;population&gt;1448600&lt;/population&gt;
        &lt;area&gt;243&lt;/area&gt;
        &lt;elevation&gt;111&lt;/elevation&gt;
        &lt;longitude&gt;101.71&lt;/longitude&gt;
        &lt;latitude&gt;3.16&lt;/latitude&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia and the largest 
            city in the nation&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;history&gt;The city was founded in 1857 by Chinese tin miners and  
            preceded Klang.  In 1880 the British government transferred their 
            headquarters from Klang to Kuala Lumpur, and in 1896 it became the 
            capital of Malaysia. 
        &lt;/history&gt;
    &lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
        &lt;cityName&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/cityName&gt;
        &lt;adminUnit&gt;St. Boniface&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
        &lt;country&gt;Canada&lt;/country&gt;
        &lt;population&gt;618512&lt;/population&gt;
        &lt;area&gt;124&lt;/area&gt;
        &lt;elevation&gt;40&lt;/elevation&gt;
        &lt;longitude&gt;97.14&lt;/longitude&gt;
        &lt;latitude&gt;49.54&lt;/latitude&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Winnipeg has two seasons. Winter and Construction.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;history&gt;The city was founded by people at the forks (Fort Garry)
         trading in pelts with the Hudson Bay Company. Ironically, 
         The Bay was bought by America.
        &lt;/history&gt;
    &lt;/city&gt;
  &lt;/tourGuide&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Prologue (XML declaration)==
The XML document starts off with the prologue.  The prologue informs both a reader and the computer of certain specifications that make the document XML compliant.  The first line is the XML declaration (and the only line in this basic XML document).

'''Exhibit 3: XML document - prologue'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''xml''' &amp;nbsp; = &amp;nbsp; this is an XML document&lt;br /&gt;
'''version=&quot;1.0&quot;''' &amp;nbsp; = &amp;nbsp; the XML version (XML 1.0 is the W3C-recommended version)&lt;br /&gt;
'''encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;''' &amp;nbsp; = &amp;nbsp; the character encoding used in the document - UTF 8 corresponds to 8-bit encoded Unicode characters (i.e. the standard way to encode international documents) - [http://www.unicode.org/ Unicode] provides a unique number for every character.&lt;br /&gt;
Another potential attribute of the XML declaration:&lt;br /&gt;
'''standalone=&quot;yes&quot;''' &amp;nbsp; = &amp;nbsp; the dependency of the document ('yes' indicates that the document does not require another document to complete content)

==Elements==

The majority of what you see in the XML document consists of XML '''elements'''. Elements are identified by their '''tags''' that '''open''' with &lt; or &lt;/ and '''close''' with &gt; or /&gt;. The '''start tag''' looks like this: &lt;element attribute=&quot;value&quot;&gt;, with a left angle bracket (&lt;) followed by the '''element type name''', optional '''attributes''', and finally a right angle bracket (&gt;). The '''end tag''' looks like this: &lt;/element&gt;, similar to the start tag, but with a slash (/) between the left angle bracket and the element type name, and no attributes.

When there's nothing between a start tag and an end tag, XML allows you to combine them into an '''empty element tag''', which can include everything a start tag can: &lt;img src=&quot;Belize.gif&quot; /&gt;. This one tag must be closed with a slash and right angle bracket (/&gt;), so that it can be distinguished from a start tag.

The XML document is designed around a major theme, an umbrella concept covering all other items and subjects; this theme is analyzed to determine its component parts, creating categories and subcategories.  The major theme and its component parts are described by elements. In our sample XML document, 'tourGuide' is the major theme; 'city' is a category; 'population' is a subcategory of 'city'; and the hierarchy may be carried even further: 'males' and 'females' could be subcategories of 'population'. Elements follow several rules of syntax that will be described in the Rules to Follow section.


We left out the attributes within the &lt;tourGuide&gt; start tag &amp;mdash; that part will be explained in the XML Schema section.

'''Exhibit 4: Elements of the city entity XML document'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tourGuide&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
        &lt;cityName&gt;Belmopan&lt;/cityName&gt;
        &lt;adminUnit&gt;Cayo&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
        &lt;country&gt;Belize&lt;/country&gt;
        &lt;population&gt;11100&lt;/population&gt;
        &lt;area&gt;5&lt;/area&gt;
        &lt;elevation&gt;130&lt;/elevation&gt;
        &lt;longitude&gt;88.44&lt;/longitude&gt;
        &lt;latitude&gt;17.27&lt;/latitude&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Belmopan is the capital of Belize&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;history&gt;Belmopan was established following the devastation of the
           former capital, Belize City, by Hurricane Hattie in 1965. High 
           ground and open space influenced the choice and ground-breaking 
           began in 1966.  By 1970 most government offices and operations had 
           already moved to the new location.
        &lt;/history&gt;
    &lt;/city&gt;
  &lt;/tourGuide&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Element hierarchy===

* '''root element'''&amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp; This is the XML document's major theme element. Every document must have exactly one and only one root element. All other elements are contained within this one root element. The root element follows the XML declaration. In our example, &lt;tourGuide&gt; is the root element.

* '''parent element'''&amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp; This is any element that contains other elements, the child elements. In our example, &lt;city&gt; is a parent element.

* '''child element'''&amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp; This is any element that is contained within another element, the parent element. In our example, &lt;population&gt; is a child element of &lt;city&gt;.

* '''sibling element'''&amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp; These are elements that share the same parent element. In our example, &lt;cityName&gt;, &lt;adminUnit&gt;, &lt;country&gt;, &lt;population&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, &lt;elevation&gt;, &lt;longitude&gt;, &lt;latitude&gt;, &lt;description&gt;, and &lt;history&gt; are all sibling elements.

&lt;br&gt;

==Attributes==

Attributes aid in modifying the content of a given element by providing additional or required information.  They are contained within the element's opening tag.  In our sample XML document code we could have taken advantage of attributes to specify the unit of measure used to determine the area and the elevation (it could be feet, yards, meters, kilometers, etc.); in this case, we could have called the attribute 'measureUnit' and defined it within the opening tag of 'area' and 'elevation'.


        &lt;adminUnit '''class=&quot;state&quot;'''&gt;Cayo&lt;/adminUnit&gt;

        &lt;adminUnit '''class=&quot;region&quot;'''&gt;Selangor&lt;/adminUnit&gt;


The above attribute example can also be written as:


1. using child elements
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;adminUnit&gt;
          &lt;class&gt;state&lt;/class&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;Cayo&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;/adminUnit&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;adminUnit&gt;
          &lt;class&gt;region&lt;/class&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;Selangor&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;/adminUnit&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

2. using an empty element

     &lt;adminUnit class=&quot;state&quot; name=&quot;Cayo&quot; /&gt;

     &lt;adminUnit class=&quot;region&quot; name=&quot;Selangor&quot; /&gt;



Attributes can be used to:

* provide more information that is not defined in the data
* define a characteristic of the element (size, color, style)
* ensure the inclusion of information about an element in all instances

Attributes can, however, be a bit more difficult to manipulate and they have some constraints.  Consider using a child element if you need more freedom.



==Rules to follow==
These rules are designed to aid the computer reading your XML document.

* The first line of an XML document must be the XML declaration (the prologue). 

* The main theme of the XML document is established in the root element and all other elements must be contained within the opening and closing tags of this root element.

* Every element must have an opening tag and a closing tag - '''no exceptions''' &lt;br&gt;
(e.g. &lt;element&gt;data stuff&lt;/element&gt;).

* Tags must be nested in a particular order 
=&gt; the parent element's opening and closing tags must contain all of its child elements' tags; in this way, you close first the tag that was opened last:
 &lt;parentElement&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;childElement1&gt;data&lt;/childElement1&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;childElement2&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;subChildElementA&gt;data&lt;/subChildElementA&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;subChildElementB&gt;data&lt;/subChildElementB&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/childElement2&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;childElement3&gt;data&lt;/childElement3&gt;
 &lt;/parentElement&gt;

* Attribute values should have quotation marks around them and no spaces.

* Empty tags or empty elements must have a space and a slash (/) at the end of the tag.

* Comments in the XML language begin with &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;!--&quot; and end with &quot;--&gt;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.


===XML Element Naming Convention===

Any name can be used but the idea is to make names meaningful to those who might read the document.

* XML elements may only start with either a letter or an underscore character.

* The name must not start with the string &quot;xml&quot; which is reserved for the XML specification.

* The name may not contain spaces.

* The &quot;:&quot; should not be used in element names because it is reserved to be used for namespaces (This will be covered in more detail in a later chapter).

* The name may contain a mixture of letters, numbers, or other characters.


XML documents often have a corresponding database. The database will contain fields which correspond to elements in the XML document. A good practice is to use the naming rules of your database for the elements in the XML documents.

==DTD (Document Type Definition) Validation - Simple Example==
====Simple Internal DTD====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE cdCollection [
    &lt;!ELEMENT cdCollection (cd)&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT cd (title, artist, year)&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT artist (#PCDATA)&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT year (#PCDATA)&gt;
 ]&gt;
 &lt;cdCollection&gt;
  &lt;cd&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;artist&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/artist&gt;
    &lt;year&gt;1973&lt;/year&gt;
  &lt;/cd&gt;
 &lt;/cdCollection&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Every element that will be used MUST be included in the DTD. Don’t forget to include the root element, even though you have already specified it at the beginning of the DTD. You must specify it again, in an &lt;!ELEMENT&gt; tag. 
&lt;!ELEMENT cdCollection (cd)&gt; The root element, &lt;cdCollection&gt;, contains all the other elements of the document, but only one direct child element: &lt;cd&gt;. Therefore, you need to specify the child element (only direct child elements need to be specified) in the parentheses. 
&lt;!ELEMENT cd (title, artist, year)&gt; With this line, we define the &lt;cd&gt; element. Note that this element contains the child elements &lt;title&gt;, &lt;artist&gt;, and &lt;year&gt;. These are spelled out in a particular order. This order must be followed when creating the XML document. If you change the order of the elements (with this particular DTD), the document won’t validate.
&lt;!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)&gt; The remaining three tags, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;artist&gt;, and &lt;year&gt; don’t actually contain other tags. They do however contain some text that needs to be parsed. You may remember from an earlier lecture that this data is called Parsed Character Data, or #PCDATA. Therefore, #PCDATA is specified in the parentheses. 
So this simple DTD outlines exactly what you see here in the XML file. Nothing can be added or taken away, as long as we stick to this DTD. The only thing you can change is the #PCDATA text part between the tags.

====Adding complexity====
There may be times when you will want to put more than just character data, or more than just child elements into a particular element. This is referred to as mixed content. For example, let’s say you want to be able to put character data OR a child element, such as the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag into a &lt;description&gt; element:

  &lt;!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA | b | i )*&gt;

This particular arrangement allows us to use PCDATA, the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, or the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag all at once. One particular caveat though, is that if you are going to mix PCDATA and other elements, the grouping must be followed by the asterisk (*) suffix. This declaration allows us to now add the following to the XML document (after defining the individual elements of course)

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;cd&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Love. Angel. Music. Baby&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;artist&gt;Gwen Stefani&lt;/artist&gt;
    &lt;year&gt;2004&lt;/year&gt;
    &lt;genre&gt;pop&lt;/genre&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      This is a great album from former  
      &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Doubt&lt;/i&gt; singer &lt;b&gt;Gwen Stephani&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/cd&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

With attributes this is done a little differently than with elements. Please see following example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;cd remaster_date=”1992”&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;artist&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/artist&gt;
    &lt;year&gt;1973&lt;/year&gt;
  &lt;/cd&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In order for this to validate, it must be specified in the DTD. Attribute content models are specified with:

  &lt;!ATTLIST element_name attribute_name attribute_type default_value&gt;

Let’s use this to validate our CD example: 

  &lt;!ATTLIST cd remaster_date CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;

====Choices====

  &lt;ATTLIST person gender (male|female) “female”&gt;

====Grouping Attributes for an Element====
If a particular element is to have many different attributes, group them together like so:

 &lt;!ATTLIST car horn CDATA #REQUIRED
              seats CDATA #REQUIRED
      steeringwheel CDATA #REQUIRED
              price CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;

==== Adding STATIC validation, for items that must have a certain value ====

 &lt;!ATTLIST classList   classNumber CDATA #IMPLIED
                       building (UWINNIPEG_DCE|UWINNIPEG_MAIN) &quot;UWINNIPEG_MAIN&quot;
                       originalDeveloper CDATA #FIXED &quot;Khal Shariff&quot;&gt;

====Suffixes====
So what happens with our last example with the CD collection, when we want to add more CDs? With the current DTD, we cannot add any more CDs without getting an error. Try it and see. 
When you specify a child element (or elements) the way we did, only one of each child element can be used. Not very suitable for a CD collection is it? 
We can use something called suffixes to add functionality to the &lt;!ELEMENT&gt; tag.
Suffixes are added to the end of the specified child element(s). There are 3 main suffixes that can be used:

* ( No suffix ): Only 1 child can be used.
* ( + ): One or more elements can be used.
* ( * ): Zero or more elements can be used.
* ( ? ): Zero or one element may be used.

====  Validating for multiple children with a DTD ====

So in the case of our CD collection XML file, we can add more CDs to the list by adding a + suffix:
 &lt;!ELEMENT cd_collection(cd+)&gt;

==== Using more internal formatting tags ====

Bold tags, B's for example are also defined in the DTD as elements, that are optional like thus:

 &lt;ELEMENT notes (#PCDATA | b | i)*&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT b (#PCDATA)*&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT i (#PCDATA)*&gt;
 ]&gt;
_______________
 &lt;classList classNumber=&quot;303&quot; building=&quot;UWINNIPEG_DCE&quot; originalDeveloper=&quot;Khal Shariff&quot;&gt;
  &lt;student&gt;
    &lt;firstName&gt;Kenneth
    &lt;/firstName&gt;
    &lt;lastName&gt;Branaugh
    &lt;/lastName&gt;
    &lt;studentNumber&gt;
    &lt;/studentNumber&gt;
    &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;notes&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excellent &lt;/b&gt;, Kenneth is doing well.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
    &lt;/notes&gt;
 etc

= Case Study on BMEcat =


One of the first major national projects for the use of XML as a B2B exchange format was initiated by the federal association for material management, purchasing and logistics (BME) in cooperation with leading German companies, e.g. Bayer, BMW, SAP and Siemens. They all created a standard for the exchange of product catalogues. This project was named [http://www.bmecat.org/English/index.asp? BMEcat]. The result of this initiative is a DTD collection for the description of product catalogues and related transactions (new catalogue, updating of product data and updating of prices). 

Companies operating in the electronic commerce (suppliers, purchasing companies and market places) exchange increasingly large amounts of data. They quickly reach their limits here by the variety of data exchange formats. The BMEcat solution creates a basis for a straightforward transfer of catalogue data from various data formats. This lays the foundation to bringing forward the goods traffic through the Internet in Germany. The use of the BMEcat reduces the costs for all parties as standard interfaces can be used. 

The XML-based standard BMEcat was successfully implemented in many projects. Nowadays a variety of companies applies BMEcat and use it for the exchange of their product catalogs in this established standard.



'''A BMEcat catalogue (Version 1.2) consists of the following main elements:'''

'''CATALOG''' 
This element contains the essential information of a shopping catalog, e.g. language version and validity. BMEcat expects exactly one language per catalog.

'''SUPPLIER''' 
This element includes identification and address of the catalog suppliers. BMEcat expects exactly one supplier per catalog.

'''BUYER''' 
This element contains the name and address of the catalogue recipient. BMEcat expects no more than one recipient per catalog.

'''AGREEMENT''' 
This element contains one or more framework agreement IDs associated with the appropriate validity period. BMEcat expects all prices of a catalogue belonging to the contract mentioned above.

'''CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM''' 
This element allows the full transfer of one or more classification systems, including feature definitions and key words.

'''CATALOG GROUP SYSTEM''' 
This element originates from version 1.0. It is mainly used for the transfer of tree-structures which facilitate the navigation of a user in the target system (Browser).

'''ARTICLE''' (since 2005 PRODUCT) 
This element represents a product. It contains a set of standard attributes. 

'''ARTICLE PRICE''' (since 2005 PRODUCT PRICE) 
This element represents a price. The support of different pricing models is very powerful in comparison with other exchange formats. Season prices, country prices, different currencies and different validity periods, etc. will be supported. 

'''ARTICLE FEATURE''' (since 2005 PRODUCT FEATURE) 
This element allows the transfer of characteristic values. You can either record predefined group characteristics or individual product characteristics. 

'''VARIANT''' 
This element allows listing of product variants, without having to duplicate them. However, the variations of BMEcat  only apply to individual changes in value, leading to a change of Article ID. Otherwise there can’t exist any dependences on other attributes (especially at prices). 

'''MIME''' 
This element includes any number of additional documents such as product images, data sheets, or websites. 

'''ARTICLE REFERENCE''' (since 2005 REFERENCE PRODUCT) 
This element allows cross-referencing between articles within a catalogue as well as between catalogues. These references may used restrictedly for mapping product bundles. 

'''USER DEFINED EXTENSION''' 
This element enables transportation of data at the outside the BMEcat standards. The transmitter and receiver have to be coordinated.

You can find a typical BMEcat file [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMECat here.]

==Well-formed and valid XML==

'''Well-formed XML'''&amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp;An XML document that correctly abides by the rules of XML syntax.

'''Valid XML'''&amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp;An XML document that adheres to the rules of an XML schema (which we will discuss shortly).  To be valid an XML document must first be well-formed.


A Valid XML Document must be Well-formed.  But, a Well-formed XML Document might not be valid - in other words, a well-formed XML document, that meets the criteria for XML syntax, might not meet the criteria for the XML schema, and will therefore be invalid.

For example, think of the situation where your XML document contains the following (for this schema):

   &lt;city&gt;
     &lt;cityName&gt;Boston&lt;/cityName&gt;
     &lt;country&gt;United States&lt;/country&gt;
     &lt;adminUnit&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
   :
   :
   :
   &lt;/city&gt;

Notice that the elements do not appear in the correct sequence according to the schema (cityName, adminUnit, country). The XML document can be validated (using validation software) against its declared schema – the validation software would then catch the out of sequence error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===Using an XML Editor===

Check chapter [[../XML Editor/]] for instructions on how to start an XML editor.
Once you have followed the steps to get started you can copy the code in the sample XML document and paste it into the XML editor.  Then check your results.  Is the XML document well-formed?  Is the XML document valid? (you will need to have copied and pasted the schema in order to validate - we will look at schemas next)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=XML schema=

An XML schema is an XML document.  XML schemas have an .xsd file extension.

An XML schema is used to govern the structure and content of an XML document by providing a template for XML documents to follow in order to be valid.  It is a guide for how to structure your XML document as well as indicating your XML document's components (elements and attributes - and their relationships).  An XML editor will examine an XML document to ensure that it conforms to the specifications of the XML schema it is written against - to ensure it is valid.

XML schemas engender confidence in data transfer.  With schemas, the receiver of data can feel confident that the data conforms to expectations.  The sender and the receiver have a mutual understanding of what the data represent.

Because an XML schema is an XML document, you use the same language - standard XML markup syntax - with elements and attributes specific to schemas.


A schema defines:

* the structure of the document
* the elements
* the attributes
* the child elements
* the number of child elements
* the order of elements
* the names and contents of all elements 
* the data type for each element 

For more detailed information on XML schemas and reference lists of: Common XML Schema Primitive Data Types, Summary of XML Schema Elements, Schema Restrictions and Facets for data types, and Instance Document Attributes, click on this wikibook link =&gt; http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XML_Schema



==Schema reference==

This is the part of the XML Document that references an XML Schema:

'''Exhibit 5: XML document's schema reference'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tourGuide
      xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
      xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='city.xsd'&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This is the part we left out when we described the root element in the basic XML document from the previous section.  The additional attributes of the root element &lt;tourGuide&gt; reference the XML schema (it is the schemaLocation attribute).

'''xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' ''' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; references the W3C Schema-instance namespace&lt;br /&gt;
'''xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='city.xsd' ''' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; references the XML schema document (city.xsd)

==Schema document==

Below is a sample XML schema using our TourGuide model. We will refer to it as we describe the parts of an XML schema.

'''Exhibit 6: XML schema document for city entity'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
   elementFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt;  
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
                &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;city&quot; type=&quot;cityDetails&quot; minOccurs = &quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
        &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
     &lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;cityDetails&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsd:sequence&gt; 
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;cityName&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;adminUnit&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;country&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;population&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;area&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;elevation&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;longitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;latitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;history&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:schema&gt;
  &lt;!--
    Note: Latitude and Longitude are decimal data types.
    The conversion is from the usual form (e.g., 50º 17' 35&quot;)
    to a decimal by using the formula degrees+min/60+secs/3600.
  --&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;



===Prolog===

Remember that the XML schema is essentially an XML document and therefore must begin with the prolog, which in the case of a schema includes:

* the XML declaration
* the schema element declaration
&lt;br&gt;
The XML declaration:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The schema element declaration:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The '''schema element''' is similar to a root element - it contains all other elements in the schema.  

Attributes of the schema element include:

'''xmlns''' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; XML NameSpace - the URL for the site that describes the XML elements and data types used in the schema.  

You can find more about namespaces here =&gt; [[../Namespace/]].

'''xmlns:xsd''' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; All the elements and attributes with the 'xsd' prefix adhere to the vocabulary designated in the given namespace.

'''elementFormDefault''' &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; elements from the target namespace are either required or not required to be qualified with the namespace prefix.  This is mostly useful when more than one namespace is referenced.  In this case, 'elementFormDefault' must be ''qualified'', because you must indicate which namespace you are using for each element.  If you are referencing only one namespace, then 'elementFormDefault' can be ''unqualified''.  Perhaps, using ''qualified'' as the default is most prudent, this way you do not accidentally forget to indicate which namespace you are referencing.

===Element declarations===
Define the elements in the schema.

Include:

* the element name
* the element data type (optional)

Basic element declaration format: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;type&quot;&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Simple type====
declares elements that:

* do NOT have Child Elements
* do NOT have Attributes

example: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;cityName&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Default Value'''

If an element is not assigned a value then the default value is assigned.

example: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; default=&quot;really cool place to visit!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Fixed Value'''

An attribute that is defined as fixed must be empty or contained the specified fixed value.  No other values are allowed.

example: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; '''fixed=&quot;you must visit this place - it is awesome!&quot;''' /&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Complex type====
declares elements that:

* can have Child Elements
* can have Attributes

examples:

'''1.'''  The root element 'tourGuide' contains a child element 'city'.  This is shown here:

'''''Nameless complex type'''''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
                &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;city&quot; type=&quot;cityDetails&quot; minOccurs = &quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
        &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Occurrence Indicators''': 

* ''minOccurs'' = the minimum number of times an element can occur (here it is 1 time) 
* ''maxOccurs'' = the maximum number of times an element can occur (here it is an unlimited number of times, 'unbounded')



'''2.'''  The parent element 'city' contains many child elements: 'cityName', 'adminUnit', 'country', 
'population', etc.  Why does this complex element set not start with the line: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;city&quot; type=&quot;cityDetails&quot;&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;?  The element 'city' was already defined above within the complex element 'tourGuide' and it was given the type, 'cityDetails'.  This data type, 'cityDetails', is utilized here in identifying the sequence of child elements for the parent element 'city'.

'''''Named Complex Type''''' - and therefore can be reused in other parts of the schema
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;cityDetails&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;cityName&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;adminUnit&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;country&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;population&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;area&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;elevation&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;longitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;latitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;history&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
   &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The '''&lt;xsd:sequence&gt;''' tag indicates that the child elements must appear in the order, the sequence, specified here.  

Compare the sample XML Schema and the sample XML Document - try to observe patterns in the code and how  the XML Schema sets up the XML Document.


'''3.''' Elements that have attributes are also designated as complex type.

a. this XML Document line: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;adminUnit class=&quot;state&quot; name=&quot;Cayo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
would be defined in the XML Schema as: 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;adminUnit&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
               &lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;class&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;
               &lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
b. this XML Document line: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;adminUnit class=&quot;state&quot;&gt;Cayo&lt;/adminUnit&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
would be defined in the XML Schema as:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;adminUnit&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
               &lt;xsd:simpleContent&gt;
             		&lt;xsd:extension base=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;
                                &lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;class&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;
                        &lt;/xsd:extension&gt;
	       &lt;/xsd:simpleContent&gt;
          &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Attribute declarations===

Attribute declarations are used in complex type definitions.  We saw some attribute declarations in the third example of the Complex Type Element. 
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;&lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;class&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;



===Data type declarations===

These are contained within element and attribute declarations as: ''' type=&quot; &quot; '''.

Common XML Schema Data Types

XML schema has a lot of built-in data types. The most common types are:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|string ||a string of characters
|-
|decimal ||a decimal number 
|-
|integer ||an integer
|-
|boolean ||the values true or false or 1 or 0 
|-
|date ||a date, the date pattern can be specified such as YYYY-MM-DD 
|-
|time ||a time of day, the time pattern can be specified such as HH:MM:SS 
|-
|dateTime ||a date and time combination
|-
|anyURI ||if the element will contain a URL
|}


For an entire list of built-in simple data types see http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#built-in-datatypes

Using an XML Editor =&gt; [[../XML Editor/]]

This link will take you to instructions on how to start an XML editor. Once you have followed the steps to get started you can copy the code in the sample XML schema document and paste it into the XML editor. Then check your results. Is the XML schema well-formed? Is the XML schema valid?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=XML stylesheet (XSL)=

An XML Stylesheet is an XML Document.  XML Stylesheets have an .xsl file extension.

The eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) provides a means to transform and format the contents of an XML document for display.  Since an XML document does not contain tags a browser understands, such as HTML tags, browsers cannot present the data without a stylesheet that contains the presentation information.  By separating the data and the presentation logic, XSL allows people to view the data according to their different needs and preferences.

The XSL Transformation Language (XSLT) is used to  transform an XML document from one form to another, such as creating an HTML document to be viewed in a browser. An XSLT stylesheet consists of a set of formatting instructions that dictate how the contents of an XML document will be displayed in a browser, with much the same effect as Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) do for HTML.  Multiple views of the same data can be created using different stylesheets. The output of a stylesheet is not restricted to a browser. 


During the transformation process, XSLT analyzes the XML document and converts it into a '''node tree''' – a hierarchical representation of the entire XML document.  Each node represents a piece of the XML document, such as an element, attribute or some text content.  The XSL stylesheet contains predefined “templates” that contain instructions on what to do with the nodes.   XSLT will use the match attribute to relate XML element nodes to the templates, and transform them into the resulting document. 

'''Exhibit 7: XML stylesheet document for city entity'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt; 
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Tour Guide&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Cities&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;tourGuide&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;city&quot;&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;continentName&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityName&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;xsl:text&gt;Population: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of select='format-number(population, &quot;##,###,###&quot;)'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;country&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;     
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


The output of the city.xsl stylesheet in Table 2-3 will look like the 
following:
{{Side note|
'''Cities'''

Europe&lt;br/&gt;
Madrid&lt;br/&gt;
Population: 3,128,600&lt;br/&gt;
Spain

Asia&lt;br/&gt;
Shanghai&lt;br/&gt;
Population: 18,880,000&lt;br/&gt;
China}}


You will notice that the stylesheet consists of HTML to inform the media tool (a web browser) of the presentation design.  If you do not already know HTML this may seem a little confusing.  Online resources such as the W3Schools tutorials can help with the basic understanding you will need =&gt;(http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).  

Incorporated within the HTML is the XML that supplies the data, the information, contained within our XML document.  The XML of the stylesheet indicates what information will be displayed and how.  So, the HTML constructs a display and the XML plugs in values within that display.  '''XSL is the tool that transforms the information into presentational form, but at the same time keeps the meaning of the data.'''

&lt;big&gt;'''XML at Bertelsmann - a case study'''&lt;/big&gt;

The German Bertelsmann Inc. is a privately owned media conglomerate operating in 56 countries. It has interests in such businesses as TV broadcast (RTL), magazine (Gruner &amp; Jahr), books (Random House) etc. In 2005 its 89 000 employees generated 18 billion € of revenue.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A major concern of such a diversified business is utilizing synergies. Management needs to make sure the Random House employees don´t spend time and money figuring out what RTL TV journalists already have come up with.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Thus knowledge management based on IT promises huge time savings. Consequently Bertelsmann in 2002 started a project called BeCom.
BeCom´s purpose was to enable the different Bertelsmann businesses to use the same data for their different media applications.
XML is crucial in this project, because it allows for separating data (document) from presentation (style sheet). Thus data can both be examined statistically and be modified to fit different media like TV and newspapers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Statistical XML data management for example enables employees to benefit from CBR (Case Based Reasoning). [[wikipedia:Case_based_reasoning|CBR]] allows a Bertelsmann employee who searches for specific content to profit from previous search findings of other Bertelsmann employees, thus gaining info which is much more contextual than isolated research results only.
Besides XML data management, Bertelsmann TV and Book units can apply this optimized data in their specific media using a variety of lay-out applications like 3B2 or QuarkXPress.

==Prolog==
*  the XML declaration;
*  the stylesheet declaration;
*  the namespace declaration;
*  the output document format.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;



'''The XML declaration'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


'''The stylesheet &amp; namespace declarations'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
* identifies the document as an XSL style sheet;
* identifies the version number;
* refers to the W3C XSL namespace - the URL for the site that describes the XML elements and data types used in the schema.  You can find more about namespaces here =&gt; [[../Namespace/]].  Every time the xsl: prefix is used it references the given namespace.


'''The output document format'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This element designates the format of the output document and must be a child element of &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Templates==

The '''&lt;xsl:template&gt;''' element is used to create templates that describe how to display elements and their content.  Above, in the XSL introduction, we mentioned that XSL breaks up the XML document into nodes and works on individual nodes.  This is done with templates.  Each template within an XSL describes a single node.  To identify which node a given template is describing, use the 'match' attribute.  The value given to the 'match' attribute is called a '''pattern'''.  Remember:   ('''node tree''' – a hierarchical representation of the entire XML document.  Each node represents a piece of the XML document, such as an element, attribute or some text content).  Wherever there is branching in the node tree, there is a node.  &lt;xsl:template&gt; defines the start of a template and contains rules to apply when a specified node is matched.


'''the match attribute'''

    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;

This template match attribute associates the XML document root (/), the whole branch of the XML source document, with the HTML document root.  Contained within this template element is the typical HTML markup found at the beginning of any HTML document.  This HTML is written to the output.  The XSL looks for the root match and then outputs the HTML, which the browser understands.

    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
This template match attribute associates the element 'tourGuide' with the display rules described within this element.



==Elements==

Elements specific to XSL:

{| border=3 cellpadding=5
|align=&quot;center&quot;|'''XSL Element'''
|align=&quot;center&quot;|'''Meaning'''
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; |(from our sample XSL)
|-
!&lt;xsl:text&gt;
|Prints the actual text found between this element's tags
|-
!&lt;xsl:value-of&gt;
|This element is used with a 'select' attribute to look up the value of the node selected and plug it into the output.
|-
!&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;
|This element is used with a 'select' attribute to handle elements that repeat by looping through all the nodes in the selected node set.
|-
!&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;
|This element will apply a template to a node or nodes.  If it uses a 'select' attribute then the template will be applied only to the selected child node(s) and can specify the order of child nodes.  If no 'select' attribute is used then the template will be applied to the current node and all its child nodes as well as text nodes.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===PHP XML Production ===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 $xmlData = &quot;&quot;;
 mysql_connect('localhost','root','')
 or die('Failed to connect to the DBMS');
 // make connection to database
 mysql_select_db('issd')
 or die('Failed to open the requested database');

 fwrite($fh, $xmlString); //write the data into the file
 fclose($fh); //ALL DONE!
 ?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===PHP Methods of XSLT Transformation===

This one is good for PHP5 and wampserver (latest). Please ensure that *xsl* is NOT commented out in
the php.ini file.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 // Load the XML source
 $xml = new DOMDocument;
 $xml-&gt;load('tourguide.xml');
 $xsl = new DOMDocument;
 $xsl-&gt;load('tourguide.xsl');
 // Configure the transformer
 $proc = new XSLTProcessor;
 $proc-&gt;importStyleSheet($xsl); // attach the xsl rules
 echo $proc-&gt;transformToXML($xml);
 ?&gt; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Example 1, Using within PHP itself (use phpInfo() function to check XSLT extension; enable if needed)
This example might produce XHTML. Please note it could produce anything defined by the XSL.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 $xhtmlOutput = xslt_create();
 $args = array();
 $params = array('foo' =&gt; 'bar');
 $theResult = xslt_process(
                         $xhtmlOutput,
                         'theContentSource.xml',
                         'theTransformationSource.xsl',
                         null,
                         $args,
                         $params
                        );
 xslt_free($xhtmlOutput); // free that memory
 // echo theResult or save it to a file or continue processing (perhaps instructions)
 ?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Example 2:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 if (PHP_VERSION &gt;= 5) {
   // Emulate the old xslt library functions
   function xslt_create() {
       return new XsltProcessor();

       // Start the transformation
       $processed = $xsltproc-&gt;transformToXML($xml);
       // Put the result in a file when specified

=XML at Thomas Cook - a case study=

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;horizontal-align:wraptext;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:lightyellow&quot; |
As the leading travel company and most widely recognized brands in the world, Thomas Cook works across the travel value chain - airlines, hotels, tour operators, travel and incoming agencies, providing its customers with the right product in all market segments across the globe. Employing over 11,000 staff, the Group has 33 tour operators, around 3,600 travel agencies, a fleet of 80 aircraft and a workforce numbering some 26,000. Thomas Cook operates throughout a network of 616 locations in Europe and overseas. The company is now the second largest travel group in Europe and the third largest in the world.

As Thomas Cook sells other companies´ products, ranging from packaged holidays to car hires, it needs to regularly change its online brochure. Before Thomas Cook started using XML, it put information into HTML format, and would take upto six weeks to get an online brochure up and running online. XML helps do this job in about three days. This helps provide all of Thomas Cook´s current and potential customers and its various agencies in different geographical locations with updated information, instead of having to wait six weeks for new information to be released.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
XML allows Thomas Cook to put content information into a single database, which can be re-used as many times as required.
&quot;We did not want to keep having to re-do the same content, we wanted the ability to switch it on immediately,&quot; said Gwyn Williams, who is content manager at Thomascook.com. &quot;This has brought internal benefits such as being able to re-deploy staff into more value added areas.&quot; Thomascook.com currently holds 65,000 pages of brochure and travel guide information and an online magazine in XML format.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Thomas Cook started using XML at a relatively early stage. As Thomas Cook has a large database, the early use of XML will stand it in good stead. At some point, the databases will have to be incorporated into XML, and it is reported that XML databases are quicker than conventional databases, giving Thomas Cook a slight competitive advantage against those who do not use XML.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Thomas Cook has found that this can lead to substantial cost reductions as well as consistency of information across all channels. By implementing a central content management system to facilitate brochure production and web publications, they have centralized the production, maintenance and distribution of content across their brands and channels.

|From the previous chapter ''Introduction to XML'', you have learned the need for data exchange and the usefulness of XML in data exchange.  In this chapter, you have learned more about the three major XML files: the XML document, the XML schema, and the XML stylesheet.  You learned the correct documentation required for each type of file.  You learned basic rules of syntax applicable for all XML documents.  You learned how to integrate the three types of XML documents.  And you learned the definition and distinction between a ''well-formed'' document and a ''valid'' document.  By following the ''XML Editor'' links, you were able to see the results of the sample code and learn how to use an XML Editor.

Below are Exercises and Answers for further practice.  Good Luck!

'''Crossing the Bridge'''

A man that weighs 98 pounds exactly is carrying 3 weights each weighing 1 pound exactly.  He must cross a bridge that has a weight limit of exactly 100 pounds

How does he cross the bridge with the weights?


'''[[Puzzles/How do you ... ?/Crossing the Bridge/Solution|Solution]]'''

1. Carry one weight at a time?&lt;BR&gt;
2. Throw the weights over.&lt;BR&gt;
3. Get some one lighter to carry them over.&lt;BR&gt;
4. Try to cross and hope the bridge does not collapse.&lt;BR&gt;
5. Find a different route across?&lt;BR&gt;
6. Go on a diet?&lt;BR&gt;
7. Juggle?&lt;BR&gt;
8. Roll the weights across&lt;BR&gt;
9. wear away some of the weights by rubbing them against a rock, or break them or something&lt;BR&gt;
10. FedEx them to the other side :P &lt;BR&gt;
11. Pray &lt;BR&gt;
12. Build a new bridge &lt;BR&gt;
13. Build a small boat and placing the weights on it, drag it across the river with a rope (if there's no river, use helium balloons :P) &lt;BR&gt;
14. Tie the weights to a long rope, cross the bridge and drag the weights from the other side &lt;BR&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The puzzle states that the man currently WEIGHS 98lbs. There is no mention of his mass, and so we must therefore assume that if &quot;the man weighs exactly 98 pounds&quot;, and he is holding the three 1 pound apples, as is stated, the 98 pounds INCLUDES the 3 apples already. Therefore to cross the bridge, the man runs, skips, jumps or simply strolls across the bridge, with no fear of collapse. He may, however, collapse at seeing the price of an apple that weighs a pound...

He juggles the apples across.
*Since he has to throw the apple to juggle it, he would end up bearing more than the force of holding the apple staticly. So I'm not sure this would work.
**This should work as long as he doesn't throw too hard. To be sure, he could hold only one at any time...
**Agreed with above.  He is effectively &quot;juggling&quot; one apple if he staggers the juggling.  He could juggle as many as he likes across the bridge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** NO!... 

(Sorry for shouting, the laws of physics made me do it!)

A juggler who weighs 98 pounds juggling 3 apples weighing 1 pound each imparts a
mean force of 101 pounds on the bridge. Mean force refers to the average force
over time. 

Objects thrown up will be at the same speed falling at the height they were thrown from.
Consider that at any given time she has one apple in the hand and  two in the air. 
Assume that a throwing velocity of V is needed to keep these apples in the air.
Since there are three apples, each apple spends two thirds of its time in the
air, and one third in her hand. While in the air, the apples accelerate down at g
changing velocity from V to -V. In the hand the apples need to accelerate
in the opposite direction, for a speed change from -V to V. 

But they have half the freefall time to do this (two apples in air, one in 
hand at any instant of time!) Thus, while in her hand, they are accelerating 
at 2g upwards. They are doing this in a -1g gravitational field. 

Sir Isaac says that the resultant force that each apple imparts on the juggler is 
3 pounds downwards. Hence, the juggler imparts 98 + 3 = 101 pounds on the bridge.

However, all is not lost! The way to cross the bridge without exceeding 
the 100 lb limit is as follows:

Hold apples in your raised hand. Run as fast as you can to cross the bridge, 
but at the instant you get to the bridge bring your arms down in one continuous 
motion (accelerating the apples down at g/3). You must not finish this until
you have crossed the bridge! 

If your arms are 2 ft long, you have 4 feet to lower the apples. 
Since g=32 ft/sec/sec and s=0.5*a*t*t, 
then you must lower the three apples at g/3 to reduce your load by 1 lb.
So we have:
t*t = 4/(0.5*32/3) or approximately 0.75 sec*sec, thus t is approximately 
0.85 seconds. 

Therefore, if you can run fast enough to cross the bridge in under
850 milliseconds and can move your arms in the motion described - at just the
right time - you can cross the bridge. 

We assumed your arms have negligible mass, in reality you get more time, 
because you are also accelerating the mass of your arms. That calculation 
is left as an exercise to the reader.   (mce)
-----------------------------


He could also cross the bridge 3 times carrying each apple every time.

(Or, he could bowl one across, assuming he doesn't mind risking losing an apple to the river.)

He eats all three apples, digests them, loses a pound by excreting and urinating then walks over
*He left the digested apples so he didn't cross the bridge WITH the apples

He sacrifices a part of his body weighing one pound

He prays that the verticle g's his body creates doesn't lead to his demise, and he hopes the engineer who calculated the weight limit left a margin for error.

He gets a hair cut.

He runs really fast across the bridge, and lets the centripetal force kick in and take some of that weight off.

He waits until there is a full moon. With the additional gravitational pull, he can successfully cross the bridge.

Hi Gentgeen,

Thanks for featuring my Tarbes Salad at wikibooks! You make my mother proud.

==Administrator==

Hi Gentgeen. As Tuf-Kat is away, I have made you a sysop following the vote at [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship|Requests for adminship]]. Please make sure you read the relevant policies linked to from [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] before using your sysop powers here, and be careful where those policies differ from those that you are more used to on the English Wikipedia. I'm surprised you have 2000 users and only one bureaucrat. I would like to advise you to nominate someone for the role, especially since your current one is away. Good luck with your adminship. [[User:Angela|Angela]] ([[m:stewards|steward]]) 00:20, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==Hi==
Thanks for the welcome, Gentgeen.  As you might have guessed, I'm an import from wikipedia.  I finally got curious about all those people saying &quot;Take it to wikibooks&quot;
and checked it out.  Mostly I plan to supplement wikipedia articles with links (Recipes for food dishes seem the most appropriate). [[User:The Steve|The Steve]] 13:10, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Wikipedia recipe ==

I found a recipe for Garlic parmesan pasta [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_parmesan_pasta] all by it's lonesome at Wikipedia. I was wondering if there was a procedure for moving such recipes or if I should just copy and paste it over to Wikibooks.  The recipe is a dead end page with no links anywhere else in Wikipedia.  [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:46, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Wikipedia dumps ==

I was wondering what we do with &quot;Wikipedia dumps,&quot; which is my term for when Wikipedians dump an article that doesn't fit in Wikipedia into Wikibooks without taking into consideration the way Wikibooks works.  Has there been discussion about this before that I can read?  This came up because of this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#October_19 page]. The pages now in Wikibooks link only to themselves and the likelyhood of someone finding them is very small by a search. Of course I can create links for it in the Misc. categpru but I was wondering if anything can be added to the conversation at Wikipedia to better inform people on best Wikibooks practice, if there is better practice. Thanks for the help. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 18:33, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Cookbook administrator abuse ==

Hi Gentgeen
I would like to ask you, how was Cookbook:Human any less valid an article than [[Cookbook:Chicken]]? Please undelete it. This is not the first time you have taken actions I do not believe are justifiable by policy, and if you have no explanation for this based on policy, it won't be the first time for that, either.

==='It is time we defined ourselves': copyright and other concerns ===

Hello Gentgreen.
I am concerned that the material downloaded today (27.10.2004) by Attention-tunnel, originally from the works of Di Murray and Andrew Walker and the late Marc Segar, is not released under the GFDL, or a Creative Commons, and therefore cannot/should not be used on Wikibooks.
The '''other''' concern I have is that the material from '''Autism and Computing''' is a 'data dump' and does not fulfill the criteria for a Wikibook, or for that matter a Wikiversity.
The third concern of mine is that this page is vulnerable to vandalism, I believe a link-spammer came.
Would appreciate if you checked up here. Also, what is the status of the Aspergia Mythos and Ethos in relation to Wikibooks?
Sincerely [[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 06:40, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC).

Thanks for the welcome and the suggestions. I will add some kind of disambiguator. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 16:02, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== [[Programming:_C_-/-_-/-]] a copyvio? ==

Please check [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Copying_content_from_Wikipedia]] too. See if that's also a copyright violation. And BTW it could be possible that the wikipedia article itself was a copyvio.

BTW, if this just increases traffic to [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Programming:C_plus_plus_and_its_fork_Programming:_C_-.2F-_-.2F-]], I'd be happier :) -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 21:01, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

oh well your objection and compromise both seem quite fair, and i would be more than willing to change it, if i could work out how to edit the damn thing.

Hi Gentgeen. As explained in [[Talk:Main_Page#Book_of_the_month]], I would ask you to add 3 lines to the Main Page, in order to include a teaser for the book of the month. Here is a demo of how the Main Page should look after the change: [[User:Andreas_Ipp/Main_Page_suggestion]]. I week ago (before you locked the page) I could have done the change by myself, now I depend on some administrator (which is fine with me).

== please distinguish this book ==

Can you fix this? Please do so, or find someone who can.

Every recipie has a link to &quot;Catagories&quot;. Oh my. I click on that, and I see...

* Abugida writing systems
* Ada 2005 feature
* Ada programming language
* Algebra
* Anthropology
* Arts

That's just the letter A. While algebra may be useful for modifying a recipie, it really does not belong in a cookbook. Catagories from unrelated wiki books should not be leaking into the cookbook. I suspect that the Ada programmers have no use for Albanian recipies, but they can always just go to the cookbook if they get hungry. They don't need to be tempted by delicious Argentine recipies while trying to learn about Ada 2005.

Strange non-cookbook stuff also leaks into the &quot;recent changes&quot; page. I suspect I'd also get it if I used the &quot;random module&quot; link, which really should be &quot;random recipie&quot; and &quot;random ingredient&quot;.

The only thing these wikis might reasonably share would be user accounts, and THAT is not working, at least between Wikipedia and the cookbook. Oh, the suffering. :-(

BTW, adding &quot;Cookbook:&quot; to all the links gets old fast. Because of this, and case-sensitivity being enabled, one is required to use the &quot;|&quot; to rename all links. This greatly detracts from the ease-of-use that wikis are known for. If the cookbook were more distinct, this prefix would not be needed.

I certainly do understand why things are the way they are. This does not change the simple fact that things are a great big mess. Renaming the &quot;Categories&quot; link isn't of much use, though I guess renaming it to the non-breaking-space character would be an improvement! Really, that link should work within the cookbook and ''only'' within the cookbook. The cookbook seriously does need a domain name for itself. Then some server-side bot can go through and rip out all the &quot;Cookbook:&quot; prefixes.
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:44, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

The [[Special:Specialpages]] stuff is unusable too. For example, I look in the [[Special:Newimages|New Images gallery]] and see nothing about the cookbook. The cookbook gets drowned out by physics and biology. Everywhere I look, wiki features are unusable, with cookbook data being crowded out by unrelated stuff. Everywhere I look, there are links that take me to some generic place outside the cookbook. Even [[Main Page]] is misleading and wrong, and the reason why every cookbook recipe has to include a link back to the main page of the cookbook.
 [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:17, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== featured recipe ==

Practically nobody in the USA can use this. We don't have scales or balences in our kitchens at all, never mind ones using French units.

It's OK to have meat in pounds, or by volume. Everything else must be by volume. Quantities much larger than a cup can be in those French units, because large glass measuring cups are marked both ways. For everything else, we need traditional units.

This is way more important than following the template, having a picture, or almost anything else.

BTW, the recipe intro and the categorization+title combo are offensive to a billion people. Not me, but... expect some vandalism. Kashmir is very much disputed, with 3 countries claiming it or parts of it.

== Forking policy ==
Do take a look at the proposed [[wikibooks:forking policy|forking policy]]; I'd be appreciative of any input before I start spamming it to other interested parties ;) However, hand-in-hand should be a dispute resolution policy also, though since 'books is smaller I doubt we'd have the numbers for the sort of structure 'pedia proper has. Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:38, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== cookbook images ==

I think it's kind of important to be sure that the images match up with the recipes. Grabbing possibly unrelated images from the commons can be very misleading. For example, you had gingerbread men attached to the gingerbread recipe. (gingerbread is a spice bread, in loaf form, but kind of wide and short more like a cake)
:Good catch.  When I added that image, the description wasn't there, and I didn't check the recipe very well. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:06, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== image locations ==

Why would somebody not use the commons for an image?

I guess I could see it for an ingredient or tool image being used under the &quot;fair use&quot; provision of copyright law. This reason should not apply to recipes. Hopefully there won't be any need to take advantage of fair use; unlike Wikipedia there shouldn't be any special must-have images that can't be redone. (for example, I can make a new spatula image but not one of an airplane hitting the WTC)

Maybe a Julia Child or Iron Chef image?

I guess I just don't see the need for placing images anywhere other than in the commons. The commons has a somewhat functional way to organize images, unlike wikibooks AFAIK.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:28, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I agree, I prefer commons to specific project uploads myself.  However, wikibooks doesn't have control of commons, and the commons pages don't list which articles and modules the image is used on.  Additionally, someone can upload a different image to wikibooks with the same title, overwriting the one at commons.  In my mind, none of these is important enough to not use commons, but other users may think differently.

== subpages ==

I would really like to keep the cookbook free of subpage usage. The idea seems to be somewhat poorly thought through; it assumes a strictly tree-structured book. The header it generates is ugly and inflexible, being redundant to any normal cookbook header. Plus a more obscure annoyance: the &quot;/&quot; makes one-article-per-file scripted processing much more awkward on a UNIX-like system.

:I agree. When I first got here some of the recipes were at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Recipies/Recipe name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (sic), which just seemed wrong. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:18, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== double boiler ==

I think that is way off. Double boilers sure do contact the water.

I'd never heard of a bain-marie before, but the Wikipedia article
seems to indicate that a bain-marie is used in an ''oven''. Presumably this would mean the inner pot needs a lid, to avoid baking, and the handle would need to be something that can't melt.

I'm fairly sure the &quot;bain-marie&quot; picture is not in fact a bain-marie. It definitely qualifies as a double-boiler.

== chicago sirloin ==

I don't believe that Midwestern recipes is an appropriate category for [[Cookbook:Chicago Sirloin with Cabernet Balsamic Reduction|Chicago Sirloin with Cabernet Balsamic Reduction]]. This is a meal with more European influences than anything Midwestern, and certainly does not deserve to be grouped in with chicken wings and Tater tot casserole.

Thanks for your time. [[User:Ntm|Ntm]] 05:40, 1 May 2005 (UTC)


Chicago sirloin is a style of cooking the steak - chargrilled and rare, not neccesarily the cuisine that the recipes that comes from. But thanks for your input, I will definitely recategorize this recipe when I find one that fits. Thanks! [[User:Ntm|Ntm]] 23:39, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

== anon IP blocks ==

Infinite IP blocks have two problems:
#IP addresses can get reassigned (per-user, or via sale of a whole netblock with thousands of addresses).
#Some of these may be temporarily infected zombie machines.
I can't help but be reminded of the problem of being unable to send email because the previous IP address owner caused trouble. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:49, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the comment on the advertising. I'd also like your opinion on tagging each recipe with Category:Recipe (to create an index). This is buried in the &quot;categorization proposal&quot; that Albert was not too thrilled about =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 00:55, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Proposal for policy overhaul ==

As a fellow admin who might be interested, it might interest you that I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as suggested by [[User:Aya]], who claims existing policies to be ambiguous) and more open (as suggested by [[User:Robert Horning]] over the biography debacle).  I've made a post on textbook-l ([http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html]) as a result, please reply to my talk page for feedback.

== Pipe trick ==

I'm editing [[Cookbook:Clear soup]] and discovered that 'pipe trick' is perfect thing and makes work with cookbook articles lot easier. For example, until now I was not aware that writing &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[cookbook:carrot|]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will provide correct link to [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s.

Maybe you should write about pipe trick in Cookbook guidelines for contributors? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

:Yeah, the pipe trick should have started working when &quot;Cookbook:&quot; became an actual namespace.  I'll go check out the cookbook editing guidlines and recipe templates, and note the new &quot;trick&quot; for our editors.  Thanks, [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:22, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:17, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== PAGENAME ==

Hiya. I saw that you added &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a few recipes. While this works in the short term, I think it's a waste of your (or anybody's) time to do that. We should strongly encourage the mediawiki developers to provide some sort of fix that actually works for us rather than twiddling with magic page variables. If we are forced to use PAGENAME, I think we should see if Uncle G or someone else who is proficient with bots could help us out, rather than doing it by hand. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:25, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

: You might also recall that doing: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Cat name|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will automagically sort by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for you. Less typing =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Study Guide for CFA Exam Level III]] ==

you deleted this book on 21 June, 2006 as a &quot;copyvio&quot;. There is currently a request on [[WB:VFU]] to have this book undeleted, under the stated assumption that the author would remove any material in violation of copyright or fair use. I don't know enough about the material to cast a vote on this manner, but if you feel that the material could be made to not violate policy if it were undeleted, i will vote to undelete. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:24, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

*Hey, Gentgeen.  Could you look at [[WB:VFU]] again?  Some discussion has been added.  I believe I can quickly remove the offending content and am eager to start working on this guy again.  Thanks.  --[[User:VivekVish|VivekVish]] 14:39, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

For fixing the main page (and the related vandalism) and it's been a while since you've gotten new messages I see :-) [[User:MichaelBillington|MichaelBillington]] 06:57, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

== Please comment or vote... ==

[[Wikibooks:Request for enabling special:import]]

This would make the transwiki of recipes from en.wp a lot easier (recipes seem to make up the majority of [[w:Category:Copy to Wikibooks]]). The folks at meta have asked for a show of local support for turning it on. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:10, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

==Sorry... one more vote please?==

One more thing to smooth out the transwiki process... [[Wikibooks:Request_for_enabling_special:import#Additional_request]].

: Give it a try. It's easy enough if you have a nix system and the basic tools (lynx, grep, and sed). It'll format everything automagically for you.

== Cookbook category order ==

G'day mate, I [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents#Category sort enhancement request|recently]] added the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word to some of the Cookbook templates, so you no longer need to specify the sort for most pages. For those that you do, e.g. non-ANSI page name, you should specify it as a parameter to the template, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe|Aebleskiver}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:56, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

== Introduction to the Invertebrate Zoology Study Guide == 

This ''Study Guide to Invertebrate Zoology'' is a textbook at '''''Wikibooks''''' shelved at the [[Wikibooks:biology bookshelf|biology bookshelf]] section and intended to establish a course of study in the subject of Invertebrate Zoology, mostly utilizing articles found in '''''[http://www.Wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]''''', with links to other relevant web sites as appropriate. In some cases, portions of the text from  ''Wikipedia'' articles have been used to materially develop introductory text within the Guide.      

For the new user, it need be pointed out that ''Wikipedia'' differs from a standard encyclopedia in two important respects: 1) it is a '''hypertext''' document, and 2) it is open and editable, and therefore '''constantly changing'''. For the student following this or any guide through ''Wikipedia'' to cover a specific subject, it is recommended that each article (page) be read first in its entirety, before any hyperlinks are followed to other topics or explanations.  It is too easy, otherwise, to simply become lost in a maze of links, and miss the main thrust of an article presented as an assignment from the Guide.  Because ''Wikipedia'' is constantly changing (and, it is hoped, improving) the quality of each article encountered will be variable.  Some articles are well written and go to adequate depth, whereas others, lacking a proponent, are shallow and incomplete. This short-coming should diminish with time, but can be a problem.  

One clear advantage to using this Guide linked to a hypertext like ''Wikipedia'' is the &quot;circular redundancy with serendipity&quot; factor that arises when an article is read and its hyperlinks followed; this factor can be a powerful learning tool. The persistent reader is  subjected to a fairly high degree of repetitive reading, often presenting slightly different perspectives on the same general topic, with the result that learning comes from redundancy. At the same time, some hyperlinks lead down less relevant paths, bringing new and unanticipated knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This study guide to invertebrate zoology is a textbook at ''Wikibooks'' filed under [[Subject:Zoology|Zoology]] and intended to establish a course of study in the subject of Invertebrate Zoology, mostly utilizing articles found in ''[[w:|Wikipedia]]'', with links to other relevant web sites as appropriate. Contributors are encouraged to spend time developing the relevant articles at ''Wikipedia'', maintaining this textbook as a ''guide'' to those articles. At some future time, it may be desirable to simply import whole articles over to build a Zoology textbook rather than a &quot;guide book&quot;, however the present approach seems to be a good one for getting a useful text at ''Wikibooks'' based upon the initial author's experience with ''[[Botany]]''.  Another Wikibook, ''[[Ecology]]'', follows a similar approach, but requires more text per page, because of less congruence between chapter material and articles at ''Wikipedia''. 

The contributors to this book included:

*[[w:user:Marshman|Eric Guinther]], biologist and environmental consultant living in Kaneohe, Hawaii envisioned this &quot;project&quot; and developed the approach.
*[[User:AFriedman|AFriedman]] ([[User talk:AFriedman|talk]]), a User who also performs research in this field on [[v:User:AFriedman|Wikiversity]]

Allgemeine Richtlinien:

Der Plan ist, von der alten Methode, LaTeX zu erläutern, wegzukommen.  Der ganze historische Ballast wird sofort aufgegeben.  Das heißt z.B.:


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Ja
! Nein
|-
| Editor in den Vordergund stellen
| Das (La)TeX-Programm in den Vordergrund stellen
|-
| Heutige &quot;best common practice&quot;
| Darstellung veralteter Methoden und Pakete
|-
| Allgemein bekannte Layout-Elemente
| Feinheiten der Typographie, z.B. Ligaturen
|-
| Plakative Darstellung || Hintergrundwissen
|-
|-
| Konzentration auf Windows || Besprechung aller Plattformen
|-
| Klare Software-Liste
| Software-Liste mit etlichen Alternativen
|-
| PDF || DVI/PS
|-
| Times &amp; Co. || Computer Modern
|-
| KOMA-Script || Standard-Klassen
|-
| inputenc, T1 || &lt;tt&gt;&quot;u&lt;/tt&gt; etc., OT1
|-
| Babel || german.sty
|-
| Syntax-Highlighting || Einfache Schreibmaschinenschrift
|}

Die Hoffnung ist, dadurch einen maximal effektiven Einstieg zu ermöglichen.  Es ist eine ''Einführung'' (&quot;Tutorial&quot;) und kein Lehrbuch, das dem Anspruch der Umfassendheit genügen will.

Es soll aber ein in sich geschlossenes Büchlein darstellen.  Die typischen Elemente eines Dokuments sollen abgedeckt werden.

&lt;/div&gt;

=Was ist LaTeX?=

LaTeX ist ein Computer-Programm, mit dem man Texte schreiben kann.  Seien es kurze Memos, Briefe, längere Berichte, Studienarbeiten oder auch ganze Bücher: LaTeX kommt mit nahezu allen Textsorten problemlos zurecht.  Für jeden dieser Fälle garantiert LaTeX ein professionelles, perfekt gestaltetes Layout.

LaTeX legt dabei besonderen Wert auf drei Dinge:
# Bei der Eingabe des Textes soll sich der Autor voll auf seinen Text konzentrieren können, und nicht von Layout-Einstellungen, Seitenumbrüchen oder ähnlichem abgelenkt werden.
# Beim Druck oder der Bildschirmdarstellung des Textes wird bestmögliche Qualität abgeliefert, selbst wenn der Autor von solchen Dingen keine oder kaum Ahnung hat.  Es wird dabei ein Niveau erreicht, das beispielsweise mit Word nicht zu realisieren ist.
# Zuverlässigkeit.  Der Kern des LaTeX-Systems gilt als einer der stabilsten und bugfreiesten überhaupt.  Selbst bei sehr komplexen Dokumenten, z.B. mit vielen Grafiken und Tabellen, bleibt das Programm belastbar und schnell.

Soweit es das Erzeugen von Dokumenten angeht, ist LaTeX ein vollwertiger Ersatz für Textverarbeitungsprogramme wie Word.  Es ist alles dabei, was das Herz begehrt: Formatierung, Schriftarten, Grafiken, Tabellen, Aufzählungen, Fußnoten, Querverweise, Rechtschreib-Kontrolle, automatische Verzeichnisse, etc.

Es gibt sogar einige Dinge, die LaTeX den meisten anderen Programmen voraus hat.  Zwei Beispiele:
* LaTeX kann selbstständig für alle Abbildungen und Tabellen des Dokumentes die bestmöglichen Plätze suchen.  Obwohl der Autor das auch überstimmen kann, lernt man diese Hilfe schnell zu schätzen.
* Leute, die ihren Dokumenten Literaturverzeichnisse anfügen müssen, können das zu einem guten Stück automatisch durch LaTeX erledigen lassen.

==Kein WYSIWYG==

In Word tippt man seinen Text, und man sieht ihn dabei auf dem Bildschirm genau so, wie er später aus dem Drucker kommt.  Man nennt diese Technik &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;. Es ist eine komfortable Möglichkeit der Texteingabe.

LaTeX geht dennoch einen anderen Weg.  Man tippt seinen Text, sieht dabei jedoch nur ''Inhalt'' und ''Struktur'' (Gliederung) des Textes.  Es fehlen also Dinge wie Schriftarten, Seitenumbrüche oder Zeichenabstand.  Das ist zwar spartanisch, reicht aber völlig aus, um den Text zu bearbeiten.  Keine Sorge: Es genügt ein Tastendruck, um jederzeit ein Vorschau-Fenster zu aktualisieren, in dem das Endergebnis absolut verbindlich dargestellt wird, und zwar noch akkurater als mit Word.

Das ist quasi eine Not, aus der LaTeX eine Tugend macht.  Zum einen ist der Verzicht auf WISYWIG ein wichtiger Grund für die Zuverlässigkeit von LaTeX. WYSIWYG ist nämlich eine sehr aufwendige und daher etwas anfällige Technik.  Zum anderen hat so der Autor seine Ruhe vor Layout-Fragen.  Wenn man will, kann man zwar auch mit LaTeX das Layout nahezu beliebig beeinflussen.  Aber wenn nicht, sorgen die Vorgaben der Profis, die LaTeX gemacht haben, für ein hervorragendes Resultat.

=Die Installation unter Windows=

Wir werden in diesem Abschnitt erfahren, wo man LaTeX herbekommt und wie man es unter Windows installiert.  Wenn man erst mal schauen möchte, wie LaTeX ungefähr funktioniert, kann man auch vorerst diesen Abschnitt überspringen und mit dem nächsten, &quot;Das erste Dokument&quot;, weitermachen.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: orange; padding: 0.5em&quot;&gt;
# Bezugsquellen (Downloads, Bestellen; muß eventuell mit dem Folgenden verquickt werden)
# Software:
#* Acrobat Reader
#* Ghostscript/GSView
#* MikTeX (full)
#* TeXnicCenter
# Knappe Beschreibung der Installation, ohne Alternativen zu nennen.
&lt;/div&gt;

=Das erste Dokument=

==Erste Schritte==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: orange; padding: 0.5em&quot;&gt;
Grundsätzliches zum Handling des Editors
&lt;/div&gt;

Um endlich mal konkret zu werden, gibt man folgendes Dokument in den Editor ein&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;
&lt;div style=&quot;background: lightgray&quot;&gt;
 \documentclass{scrartcl}       % Wir brauchen keine Kapitel
 \usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
 \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
 \usepackage{graphicx,mathptmx,courier,textcomp,booktabs}
 \usepackage[scaled]{helvet}

 \usepackage[ngerman]{babel}    % Neue deutsche Rechtschreibung


 \begin{document}               % Hier geht der eigentliche Text los

 Hallo! Dies ist der erste Absatz dieses einfachen Textes.  Ich muß
 jetzt hier ein wenig herumlabern, um ihn ein wenig länger zu
 bekommen, sonst kann man nachher nicht so schön sehen, wo der eine
 Absatz aufhört und wo der andere anfängt.

 Dies ist der zweite und letzte Absatz.

 \end{document}                 % Und hier hört er auf
&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;und drückt und F7 und&amp;nbsp;F5.  Es öffnet sich ein Fenster, in
dem man den Text so sehen kann, wie er auch später aus dem Drucker kommen wird.

Aber was bedeutet das, was wir gerade getippt haben?  Die allererste Zeile ist
 \documentclass{scrartcl}
und sie besagt, dass unser Text keine Kapitel benötigt.  Die Alternative wäre
gewesen, stattdessen
 \documentclass{scrbook}
zu schreiben.  Dann hätte unser Dokument Kapitel haben können.  Die folgenden vier Zeilen sagen LaTeX unter anderem, daß wir Windows benutzen.  Es leider nötig, es einzufügen, aber unnötig, seine genaue Bedeutung zu kennen. Glücklicherweise muß man es nur einmal pro Dokument eingeben, und man kann es aus einem anderen Dokument herauskopieren.

==Die Anatomie eines LaTeX-Befehls==

Die überwiegende Zeit tippt man einfach seinen Text, egal, welches Programm man dafür benutzt.  Aber manchmal muß man seinen Schreibfluß unterbrechen, z.B. weil ein neuer Abschnitt beginnen soll, oder weil man eine Grafik einfügen möchte.  In Word muß man dann auf Icons klicken, Menüpunkte anwählen oder Tastenkürzel benutzen.  In LaTeX fügt man ''Befehle'' und ''Umgebungen'' ein. Diese Befehle und Umgebungen kann man mit seinem Text zusammen im Editor-Fenster sehen.  Der Editor färbt sie zur besseren Übersicht blau ein.

Fangen wir mit den Befehlen an.  Unser kleines LaTeX-Beispiel beginnt mit
 \documentclass{scrartcl}
Das ist ein typischer LaTeX-Befehl.  Er sagt aus, daß wir einen Text ohne Kapitel schreiben wollen. Ein LaTeX-Befehl hat immer den folgenden Aufbau:
# Er beginnt mit einem umgekehrten Schrägstrich&amp;nbsp;&quot;\&quot;, einem sogenannten &quot;Backslash&quot;.
# Dann folgt der Name des Befehls, z.B. &quot;documentclass&quot; für &quot;Die Klasse des Dokumentes&quot;.
# Als letztes kommen zusätzliche Angaben, die sogenannten ''Parameter''.  Sie stehen jeweils in geschweiften Klammern &lt;tt&gt;{...}&lt;/tt&gt;, und es können keiner, ein, zwei oder manchmal noch mehr für einen Befehl sein.  Mehr als zwei ist aber extrem selten.  Unser Beispiel-Befehl hat nur einen Parameter, nämlich eben das Kürzel &quot;scrartcl&quot;.

Die zweite Gattung von sonderbaren Dingen in LaTeX-Texten sind die ''Umgebungen''.  Umgebungen klammern einen Textes ein.  Unser Beispiel-Dokument von vorhin enthält genau eine Umgebung, und es ist sogar die wichtigste:
 \begin{document}
  ...
 \end{document}
Die &lt;tt&gt;document&lt;/tt&gt;-Umgebung enthält das ganze Dokument.  Jede Umgebung beginnt mit
 \begin{Umgebungsname}
und endet mit
 \end{Umgebungsname}
Ganz selten haben auch Umgebungen Parameter.  Die stehen dann hinter dem &lt;tt&gt;\begin{...}&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[LaTeX-Schnellkurs]]?  Nachtrag: Habe jetzt unter [[LaTeX-Schnellkurs]] mit dem Projekt begonnen. &amp;#8211; [[User:217.1.206.25|217.1.206.25]] 09:59, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Weil solche Projekte, wenn sie zu früh an die große Glocke gehangen werden, schnell zerfleddert werden.  Erst recht, wenn es derart unorthodox ist.  Die Idee dazu entstand gesten bei einem Abendessen, und es ist geplant, das ganze fühestens im April mit Anfängern im Rahmen einer Einführungsveranstaltung auszuprobieren.  Dann wird sich zeigen, ob das Konzept brauchbar ist.

:Nimm dir zum Beispiel deine MacOS-Erweiterung in deinem Schnellkurs: Das ist sicher löblich und kompetent geschrieben, aber dann mußt du im folgenden wieder ''zwei'' Editoren (oder einen generischen) beschreiben, was ein Anfänger gar nicht gerne hat. &amp;ndash; [[User:Bronger|Torsten Bronger]] 10:52, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::Habe ich mir auch überlegt, aber durch TeXShop gibt es auf einmal soviele Apple-Anwender, die mit TeX anfangen wollen, daß es irgenwie schade wäre, wenn man denen nicht einen möglichst einfachen TeX-Einstieg anbieten könnte. Man kann ja im Hauptverlauf den Vorgang unter Windows beschreiben und nur auf das Wikibooks-Modul verweisen, das den Vorgang unter Mac OS X erklärt. Eine andere Variante wäre: zwei Inhaltsverzeichnisse, die auf die jeweils richtigen Module verweisen. Was hältst Du denn davon? [[User:217.1.206.25|217.1.206.25]] 11:01, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC) 

:::Beides sind interessante Ideen.  Man sollte versuchen, dort, wo es nicht unbedingt nötig ist, auf Screenshots und direkte Erwähnung von TeXnicCenter-Funktionen zu verzichten.  Dadurch hielte man die Zahl der auszutauschenden Module minimal.  Leicht wird das aber nicht.  Es ist ja nicht nur mit der Beschreibung der Editor-Grundfunktionen getan.  Auch die PDF-Erzeugung, die Behandlung von Kompilierfehlern sowie die Schnellvorschau sind vom OS abhängig. &amp;ndash; [[User:Bronger|Torsten Bronger]] 11:26, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Deine Konzeption gefällt mir gut. Besonderen Wert würde ich auf ausführlich kommentierte Musterdokumente legen. &amp;#8211; [[User:217.1.206.25|217.1.206.25]] 10:02, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Das ist sicher eine gute Sache. &amp;ndash; [[User:Bronger|Torsten Bronger]] 10:52, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Ein paar einfache Musterdokumente könnte ich auch beisteuern (scrlttr2 &amp; g-brief), ich müsste sie nur noch kommentieren, dürfte aber machbar sein (meine eigenen Anfänge liegen schließlich noch nicht allzu weit zurück). Auch ein längeres Fanfic (knapp 30 Seiten) würde ich eventuell hergeben, ist aber eben 99% Text und kaum LaTeX. Bei Windows-spezifischen Dingen kann ich aber nicht helfen, davon habe ich keine Ahnung.


::Das Projekt lebt nun bei [http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-tutorium], weil es dort CVS-Zugriff gibt.  Ich bin aber gerne bereit, zum Wikibooks-LaTeX-Projekt beizusteuern.  Es ist bereits seit seinem Bestehen auf meiner Watchlist.</text>

= Los tiempos de los verbos: por modos =

Gramatically, there are different ways of classifying Spanish verb forms (as well as the verbs of any language). The one most people understand is &quot;tense&quot;, but another very important classification is the &quot;mood.&quot; A &quot;mood&quot; is differentiated from a &quot;tense&quot; in that it does not express time per se (which is what &quot;tense&quot; really means). Unfortunately, &quot;mood&quot; is not really a very good name either because moods do not express moods of the speaker (happy, sad, etc.) The mood is used to classify how the verb is used grammatically in the sentence; that is, how the verb usage works together with the other parts of the sentence. Spanish has the following verb moods:

* Indicative (indicativo): Used to express statements of fact as the main verb of a clause
* Participial (participio, gerundio): Used to convert a verb into a noun or adjective to express not actions but rather qualities or objects related to the verb
* Conditional (potencial): Used together with other clauses to indicate a potential fact.
* Subjunctive (subjuntivo): Used together with a main clause to indicate that the subordinate clause is somehow under discussion (mooted).
* Imperative (imperativo): Used to express a direct command.

In many cases, along with the name of the mood also goes a tense. A given form of a verb normally has both mood and tense, although when the mood is indicative usually the name of the mood is not stated. This is one thing that makes the concept of moods hard to understand. When we talk about the &quot;present tense&quot; of a verb, we really should say &quot;indicative mood, present tense&quot;. This would make it clear that when we say &quot;subjunctive mood, present tense&quot; we're not dealing with anything particularly strange, only a little different.

The imperfect tense communicates:
* continuing past events (translates English ''was/were __ing'')
* customary, habitual events in the past
* planned future events

Verbs are conjugated to the imperfect by taking off the last two letters of the [[../Infinitive|infinitive]] and replacing them with an ending based on '''-ía''' or '''-aba'''. 

==Conjugating regular verbs in the imperfect==
This is probably the easiest verb tense to conjugate.

-AR verbs take on the -aba endings. Here is an example:

'''Bailar''' (to dance)

''' bailaba:''' I danced&lt;br&gt;
''' bailabas:'''  you danced&lt;br&gt;
''' bailaba:'''  he, she, it, you (formal) danced&lt;br&gt;
''' bailábamos:''' we danced &lt;br&gt;
''' bailabais:''' you danced &lt;br&gt;
''' bailaban:''' they, you (plural, formal) danced &lt;br&gt;

-IR and -ER verbs take on -ía endings. Examples:

'''Venir''' (to come)

''' venía: ''' I came &lt;br&gt;
''' venías: ''' you came &lt;br&gt;
''' venía: ''' he, she, it, you came &lt;br&gt;
''' veníamos: ''' we came &lt;br&gt;
''' veníais: ''' you came&lt;br&gt;
''' venían: ''' they, you (formal) came &lt;br&gt;

'''Comer''' (to eat)

'''comía:''' I ate &lt;br&gt;
'''comías:''' you ate &lt;br&gt;
'''comía:''' he, she, it, you ate &lt;br&gt;
'''comíamos:''' we ate &lt;br&gt;
'''comíais:''' you ate&lt;br&gt;
'''comían:''' they, you (formal) ate &lt;br&gt;

==Irregular verbs==
There are only three.

'''Ser''' (to be)

'''era:''' I was &lt;br&gt;
'''eras:''' you were &lt;br&gt;
'''era:''' he, she, it was, you were &lt;br&gt;
'''éramos:''' we were &lt;br&gt;
'''erais:''' you were &lt;br&gt;
'''eran:''' they were &lt;br&gt;

Notice the accent in the &quot;nosotros&quot; form of &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;ir.&quot;

'''Ir''' (to go)

'''iba:''' I used to go&lt;br&gt;
'''ibas:''' you used to go &lt;br&gt;
'''iba:''' he, she, it, you used to go &lt;br&gt;
'''íbamos:''' we used to go &lt;br&gt;
'''ibais:''' you used to go &lt;br&gt;
'''iban:''' they used to go &lt;br&gt;

'''Ver''' (to see)

'''veía:''' I used to see&lt;br&gt;
'''veías:''' you used to see &lt;br&gt;
'''veía:''' he, she, it, you used to see &lt;br&gt;
'''veíamos:''' we used to see&lt;br&gt;
'''veíais:''' you used to see&lt;br&gt;
'''veían:''' they used to see &lt;br&gt;


That's it!  Those are '''all''' the irregulars.

The preterite verb form describes past actions that have begun or completed.  The preterite sets something in the past as an event, with a beginning and an end.  Spanish has another past tense form, the [[../Imperfect|imperfect]], that is used for past actions that are continuing, or for which its beginning or its end is not important.

==Conjugate regular verbs in the preterite==
'''-AR verbs'''

Eliminate the &quot;-ar&quot; and replace it with one of the following endings:

-é &lt;br&gt; 
-aste &lt;br&gt; 
-ó &lt;br&gt; 
-amos &lt;br&gt; 
-asteis&lt;br&gt;
-aron &lt;br&gt; 

Patinar (to skate) becomes:

'''patiné:''' I skated &lt;br&gt;
'''patinaste:''' you skated &lt;br&gt;
'''patinó:''' he skated &lt;br&gt;
'''patinamos:''' we skated &lt;br&gt;
'''patinasteis:''' you skated&lt;br&gt;
'''patinaron:''' they skated &lt;br&gt;

Notice that the &quot;nosotros&quot; form conjugates the same as it does in the present tense. This can cause confusion so look for context tools to make sure you have the right tense.

'''-ER and -IR verbs'''

Eliminate the &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot; and replace it with one of the following endings:

-í &lt;br&gt;
-iste &lt;br&gt;
-ió &lt;br&gt; 
-imos &lt;br&gt; 
-isteis&lt;br&gt;
-ieron &lt;br&gt; 

Vender (to sell) becomes:

'''vendí:''' I sold &lt;br&gt;
'''vendiste:''' you sold &lt;br&gt;
'''vendió:''' he sold &lt;br&gt;
'''vendimos:''' we sold &lt;br&gt;
'''vendisteis:''' you sold &lt;br&gt;
'''vendieron:''' they sold &lt;br&gt;

==Conjugate irregular verbs in the preterite==
There are 2 types of irregular verbs in the preterite tense. We will start with the more regular of the 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The endings of these irregulars are all the same, which is why I am referring to them as more regular. The endings are:&lt;br&gt;
-e&lt;br&gt;
-iste&lt;br&gt;
-o&lt;br&gt;
-imos&lt;br&gt;
-isteis&lt;br&gt;
-ieron&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The stems of these verbs also change as follows:&lt;br&gt;
estar --&gt; estuv&lt;br&gt;
andar --&gt; anduv&lt;br&gt;
tener --&gt; tuv&lt;br&gt;
poder --&gt; pud&lt;br&gt;
poner --&gt; pus&lt;br&gt;
saber --&gt; sup&lt;br&gt;
caber --&gt; cup&lt;br&gt;
hacer --&gt; hic (exception: 'hi'''z'''o')&lt;br&gt; 
venir --&gt; vin&lt;br&gt;
querer --&gt; quis&lt;br&gt;
decir --&gt; dij&lt;br&gt;
traer --&gt; traj&lt;br&gt;
and any verb that ends in -ducir --&gt; -duj&lt;br&gt;
  Note that for stems ending in '''j''' the ending 'ieron' is shortened to 'eron'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The more irregular verbs conjugate as follows:&lt;br&gt;
'''&quot;Ir&quot; and &quot;Ser&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
fui&lt;br&gt;
fuiste&lt;br&gt;
fue&lt;br&gt;
fuimos&lt;br&gt;
fuisteis&lt;br&gt;
fueron&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''&quot;Dar&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
di&lt;br&gt;
diste&lt;br&gt;
dio&lt;br&gt;
dimos&lt;br&gt;
disteis&lt;br&gt;
dieron&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''&quot;Haber&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
hube&lt;br&gt;
hubiste&lt;br&gt;
hubo&lt;br&gt;
hubimos&lt;br&gt;
hubisteis&lt;br&gt;
hubieron&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''&quot;Reír&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
reí&lt;br&gt;
reíste&lt;br&gt;
rió&lt;br&gt;
reímos&lt;br&gt;
reísteis&lt;br&gt;
rieron&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''&quot;Leer&quot;''' (similarly Creer)&lt;br&gt;
leí&lt;br&gt;
leíste&lt;br&gt;
leyó&lt;br&gt;
leímos&lt;br&gt;
leísteis&lt;br&gt;
leyeron&lt;br&gt;


'''&quot;Dormir&quot;''' (similarly Morir)&lt;br&gt;
dormí&lt;br&gt;
dormiste&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;durm&lt;/u&gt;ió&lt;br&gt;
dormimos&lt;br&gt;
dormisteis&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;durm&lt;/u&gt;ieron&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''&quot;Ver&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
v&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
viste&lt;br&gt;
v&lt;u&gt;io&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
vimos&lt;br&gt;
visteis&lt;br&gt;
vieron&lt;br&gt;

&quot;He is running. They are dancing. I am liking ... &quot;

The above are examples of the present progressive tense, which is used for continuous actions that are taking place right now. This tense works the same way in English and in Spanish.

Take the verb &quot;to be&quot; (estar) and conjugate it in the [[../Present|present tense]], then add the [[../Present Participle|present participle]] on the tail end.

''' Estoy caminando.''' '' I am walking.'' &lt;br&gt;
''' Estamos jugando.''' '' We are playing.'' &lt;br&gt;
''' Estas fingiendo.''' '' You are faking.'' &lt;br&gt;

Running, jumping, skiing, thinking, talking, ...

Corriendo, brincando, esquiando, pensando, hablando ...

The present participle is formed by taking off the last two letters of a Spanish verb (-ar, -er, or -ir) and replacing it with -ando (-ar verbs) or -iendo (-er and -ir verbs). 

'''Estar''' &gt; '' estando'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Comer''' &gt; '' comiendo'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Ser''' &gt; '' siendo'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Contar''' &gt; '' contando'' &lt;br&gt;

The slightly irregular '''ir''' &gt; ''yendo''

The past participle in Spanish is usually the same as the past tense. I thought, I had thought. But sometimes it is the same. I broke, I had broken. In English it is a different conjugation as a rule. 

Take the -ar, -er, and -ir ending off of the [[../Infinitive|infinitive]] and replace it with '''-ado''' (-ar verbs) or '''-ido''' (-er and -ir verbs).

==Regular conjugation examples==
'''Pensar''' &gt;&gt; ''pensado''
'''Comer''' &gt;&gt; ''comido''
'''Venir''' &gt;&gt; ''venido''

==Irregular conjugation examples==
'''Romper''' &gt;&gt; ''roto''
'''Morir''' &gt;&gt; ''muerto''

I will think, he will shout, you will die, ...

Pensaré, gritará, morirás, ...

— '' or '' —

Voy a pensar, va a gritar, vas a morir, ...

There are two ways to comminicate future events in Spanish. In the first one, add an ending to the unchanged [[../Infinitive|infinitive]] form of the verb. These same endings are used for all three types of verbs (-AR, -ER and -IR), which makes learning them easier:

-é &lt;br&gt;
-ás &lt;br&gt;
-á &lt;br&gt;
-emos &lt;br&gt;
-án &lt;br&gt;

'''Pensaré:''' ''I will think'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Pensarás:''' ''you will think'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Pensará:''' ''it will think'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Pensaremos:''' ''we will think'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Pensarán:''' ''they will think'' &lt;br&gt;

'''Iré:''' ''I will go'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Irás:''' ''you will go'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Irá:''' ''she will go'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Iremos:''' ''we will go'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Irán:''' ''y'all will go'' &lt;br&gt;

There are 12 verbs which change their infinitives before adding the ending, and they can be classified into 3 catigories:
First, the &quot;drop 'e's&quot; are &quot;querer,&quot; &quot;poder,&quot; &quot;caber,&quot; &quot;haber,&quot; and &quot;saber.&quot; Each of these loses the 'e' before the final 'r' when forming the future tense. These can be remembered by the mnemonic &quot;'''Q'''uick '''P'''eople '''C'''an't '''H'''ave '''S'''ushi.&quot;
Next, the &quot;add 'd's&quot; are &quot;venir,&quot; &quot;valer,&quot; &quot;salir,&quot; &quot;tener,&quot; and &quot;poner.&quot; For these, the 2nd to last letter of the infinitive is replaced with a 'd'. These can be remembered by the mnemonic &quot;'''V'''room '''V'''room, '''S'''aid '''T'''he '''P'''orsche.&quot;
Finally, the verbs &quot;decir&quot; and &quot;hacer&quot; change their infinitives to &quot;dir&quot; and &quot;har&quot; respectively before adding the ending. These must simply be memorised.

The alternate way to describe the future is to use the [[../Present|present tense]] of &quot;[[../Ir|ir]],&quot; followed by the infinitive of the action verb.

'''Voy a saber:''' ''I am going to know'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Vas a mentir:''' ''You are going to lie'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Va a cazar:''' ''He/she is going to hunt'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Vamos a contar:''' ''We are going to count'' &lt;br&gt;
'''Van a poner:''' ''They are going to put'' &lt;br&gt;

Hey, i am not sure if the text u copied here is copyleft? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:07, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tomz. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tomz~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:48, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

Someone who is familiar with Wiktionary, please let me know if it would make any sense to try to link these verbs over to that site. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::I took a look at Wiktionary (Spanish). First of all, to link these to Wiktionary would be wicked tedious. Also, it isn't a bilingual dictionary (i.e. it gives the definitions in Spanish), which wouldn't be very useful to students. It appears however, that each verb has a table of its conjugations, which would be useful. It would be tedious, as I said, but doable (if we had multiple people working on it, of course). --[[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 18:43, 3 Jul 2005
:::I know the previous comments were written years ago, but you should know that each Wiktionary is ''multilingual'', meaning that if you want any word defined in English, you would look on the English Wiktionary, where Spanish words are also included. It would certainly make sense to have words link to Wiktionary. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 02:05, 26 November 2009 (UTC)
== Namespace? ==

I'm not very familiar with the organisation of Wikibooks, but wouldn't it be more logical if there was a namespace called Spanish and pages like this and Los Deportes were renamed 'Spanish:Lista de verbos' and Spanish:Vocabulario:Deportes etc? Is this easy to do? [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 10:42, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Update ==

I added some links at the bottom of the page to some Spanish verb books. --[[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 18:36, 3 Jul 2005</text>

      <comment>/* Removing Bicycle Pedals */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}
A pedal can be removed using a [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Tools and Supplies/Pedal Wrench|pedal wrench]] or, sometimes, an [[w:allen wrench |allen wrench]] if there is a hexagonal hole in the inside end of the pedal axle.  A normal open end spanner/wrench will work on some pedals; an adjustable spanner/wrench spanner will typically not work, because the head is too wide to fit between the pedal and the crank.  A good shop-quality pedal wrench will also be longer than these, for the required leverage. This leverage is also the limiting factor for the use of allen wrenches in this application.

[[Image:Close up of scratches from adjustable spanner.jpg|thumb|right|Be careful not to scratch the crank arm if you ''do'' use a normal spanner.]]If a normal spanner is all that you have (be it adjustable or not) then you may find that pedal removal is possible, especially if you are removing platform style pedals&amp;mdash;these generally have larger lands for the spanner.  Just take care not to scratch or gouge the crank arm (see photo at right). Position an adjustable wrench so that, when turned, the adjustable jaw is on the &quot;inside&quot; of the turn.

Usually, you should position the wrench as close to overlapping the crankarm as possible. (So that it is in front of the arm, not extending its line.) Before attempting to remove the right side pedal, make sure the chain is on the largest gear. (That way, if you slip, you'll have a more difficult time impaling yourself on the sharp chainring teeth.)

(Usually the left and right pedals are marked with an &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot; on the end to make identification easy.)

===Removing Bicycle Pedals===
#The left pedal (for left foot) has a [[w:Screw thread#Handedness|left-hand thread]] ''i.e.'' it unscrews in the opposite direction to most threads (to unscrew it, you have to turn it clockwise). Left and right side pedals have opposite threads.  The right hand, drive side, pedal is right hand (normal) thread; the left hand, non-drive side, pedal is left hand (reverse) thread.  &lt;u&gt;There is an easy way to remember the directions, with the wrench located on the pedal nut and projecting vertically above it, always push the lever of the wrench toward the rear of the bicycle to loosen that pedal; this works on either side.&lt;/u&gt;  The natural motion of the pedal (which is counter-clockwise) will unscrew the left pedal if it is not left-handed.
#Pedals, especially when they have not been removed in a long time, can be very ''tight''. It is important to apply grease to the threads before reassembly, to facilitate the next disassembly. Doubly so if the parts will be in a corrosive environment. (Salted roads, near saltwater, etc.)  Any general purpose grease is acceptable. Without grease, pedals are very likely to become seized later and make for troublesome removal.

Note that there are two sizes of pedal axles in common, current-day use: 1/2 inch diameter for the [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Cranks#One piece|one piece cranks]] typically found on children's bikes and older American-made bikes, and 9/16 inch diameter for the two and [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Cranks#Cotterless|three piece cranks]] found on most modern adult bikes. Both sizes have [[w:United States Standard thread#History and use|SAE threads]] at 20 tracks per inch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thread locking compound is an adhesive designed to prevent parts from vibrating loose. Some brand names are Loc-Tite&amp;reg; and Permatex&amp;reg;. A light duty compound will be removable with simple hand tools. Heavier duty may require special equipment such as a heat gun.
There are three standard Loctite grades

* Blue Removable No.242 which is applied to fasteners that you may want to unscrew easily. 
* Red High-Strength No.271 which is applied to fasteners that you seldom need to remove. 
*Green is a wicking grade of Loc-Tite&amp;reg; used on joints which have already been assembled
Loctite was invented in 1953 by Vernon Krieble, PhD. It is described as an anaerobic sealant. In other words, it sets without air. To set it must be in the presence of metal ions and the absence of oxygen. this allows it to set properly inside an assembled fastening.

Hey all -- I've just expanded out the main page a little, since I thought that more topics should be discussed beyond simple greetings.  I have set out a tentative structure for a wider treatment of chinese which is probably most useful for a beginner to learn. The idea of the &quot;Exercises&quot; which I added to Chapter One is to set out a few questions for students to work through according possibly to a corresponding lesson, with example solutions given at the end or on a separate page, although possibly this is more in the domain of Wikiversity. --[[User:ConfusedGremlin|Gremlin]] 29 December 2006

:I moved all the new lesson ideas to the [[Chinese/Planning#Subjects_Areas_to_Cover|Chinese/Planning]] page for now. They're good ideas, but need to be more smoothly integrated with the book I think. Instead of making new headings for each chapter, I think it would be best to enter them all under the Lessons heading in the format already used. I think it's time for some of the later chapters listed to be renamed to subjects areas like the ones you added, but the old content should be moved first, maybe to a subpage of the Planning page. That's why I didn't do all that just now. Sometime soon. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 05:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

::Sorry for the very late response. Thanks for the positive feedback. It was a good idea to move my ideas to the planning page, since afterall they were only intended as a sketch of what could be done.  I might return and help out again when I can find the time. --[[User:ConfusedGremlin|Gremlin]] 4 February 2007

A new [[Cantonese: Contents|Cantonese]] book has just started up.  If there are any Cantonese-speaking contributors in this crowd, we'd appreciate your help on the Cantonese book as well.  Thanks!
--[[User:Xingmu|Alissa]] 07:45, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

You may also want to check out [[Spanish]] which I have just organized, simplified and improved. Hope you don't mind I changed the splash image into a link to the contents page. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Not at all -- this is a collective effort, so any and all help to further improve upon what is existent would be appreciated. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Does anyone else plan on adding more to this Wikibook? I would like some collaboration on this, as one person's work will ultimately yield errors at some point or another. Yacht/Gboy? -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

:Hey, Taoster! u guys r so cool! when I came back here, I found out a lot of contents have already been added. :) About the textbook, I would like to help, but I know little about what other Chinese textbooks for English speakers are like, I want to check out some examples first. BTW, r u mandarin speaker?
:And, here is my opinion: I don't think it's good to introduce the grammar at the very begining lessons, which would make learners boring. What do u think? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:31, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::BTW, shall we make a note that this textbook is in Simplified Chinese? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:45, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)

This is a very good textbook on chinese! Keep up the good work guys, it's good to be able to have access to comprehensive texts like these for people with little money :)

I suggest writing the pinyin using the tone markings on the letters instead of with numbers.  It would look a little cleaner and be easier to read.

It is great that someone does this stuff!  I learned how cool Chinese can be.  Keep up the good work.  The only thing is that I would like to see section 5, and 6 done.
== couple of things ==

Couple of things I'd like to say after writing a bit on pronunciation and lesson 1:

* What's the purpose of &quot;Fundamentals&quot;? As far as I can see, it duplicates content that belongs elsewhere.
* The current material introduces things too fast, too much... I've tried to cut this down by reducing the dialogue in Lesson 1 to just a few sentence structures. The result is a rather idiotic conversation but I don't think that can be helped.
* Pinyin: currently we're using Unicode for pinyin. Does anyone think we should switch to using numbers for the tones?
: I feel that using numbers for tones is not a good idea because it looks clunky and to me seems more difficult to read.  Think of the tone marks like the special letter marks in French.

That's about it for now. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 05:23, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Simplified and Traditional Chinese mixed up! ==
I am not doing this to the tradition Chinese, but the mixed-up is really ugly, and confusing. i don't think it's good for the learners. We need separate textbook for the needs of different learners. Mixing up is not a good option. Maybe we need to set up a [[Simplified Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Traditional Mandarin Chinese]] respectively. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 18:39, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)

They're parallel to eachother, but I wouldn't say it's harder to learn. I think that people can just disregard the one that they don't plan on learning. As well, they're just simplifications of chars, you could probably run a script to convert a text from trad to simplified or vice versa.
: TC &gt; SC is problematic. eg ?? vs. ??. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 23:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

I like having both, since it is nice for learners that learn how to write one system, but perhaps only learn charater recognition of the other system.

i also like having both. on the mainland TC is often used in business/school names. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 23:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

:I've thought on this quite a bit. I've seen books that:
::#have the traditional for lesson texts only, as an insert or in the back of the book
::#acknowledge the traditional, but just in the vocab section
::#have simplified/traditional/pinyin/english for everything
::#have traditional on the left page--simplified for the right, all the way through the book
::#or totally ignore the other character set
:In my opinion, #2 would be the best trade-off with making the book less cluttered but still friendly to familiarization with the alternate character set. However, since it is a Wikibook, I think it's inevitable that people will volunteer the translations (as in fact happened), converting us to the #3 type. This makes me want to lean towards the #4 type with parallel texts. Especially after having tried using traditional while using an exclusively simplified book, I think having the two is necessary. 

:I think the best way to implement it would be making subpages with traditional in the form of Chinese/Lesson_1/traditional and just keeping the content all the same, which is easy enough. We can make a traditional Table of Contents template to make the traditional easy to navigate, and, being subpages, there's the automatic linking back to the simplified pages all the time. What does everyone think? --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 09:13, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
::I finally made the subpages change a few days ago. I think things look much neater without a simplified/traditional translation of ''everything''. However I did leave the alternatives in for the dialogues and for the vocab lists so that readers can get to where they recognize the other set, but don't have it cluttering up every example sentence.
:::--[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 17:05, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

== a proposed new outline ==
is [[Chinese: Contents/Temp|here]], check that out. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 08:08, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Chinese Writing ==
Shouldn't the writing system be a wikibook of its own? If it's combined with Mandarin it is hard to reference to here for other Chinese languages (eg. Cantonese) which uses the same system?
:I definitely think this wikibook needs to contain sections on how to write the characters learned in the dialogue.  That means means some text gets duplicated between the two, but in my opinion a language textbook needs to have a holistic approach to its subject matter.[[User:Rycanada|Rycanada]] 21:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

It would be nice to add audio recordings of the texts. It is very hard to understand the pronounciation just from the transscript.
:Completely agree—for Chinese, I feel that audio is a must.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 22:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
::I'm working on including audio, linking the vocab lists to all the Wikicommons recordings available (current total: 3). I've put in a request with one of the recorders to do more to fill out our lessons, though I haven't heard back from him. When I find time I'll try to record them myself if need be, though they'll just be standins until a native speaker takes on the task. Eventually, whole dialogues could be recorded, even the grammar could be recorded as in the [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia|Spoken Wikipedia]].

== Naming Policy ==

I'm going to start converting the Chinese textbook to conform with the new &quot;slash convention&quot; recommended for new wikibooks in [[WB:NP|Wikibooks Naming Policy]] as opposed to the now obsolete [[WB:NC|Wikibooks Naming Conventions]] we're currently using. The MediaWiki software will make automatic links back to main page from all subpages (i.e. - [[Chinese|&lt;&amp;nbsp;Chinese]]), simplifying organization. Additionally, the slash convention could be used to easily expand in a logical heirarchy, as shown below. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 03:43, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

**Chinese/Pronunciation
**Chinese/Lesson 1
***Chinese/Lesson 1/Stroke Order

== More useful media! ==

The podcast, [http://www.chinesepod.com/ chinesepod] has lessons in audio, and they are CC-by, which is completely wikimedia-compatible.  Should we try to integrate them into the wikibook somehow?  We'll need to convert them to .ogg of course.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

== Disentangling Traditional and Simplified ==

Thanks for everyone's hard work!  This is a fantastic resource.

I was just wondering, if there is a separate Traditional wikiproject, why do the lessons have both Simplified and Traditional characters in them?  

I've taken a short (4 month, 3 hours a week) course on Mandarin Chinese, so I've covered a lot of the same material that this has... but I find my textbook much easier to follow simply because my eyes wander over to the traditional version of the dialogue.  [[User:Rycanada|Rycanada]] 21:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:(Oh, there is one exception to the Simplified-only rule in my textbook: There is a guide to writing characters at the end of each section, and that section contains traditional versions as well as simplified). [[User:Rycanada|Rycanada]] 21:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Traditional / Simplified split is not working ==

The Traditional and Simplified versions should '''not have been split up'''! Now we have two parallel wikibooks teaching precisely the same topics except for a split in orthography, which '''doubles our workload'''. Changes and corrections made to one wikibook has to be made to the other one as well, which also '''doubles our workload'''. Moreover, it's inevitable that people will make changes or additions to one wikibook but neglect / forget to do it to the other, which '''splits our efforts''' and results in '''forking'''. Considering how stalled this wikibook already is, it is not helpful to split up what little we already have.

Moreover, it is '''not hard''' to teach two systems at the same time. In fact, I think it is a '''disservice''' to potential students if we don't show them both systems: many Chinese programs in fact do teach both systems simultaneously, with the expectation that students will learn to write one and read the other. Teaching two systems simultaneously '''does not take up that much space''' even, so why have we stopped doing it?

In short, I see huge problems and little advantage with this current split into Traditional and Simplified. If there are no objections, I will re-merge them together.

==More reading passages?==
This textbook is so far very elementary. I'm wondering if there should be more offered... maybe reading passages for slightly more advanced students? harder vocabulary lists from those reading passages? All of the chinese language textbooks (from china) that I've ever seen are structured that way. 
I would offer to write the passages but I am not a very good writer and my writing in chinese is even worse. However, I will volunteer to read and record passages. I am fluent in speaking and chinese is my first language.
[[User:Blacksheepmails|Blacksheepmails]] 04:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:The text may be elementary, but I don't think a new student would find anything about it too easy, what with studying grammar, pronunciation and writing simultaneously. It's a real struggle making everything gradual enough. We need to introduce useful vocab slowly so as to not overwhelm students with too many words a lesson. I've used books where the new vocab would vary from 40&amp;ndash;90 per lesson, and it was not fun.

:I'm wary too about adding reading passages with a lot of &quot;supplemental&quot; vocab words that won't be properly reinforced. Nevertheless, I think some extra passages could be good every few lessons. Most textbooks I've seen do that and it could be good for an occasional challenge and review without being intimidating. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 11:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

::Yes, the reading passages should be occasional. But also, not everyone using wikibooks will be a complete beginner. I came here first to learn spanish, which I have been learning for a while now.[[User:Blacksheepmails|Blacksheepmails]] 01:41, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

==Adding lang attributes?==
The display of Chinese in this book isn't too great in my browser because there are no &quot;lang&quot; attributes on the Chinese portions, so the fonts firefox chooses aren't correct. Does anyone know of a way we can implement the adding of &quot;lang&quot; attributes to the appropriate sections? --[[User:Echalon|Echalon]] 05:13, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
:I looked up ''lang'''s uses, and it seems it might be a good idea, both for specifying a font and for making the Chinese text a larger font than the English for readability. Looks even better since bold and italics don't work too well on Chinese, so this would allow alternative emphasizers to be specified.

:I haven't used ''lang'' and don't know if it is allowed by the wiki software, but what font would you choose for best display? (In Firefox and Opera, since IE doesn't recognize ''lang''.)
:&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 23:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

::Personally I use AR PL ZenKai Uni, but really that should be up to every user. The idea is with the correct lang tags, I can set my preferences in the browser and everything should work out. All the tags really do is help the browser to decide what is English text versus Chinese text, and then the browser can make font choices based on that information. If everything was under a different character encoding it would be far easier, but with UTF-8 and kin we have to add that information ourselves. --[[User:Echalon|Echalon]] 00:05, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== A bit too basic? ==

I feel like there are a lot of really basic &quot;What is your name?&quot; type lessons in here.  I've had to learn a lot of Chinese in my time, and by the end of the first year of Chinese study, we were already on to more advanced topics of conversation.  Fundamentally, I feel like this textbook should be structured around subjects of conversation, rather than around grammar.  Each lesson should introduce new grammar and vocabulary, of course, but each should have its own unique subject of conversation.  Just my 2 cents, gleaned from four years of Chinese study.--[[User:Danaman5|Danaman5]] ([[User talk:Danaman5|talk]]) 12:13, 30 July 2008 (UTC)
:I agree, I think really the &quot;perfect&quot; textbook will have a dialogue at the beginning that introduces a topic and a new grammatical concept. The next section of that lesson will introduce and explain the vocabulary used in the dialogue.  The next section explains the grammatical concept introduced.  Following are drills/exercises that give the student an opportunity to apply what was learned.  This would allow for us to give students more vocabulary and topics will still addressing the fundamentals of the language.[[User:Shivasprogeny|Shivasprogeny]] ([[User talk:Shivasprogeny|talk]]) 06:21, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A standard &quot;pedal wrench&quot; is an open-ended wrench designed to be ''thin'' enough to fit the narrow wrench flats (gripping surface) typical to pedals. A quality pedal wrench will be ''long'' enough (and preferably with angled openings) to provide significant leverage, and durable enough to allow repeated application of such force. Pedal wrench flats are ''typically 15mm'' in size. 9/16&quot; (~14.3mm) is ''somewhat common'' on older pedals. 17mm and other sizes have been used, but you aren't very likely to encounter them.

(A &quot;[[w:cone wrench|cone wrench]]&quot; is thinner and shorter than a pedal wrench, and unable to provide appropriate durability or leverage for use on pedals. A standard [[w:open-end wrench|open-end wrench]] (such as found on one end of a [[w:combination wrench|combination wrench]]) will sometimes fit on the flats, but is unlikely to provide proper leverage, while being likely to spread at the tips, ruining the wrench and possibly the flats.)

Pedal wrenches are also available for pedals with ''6mm or 8mm internal hex'' (&quot;[[w:Allen wrench|Allen wrench]]&quot;) fittings in the end of the spindle, accessed from the back of the crank arm, through the pedal hole. A ''significant portion'' of modern pedals provide only this fitting, with no traditional wrench flats. These pedals wrenches differ from standard &quot;Allen wrenches&quot; primarily in that they provide longer and more comfortable handles, which is important to allow application of needed leverage.

In the U.S., there are two diameters (sizes) of pedal spindle (axle) threads which you are likely to encounter: 1/2&quot; and 9/16&quot;. The first is generally used on bikes with a [[w:one piece crank|one piece crank]], which will normally be an inexpensive or older bike. The second will usually be found on bicycles with two or [[w:three piece crank|three piece cranks]], which includes many current multi-speed bicycles and higher quality older bikes. There are other pedal thread sizes, such as 14mm (French), but you are quite unlikely to encounter them in the U.S.

'''WARNING'''

Left-hand pedals are ''reverse threaded''. (That is, you turn clockwise to ''loosen'', counterclockwise to ''tighten''. The Wright brothers introduced this to prevent pedals from unscrewing on their own.) Make very sure it's ''not crossthreaded'', you are turning the ''correct direction'', using the ''correct pedal'', and use ''grease''! (If any of the threads are stainless steel or titanium, it would likely be better to use an appropriate &quot;anti-sieze&quot; compound instead of grease.) Pedals should be ''properly tight'', 26 ft-lbs being a generic (not perfect) torque specification. (Rotational force equivalent to 26 pounds on the end of a foot long lever (the wrench). 52lbs on a 6&quot; lever. Etc.)

== Imperativo ==
This form gives commands.

To form the imperative mood of verbs, one normally takes the present subjunctive of the verb. 

The major exceptions to this rule are the second person singular and plural forms of positive command. To form a positive second person singular command, use the third person singular indicative. To form a positive second person plural command, take the stem of the verb and add:

-ad if the verb is an ar verb.

-id if the verb is an ir verb.

-ed if the verb is an er verb.

Note that when making a negative command, such as &quot;no cantes&quot; (don't sing), the present subjunctive is used.

There are many exceptions to these rules.

Ugh. I have spent hours and hours on this page trying to make the presentation as simple and meaningful as possible. I think it makes sense to present the list of tenses in more than one way because it shows the relationships of the parts. Should they be on the same or different pages ? Is the way I have ordered them the most meaningful ? Someone who is a true linguist, please help me out here. -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:I'm a little confused about a couple of names. For example, the &quot;potencial&quot; would be called &quot;condicional&quot; (at least in Spain, I don't know if it's the same in Latin America).
:As for the order of the tenses, in [[First_conjugation_verb_(Spanish)]], I made a table on the simple tenses of a typical verb (in this case, '''amar'''). I would suggest leaving subjunctive towards the end. Maybe...
:*INDICATIVO: presente - imperfecto - pretérito perf. simple - futuro - condicional + the corresponding composite tenses
:*SUBJUNTIVO: presente - imperfecto - futuro + the corresponding composite forms.
:I'd note that ''pretérito perfecto compuesto'' (hube estudiado) is rare, and ''futuro de subjuntivo'' (estudiare) and ''futuro perfecto de subjuntivo'' (hubiere estudiado) are almost archaic and used only in law. Even so, I think a link to the last two forms would be useful. Not for people who don't know Spanish at all, but maybe for lawyers who would like to work in Spanish-speaking countries ^^ [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 20:15, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)

This page requires some serious work. I added the present subjunctive page, but there are many tenses that have not been addressed yet. I think that the archaic tenses should be on a separate page of &quot;rare tenses,&quot; but that's just a thought. -[[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 5/18/05

I added a bit to the imperative section. It should probably be edited, but at least now there's something useful there.

== Spanish vs. English Headings ==

It is hard for me to browse through this page and get what I need from it because all the names of the tenses are in Spanish.  And I even know enough Spanish to read a book or newspaper or to have a simple conversation.  What do others think about this?  Would it be okay for me to add the English in addition to the Spanish? --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== Potencial vs. Condicional ==

Is it more correct to say ''potencial'' or ''condicional'' for the conditional tense?  Also, is the conditional a tense or a mood? --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vietnamese is a bit different than [[w:Romance language|Romance languages]], in that Vietnamese doesn't just use different pronouns for casual or formal situations, but Vietnamese actually uses different pronouns depending on the relation between the speaker and his/her audience. This relation takes gender, age, and status into account. Basically, Vietnamese refer to everyone as a family member. Also, it is common to use a third person personal pronoun in the first person. 

== Singular pronouns ==
;'''bạn (friend)'''
:informal, but not casual; a general-purpose version; use with caution
;'''anh (brother)'''
:to a male who is the same age as the speaker
;'''bà (grandmother, old lady)'''
:formal; to a female who is older than the speaker
;'''chị (sister)'''
:informal; to a female who is the same age as or older than the speaker
;'''con (child)'''
:from an adult to a child
;'''em(younger sister or brother)'''
:to a female who is the same age as the speaker, or to a person (of either gender) who is younger than the speaker (such as a child)
;'''mày (you)'''
:informal, even rude or insulting; to a person younger than the speaker, or to a person held in low esteem; use with caution
;'''ông (grandfather, old man)'''
:formal; to a male who is older than the speaker
;'''cô (father's sister)'''
:formal; to an older woman as old as one's father, a young (usually unmarried) woman

In addition, there are different pronouns for each kind of relative. For a listing of those pronouns, see [[Vietnamese/Family|Family]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A degreaser is useful in removing greasy dirt from parts.  Traditionally petroleum based products have been used. DO NOT use gasoline.  Although it is an effective degreaser, its volatility (i.e. tendency to explode) make it a poor choice for shop work.  If you must use a petroleum product, choose naphtha (usually available in hardware stores) or kerosene.  A better choice is a modern, biodegradable water based degreaser.  Specific blends for bicycle cleaning are available from bike shops and online retailers.  You can probably save some money, though, by purchasing degreaser from an auto parts retailer.  Whatever you use, after cleaning moving parts with a degreaser, always follow up with lubrication. All residual degreaser should be wiped off the parts before applying lubrication, as it would otherwise dilute the lubricant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Editor note|This page can be deleted. It is redundant to [[../Text Formatting]].}}

As with almost all programming languages and Markup Languages there are several different ways of formatting text. HTML is no exception. 

A popular way to format HTML is to use specific HTML tags such as &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;u&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt; The World Wide Web consortium (W3C) suggest these tags may not be supported in future and that you use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to add formatting to text on the HTML page. 

In practice, these methods are both fine to use, but are limited in the ways that text can be formatted.

Thus, many HTML authors are shifting towards using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which employs &quot;style sheets&quot; and &quot;inline styles&quot; to add formatting to text. It should be noted that using CSS one can redefine the appearance of text inside all tags of a particular type. See the section on classes below for details.

== Inline styles ==
Through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) you can reuse code using &quot;classes&quot; which contain &quot;styles&quot; (ways of formatting text). You can also put CSS styles inline, as in the following:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;This is a paragraph of double-size bold text&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

results in

&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;This is a paragraph of double-size bold text&lt;/div&gt;

== Classes ==
&lt;!-- ToDo: explain tagname.class format.  --&gt;
Classes can be defined in two places; in style tags in HTML documents and in external files, the &quot;style sheets&quot; referred to in the name &quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot;.  The term &quot;cascading&quot; refers to the mechanism by which the correct style is chosen when multiple style sheets are to be applied to the same document.

An example style tag:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
a { font-weight: bold; }
a.special { color:red; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


An example of the contents of a style sheet file:
&lt;pre&gt;
a { font-weight: bold; }
a.special { color:red; }
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Voynich Manuscript (32).jpg|thumb|A floral illustration on page 32. The colors are still vibrant.]]
The '''Voynich manuscript''', described as &quot;the world's most mysterious manuscript&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Brumbaugh, Robert S. | title = The World's Most Mysterious Manuscript | publisher = [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] | location = London | year = 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a work which dates to the early 15th century, possibly from northern Italy.&lt;ref name=ngvideo&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/winners/tvf2011winners/pieces.php?iid=413203&amp;pid=1|year=2011|accessdate=November 6, 2011 | title = The Voynich Code&amp;nbsp;— The World's Mysterious Manuscript | author = Steindl, Klaus; Sulzer, Andreas | format = video }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;physorg&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Stolte, Daniel |date = February 10, 2011 | publisher = [[PhysOrg]] | url = http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-02-experts-age.html | title = Experts determine age of book 'nobody can read' | accessdate = February 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the book dealer [[/Wilfrid Michael Voynich/]], who purchased it in 1912.

Some pages are missing, but the current version comprises about 240 [[wikipedia:vellum|vellum]] pages, most with illustrations. Much of the manuscript resembles [[/herbal manuscripts/|herbal manuscripts]] of the time period, seeming to present illustrations and information about plants and their possible uses for medical purposes. However, most of the plants do not match known species, and the manuscript's [[/VMS writing system/|script]] and [[/VMS language/|language]] remain unknown and unreadable. Possibly some form of encrypted [[wikipedia:ciphertext|ciphertext]], the Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. As yet, it has defied all decipherment attempts, becoming a ''cause célèbre'' of historical cryptology. The mystery surrounding it has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript a subject of both fanciful theories and novels. None of the many speculative solutions proposed over the last hundred years has yet been independently verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciphermysteries.com/the-voynich-manuscript/voynich-theories|title=Voynich theories|author=Pelling, Nick|accessdate=December 4, 2011|publisher=ciphermysteries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voynich manuscript was donated to Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1969, where it is catalogued under call number ''MS 408'' and called a &quot;Cipher Manuscript&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 408|publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|url=http://brbl-net.library.yale.edu/pre1600ms/docs/pre1600.ms408.htm|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/digitallibrary/voynich.html|title=Voynich Manuscript|accessdate=December 4, 2011|publisher=Beinecke Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the appeal of Voynich research is that (a) it is truly cross-disciplinary, and (b) it rewards endeavour and persistence. This wikibook is intended to help you get started on what has already been (for some) a long road of (self-)discovery - the page you may find most useful at first is the [[/Jargon|Guide To Voynich Jargon]].

==What we know about VMS==

* Illustrated medieval folio written in an undeciphered script.
* From the illustrations – hairstyles and features of the human ﬁgures – as well as the shapes of the glyphs, the manuscript is posited to have been created in Europe. Carbon-dating at the University of Arizona has found that the vellum was created in the 15th century, and the McCrone Research Institute has asserted that the ink was added shortly afterwards.
* The manuscript is divided into quires – sections made out of folded parchment, each of which consists of folios, with writing on both sides of each folio (Reeds, 2002).
* Including blank pages and pages with no text, there are 240 pages, although it is believed that some are missing (Pelling, 2006)
* 225 pages include text, and most are illustrated.
* The text was probably added after the illustrations, and shows no evidence of scratching or correction.
* The text is written left to right in paragraphs that are left-aligned, justiﬁed, and divided by whitespace into words. Paragraphs do not span multiple pages.
* Under the most used transcription, as there are ambiguities, the VMS is comprised of 8114 word types, and 37919 word tokens.
* Based on the illustrations, the manuscript has traditionally been divided into six sections: (1) herbal, containing drawings of plants; (2) Astronomical, containing zodiac-like illustrations; (3) Biological, mainly containing drawings of female human ﬁgures; (4) Cosmological, consisting of circular illustrations; (5) Pharmaceutical, containing drawing of small containers and parts of plants, and (6) Stars (sometimes referred to as Recipes), containing very dense text with drawings of stars in the margins.
* Currier (1976) observed from letter and substring frequencies that the text is comprised of two distinct ‘languages’, A and B. Interestingly, the Biological and Stars sections are mainly written in the B language, and the rest mainly in A.
* The word frequency distribution follows Zipf’s law, which is a necessary (though not sufﬁcient) test of linguistic plausibility. We also ﬁnd that the unigram word entropy is comparable to the baseline texts.

==Page-by-page commentary==
''See: [[The Voynich Manuscript/Page-by-page commentary]]''

The Voynich Manuscript has more than 200 pages, divided up into twenty quires (as per the following links). The first 7 quires are standard quires consisting of 4 nested bifolios each. Quire
8 once consisted of 5 such bifolios but only 2 remain. From quire 9 onwards, quires often
consist of only one or two multiple folding bifolios. Exceptions are quires 13 (5 standard bifolios)
and 20 (7 standard bifolios of which 6 remain). Further details are available at the description
of each quire.

The web-pages linked onwards from there are intended to summarise the debate relating to individual pages - what could they mean? To what are they similar? What interesting (visual or statistical) properties do they have? ''(etc)''
:Main herbal section - Quires 1-7
:Mixed quire - Quire 8
:Astronomical/cosmological section - Quires 9-10 ''(note that quire 10 also contains the start of the zodiac section!)''
:Zodiac section - Quires 11-12 
:Biological/balneological (bathing nymph) section - Quires 13-14 ''(contains the &quot;9-rosette&quot; fold-out page)''
:Pharmacological+herbal section - Quires 15-19
:Recipe / calendar / almanacke section - Quire 20

==Cross-page commentary==
This section is designed to contain commentaries on features spanning multiple pages of the VMs.

== Principal Parts ==

All Latin verbs are identified by four principal parts. By using the four principal parts, one can obtain any and all forms of the verb, including participles, infinitives, gerunds and the like.

Examples of principal parts from verbs of each conjugation:

:1st: ''ambulō, ambulāre, ambulāvī, ambulātum'' (to walk)

:2nd: ''doceō, docēre, docuī, doctum'' (to teach)

:3rd: ''mittō, mittere, mīsī, mīssum'' (to send)

:4th: ''audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum'' (to hear)

For all regular verbs, the principal parts consist of the first person singular present active indicative, the infinitive, the first person singular perfect active indicative, and the supine (or in some texts, the perfect passive participle).

*Deponent verbs have only three principal parts:

:''patior, patī, passus sum'' (to suffer)

:''ūtor, ūtī, ūsus sum'' (to use)

*Likewise, semi-deponent verbs have only three:

:''audeō, audēre, ausus sum'' (to dare)

:''gaudeō, gaudēre, gavīsus sum'' (to rejoice)

Some verbs lack fourth principal parts (e.g., ''timeō, timēre, timuī, —''; to be afraid); others, less commonly, lack a third in addition (e.g., ''ferro, ferre, tuli, latum''; to bring/carry). Others, such as ''sum, esse, fuī, futūrus'', may use the future active participle (''futūrus'') as their fourth principal part; this indicates that the verb cannot be made passive.

Gee, someone needs to find some suitable diagrams. I had a tough time describing right triangles and a unit circle only in words... and I'm too lazy to find diagrams :-\. [[User:Ugen64|Ugen64]] 01:58, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

I drew it incorrectly with not the hyp to the unit circle to the leg. I'll fix this pretty quick

Um, where are the answers?

...to the exercises


Some notation for an angle must be included in defining the trig ratios because the value of the angle measure is one of the three variables in the equation.  Math anxious students need to see as many visaul clues as possible in order for them to build an understanding of this concept.

==Elementary Trigonometric Functions==
Their teachers have taught my children the memory aid &quot;SOHCAHTOA&quot;, pronounced so-ka-toe-a.  Sin == Opposite / Hypotenuse, Cos == Adjacent / Hypotenuse. Tan == Opposite / Adjacent.  This might be considered for adding to this section. [[User:Walrii|Walrii]] 20:26, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

==Suggest delete page==

It's not clear what useful role this page plays in the book.  I think it is simply an introduction to the topic of trigonometry, which already exists in more well-developed form at the beginning of the book.  Any objections to deleting the page?

== Safety of user input data ==
Hi i didn't found anything about preventing XSS injection and SQL injections.
I think its important part of doing web apps. Chris.
: Although avoiding XSS injection and SQL injection is indeed important, I believe it is a cross-language skill that should be learned separately from the language itself (it could make a book by itself). There are however, aspects of certain language that is often an easy weak-point for malicious hackers coupled with careless programmer. In python, these weak points would be (not a complete list): input (python 2.x and below), eval, exec, popen, and subprocess, possibly open too. These weak points should be mentioned.

== Non-programmers python tutorial ==
If anyone wants to, feel free to take any material from the tutorial that I wrote for the python programming language.  [http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut/easytut/ Non-programmers python tutorial].  I grant permission to relicense it under the GNU Free Documentation License (though I would recommend keeping the public domain exception for the programming samples).  Josh Cogliati.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 15:42, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Thank you very much! I'll start to integrate it into the module ASAP [[User:Thunderbolt16|Thunderbolt16]] 22:56, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:I started wikifiying it to simplify integrating it in. See my [[User:Jrincayc]] page for the contents. [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 02:43, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:More or less finished wikifying it.  See [[User:Jrincayc/Contents]] -- [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 02:54, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:::I plan on moving it from User:Jrincayc to Non-programmers Python Tutorial, if nobody objects.  I am doing this because the server honors.montana.edu is being permanently shutdown, so I wish to start changing links to it to point to wikibooks rather than honors.montana.edu.

::Josh's work is now avaialable at http://www.andamooka.org/reader.pl?section=easytut as his link to the website at U. Montana is broken.--[[User:DavidRoss|DavidRoss]] 06:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

: Thank you. That looks excellent. We now have [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python]].
: Well, that's technically merely a redirect to the specific version of Python we recommend for new people.
: At the moment it redirects to [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6]].
: Someday it will become a redirect to [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]] (after a few [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3 more issues] are resolved).

== Explain what makes this book unique ==

People mentioned that Python is already covered in:
* the book &quot;How to think like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python&quot;, which is already a comprehensive text about Python and covers a lot of topics on programming. Why not use that? --Offray
* [http://www.diveintopython.org Dive Into Python] by [http://www.diveintomark.org Mark Pilgrim], which is licenced under the GNU FDL--::[[User:Noldoaran|Noldoaran]] 18:14, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)
* The official Python documentation --Beuc

Please add a note in the synopsys or introduction about what fostered the development of this wikibook :)

== September 2004 revamp ==

I am about to delve into this thing, and find it's pretty much in disarray. It appears nobody is workin on it, so I'm going to go right ahead.

I have a structure in mind. The sections of the book will go something like this:

#Introduction - What is Python; Getting Python; Editing Python programs.
#Tutorial - A series of examples and exercises.
#Language concepts - Indepth and complete treatment of Python's implementation of syntax, variables, flow control, files, classes, etc.
#Standard modules - Indepth documentation of standard modules.
#Function reference - Indepth documentation of standard functions. (Not sure about this section.)
#Appendices - List of keywords and similar stuff.

See [[User:Yath/Python]] for the full chapter outline.

== Web scripting ==

I'd like to read how to write a page containing a python script and how to configure apache to understand python. Thanks [[User:158.193.85.212|158.193.85.212]] 07:28, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

==Using saved programs==

Could somebody elaborate on how to get a saved python program? I entered the program in a notepad file. But when I try to get it on the python command line, it says that the : in C:\ is wrong syntax. How do I get the programs? --[[elpenmaster]]

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. Your current naming convention is deprecated and has several disadvantages - e.g. it has no navigational links. Also your worthy effort is neither considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an extensive book and section detector.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:15, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:Adding to this, it would be a good idea in my opinion to drop the &quot;Programming&quot; pseudo-namespace. Books are starting to move out of that, notably [[Ada Programming]]. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 23:41, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

::Now what should be the new location, is it [[Python]]?. --[[User:Baijum81|Baijum81]] 04:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
:::One day the pages should be moved by a bot to fit the new scheme, but I'm not sure how to request that. Going to the bot maintainer's talk page will probably do it. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 14:30, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

:I'm adding the Development stages to each of the sections to it's easier to find stuff to work on at a glance.  [[Help:Development_stages]] I'm not going to 100% beside any sections (yet) as I am not a python expert, and I am reluctant to say that a section that is complete.  Once I have done this, I will work on fleshing out some of the sections that need content.

:I am new to contributing to wikibooks--well to any of the wikimedia projects--so any pointers or suggestions would be helpful. -[[User:DavidRoss|DavidRoss]] 20:00, 6 Aug 2006 (PDT)

== Unified Navigation ==

The navigation bars on this book are problematic: there doesn't seem to be any kind of general consensus on navigation bar template.  What is/should be the convention? --[[User:Quartz25|Quartz25]] 21:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

For reference, the convention seems to be to use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Python Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; template for the top, and no template is used on the bottom. --[[User:Quartz25|Quartz25]] 23:54, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

== Changes to the Introduction section ==
The introduction, as it now appears, is convoluted, incomplete, and circular.  Thus I propose the following pages to be used in the following order:

1. Installing the python language itself
:* Broken down by platform
2. Interactive mode Python interpreter.
:*With demonstrative &quot;Hello World&quot; program (or perhaps a very simple ''print &quot;What Is Your Name?&quot;'', ''print &quot;What is your quest?&quot;'', ''print &quot;What is your favorite color?&quot;'') example.
3. Non-interactive mode python interpreter.
:*With the same demonstrative Hello program, instructing the user to use a simple text editor to save it as a text file.
4. Python Editors &amp; Addons
:(broken down by OS)
:*I'm placing this last, because this section is always going to be very much up in the air relative to a user's own tastes, but the link to the Python Editors should be maintained.
:*Furthermore, some people will be quite happy with the simple built-in text editors for quite a while, and we want to get them up to coding as quickly as possible, thus this section isn't, strictly speaking, necessary.
:*The addons come very last, because people just taking their first steps into python probably aren't looking to extend the language; again, not strictly necessary, not here anyway.
:* In fact, this last page could probably be best served as 2 separate sections of the appendix.

Once I figure out how to create subfolders and subpages in my user page, I'll start posting my reworking of the introduction there, and people can start commenting as they see fit. --[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld|MyOwnLittlWorld]] 19:24, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

The pages are up now at my [[User:MyOwnLittlWorld|user page]], please tell me what you think and whether or not the intro should be replaced.  Thanks, [[User:MyOwnLittlWorld|MyOwnLittlWorld]] 23:18, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

== Question or Suggestion on the TOC ==
When you say User Interface on the TOC to you mean a topic on UI creation or is it a section to explain the UI of Python IDLE.
And if its a UI section I will suggest some GUI Programming using the Tkinter Library if possible also support the Glade Library.
=== Few changes or Updates ===
# Help on the Python OOP page. I can use a little more help on the terms as their still too technical.
# Help with the installation of Python language (Ubuntu and Mac section)
--[[User:Dragonecc|Dragonecc]] ([[User talk:Dragonecc|talk]]) 01:34, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

== Two links to Gaming ==

There seems to be two links to the module &quot;[[Python Programming/Game Programming in Python|Game Programming in Python]]&quot; in the index.  Should one be deleted?  It is messing up the navigation on each page.  

If so, which one should go?  I was thinking about getting rid of the one under the section &quot;Learning to program in Python&quot; because the game programming is a more advanced subject.  

--[[User:Hypergeek14|hypergeek14]] ([[User talk:Hypergeek14|talk]]) 21:14, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

I have just noticed that there are also two links to the [[Python Programming/Files|Files]] module.  This time I think the link under &quot;Rocking the Python (Modules)&quot; section should go, as files are a basic concept.  

--[[User:Hypergeek14|hypergeek14]] ([[User talk:Hypergeek14|talk]]) 21:21, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

:The deed has been done.  
:
:--[[User:Hypergeek14|hypergeek14]] ([[User talk:Hypergeek14|talk]]) 21:44, 29 July 2008 (UTC)

== Examples? ==

I would like to understand the reasons for using dictionaries, tuples, lists, etc. I can't see the reasons for doing most of the things in this language. There are never an explanation of ''why'' you'd want to use certain things. [[User:Hires an editor|Hires an editor]] ([[User talk:Hires an editor|talk]]) 21:40, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

== redundancy ==

Is there a reason why most of the content is there twice? Once under &quot;Learning to program in Python&quot; and once under &quot;Python concepts&quot;. I believe we should merge those sections. Especially the following are very similar:

* Errors and Exceptions
* Flow control and Decision control
* Scoping and Namespaces

Also I dont see a reason why modules need to be treated separately but still appear many times before in the text. I would also like to fix that. Any other suggestions? Greetings --[[User:Hannes Röst|Hannes Röst]] ([[User talk:Hannes Röst|talk]]) 07:56, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
:Yes, I believe the sections were written by separate people with differing visions of the final book.  I was trying to rewrite the whole thing coherently, but moved on to other projects.  You can see my single plan [[Python_Programming/TODO|here]].  Your goals seem similar to what I was thinking.  I might return as I would like to teach Python to a friend from this. --[[User:Jesdisciple|Jesdisciple]] ([[User talk:Jesdisciple|talk]]) 12:12, 23 August 2010 (UTC)

== Which version of Python to use ==

Python 2.x or 3.x? The book in its current form contains many examples and explanation of language structures, internal functions, statements and all of that. However, there seems to be great inconsistency in the implementation of it.
The most glaring is the use of print() as a function (3.x style) or as a bare statement (2.x style).
Whichever choice is made, it needs to be clearly represented somewhere, that or all examples need a note as to the language major version they're written in, or even written in both major versions as examples should be copy/past-able.

Drivers for a decision 2 vs 3:
* How long is this book expected to be useful (3.x is going to be more useful in the longer run)
* Is third-party package support critical for people still learning the language (as most exist purely for 2.x and 2to3 is not a tool for those new to the language)
* What version is mastered by the editors here (going with 3, only to discover a wholesome three people know it, is a disappointment about to happen)


:
:Greetings while you may have a valid point on newer Python release, there are some problems.  Python 2.6 is highly use release across major Linux :releases and corporate development.  For this environment Python module are a great impact and migration to Python 3 make have costly deployment.  :Until modules are translated to Python 3 or native supported development for Python 2.6 will continue. This has being experimented with other :programming language like Cobol, Fortran and Pascal.  Also this book samples could be easily ported to Python 3 with minor changes.

== Contents / Landing Page re-org ==
Last night I reorganised the Contents page.  Danielle Polansky was not happy with some of words that I chose for section headings.  I propose reverting back my changes, and use the following headings:
Intro --&gt; Getting Started
Basics --&gt; Fundamentals
I introduced a new section called 'Code Reuse' that moves out everything from Functions, to Classes, and namespaces.  
Modules is redundant
Standard Library Modules
Third-party modules
Writing extension modules --&gt; Extending Python
Appendices
What are your thoughts?  [[User:Hackbinary|Hackbinary]] ([[User talk:Hackbinary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hackbinary|contribs]]) 21:50, 13 October 2013 (UTC)

**It is you that I wish could find another playground.  All I want to do is add some content, and already expressed, improve the readability, and ease of use of the book.

**I am pressing ahead with reorganising, refactoring, and rationalising the chapters and chapter order as there is a fair bit of duplicated content which needs to be sorted through.

There is currently duplication across numerous chapters, and as much as as possible, I have grouped chapters with similar content together, but their names may not be representative of their content at this time, eg text is really about strings.

I disagree with edits that are not constituting an objectively unquestionable improvements but rather are pushing a personal preference when these edits come from someone who is not interested in contributing ''actual content'' to the book. You are not prevented from adding ''content''; you are prevented from an ''arbitrary reorganization''. No, you should not be &quot;pressing ahead with reorganising, refactoring, and rationalising&quot; as long as your content contribution to Wikibook is nearly nonexistent and there is an opposition to that reorganizing. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 08:03, 19 October 2013 (UTC)
****Sorry, you're inactivity lead the status quo being changed. While you have contributed some good content, you are not the dictator of Programming Python.  The content must be rationalised in a progressive manner, and if you are unwilling to be cooperative, I will seek assistance from others.  You have a track record of being obstinate, and forcing your views on others.   To begin with Basics is not a good section title.  The word is overly generic and does nothing to articulate that the section is about core building blocks of the language, Fundamentals on the other hand says this is core material to what will be discussed further on.  Furthermore, it makes immeasurable sense to organise related chapters that duplicate content together, before the content is merged into one chapter.  Do you not concur that the chapters Sequences, Data types, Numbers, Strings, Text, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets duplicates a fair amount of material?  Do not agree that this needs to merged together in a managed, organised and controlled way? If you are going to be so argumentative, and obstructive to the work that I am doing, then fine, that is your decision, but I am going to press ahead.  If you wish to discuss it, and compromise, then I am happy to do the same.  I am not willing to be in a situation where you feel that you can call the shots and that you feel that you can make arbitrary decisions yourself.  Over the past week I have been reading through chapters with greater detail, and reading through the change logs, and for example I do not approve of your revert 6 Oct, Input and Output [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Python_Programming%2FInput_and_Output&amp;diff=2563925&amp;oldid=2555399] as it seems to me that using with is the better way to open a file context and read the file because 1.) you do not have to explicitly close the file once the execution path falls out of scope, and 2.) the handling of exceptions is better with the with block.  My point is that you make arbitrary changes yourself that have dubious merit.[[User:Hackbinary|Hackbinary]] ([[User talk:Hackbinary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hackbinary|contribs]]) 12:50, 20 October 2013 (UTC)

== pdf problems ==

In the pdf version page 94 (numbered 90) has the page number superimposed over text.
The first 2 pages aren't numbered, the next 2 are numbered III &amp; IV, &amp; the rest are numbered starting with 1. The Contents are on pages III, IV, &amp; 1 with the text starting on 3 which doesn't make sense.
At least on my system, pages 157-159 print out cropped. In the case of 157 and 159, cropping some of the blank space at the top and bottom respectively solved the problem. To fix 158 I suggest putting the entire section 36.3 on page 159.

== Printed version very differ from main article, October 2015 ==
First I notice missed &quot;Extending with ...&quot; chapters  in existing PDF.
I generated PDF myself (mediawiki2latex 7.21) from current article, but then I found that &quot;Extending with ctypes&quot; and some another chapters no included in printer version too.

Noticed a very annoying issue with the PDF after printing the entire thing out and binding...

Chapter 4,5 and 6 are missing and contain only the text like:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;d&quot;&gt;
1. REDIRECT Python Programming/Creating Python Programs
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

I think it may have to do with that navigation (Redirected from) which I have removed and it waiting for moderation

== This book for sale on Amazon ==

This book seems to be available for sale on Amazon. That's kinda cool. Good to see wikibooks content being made available in that form. Good to see an example of  commercial use of the content too I guess, but...

It's rather expensive though. I mean it's kind of a normal technology book price £19.89 on the UK store. I would expect it to be cheaper, given that it's available to download from here for free, and authored here by volunteers. Either that or I would expect the profits to be donated to wikibooks (which may be the case, but I don't see any label about that). Otherwise it feels a little bit like purchasers are being misled, and the community here is not being adequately rewarded. 

How do others feel about it? It's not really my place to be outraged, since I've not authored any of this book myself. It could be that the book was actually authored elsewhere and copied in here, or authored by a few people here who are now profiting from publishing the book on amazon. What's the situation?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, good idea to have a general proof! Here are some things I am not so happy about yet:

You say that S(n) can measure weights between 1 and |S(n)|. In standard mathematical
notation |S(n)| would be just the number of elements in S(n) which is n+1 (maybe we
should introduce another symbol like W(n) or so). Also, to be
technically precise, we should write &lt;math&gt;\lfloor 3^{(n+1)}/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;  rather
than 3^(n+1)/2 for the upper bound of weights that can be measured.
[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

----

The answer (four weights: {1,3,9,27}) is correct as far as the question is posed. But, as the question does not require weights to be measured in a single weighing, the question and answer both miss an interesting aspect of measuring integral weights: that it is not necessary for the scale to be balanced to correctly identify an unknown weight. With four known weights, {2,6,18,54}, it's possible to measure up to 80, not just 40:

If x &lt; 2, then x = 1.

If x = 2, then x = 2.

If 2 &lt; x &lt; 6-2, then x = 3, etc.

You could repose the question with 80 instead of 40, or turn it around and ask what range of integral weights can be measured using four known weights.

== Notes ==

These planned articles are pitifully out of order &amp;ndash; I'd like them to be ordered by difficulty, and have one lead into the other, like an academic course would.

I also plan to use some of the content on [http://www.1ec5.org/mingerweb/viet/index.html Học với Tôi], one of my websites, in this textbook. As I understand it, doing so would not violate any copyrights or policies here at Wikibooks, because I'm the author of Học với Tôi.

If you speak Vietnamese, or have an understanding of Vietnamese culture, please help out with this textbook. I'm still learning Vietnamese (maybe you can tell by the quality of my translations), so I definitely can't do this by myself.

== My book ==

I also wrote a Vietnamese course [http://dohongnam.com/vn Let's Learn Vietnamese]

== Writing a course ==

Great that Wikibooks will now have a Vietnamese course! I'm looking forward to it. I will probably start learning Vietnamese next year.

Have you seen the article on creating a language course on Wikibooks? I think it's quite useful. Also, you may want to have a look at the course format I found works best for students: [[Bite-sized language lessons]]. Good luck!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 15:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

== Continued updates? ==

Doesn't seem the material has been updated any time recently, so just wanted to do a shout out to let you authors know that there are those of us still interested in learning Vietnamese. Also believe my case is quite common: fluent Vietnamese speaker who can't write Viet and reads Viet using English phonetics (which is basically an educated guess most of the time... I can do it on the fly though ;D ), so if you folks could consider making a course for Native English speakers who know how to speak Viet but can't write or really read Viet, that would be great.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike Western languages, Vietnamese doesn't change the ending of the verb (that is, verbs don't conjugate) to express when the statement occurs (the statement's tense). Instead, Vietnamese relies on context to express tense. So, where textbooks for other languages will need to spend chapters and chapters, or pages and pages, to teach you how to change tense, we'll teach you in one page! See what we mean by [[Pros and cons#Pro: Vietnamese is simple.|simple]]?

==Tense words==

One way to do this is to add certain words either before the verb itself, or at the end of the sentence, or both:

===Present tense===
As in most languages, you don't have to do anything special for the present tense &amp;ndash; no words expressing tense need to be added. Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Tôi học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en-us&quot;&gt;I study&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Present progressive tense===
Place ''đang'' in front of the verb. Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Tôi&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;đang&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb&gt;học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; I am studying&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Past tense===
Either place ''đã'' in front of the verb, or place ''rồi'' at the end of the sentence. You can use both, and it often sounds better when you do use both, but it's not necessary, because both words mean &quot;already.&quot; Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Anh&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;đã&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb&gt;học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;He already studied&lt;/rt&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

can also be written as:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Anh học&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;rồi&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;He studied already&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Whereas many other languages have two past tenses &amp;ndash; the preterite and imperfect past &amp;ndash; Vietnamese has only one.

===Future tense===
Place ''sẽ'' (will, shall, is about to, plans to) in front of the verb. Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Anh&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;sẽ&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb&gt;học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;He will study&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Time words==

There is another, more natural way of expressing tense. Just use words that express time in the sentence:

===Present tense===
Again, you don't have to do anything special here. But sometimes it's helpful to add ''hôm nay'' (today) at the beginning or end of the sentence, just to clear things up.

===Present progressive tense===
Place words like ''bây giờ'' (now) or phrases like ''ngay bây giờ'' (right now) at the beginning or end of the sentence.

===Past tense===
Place words like ''hôm qua'' (yesterday) at the beginning or end of the sentence, or words like ''mới'' (recently) right before the verb. You can do both, actually.

===Future tense===
Place words like ''ngày mai'' (tomorrow) at the beginning or end of the sentence.

==Context==

Although other methods of expressing tense also rely on context in the sentence, another way to express tense has to do with common sense. For example, in the sentence, . . .

''(More to come.)''

==Buoyancy==
'''Buoyancy''' is the force due to pressure differences on the top and bottom of an object under a fluid (gas or liquid).

Net force = buoyant force - force due to gravity on the object

== Bernoulli's Principle ==
Fluid flow is a complex phenomenon. An ideal fluid may be described as:

* The fluid flow is '''steady''' i.e its velocity at each point is constant with time.
* The fluid is '''incompressible'''. This condition applies well to liquids and in certain circumstances to gases.
* The fluid flow is '''non-viscous'''. Internal friction is neglected. An object moving through this fluid does not experience a retarding force. We relax this condition in the discussion of '''[[w:Stokes' Law|Stokes' Law]]'''.
* The fluid flow is '''irrotational'''. There is no angular momentum of the fluid about any point. A very small wheel placed at an arbitary point in the fluid does not rotate about its center. Note that if turbulence is present, the wheel would most likely rotate and its flow is then not irrotational.


As the fluid moves through a pipe of varying cross-section and elevation, the pressure will change along the pipe. The Swiss physicist [[w:Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel Bernoulli]] ([[w:1700|1700]]-[[w:1782|1782]]) first derived an expression relating the pressure to fluid speed and height. This result is a consequence of conservation of energy and applies to ideal fluids as described above.

''Consider an ideal fluid flowing in a pipe of varying cross-section. A fluid in a section of length ''&amp;Delta;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' moves to the section of length ''&amp;Delta;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' in time ''&amp;Delta;''t.''
The relation given  by Bernoulli is:


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = K&lt;/math&gt;}}


[where: ''P'' is pressure at cross-section, ''K'' is a constant, ''h'' is height of cross-section, ''&amp;rho;'' is density, and ''v'' is velocity of fluid at cross-section.]


In words, the Bernoulli relation may be stated as:
''As we move along a streamline the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume and the potential energy per unit volume remains a constant.''

----

''(To be concluded)''

== Unix and Linux ==

=== Overview ===

Unix is the original Internet Operating System (NFS, TCP/IP, RPC, ...).
Linux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a world wide team of developers across the Net.
Properties of both systems are:
* Portable, multi-user, multiprocessing
* Device-independent input/output
* Shared resources, high performance and highly secure
* Line commands
* GUI
Linux aims toward POSIX compliance and supports also other standard API's such as BSD and SVR4.
Linux has all the features you would expect in a modern Unix, including true multitasking/multiple-users, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management and TCP/IP networking.

More and more companies and organizations are selecting Linux because of its performance, low cost, and royalty free license.

==== Unix and Linux ====

Unix is the original Internet Operating System written in 1970 developed at A&amp;T Bell Labs.
Distributed freely to government and universities.
Different entities did support different distributions.
* System V
* BSD
* SCO
Most varieties of Unix carry copyright licenses.

Linux was released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
The model of Linux licence is copy left from GPL.
Linux implement most of the System V and BSD Unix commands.
Use the man pages to determine the version.

==== Logging In and Out ====

The logging In session is the first step to access a Linux system.
You need a login ID and a password to be able to start using the system.
The login ID root is the super user ID that has all privileges, normally assigned to the System Administrator.
When a log in session is successful it will set some environment variables and start the shell that has been assigned to the login ID account.

Examples of variables set at log in time:
$HOME, $SHELL, $PATH, and more.
By changing the file /etc/login.defs the administrator can customize some login parameters and variables for all the users.

Examples of some of them:
 UID_MIN 500
 UID_MAX 60000
 UMASK 022
 ENV_PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
To logout use the exit or logout command.

==== Password ====

Nobody can see your password, not even the administrator.
To change passwords for users or groups, use passwd.

 passwd [options]

Common options:
* -l, -u : Lock and unlock an account.
* -g [| r]: Used for group. 
* -g set a password for group and -r removes it.
* -x|n : Maximum and minimum number of days a password remain valid.

As a general rule a password must:
* Have a minimum length
* Not contain any English language words
* Contain non-alphanumeric characters
* Contain a mixture of uppercase and lower case letters.

==== User information ====

For every user account, there is a line defined in the file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;. The encrypted password is stored in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/tt&gt;. The format of &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt; is:

 root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
 bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/bash
 daemon:x:2:2:Daemon:/sbin:/bin/bash
 yann:x:500:100:Yann Forget:/home/yann:/bin/bash

The x field is the old location for the password.

The format of &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/tt&gt; is:

 root:IMXweyiV816gg:11996:0:10000::::
 bin:!*:8902:0:10000::::
 daemon:*:8902:0:10000::::
 yann:GoIM8j1S.IuTY:11996:0:99999:7:::

The * for the encrypted password means there is no password defined yet.
The ! Before the encrypted password means the account is locked.

==== Group information ====

For every group of users there is a line in file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt;. The encrypted password is stored in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/gshadow&lt;/tt&gt;. The format of &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt; is:

 root:x:0:root
 bin:x:1:root,bin,daemon
 daemon:x:2:
 video:x:33:yann

The format of /etc/gshadow is:

 root:*:root:root
 bin:*:root:root
 daemon:*:root:root
 video:*:root:root,yann

Passwords for group are not often implemented since you have to pass to members of a group the password.

==== Misc. Commands ====

To get information on a logging In session, use id.

 id [options] [username]

Common options:
-g : Print only the group ID.
-u : Print only the user ID.

Example:

 $ id
 uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), 1(bin), 14(uucp), 15(shadow),16(dialout)

To run a shell with another user ID and group ID, use su.

 su [options] [username]

Common options:
-s : Select another shell.

Example:

 $ su toto
 passwd:

==== Shell ====

A Shell is a command line interpreter and:
* Prompts for commands.
* Interprets command which can include:
* I/O redirection, pipes, filename generation, etc.
* Executes commands.
* Executes scripting language.

There are several popular shells:
* sh: Bourne shell, the standard scripting shell.
* csh: Berkeley shell, job control, command history, alias.
* ksh: Korn shell, Bourne syntax with Berkeley features.
* bash: Bourne Again shell, free, Korn-like shell.
* t csh: Free, Berkeley clone with many extensions.

Most shells let you customize your prompt and environment.
For bash the prompt variable is PS1.
For bash the file that can be used for the customization of the environment are:
* .bashrc  Executed for each new bash session
* .bash_profile Executed at logging In time
* .bash_logout Executed at logging Out time

== Process text streams using filters ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should should be able to apply filters to text streams. Tasks include sending text files and output streams through text utility filters to modify the output, and using standard UNIX commands found in the GNU textutils package.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;br&gt;
cut&lt;br&gt;
expand&lt;br&gt;
fmt&lt;br&gt;
head&lt;br&gt;
join&lt;br&gt;
nl&lt;br&gt;
od&lt;br&gt;
paste&lt;br&gt;
pr&lt;br&gt;
sed&lt;br&gt;
sort&lt;br&gt;
split&lt;br&gt;
tac&lt;br&gt;
tail&lt;br&gt;
tr&lt;br&gt;
unexpand&lt;br&gt;
uniq&lt;br&gt;
wc&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Pattern matching and wildcards ===

Wildcard is a pattern matching mechanism for filenames.
The purpose of wildcard is to increase productivity:
Locate files that you don't fully remember.
Locate files that have something in common.
Work with a group of files rather than individual.

The shell interprets these special characters:
 ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) { } [ ] | \ ; ~ ' &quot; ` ?

The characters used for wildcard are:
 ?  *  [  ]  ~

If you use the wildcard characters the shell will try to generate a file from them.
Try the following:
 echo all files *

Special wildcard characters
 ? match any one character.
 * Any string
 [abcfghz] One char set
 [a-z] One char in range
 [!x-z] Not in set
 ~ Home directory
 ~user User home directory

Examples:
 ? One character filenames only
 [aA]??? Four characters, starting with a or A.
 ~toto pathname of toto home directory
 [!0-9]* All string not starting with a number.

What about these commands?
 ls [a-z][A-Z]??.[uk]
 ls big*
 ls a???a
 ls ??*

=== Shell and wildcards ===

A shell command line can be a simple command or more complex.
 ls -l [fF]*
 ls *.c | more
 ls -l [a-s]* | mail `users`

The first event in the shell is to interpret wildcards.
Only the shell interprets unquoted wildcards.

=== Quoting and Comments ===

==== Quoting ====

Do quote to prevent the shell to interpret the special characters and to transform multiple words into one shell word.

* 'string' Nearly everything within the quote is literal:
 echo 'He did it, &quot;Why?&quot;'
 echo 'Because &quot;#@&amp;^:-)&quot;'
 echo '$VAR='Me

* &quot;string&quot; Like 'string' but interprets $, \, !:
 echo &quot;What's happening?&quot;
 echo &quot;I don't know but check this $ANSWER&quot;

* The backslash \ treats the following character as literal:
 echo \$VAR=Me
 echo What\'s happening\?

* How could we display the backslash?  With the following line:
 echo \\

==== Comments ====

You can add comments in a command line or a script.
Use the character #.
A white space must immediately precede #.

Examples:
 echo $HOME # Print my Home directory
 echo &quot;### PASSED ###&quot; # Only this part is a comment
 echo The key h#, not g was pressed.

== Perform basic file management ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to use the basic UNIX commands to copy, move, and remove files and directories. Tasks include advanced file management operations such as copying multiple files recursively, removing directories recursively, and moving files that meet a wildcard pattern. This includes using simple and advanced wildcard specifications to refer to files, as well as using find to locate and act on files based on type, size, or time.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;br&gt;
find&lt;br&gt;
mkdir&lt;br&gt;
mv&lt;br&gt;
ls&lt;br&gt;
rm&lt;br&gt;
rmdir&lt;br&gt;
touch&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;file globbing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

cp: Copy files and directories.
ls: List directory contents.

=== Create and Remove directories ===

To create a directory, use mkdir.

 mkdir [options] dir

Common options:
 -m  mode: set permission mode. Default use umask.
 -p  parent: create parent directory as needed.

Examples:
 mkdir -m 0700 bin
 mkdir -p bin/system/x86

To delete an empty directory, use rmdir.

 rmdir [options] dir

Common options:
 -p  parent: remove empty subdirectories.

Examples:
 rmdir  tmp
 rmdir -p bin/system/x86

=== Copy files and directories ===
To copy one file to another, or to a directory, use cp.

 cp [options] source target

Source and target can be a file or a directory.

Common options:
 -i  interactive: prompt to overwrite
 -r  recursive: copy the subdirectories and contents. Use -R for special files.
 -f  force: force the overwriting

The default is to silently clobber the target file.
Does not alter the source.

Examples:
 cp *.[a-z] /tmp
 cp readme readme.orig
 cp  ls /bin
 cp -ri bin/* /bin

=== Move &amp; Rename files ===

To rename a file or directory or to move a file or directory to another location, use mv.
 mv [options] source target
Source and target can be a file or a directory.

Common options:
 -i  interactive: prompt to overwrite
 -f  force: force the overwriting
 -v verbose
The default is to silently clobber the target file.

Examples:
 mv *.[a-z] /tmp
 mv readme readme.orig
 mv ls /bin
 mv -fi bin/* /bin

=== Listing filenames and information ===

The command to list files in the current directory is ls.
 ls [options] [filenames]
Common options are:
 -l for a long format
 -F Append a file type character
 -a All files, including hidden
 -R Recursive listing of subtree
 -d Do not descend into directory

The ls is equivalent to the dir command on DOS.

Examples of ls output:
 $ ls -l /bin/ls
 -rwxr-xr-x    1   root  root  46784 mar 23  2002 /bin/ls
 $ ls -ld /bin
 drwxr-xr-x    2 root   root   2144 nov  5 11:55 /bin
 $ ls -a .
 .bash_history .bash_profile .bashrc ...
 $ ls -dF /etc .bashrc /bin/ls
 .bashrc  /bin/ls*  /etc/

=== File types ===

The long format means:
 $ ls -l /etc/hosts    #List a long format of the file hosts
 -rw-r—r-- 1 root root 677 Jul 5 22:18 /etc/hosts
File content and location
Linux/Unix does not distinguish file by filename extension, like Windows.
To determine the file content use file.
 $ file /etc .bashrc /bin/ls /dev/cdrom
 /etc:       directory
 .bashrc:    ASCII English text
 /bin/ls:    ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
 /dev/cdrom: symbolic link to /dev/hdc

To determine if a command is a built-in shell command or a program, use type, and use which to find its location.
 $ type cp cd ls which type
 cp is /bin/cp
 cd is a shell builtin
 ls is aliased to `ls $LS_OPTIONS'
 which is aliased to `type -p'
 type is a shell builtin
 $ which cut
 /usr/bin/cut

=== Creating and using filenames ===

Filenames can be created with:
* I/O redirection
 cat chapter1 chapter2 &gt; book
* An editor, such as vi.
 vi mynewfile
* Many of the Unix utlities
 cp file newfile
* An application
 netscape
* The touch command, which creates empty files (or updates the &quot;date modified&quot; of existing files)
 touch memo

The valid filename may have:
* Maximum 255 characters per filename
* Case sensitive 'A' and 'a' are different
* Any character except forward '/'
* Recommended alphanumeric characters as well as plus, minus, and underscore characters.
* Characters to avoid
* Hypen character.
* touch my-file -lt
* White space.
 touch more drink
 touch &quot;more drink&quot;
* Most other special characters !@#$%^&amp;*():;&quot;'}{|\&lt;,&gt;.?~`
 touch memo*

=== Remove files or directories ===

To remove files or subtree directories, use rm.
 rm [options] files
Files can be a file or a directory.

Common options:
 -i  interactive: prompt to for each removal
 -f  force: force the overwriting
 -r recursive: remove subtree directories and contents
There is no unremove or undelete command.

Examples:
 rm *.[a-z]
 rm readme readme.orig
 rm  ls /bin
 rm -rfi /bin
 cd; rm -rf *  .* # !! this removes all files of in the home directory of the current user, as well as those in the subdirectories !!

=== Locating files in a subtree directory ===

To search for a file in a subtree directory, use find.
 find [subtrees] [conditions] [actions]
The command can take multiple conditions and will search recursively in the subtree.

Some  possible conditions are:
 -name [FNG] # Search fo the FNG name
 -type c  # Type of file [bcdfl]
 -size [+-]# # Has a +- size in blocks (c:bytes,k:kilo)
 -user [name] # Own by user
 -atime [+-]# # Accessed days ago +n means not been accessed for the last n days -n means been accessed the last ndays.
 -mtime [+-]# # Modified days ago
 -perm nnn # Has permision flags nnn 
Some  possible actions are:
 -print  # Print the pathname
 -exec cmd {} \; # Execute cmd on the file
 -ok cmd {} \; # Same as -exec but ask first

Examples
 find . -name '*.[ch]' -print
 find /var /tmp . -size +20 -print
 find ~ -type c -name '*sys*' -print
 find / -type f -size +2c -exec rm -i {} \;
 find / -atime -3 -print
 find ~jo ~toto -user chloe -exec mv {} /tmp \;

To locate a binary, source file, or man pages, use whereis.
 Whereis [options]
Common options:
 -b: Search only for binaries.
 -m: Search only for manual sections.
 -s: Search only for sources.
Examples:
 $ whereis host
 host: /usr/bin/host /etc/host.conf /usr/share/man/man1/host.1.gz
 $ whereis -m host
 host: /usr/share/man/man1/host.1.gz

To locate a file located somewhere defined by the PATH variable, use which.
 $ which -a ls
 /bin/ls
The -a will look for all possible matches in PATH, not just for the first one.

== Use streams, pipes, and redirects ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to redirect streams and connect them in order to efficiently process textual data. Tasks include redirecting standard input, standard output, and standard error, piping the output of one command to the input of another command, using the output of one command as arguments to another command and sending output to both stdout and a file.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;tee&lt;br&gt;
xargs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|&lt;br&gt;
` `&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Standard input and standard output ===

For each command executed in a terminal, there are:
a standard input value 0. (default keyboard)
a standard output value 1.(default terminal)
and a standard output for the errors value 2. (default terminal).

Each channel can also be identified by an address:
&amp;0 for input,
&amp;1 for output, 
And &amp;2 for errors.

Each channel [n] can be redirected.
[n]&lt; file: Default value of n is 0 and it reads standard input from file.
[n]&gt; file: Default value is 1 and it sends standard output to file, overwriting the file if it exists. (clobber)
[n]&gt;&gt;file: Default value is 1 and it appends standard output to file.
&lt;&lt;word: Read standard input until word is reached.
`command`: Substitute the command name by the result.

Examples:

 $ pwd &gt; file  # out=file in=none error=terminal.

 cat chap* &gt;book # out=book in=none error=terminal.

 mv /etc/* . 2&gt;error # out=terminal in=none error=error.

 echo end of file &gt;&gt; book # out=book in=none error=terminal.

 set -o noclobber # Shell does not clobber existing files.

 ls &gt; list 2&gt;&amp;1 # ls and errors are redirected to list.

 ls 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; list # Errors are redirected to standard output and ls output is redirected to list.

 cat `ls /etc/*.conf` &gt; conffile 2&gt;&gt;/tmp/errors

''Concatenate all the configuration files from /etc dir in  conffile and append errors in file /tmp/errors.''

Redirecting with pipes

Pipes are an efficient way to  apply multiple commandes concurrently.

 command1 | command2

The standard output of command1 will be piped to the standard input of command2.
The standard error is not piped.

Examples:
 ls -l /dev | more
 ls -l /etc/*.conf | grep user | grep 500
 ls -l /bin | mail `users`

To redirect the standard output to a file and to the terminal at the same time, use tee.
 ls -l /dev | tee file
 ls -l /etc | tee -a file # Append to the file

Building arguments

The xargs utility constructs an argument list for a command using standard input.

 xargs [options] [command]

The xargs command creates an argument list for command from standard input. It is typically used with a pipe.

Common options:
-p: prompt the user before executing each command.

Examples:
 ls f* | xargs cat # Print to standard output the content of all files starting with f.
 find ~ -name 'proj1*' print | xargs cat

''Search in the Home directory for files starting with proj1 and send it to the standard input of cat.''

Use the /dev/null device file to discard output or error messages.

Try the following:
 grep try /etc/*
 grep try /etc/* 2&gt; /dev/null
 grep try /etc/* &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null

=== Exercises ===

# Create a file list.bin that will contain all the filenames from /bin directory.
# Write a command that will append the list of files from /usr/local/bin to the file named list.bin and discard any error output.
# Split list.bin file into files that are 50 lines long and remove list.bin.
# From the splitted files create back list.bin. but with inversed order.
# Simplify the following commands:
 ls *.c | xargs rm
 ls [aA]* | xargs cat
 cat `ls *.v` 2&gt;/dev/null
# Use find to do the following command:
 more `ls *.c`
# Write a command that will create a file list.sbin with the contents of /sbin and at the same time display it to standard output.
# Create a file that within the filename you include the creation time.
# Create a file that will contain all the filename in reverse order with extension .conf from the /etc directory.

== Create, monitor, and kill processes ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to manage processes. This includes knowing how to run jobs in the foreground and background, bring a job from the background to the foreground and vice versa, start a process that will run without being connected to a terminal and signal a program to continue running after logout. Tasks also include monitoring active processes, selecting and sorting processes for display, sending signals to processes, killing processes and identifying and killing X applications that did not terminate after the X session closed.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;br&gt;
bg&lt;br&gt;
fg&lt;br&gt;
jobs&lt;br&gt;
kill&lt;br&gt;
nohup&lt;br&gt;
ps&lt;br&gt;
top&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Create processes ===

A running application is a process.
Every processes have:
A process ID.
A parent process ID.
A current directory PWD.
A file descriptor table.
A program which it is executing.
Environment variables,  inherited from its parent process.
Stdin, stdou, and stderr
Other

Bash is a program that when it is executed becomes a process.
Each time you execute a command in a shell a new process is created.
Except for the buil-in shell command. They run in the shell context. Use type to check if a command is a built-in shell command.

Example
type cp ls which type
Monitor processes
Once the system is up and running from a terminal it is possible to see which processes are running with the ps program.
To display a long format of all the processes in the system, do:

 ps -Al
 F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
 004 S     0     1     0  0  80   0 -   112 do_sel ?        00:00:04 init
 004 S     0   381     1  0  80   0 -   332 do_sel ?        00:00:00 dhcpcd
 006 S     0  1000     1  0  80   0 -   339 do_sel ?        00:00:00 inetd
 044 R     0  1524  1222  0  79   0 -   761 -      pts/3    00:00:00 ps

The ps program will display all the processes running and their PID numbers and other information.
To see a long format of the processes in your login session, do a:

 ps -l
 F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
 000 S   500  1154  1139  0  80   0 -   724 wait4  pts/1    00:00:00 bash
 002 S   500  1285  1283  0  77   0 - 24432 wait_f pts/1    00:00:00 soffice.bin
 040 R   500  1442  1435  0  79   0 -   768 -      pts/4    00:00:00 ps
 F: Process Flags 002: being created, 040: forked but didn't exec, 400: killed by a signal.
 S: Process States: R: runnable, S: sleeping, Z: zompbie
 UID: User ID, PID: Process ID, PPID: Parent Process ID, C: Scheduler, PRI: priority
 NI: Nice value, SZ: size of routine, WCHAN: name of routine

=== Monitor processes ===

To monitor the processes in real-time, use top.
top
  9:20am  up  2:48,  4 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.13, 0.09
78 processes: 75 sleeping, 3 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states: 15.3% user,  0.3% system,  0.0% nice, 84.2% idle
Mem:   254896K av,  251204K used,    3692K free,       0K shrd,   27384K buff
Swap:  514072K av,       0K used,  514072K free                  120488K cached
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND

    2 root      20   0     0    0     0 SW    0.0  0.0   0:00 keventd
RSS: The total amount of physical memory used by the task.
SHARE: The amount of shared memory used by the task.
%CPU: The task's share of  the  CPU  time.
%MEM: The task's share of the physical memory.
Once top is running it is also possible to execute interactive commands:
Type N to sort tasks by pid.
Type A to sort tasks by age (newest first).
Type P to sort tasks by CPU usage.
Type M to sort tasks by memory usage.
Type k to kill a process (prompted for pid).

=== Kill processes ===

The ps program will display all the processes running and their PID numbers.
Once the PID is known, it is possible to send signals to the process.
SIGSTOP to stop a process.
SIGCONT to continue a stopped process.
SIGKILL to kill a process.

The program to send a signal to a process is called kill.

 kill -SIGKILL [pid]
 kill -63 [pid]
 kill -l

By default a process is started in foreground and it is the only one to receive keyboard input. Use CTRL+Z to suspend it.

To start a process in backgroud use the &amp;.
 bash &amp;
 xeyes &amp;

Job control

In a bash process it is possible to start multiple jobs.
The command to manipulate jobs are:
 jobs   # List all the active jobs
 bg %job  # Resume job in background
 fg %job  # Resume job in foreground
 kill %job # Kill background job

When bash is terminated all processes that have been started from the session will receive the SIGHUP signal.
This will by default terminate the process.

To prevent the termination of a process, the program can be started with the nohup command.

 nohup mydaemon

== Modify process execution priorities ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should should be able to manage process execution priorities. Tasks include running a program with higher or lower priority, determining the priority of a process and changing the priority of a running process.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;nice&lt;br&gt;
ps&lt;br&gt;
renice&lt;br&gt;
top&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Priorities ===

To start a command with an adjusted priority, use nice.&lt;br /&gt;
'''nice -n +2 [command]'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''nice -n -19 [command]'''&lt;br /&gt;
The program '''nice''' changes the base time quantum of the scheduler.&lt;br /&gt;
i.e. it informs the scheduler how important a process is, which is used as a guide to how much CPU time to give it.&lt;br /&gt;

For example if you wanted to listen to music whilst ripping another CD, you could use '''nice -n +5 oggenc''', you shouldn’t get any “hops” in the music playback, as the scheduler “knows” the oggenc process is less important. &lt;br /&gt;

The value can go from -19 (highest priority) to +20 (lowest priority).&lt;br /&gt;
The default value is 0. Only root can set a value below zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To modify the priority of a running program, use renice.&lt;br /&gt;
'''renice +1 -u root'''&lt;br /&gt; # Change the priority for all root processes.&lt;br /&gt;
'''renice +2 -p 193 '''&lt;br /&gt; # Change the priority for PID 193&lt;br /&gt;

=== Exercises ===

3) Same start as 2) but, make the print out to stop for 3[s] and to continue for 1[s] repeatedly.
4) Make a shell script to renice all process called apache to a 19 value.
5) Do a print from ps formated as: “username”, “command”, “nice value”
6) Kill all the process called “bash” and owned by user polto..

== Regular Expression ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to manipulate files and text data using regular expressions. This objective includes creating simple regular expressions containing several notational elements. It also includes using regular expression tools to perform searches through a filesystem or file content.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;br&gt;
regexp&lt;br&gt;
sed&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Pattern matching ===

There are two kinds of pattern matching:
* Wildcards (File Name Generation)
* Regexp (Regular Expression)

Wildcard characters  are mainly applied when they are used in the current directory or subdirectories.
When wildcard characters *, ?, [ - ], ~, and ! are used in regexp they no longer generate filenames.

Some of the utilities that use regexp are:
* grep, egrep
* vi
* more
* sed
* Perl

Limited regexp search pattern
Used by all utilities using regexp.

* Any 1 char  . Ab.a  Abla or Abca
* 1 char set  [   ] Ab[sd]a  Absa or Abda only
* 1 char range [ - ] Ab[a-z]a  Abaa or Abba or ...
* Not in set  [^ ] Ab[^0-9]a  Abaa or Abba or ...
* 0 or more  * Ab*a  Absala or Aba or ...
* Begin line  ^ ^Aba  Line starts&gt;Aba
* End line  $ Aba$  Aba&lt;line ends
* Literal  \ Aba\$  Aba$

Example:
 Ab[0-3]s
 ^Ab\^bA
 [01]bin$
 ^..\\
 [^zZ]oro

Combinations of limited regexp
Combinations used by all utilities using regexp.

* Any string  .* Ab.*a  Abrahma or Abaa or ...
* String from  [   ]* th[aersti]* There or This or ...
* Multi range  [ - - ] Ab[0-2][a-c]a Ab0aa or Ab1aa or ...
* Match \  \\ \\[a-zA-Z]* \Bethoven

Examples: 
 Ab[0-3][a-z]s
 ...$
 ^[01]\^2
 [0-9][a-z] \$
 [a-zA-Z]*
 ^[^c-zC-Z]*
 ^[a-zA-Z0-9]$

Modifier patterns
Replace strings matched by regexp patterns

* Match m  \{m\}  b[0-9]\{3\} b911
* One or more \{m,\}  b[0-9]\{2,\} b52
* Up to n  \{m,n\}  b[0-9]\{2,4\} b1234
* Begining of word \&lt;  \&lt;wh  where
* End of word \&gt;  [0-9]\&gt;  bin01

=== grep ===

To find text in a file, use grep.

 grep [options] [string] [files]

Best to quote the string to prevent interpretation.

Common options:
-i: Ignore case
-l: List filename only if at least one matches
-c: Display only count of matched lines
-n: Also display line number
-v: Must not match.

Examples:
 grep host /etc/*.conf
 grep -l '\&lt;mai' /usr/include/*.h
 grep -n toto /etc/group
 grep -vc root /etc/passwd
 grep '^user' /etc/passwd
 grep '[rR].*' /etc/passwd
 grep '\&lt;[rR].*' /etc/passwd

=== sed ===

To apply a command on a stream, use sed.

 sed [address1][,address2][!]command[options] [files...]

The program sed will  apply a command from address1 to address2 in a file.
The address1 and address2 format are regular expressions.
The sed program is a noninteractive editing tool.

Examples:
 sed '1,3s/aa/bb/g' file # Replace in file from line 1 to 3 aa by bb.
 sed '/here/,$d' file # Delete line from here to the end.
 sed '/here/d' file # Delete lines with word here.
 sed '1,/xxx/p' file # Print lines from 1 to xxx.
 sed '/ll/,/ff/!s/maison/house/g' file # In file replace words maison by house excluding lines from ll to ff.

# Do “ps -aux” and replace user r_polto by root and print it in to a file called new_process.txt
# List all process called apache and owned by a usernames starting by “p” or “P”..

== Perform basic file editing using vi ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to edit text files using vi. This objective includes vi navigation, basic vi nodes, inserting, editing, deleting, copying, and finding text.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

ZZ, :w!, :q!, :e!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;:!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== vi ===

When using X-Windows, you can use mouse oriented editors such as xedit.
In a cross-development environment, users use their favorite editor.
On a non-windowing system, you only need a keyboard editor such as vi.
The vi editor on Linux is the same as on any Unix systems.
vi has two modes:
* Command mode: Anything you type will be interpreted as a command
* Input mode: Anything you type will be inserted into the file
Transition from one mode to another
Command mode to Input mode: i, I, a, A, o, O keys
Input mode to Command mode: ESC key
The default starting mode is the Command mode
The file configuration .exrc can be created in your HOME directory to setup some vi behavior.

== Create partitions and filesystems ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure disk partitions and then create filesystems on media such as hard disks. This objective includes using various mkfs commands to set up partitions to various filesystems, including ext2, ext3, reiserfs, vfat, and xfs.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;fdisk&lt;br&gt;
mkfs&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Partitions ===

Media can be divided into partitions.
Partitions are usually created at installation time but can also be created with the fdisk program or other utilities.
This will divide the media in partitions and different filesystems can be built and different operating systems can be installed.

IDE is recognized as follows:

* Primary Master:
::/dev/hda  : Full disk
::/dev/hda1: First partition
::/dev/hda2: Second partition
* Primary Slave: /dev/hdb
* Secondary Master: /dev/hdc
* Secondary Slave: /dev/hdd

SCSI is recognized as follows:

* ID1:
::/dev/sda: Full disk
::/dev/sda1: First partition
*ID2: /dev/sdb

USB and FireWire disks are recognized as SCSI disks.

Once it is partitioned it is possible to build a filesystem on every partition.

=== Filesystems ===

Filesystems exist to allow you to store, retrieve and manipulate data on a media.
Filesystems maintain an internal data structure (meta-data) that keeps all you data organized and accessible.
The structure of this meta-data gives the characteristic of the filesystem.
A filesystem is accessed by a driver through the organized meta-data structure.
When Linux boots it reads in /etc/fstab all the filesystems that needs to be mounted and checks if they are in an usable state.

When a power failure occurs Linux won't be able to unmout the filesystem properly and some data in the cache won't be synchronized on the media.
The meta-data may be corrupted.

Once you reboot the system, it will detect this and do a fsck to the full meta-data structure for a consistency check.
This can take a very long time. Few minutes to few hours in proportion of the media size.
Journaling a filesystem is adding a new data structure called a journal.
This journal is on-disk and before each modification to the meta-data is made by the driver it is first written into the journal.
Before each meta-data modification the journal maintains a log of the next operation.

Now, when a power failure occurs there is only the need to check the journal.
A journaling filesystem recovery is very fast. It just needs to go through the logs and fix the latest operation.
Journaling filesystem recovery can take only few seconds.

On a cluster systems, journaling allows to quickly recover a shared partition of a node that went down.

=== Linux filesystems ===

* ext2: Old very stable Linux filesystem. Efficient for files larger than ~2-3K.
* ext3: Journaling extension for ext2. Possible to move a filesystem back and forth between ext2 and ext3.
* Reiserfs: Journaling filesystem. 8-15 time faster than ext2 when manipulating small files.
* XFS: A powerfull journaling filesystem with possible quota and ACL
* Msdos: MS-Windows FAT filesystem type. (mainly used for floppy)
* Vfat: MS-Windows FAT filesystem type. (mainly used for large hdd partitions)
* NTFS (ReadOnly but loop files): MS-Windows journaling filesystem
* SMBFS: A filesystem to mount windows or samba sharing from Linux
* NFS: Network File System
...

=== Filesystem tree ===

A Linux file system has one top directory called root (/) where all sub directories of the entire system is stored.
The sub directories can be another partition, a remote directory, or a remote partition accessible through the network with NFS protocol.

=== Create filesystems ===

To create a file system on a partition, use mkfs.

 mkfs [options] -t [fstype] device [blocksize]

Common options:
:-t: fstype: File system type.
:-c : Check the device for bad blocks before building the filesystem.

The full partition will be erased and organized to the type of filesystem requested. There is no undo command.
The fstype possible are:
msdos, ext2, ext3, reiserfs,minix,xfs

The blocksize allows to customize the block size for your filesystem.

Examples:
 mkfs -t msdos /dev/fd0
 mkfs -t reiserfs /dev/hdd1  4096

==== Create extended filesystems ====

To create a extended (ext2, ext3) filesystem on an partition, use mke2fs.

 mke2fs [options] device [blocksize]

Common options:
:-b: Specify the block sizefstype: File system type.
:-c : Check the device for bad blocks before building the filesystem.
:-j: Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal.
:-L: Set the volume label for the filesystem.

With mke2fs it is possible to store the super-block the journal information on another device.
Examples:

 mkefs -b 2048 /dev/fd0 -L floppy
 mkfs -V
 mke2fs 1.26 (3-Feb-2002) Using EXT2FS Library version 1.263

=== Monitoring disk usage ===

To print the disk usage, use du.

 du [options] [files...]

Common options:
:-a: All files not just directories
:-b: Print size in bytes
:-c: Total
:-h: Human readable format. (1K, 20M,...)

Examples:

 $ du -ch Documents
 112k    Documents/Cours/LPI101
 4.0k    Documents/Cours/LPI102
 4.0k    Documents/Cours/LPI201
 4.0k    Documents/Cours/LPI202
 124k    total

 du -sk ~ # Sums up your total disk usage in kilobytes

 du -ak ~ | sort -n more # Display every file and its disk space in numerical order.

=== Filesystem disk space ===

A filesystem is composed of a meta-data structure plus a list of blocks.
To print the filesystem disk space usage, use df.

 df [options] [files...]

Common options:
:-a: All included filesystems with 0 blocks.
:-t: Limit listing to a filesystem type.
:-h: Human readable format. (1K, 20M,...)

Examples:

 $ df -t reiserfs -h
 F           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/hda3             28771528   3121536  25649992  11% /

 $ df -t ext2 -h
 Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 /dev/hda1              15M  3.8M   10M  27% /boot

== Maintain the integrity of filesystems ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to verify the integrity of filesystems, monitor free space and inodes, and repair simple filesystem problems. This objective includes the commands required to maintain a standard filesystem, as well as the extra data associated with a journaling filesystem.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;du&lt;br&gt;
df&lt;br&gt;
fsck&lt;br&gt;

=== Checking filesystems ===

To check filesystems consistency, use fsck.

 fsck [options] -t [fstype] device [fsck-options]

Common options:
:-A:  Go through the /etc/fstab file and try to check all file systems. Typically  used  at boot time from a script.
:-t fslist:  Specify the type of file system to be checked. With -A,  only  filesystems  that match fslist are checked
:-C: Display completion/progression bar.

Common fsck-options:
:-a: Automatically repair.
:-r: Interactively repair.

Examples:

==== Checking extended filesystems ====

To check extended filesystems consistency, use e2fsck.

 e2fsck [options] device

Common options:
:-b: Use an alternate super block filename.
:-c: This option makes badblocks program to run and marks all the bad blocks.
:-f: Force checking even if the filesystem seems clean.
:-a or -p: Automatically repair.
:-y: non-interactive mode

Examples:

 e2fsck -ay /dev/fd0
 e2fsck -f /dev/hda2

=== Debugging extended filesystems ===

The debugfs program is an interactive file system debugger. It can be used to examine and change the state of an ext2 file system.

 debugfs device

Common commands:
:Help: Give an help on all the command available.
:Stats: Give a statistics of the media.
:Stat file: Give a statistic of the file on the media.

== Attach and detach filesystems ==

* Control mounting and unmounting filesystems

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure the mounting of a filesystem. This objective includes the ability to manually mount and unmount filesystems, configure filesystem mounting on bootup, and configure user mountable removable filesystems such as tape drives, floppies, and CDs.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;mount&lt;br&gt;
umount&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Attach a filesystem ===

The mount command serves to attach the file system found on some  device to the big file tree.

 mount [options]
 mount [options] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir

If the device or directory is listed in /etc/fstab you can use the following:

 mount [options] [-o options [,...]] device | dir

Normally only root has the priviledge to mount devices unless it is specified in the /etc/fstab file.
Examples:
 # Print all the mounted filesystems (/etc/mtab).
 mount

 # Mount devices or dirs listed in /etc/fstab.
 mount -a

 # Mount /dev/hdc partition in read only mode without updating /etc/mtab.
 mount -n -o ro /dev/hdc /mnt

 # Allow a user to mount the CDROM if the following line is in /etc/fstab:
 # /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide
 mount /media/cdrom 
 mount /dev/cdrom

 # Sync in realtime
 mount -o sync /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

=== Detach a filesystem ===

To detach a filesystem from the file tree, use umount.

 umount [options]
 umount [options] [-o options [,...]] device | dir

A busy filesystem cannot be unmounted.
* Open files
* Working directory of a process.

Examples:
 umount -a # Unmount devices or dirs listed in /etc/fstab.
 umount /mnt # Unmount the filesystem attached to /mnt.
 umount /media/cdrom  # Allow a user to unmount the CDROM if the following line is in /etc/fstab:
 /dev/cdrom  /media/cdrom  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide

=== File system information ===

The file /etc/fstab contains all the file sytems and related information that will be used when doing a mount -a. (Boot time)

The file /etc/mtab is maintained by the kernel and keeps track on what is or isn't mounted.
The /etc/fstab format is:

 #Device     Mount point    Fs type  Options             1 2
 /dev/hda3   /              reiserfs defaults            1 2
 /dev/hda1   /boot          ext2     defaults            1 2
 /dev/cdrom  /media/cdrom   auto     ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0
 usbdevfs    /proc/bus/usb  usbdevfs noauto              0 0
 /dev/hda2   swap           swap     pri=42              0 0

Common options:
:ro:      read only
:noauto:  Don't mount automatically
:exec:    Can execute binary on the filesystem
:suid:    Allow to setuser bit
:user:    Allow a user to mount/unmount it
:unhide:  hidden file visible
:async:   All operations will be done asynchronously
:default: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async

=== Exercises ===

#* Issue the following command:
#* Tar cvf /dev/fd0 /etc/*.conf
#* Try to mount it back. What's happening?
#* Use tar to view the contents of the floppy..

== Managing disk quota ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to manage disk quotas for users. This objective includes setting up a disk quota for a filesystem, editing, checking, and generating user quota reports.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;quota&lt;br&gt;
edquota&lt;br&gt;
repquota&lt;br&gt;
quotaon&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

* Managing quotas for filesystems
* Printing quota reports
* Managing disk quota

=== Quotas ===

On a system, root can manage the useage of disk space per user and per filsystems.
The two limits that can be setup are:
The soft limit (soft =) specifies the maximum amount of disk usage a quota user is allowed to have.
The hard limit (hard =) specifies the absolute limit on the disk usage a quota user can't go beyond it.
There is also the possibility to setup a grace period that will enforce the soft limit only after an amount of time specified.

=== Setting up quotas for users ===

1) The keyword usrquota or/and grpquota must be added in file /etc/fstab for the partition interested.

 /dev/fd0  /home/yann/mnt auto    rw,noauto,user,usrquota 0 0
 /dev/hda5 /home     ext2    defaults,usrquota,grpquota 1 2

2) Add in each root filesystems the file user.quota or/and group.quota.

 touch /mnt/aquota.user
 touch /home/aquota.user
 touch /home/aquota.group 
 chmod 600  /mnt/aquota.user 
 chmod 600  /home/aquota.user 
 chmod 600  /home/aquota.group

Only root can do the quota administration and once the empty files have been created some disk quota can be set such as:
* Soft limitation on number of files and inodes.
* Hard limitation on number of files and inodes if the grace time is set.

=== Setting up quotas for users ===

3) Check the setting

 quotacheck -v mnt
 quotacheck: Scanning /dev/fd0 [/home/yann/mnt] done
 quotacheck: Checked 6 directories and 1 files

4) Enable quota on the disk

 quotaon -av
 /dev/fd0 [/home/yann/mnt]: user quotas turned on

5) Customize the disk quota limits:

 $ edquota -u yann
 Disk quotas for user yann (uid 500):
 Filesystem    locks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard
 /dev/fd0       15          0          0          4        0        0

 $ edquota -g yann 

 $ edquota -t
 Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users:
 Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds
 Filesystem             Block grace period     Inode grace period
 /dev/fd0                      7days                  7days

=== List quotas ===

To list quotas for an user or group, use quota.

 quota [options] [user|group]

Common options:
:-u:Default, print user quotas.
:-g:Print group quotas for the group of which the user is a member.
:-q: Print a more terse message, containing only  information on filesystems where usage is over quota.

Example:
 quota -u yann

==== Display a quota report ====

To display a quota report, use repquota.

 repquota [options] [user|group]

Common options:
:-a: Report on all filesystems indicated in /etc/mtab to be read-write with quotas.
:-g: Report for group.

Example:

 $ repquota /dev/fd0
 *** Report for user quotas on device /dev/fd0
 Block grace time: 7days; Inode grace time: 7days
                 Block limits                   File limits
 User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 root   --       8       0       0              2     0     0
 yann   --      15       0       0              4     0     0

=== Exercises ===

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]]

# Setup a soft limitation for any users that have their home directory in /home to 500M.
# Change the grace time to 0.
# Log as the user and check if the limitation works..

== File Permissions and Security ==

=== Overview ===

Unix File Security
File and Directory Permissions
Default Permissions
Changing File Permissions
Changing File Owner and Group
More Privileges
Unix file security
The biggest security problem may be you.
You own any directory or files you created.
You are responsible for accessibility of your files.
You decide who can access which files and directories.

In your home directory you will be able to grant different levels of permission to yourself, users in your group and the all other users.

=== File and Directory Permissions ===

The permission of a file or of a directory can be viewed with ls -l.

==== File permissions ====

Examples of file permissions:

 ls -l readme
 -rwxrw---- 1 toto users 14 Jul 5 10:00 readme

This means read,write, and execution permissions for user toto, read and write permissions for members of group users. No permissions for others. (0760)

 ls -l /etc/hosts
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14 Jul 5 10:00 /etc/hosts

This means read and write permissions for user root, read permissions for members of group root and all others. (0644)

Examples of directory permissions:

 ls -ld /bin
 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 5 10:00 /bin

This means read,write, and execution permissions for user root, read and execution permissions for members of group root and others. (0755)

 ls -l /home/toto
 drwxr-xr-x 10 toto  users 4096 Jul 5 1:00 /home/toto

This means read, write, and execution permissions for user toto, read and execution permissions for members of group users and others. (0755)

=== Default permissions ===

The default permissions when creating a file are 0666 and when creating a directory are 0777.
Most of the systems overwrite this at boot time with the program umask.
Generally the mask value is 022. It means the write for group and other will be blocked.
To check or change the mask value, do:

 umask 
 umask 066  

Examples for file:
 default: rw- rw- rw- (0666)
 umask: 0 2 2 (0022) Block
 result: rw- r-- r-- (0644)

Examples for directory:
 default: rwx rwx rwx (0777)
 umask: 0 2 2 (0022) Block
 result: rwx r-x r-x (0755)

=== Changing file permissions ===

To change permissions on a file or directory, use chmod.
To overwrite the existing permissions, do:

 chmod 0755 /tmp #rwx for user, rx for group and others

To change add or cancel some permissions without overwriting all the existing permissions, do:

 chmod u+w readme  # Add write permission for user
 chmod +r readme  # Add read permission for everybody
 chmod -r readme  # Remove read permission for everybody
 chmod u+x,g=r readme  # Add execution for user and set read for group
 chmod u=rwx,go=rx readme  # Set read write and execution for user, read and execution for group and others

To change in recursive mode, use the -R option.

 chmod -R +x /sbin/*

== Manage file ownership ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to control user and group ownership of files. This objective includes the ability to change the user and group owner of a file as well as the default group owner for new files.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;chmod&lt;br&gt;
chown&lt;br&gt;
chgrp&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Changing file owner and group ===

To change the owner of a file or directory, use chown.

 chown yann mon_fichier.txt

To change the group of a file or directory, use chgrp.

 chgrp dialout caller

The programs gpasswd and yast2 allow you to administrate groups.

gpasswd [-A user,...] [-M user,...] group
:-A: Add users with group administrator privileges.
:-M: Add members in group.

Group administrators can add or delete members of the group

 gpasswd -d toto users
 gpasswd -a toto users

Group administrators can set or remove the password for the group.

 gpasswd users
 gpasswd -r users

=== More privileges ===

It is possible to give more privileges to an user when it executes a particular script or program by setting the uid or gid bit of the file.

If the bit is set, the process will inherit the permissions of the owner of the file not the permissions of the user.
To set the effective uid or gid, use chmod.

 chmod 2640 [file] # (2) gid is inheritable for group.
 chmod 4640 [file] # (4) uid is inheritable for user.

Example of such program is /bin/passwd.

The sticky bit can also be set and can make the program text segment resident in RAM.
chmod 1640 [file] (1) The file program stays in RAM.

=== Exercises ===

1) Write the command line by using letters with chmod to set the following permissions:

 rwxrwxr-x :
 rwxr--r-- :
 r--r----- :
 rwxr-xr-x :
 rwxr-xr-x :
 r-x--x--x :
 -w-r----x :
 -----xrwx :

2) Write the command line by using octal numbers with chmod to set the following permissions:

 rwxrwxrwx :
 --x--x--x :
 r---w---x :
 -w------- :
 rw-r----- :
 rwx--x--x :

3) With the following umask values what would be the files and directories creation permissions?

 umask = 0027
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

 umask = 0011
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

 umask = 0541
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

 umask = 0777
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

4) Create two user accounts

Logging in id: tst1, group users, with bash shell, home directory /home/tst1 &lt;br/&gt;
Logging in id: tst2, group public, with bash shell, home directory /home/tst2 &lt;br/&gt;
For the two accounts set a password.

Logging in as tst1 and copy /bin/ls into tst1 home directory as myls.  Change the owner of myls to tst1 and the permissions to 0710. What does this permission value mean?

Logging in as tst2 and try to use /home/tst1/myls to list your current directory. Does it work ?

Create in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow a new group labo with tst1 and tst2. Change the owner group of myls to labo.

Try again from tst2 account to execute /home/tst1/myls to list your current directory. Does it work?.

== Hard and symbolic links ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to create and manage hard and symbolic links to a file. This objective includes the ability to create and identify links, copy files through links, and use linked files to support system administration tasks.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;ln&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Links ===

Use link when:
You want to create a pathname to a file. 
Set a shorter or fixed pathname to a file.

To link one file to another, use ln:

 ln [options] filename linkname
 ln [options] filename linkdirectory

Common options:
:-f  force: clobber existing link
:-s symbolic link

The default links are hard links (ln without an option).
On Windows they're called shortcuts.
A hard link can only be created to an existing file on the same physical device, after creation no visible association can be displayed between a link name and a file name.
A symbolic link can be created on a file that doesn’t exist yet, the association between the link name and the file name can be viewed with the ls command.

=== Linking to a file ===

The symbolic and hard link can be displayed with ls -l.
Symbolic link are indicated with an arrow: link_name-&gt;real_filename.

 $ ls -l /dev/midi
 lrwxrwxrwx   1   root   root        6    Jul 4 21:50   /dev/midi -&gt; midi00

Hard links are indicated with the number of links counter (3-1=2 in this case).

 $ ls -l readme
 -rwxrwxrwx   3   yann   users       677  Jul 4 21:50   readme

When removing a link name, use rm.
Only the link will be removed not the linked file.

* 1.110.1 Install &amp; Configure XFree86
* 1.110.2 Setup a display manager|Setup a display manager
* 1.110.4 Install &amp; Customize a Window Manager Environment

== Install &amp; Configure XFree86 ==

=== Overview ===

X is a windowing system that provides the basic graphic functions of Linux.
It's designed to provide a GUI to any other systems operating across a network, regardless of OS.

X operates on a client/server model.

X is not part of the operating system. It is an application.

The standard Linux X server is Xfree86.

The XFree86 log file is located at /var/log/XFree86.0.log.

=== Configuration ===

type &quot;XFree86 -configure&quot;, it will scan your hardware and auto. generate a configuration file matching to your hardware. However, FOR PS/2 MOUSE, I usually need to modify this config file manually from &quot;&quot;Device&quot; &quot;/dev/mouse&quot;&quot; to &quot;&quot;Device&quot; &quot;/dev/psaux&quot;&quot;

=== Starting and stopping X ===

To start X you can use:&lt;br&gt;
''startx'' - terminal command used at level 3;&lt;br&gt;
''edit /etc/inittab'' to run default at level 5;&lt;br&gt;
''xinit'' - when there is no .xinitrc file;&lt;br&gt;
''init 5'' - to change manually runlevel to 5 (and run display manager);&lt;br&gt;
''xdm'' - (X Display Manager) - graphical login manager, which run automatically at boot process when starting Linux at level 5 (there are also external graphical login managers ex. kdm, gdm).&lt;br&gt;

To stop X you can use:
&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
''init 3'' - at lower level than 5 Linux will stop X Window;&lt;br&gt;
kill the XFree process.

Configuring X
To configure X on a system use XF86Setup.
The program will generate a configuration file that will be used by the XFree86 server.
To tune the screen under X use Xfine2.

Under X, the user can configure every conceivable aspect of graphic display.
Screen font size, styles
Pointer behaviour
Screen colors
Window manager

The tunning can be done on a system-wide or per-user. .xinitrc contains the default window manager and style information to be used by the ''startx'' command. This file is usually located under /home/username when defined on a per-user basis.
.Xdefaults used to setup pointer behaviour, colors, fonts, etc...

=== Exercises ===

== Setup a display manager ==

=== Overview ===

X needs window managers to manipulate all the graphic applications.
Move, size.
Open and close.
Maximize, minimize, iconize.
Title bars
The look and feel is implemented in the window manager.&lt;u&gt;&lt;small&gt;shouldn't this be in Widget sets not WMs?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
Provide virtual desktops.
Linux distributions contain many window managers:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fvwm2  Motif-like look, highly customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WindowMaker Next Step look, fast and lean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wm2  Ultra lean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olwm  Open look (Sun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluxbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlackBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The desktops bring on top of X Window managers more facilities:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.kde.org KDE]: based on Qt, current at the top of market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.gnome.org GNOME]: The &quot;GNU&quot; Desktop, based on Gtk+-v2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Networked X ==

=== Overview ===

X works in a client-server relationship where the application is the client and the server is the application that knows how to provide the services.
On a single system, both applications reside on the same system.
On a networked system the user can run an X application which is installed on a remote system and do the display on a local system.
The advantage of having a X application server is:
No local applications installation is needed.
No need to have performant local system.
No local access to data.

=== Networked X ===

Exporting a simple application : 
In order to do so do:
startx  on the serverhost.
xhost + Enable lack of identification on the server host.
telnet serverhost from the clienthost and set the DISPLAY variable to the clienthost.
Export DISPLAY=clienthost:0.0

Exporting the window manager : 
In order to do so do:
Activate xdmcp whith gdmsetup on the server
Use Xnest to connect the client on the server in broadcast

Chinese, like all languages, has its own set of unique greetings which may be seemingly strange to learners of the language (this is particularly true if the two cultures are vastly different). Below, you will find commonly-used Mandarin greetings and farewells, along with corresponding [[Pinyin|pinyin]] pronunciations.

==Hello==

*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;你好。&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nee hǎu]]&lt;/span&gt;; The standard &quot;hello&quot; greeting. Literally means &quot;you good.&quot;
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;您好。&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nin hǎu]]&lt;/span&gt;; The same &quot;hello&quot; greeting as above, except that &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;您 ([[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|nín]])&lt;/span&gt;, like in many European languages, is the polite form of &quot;you&quot;, used when addressing elders, or teachers etc.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;你好嗎?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nee hǎu ma?]]&lt;/span&gt;; More often used following a greeting than not, however, this can be used as a &quot;hello&quot; by itself. 
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;您好嗎?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nín hǎu ma?]]&lt;/span&gt;; The same as the &quot;&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;Nǐ hǎo ma?&lt;/span&gt;&quot; above, again, except that this is used as a more polite form.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;你怎麼樣?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nǐ dzěmuhyàng?]]&lt;/span&gt;; &quot;What's up?&quot;, &quot;How are you doing?&quot;
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;幸會&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#X|Xìnghuì]]!&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Nice to meet you!&quot;
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;久仰&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#J|Jiǔyǎng]]&lt;/span&gt;; An extremely polite greeting that is not commonly used between friends, but rather between professionals meeting for the first time. 
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;久聞大名&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#J|Jiǔwéndàmíng]]&lt;/span&gt;; This greeting should be reserved for use towards those whom you have ''extreme'' respect for. Literal translation: &quot;Your name is famous&quot; / &quot;I have heard much about you&quot;

==Good morning==
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;早安&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#Z|Dzǎo-anh]]&lt;/span&gt;; Literally &quot;Peace this morning&quot;.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;早&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#Z|Dzǎo]]&lt;/span&gt;; Also good morning. 

==Good afternoon==
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;午安&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#W|ǔ-anh]]&lt;/span&gt;; ''note'': seldom used in the Mainland. Mostly used in the Republic of China and the rest of the Chinese speaking world.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;下午好&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#X|Xìa-ǔ hǎo]]!&lt;/span&gt; Seldom used in the Republic of China and in the Chinese speaking world.

==Good evening / Good night==
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;晚安&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#W|Wǎn-anh]]&lt;/span&gt;; Literally &quot;Peace at night&quot;, Good night.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;晚上好&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#W|Wǎnshang hǎo]]&lt;/span&gt;; Good evening!

==Good-bye==
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;再見&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#Z|Dzàijien]]&lt;/span&gt;; Literally &quot;See you again&quot;.

*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;拜拜&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#B|Baibái]]&lt;/span&gt;; From English &quot;Bye-Bye&quot;. Widely used in Hong Kong, Taiwan (ROC) and most urbanised parts of mainland China. &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;掰掰&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;(Baibái)&lt;/span&gt; is the variant character form that is gaining popularity in ROC.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;回頭見&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#H|Huítów jien]]&lt;/span&gt;: roughly equivalent to &quot;see you soon&quot;, used in northern China.

==Grammar==

===The adverb &lt;u&gt;Hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很]===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Though translated as &quot;very&quot;, &lt;u&gt;Hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很] has a weaker meaning than it does in English. It is often added before a single-syllable adjective just to enhance the rhythmic flow of the sentence. &lt;u&gt;Hěn&lt;/u&gt; is used before the adjective in affirmative sentences, but ''not'' in negative sentences or questions. A common mistake of beginners is to insert &lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt; [是] into adjectival sentences, but this usage is incorrect as &lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt; can only be used to equate combinations of nouns, noun phrases and pronouns.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;

1. 我很忙。
:Wǒ hěn máng
:''I am (very) busy.''

===&lt;u&gt;Le&lt;/u&gt; [了] as emphasizer===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;le&lt;/u&gt; [了] has many different functions in Chinese, but in this case, it serves to add emphasis to the verb or adjective of the sentence. It can be seen paired with &lt;u&gt;tài&lt;/u&gt; [太] to express excessiveness.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;

1. 太多了。
: Tài duō le.
: (That's) too many.

2. 太少了。
: Tài shăo le.
: (That's) too few.

===Affirmative-negative questions===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | A sentence can be made into a question by having both affirmative and negative options together. To answer in the affirmative, the verb or adjective is repeated. (An affirmative adjective in this case is usually preceded by &lt;u&gt;hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很] to avoid a comparative tone.) Responding in the negative is simply saying &quot;not verb&quot; or &quot;not adjective&quot;.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + V 不 V + O?
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Because the &lt;u&gt;bù&lt;/u&gt; in affirmative-negative questions is often said quickly, marking the tone on &lt;u&gt;bù&lt;/u&gt; is not strictly necessary in their case.
|-
|}
Q: 他是不是东尼？
:Tā shì bu shì Dōngní?
:''Is he Tony?''
:literally, &quot;he is/is not Tony?&quot;
A: 是的。（是，他是/嗯，他是。）'''or''' 不是。 （不，他不是。）
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; is not necessary. You can simply answer &lt;u&gt;是&lt;/u&gt; (&lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt;). 
|-
|}
:Shì de. (Shì tā shì) '''or''' Bú shì (Bù tā bú shì).
:''Yes (he is).'' '''or''' ''No (he isn't).''

&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + adj. 不 adj.? （The second adjective can be omitted.）
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
Q:艾美今天忙不忙？/艾美今天忙不？
:Àiměi jīntiān máng bù （máng）? 
:''Is Amy busy today?''
:literally, &quot;Today, Amy busy/not busy&quot;
A: 她很忙。'''or''' 她不忙。
:Tā hěn máng. '''or''' Tā bù máng.
:''Yes, she's (very) busy.'' '''or''' ''No, she's not busy.''

===Sentences using &lt;u&gt;yǒu&lt;/u&gt; [有]===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Yǒu&lt;/u&gt; [有] means ''to have'' and indicates possession.
|}&lt;br&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + 有 + O
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
我有三门课。
:Wǒ yǒu sān mén kè.
:''I have three classes.''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Yǒu&lt;/u&gt; is negated when preceded by &lt;u&gt;méi&lt;/u&gt; [没].
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + 没 + 有 + O
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
今天，他们没有课。
:Jīntiān tāmen méi yǒu kè.
:''Today, they don't have any classes.''

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Yǒu&lt;/u&gt; is negated when preceded by &lt;u&gt;méi&lt;/u&gt; [没].

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + 一 + O + 都没有
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example: &lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The adverb &lt;u&gt;都&lt;/u&gt; (&lt;u&gt;dōu&lt;/u&gt;) is required here in front of 没有 to emphasize the lack of a single one of the object. Also, be sure to remember to place the proper measure word between  一 and the object.
|-
|}
今天，他们一门课都没有。
:Jīntiān tāmen yì mén kè dōu méi yǒu.
:''Today, they don't have a single class.''

= Lesson 3: 助詞 =
The Chinese language employs heavy usage of particles to modify the meaning of characters and sentences. Since Chinese has neither inflections nor tense, the mastery of particles is an absolute must if one is to fully comprehend both written and spoken Chinese. Below, you will find some of the most common particles in everyday Chinese.

== The &lt;u&gt;De&lt;/u&gt; {的} particle ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; [的] can be used to indicate possession. It is roughly equivalent to the contraction &quot;X's&quot; in English, where X is the subject.
|}

Example:
       她  的   名字   是   金妮。
        Tā de míngzi shì Jīnní.
       Her name is Ginny.
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | sometimes &quot;的&quot; is suffixed to a word to indicate that it's used as an adjective.
|}



Example 她是一个美丽的姑娘
         Tā shì yīge měilì de gū’niang.
        She is a beautiful girl.

where &quot;美丽&quot; &quot;beautiful&quot; is an adjective, and

Example 研究是一个科学的过程
        Yánjīu shì yígè kēxué dè guòchéng
        Researching is a scientific process. 

and where &quot;科学&quot; is a noun in Chinese and is turned into adjective using &quot;的&quot;.

== The &lt;u&gt;Le&lt;/u&gt; {了} / &lt;u&gt;Liăo&lt;/u&gt; {了} particle ==

'''Perfective Aspect Particle'''


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The {了} particle is used mainly to indicate a '''completed action''' (this overlaps somewhat with the English ''perfect aspect'', i.e. &quot;to have gone&quot;, &quot;to have eaten&quot;).
|}
Example:

       他  走  了。
        Tā zŏu le.
       He has gone. 
 
※The &quot;le&quot; here is used to modify 走 (zŏu, ''to go'') into an action which has already been completed.


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The {了} can also be used as an '''imperative''', that is, a command which is issued by the subject
|}
Example:

       別   再   打扰  我  了! 
       別   再   打擾  我  了! 
       Bié zài dărăo wŏ le! 
       Do not bother me again!

※In this instance, le is used in conjunction with bié (&quot;do not&quot;) to form an imperative. ''Note'': most imperatives are not formed using this construction.


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The {了} , as in Liăo (a homographic variant) can be used to indicate the subject's '''capability''' in doing such and such.
|}
Example:

       我  实在    吃  不  了   了。
       我  實在    吃  不  了   了。 
        Wŏ shízài chī bù liăo le. 
       I cannot possibly eat any more.



At first glance, this sentence may seem a bit daunting as it includes two instances of the le particle, paired side-by-side. However, the first le is understood to be liăo given its placement (bù + le is a nonsensical pairing). Therefore, liăo serves to indicate the capability of eating any further and le ''emphasizes'' this assertion.

== The &lt;u&gt;Zhe&lt;/u&gt; [着] particle showing continuation ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;Zhe&lt;/u&gt; [着] is used after a verb to show that the action is in progress or that the results from that action are continuing.
|}
1.  他睡着觉时有人敲门。
:Tā shuìzhe jiào shí yǒurén qiāomén
:''While he was sleeping, someone knocked on the door.''&lt;br&gt;
: For this sentence, you can take out &quot;着&quot; and say &quot;他睡觉时有人敲门。&quot; as &quot;时&quot; means &quot;while&quot; here.

== The &lt;u&gt;Zháo&lt;/u&gt; [着] particle indicating accomplishment ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;Zháo&lt;/u&gt; [着] is used after a verb to show accomplishment or result. 

Note: It is not to be confused with the identically written particle Zhe, which shows continuation (Lesson 3).
|}

1. 我终于把东西买着了! 
  (我終於把東西買著了!) 

:Wŏ zhōngyú bă dōngxī măi zháo le.
:''I've finally been able to buy this item!'' &lt;br/&gt;
And another word, &lt;u&gt;dào&lt;/u&gt; [到], can be seen as a substitution for 着, in most cases they are interchangeable. 

2. 他在行窃时被当场抓到。
:Tā zài xíng qìe shí beì dāng chǎng zhuā dào.
:He was(is) caught in the act of stealing.

The 把 + N + V + 着(到)了 construction is particularly useful and should be studied.

== The &lt;u&gt;De&lt;/u&gt; [得] particle indicating degree ==

|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; [得] is used in few special constructs to indicate degree of complement (how fast, how early, how expensive, etc.). It has no equivalent in English but must be used to indicate the meanings below.
|}
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + V + 得 + adjective
|}
1. 我说得很好.
:Wŏ shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak very well.''
This construct often requires a context to gain its full meaning. 

If you wish to speak more specifically about an action, the two constructs below demonstrate the use of 得 with a direct object.

2. 我说中文说得很好.
:Wŏ shuō zhōngwén shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak Chinese very well.''
Note the dual-use of the verb.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;

|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | O + S + V + 得 + adjective
|}
3. 中文我说得很好.
:Zhōngwén wŏ shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak Chinese very well.''
This construct emphasizes the object (here being &quot;Chinese&quot;).

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + O + V + 得 + adjective
|}
4. 我中文说得很好.
:Wŏ zhōngwén shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak Chinese very well.''
This expression is the simplification of the 2nd expression by eliminating the 1st verb. This form is even more frequently used than the 2nd expression above.

==Synopsis==
This book attempts to teach the skills that can help you to have lucid dreams &amp;mdash; dreams in which one knows he or she is dreaming. For the skeptical, lucid dreams have been [[w:Lucid_dream#Scientific history|scientifically demonstrated]] to exist. The ability to lucid dream will open your mind to a world of infinite possibilities as you become adept at taking control of your dreams.

We will start by explaining how lucid dreaming works biologically. Next, the book will prepare you for lucid dreaming by helping you to remember more of your dreams (dream recall). You will then learn a variety of ways of becoming, and staying, lucid. Finally, you will find suggested activities to try while in the dream world...

=Lesson 4: Word order and Verbs=
==Basic Word Order==
===Subject-Verb-Object===
The order of most Chinese sentences, like in English, is S-V-O, that is '''S'''ubject-'''V'''erb-'''O'''bject.

:我看这本书。
:我看這本書。
:Wǒ kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I read this book.''

Word order in Chinese is more rigid than in English. However, sometimes you may find sentences that seem to defy normal word order. For example, 我住在中国。wǒ zhù zài zhōngguó. The English translation does this too: I live in China. The reason for this is that &quot;in China&quot; is a preposition (prepositions indicate place or time) that is tacked on to the main sentence—&quot;I live.&quot;
More examples:

:下午一点半，我们走。
:Xiàwǔ yīdiǎn bàn, wǒmen zǒu.
:''At 1:30 in the afternoon, we'll go.''

:在青岛，我看到了。
:Zài qīngdǎo, wǒ kàn dào le.
:''In Qingdao, I saw it.''

As in English, a preposition can also appear after a subject.

:我在我家看这本书。
:我在我家看這本書。
:Wǒ zài wǒ jiā kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I read this book at my house.''

:我明天看这本书。
:我明天看這本書。
:Wǒ míngtiān kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I will read this book tomorrow.''

When using both a preposition for time and a preposition for place, put the preposition for time first.

:我明天在我家看这本书。
:我明天在我家看這本書。
:Wǒ míngtiān zài wǒ jiā kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I will read this book at my house tomorrow.''

:明天在我家，我看这本书。
:明天在我家，我看這本書。
:Míngtiān zài wǒ jiā, wǒ kàn zhè běn shū.
:''Tomorrow at my house, I will read this book.''

:明天，我在我家看这本书。
:明天，我在我家看這本書。
:Míngtiān, wǒ zài wǒ jiā kàn zhè běn shū.
:''Tomorrow, I will read this book at my house.''

Note the variation in word order. You can also place a preposition for place, but not for time, at the end of a sentence.

:我看这本书在我家。
:我看這本書在我家。
:Wǒ kàn zhè běn shū zài wǒ jiā.
:''I read this book at my house.''

===Topic-Comment===
Another structure for Chinese sentences is topic-comment.  That is, the first thing mentioned is the topic of discussion and then the speaker will add a comment following that.

It is used to emphasize a certain part of the sentence.  In the following example, the speaker wants to emphasize that he is going to read the particular book being discussed.

:这本书，我明天在我家看。
:這本書，我明天在我家看。
Zhè běn shū, wǒ míngtiān zài wǒ jiā kàn.
:''I will read'' this ''book tomorrow.''

==Comparisons Using &lt;u&gt;bǐ&lt;/u&gt; [比]==
{| cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px solid #000000;&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;white-space: wrap; background-color:#FFFFCC;&quot;| Comparisons can be made using &lt;u&gt;bǐ&lt;/u&gt; [比]. Adverbs (like 不，也，只，都）and any auxiliary verbs are placed before &lt;u&gt;bǐ&lt;/u&gt; in the sentence. The amount of the disparity between the two is placed after the adjective.

:Tā bǐ wǒ máng.
:''She is busier than I am.''


:东尼也比我忙很多。
:東尼也比我忙很多。
:Dōngní yě bǐ wǒ máng hěn duō.
:''Tony is also a lot busier than I am.''

----

There is a great description of Lucid Dreaming experience in Feynman's ''Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman''. I took the liberty to make the excerpt temporarily available in my userspace at Wikipedia: [[Wikipedia:en:User:Paranoid/Feynman]]. Check it out and may be some facts experiences would be interesting to add in this book.

== Naming conventions ==
I have updated all the pages so they are properly named. The book is in a hierarchial structure now. Don't use colons to name pages, use slashes to name pages. Example:

Improper way: &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Introduction&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Proper way: &quot;Lucid Dreaming/Introduction&quot;

Same goes with sub-pages.&lt;br /&gt;
[[User:Ksd5|Emanla Eraton]] 23:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

I think you made rather a hash of this.  I've just spent about half an hour making an even nastier mess of it, moving over all the Talk content and correcting the links in the [[Lucid Dreaming|main page]] and [[Print_version]].

What you should have done is just clicked on the &quot;move&quot; tab and left the &quot;Move associated talk page&quot; checkbox ticked.  That way a) the talk pages would have come over too, b) you wouldn't have created pages with 10s of K worth of content and one lonesome edit history entry which names you as completely responsible!

I didn't notice this at first and did some editting on the new pages (before I'd registered this username), including some talk sections.  That's why I wasn't able to simply move all the talk sections, and why I wasn't so eager to move your pages out of the way and move the old ones the proper way, because I'd have to reapply all my recent edits.

Hope I don't sound too annoyed.

[[User:Sourcejedi|Sourcejedi]] 20:26, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

This book needs to be marked for fixing the pages for naming.

== Conventions ==

A few conventions I'll post here for now:

* Don't just write MILD, VILD, LILD or WILD. Say &quot;the -ILD technique&quot;. The exception is WBTB (don't ask, just do it!)
* ''No'' other acronym is used.
* Write &quot;reality check&quot; (no capitals)
* To add links to a forum, use the format as on the current pages.
* Please post here before creating a new page (with the exception of reality check pages)
* Don't use the first person.

Thank you! [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 00:46, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== To do ==

Stuff to do:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;
Done:
# &quot;Food and drink&quot; section will remain a stub for now.. however see below
# Merged &quot;Grabbing for stuff&quot; and &quot;Looking for stuff&quot; in [[Lucid Dreaming: Using]] (Thanks KirbyMeister and KC!)
# Created &quot;Dissociation&quot; section (Thanks KirbyMeister and KC!)
# Dream recall improves if you are in the same position in recall and sleep - true? (check with EWLD) -- EWLD says not to move from the position you wake up in since any movement might make dreams harder to remember, but it doesn't say anything about being easier to remember if you move into a position you slept in. [[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 23:48, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Waiting (it's the jobs which are waiting for me to come over and help them ;-) ):
# Mess with the content and design of the induction comparison table simultaneously some more *uh oh*
# You can use MILD to say you can control the length of your LDs... how many people use this? Effective? [http://www.ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=60105#60105]
# Update yellow boxes with latest topics *my gawd this is such a pain, I have to get rid of them somehow... useful though*
# Dream formation/function/interpretation theories (currently in [[Lucid Dreaming: Dream Recall]]) *** Surely it needs its own page?  I'd like to make mention of Joe Griffin's Expectation Fulfilment Theory of Dreaming, which has a logical place for LDs.

# Clear up the food, drink &amp; drugs section
# Make [[Lucid Dreaming: Glossary]] worth using
# Make examples for the rest of the reality check pages ([[Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Light switches|Light switches]] and [[Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Memory|Memory]]).
&lt;/div&gt;

== Acronyms ==

I think we probably should agree on some acronyms to use and what they stand for... here's what I say:
# DILD - ''Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream''
# WILD - ''Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream''
# MILD - ''Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream''
# VILD - ''Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Visually Induced Lucid Dream''
# LILD - ''Lucid Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Lucidly Induced Lucid Dream''
# WBTB - ''Wake-Back-To-Bed''
--[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 23:30, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: We should not coin any new terms - this is a major barrier between posting on many different sites. I agree with the bottom five (WILD is sometimes taken to mean &quot;Wake Induced Lucid Dream&quot; (although it doesn't make any sense :) )but I'm not so sure about the first one (which is meant to be used to categorise techniques). It will only need to be used in few paragraphs above our excellent techniques table at [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]]. Is it really worth &quot;teaching&quot; the reader another acronym just for that small section to read smoothly? I think not.
: If you were expecting us to choose between, eg, ''Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams'' and ''Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream'', I refrain because often the same forums take the same acronym to meanboth those things (although the first use is more useful and the second use is dying out). This is exactly what the &quot;the -ILD technique&quot; method of writing (I didn't want to write ''technique of writing'') is set out to solve.

:: By &quot;''Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream''&quot; and the others like that, I actually meant that the acronym would stand for both of them depending on it's context. I probably should have said &quot;and&quot; instead, but anyway...
:: This is something like how I picture some of the techniques I know:
::* DILDs:
::** MILD (''remembering'' to recognize that you're dreaming; not quite the same thing as autosuggestion (that is, EWLD says MILD and autosuggestion are two different things, and describes them as separate (and different) techniques, but I think they both include a bit of [[en:autosuggestion|autosuggestion]]) (I'll probably put a draft of a rewritten MILD section on the [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]] page sometime))
::** Autosuggestion (the adapted version of MILD described on ld4all.com is a lot like the &quot;Autosuggestion&quot; described in EWLD, especially the part that says it's &quot;important to not *want* it too much&quot;)
::** VILD (not completely sure about VILD - you become lucid after the dream starts, but you incubate the dream while awake)
::** Going to sleep thirsty
::** Drinking a lot before sleeping
::** LILD
::* WILDs:
::** Focusing on hypnagogic imagery
::** Counting
::Most WILD techniques are usually just called WILD like they're one technique, and that makes WILD a few bits ambiguous, which is why I think we should explain WILD and DILD as categorizations and then explain each specific induction technique. If we use WILD (and DILD) like this:
::* WILD - ''Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream'' and ''Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams''
::* DILD - ''Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream'' and ''Dream-Initiation of Lucid Dreams''
::...and put a note on the [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]] page about common usage of &quot;WILD&quot; to refer to any technique that induces WILDs, then it'll still make sense to someone who reads this wikibook when someone says they &quot;used WILD&quot;. --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 18:46, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== New section? ==

I wonder if it is worth giving a section which gives more background on what dreams are.  For example, with that background the reasons why turning on a light may not work or flying very high may not work is clear - both require ''rapid'' addition of new detail that hasn't been 'in the pipe-line'.

Such a section could also explain the way that characters in a (normal) dream are often different aspects of oneself.  There should be some discussion of what the normal function of dreaming is too, even if perforce it has to be stated conjecturally.

So - should a new section be added, if so what should it be called, or is it tooo far off-topic? (anon)

: I'm not sure about this. I have been considering an appendix section. It would have instructions for making an alarm-clock-based Novadreamer (the site I found it on has copyright-violating material), and full texts from the ld4all.com forum &quot;as the experts wrote them&quot; (stuff like Pedro's mind model text). It could also explain the reality checks, but I don't think that simple things like &quot;the mind has no external input to base the writing on&quot; is enough. Close your eyes now and imagine the words of your choice. See what I mean?
: If analysing dreams is not offtopic, neither is the new section. I think it could be lumped into the introduction.

Good work with this module. I never heard of lucid dreaming before, but I am now very interested in Lucid dreaming. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 01:10, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

If you fly in dreams does this mean that you are definitely lucid dreaming? [[User:Perl|Perl]] 01:37, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: Could you tell me where you got that idea from so I can go fix it? You can dream that you are flying without being lucid (I have flyed once in my normal dreams and about five times in my lucid dreams). Lucid dreaming just means that you are aware, to some extent, that you are dreaming. As you probably know already, we usually accept our reality whether we're in a ridiculous dream or just normal life. Changing that, by using reality checks etc, helps you make lucid dreams where everything is more vivid and you can fly more often :D.

== Recall fact or myth? ==

I recently read this in a lucid dreaming book which is ''commercially sold'':

: You will have the best recall when you are lying in the same position that you were in when you were dreaming. [http://www.consciousdreaming.com/lucid-dreaming/how-to-lucid-dream.htm]

As far as I know, there is no scientific research about this, and no way I can see to seperate reality from [[en:Placebo effect]]. So - should the wikibook

# Not mention this at all (along with most things here) due to its uncertainty?
# Use [[en:Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms|weasel terms]] to mention it?
# State it as fact, giving readers the advantage of a placebo effect they don't even realise?

At the moment, the wikibook is on the second option. Tough, tough... [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 23:34, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I had noticed that I could remember a dream as much as I wanted if I stayed immobile, and that the memories of the dream would fade away quickly if I moved, long before I had read anything about dreams or this article. More precisely, I think it's something about the vertebral column, it's like it felt different when I was immobile, and as soon as I moved the strange feeling would disappear, and the memory of the dream would fade away.

:I'd vote for the second option for the moment, or put something else to show the lack of scientific research on the subject. I do however have a strong feeling that it is true from my personal experiences. (but, then again, it could be true for some people and false for others)

:I find it strange though that this has never been studied or confirmed. There has been a lot of research in the domain of sleep and dreams, and this looks like a good clue on how dreams and sleeping work. [[User:201.92.136.117|201.92.136.117]] 01:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:: Really depends on how much effort I put into it. If I don't think about the subject at all, LDs don't happen very often. If I read or write stuff on LDs, I get them once a week maybe. If I keep a dream diary and do reality checks, I'll go up to 3 or 4 times a week. But I'm too lazy for that .p Don't be too envious, spontaneously having LDs can sometimes alienate a person, or cause dissociative symptoms (ie., Did this thing I remember happen in a dream or in reality?).

== Recent page name changes ==

I personally don't like the new system on the wikibook with page naming. Some reasons:

* The preference on Wikipedia not to use colons in titles unless it is really necessary, because it can mess with namespaces
* Slower to type out (I can use &quot;LD Using&quot; in the search, but I have to write &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot; in links). Also compare &quot;LD RC Memory&quot; to &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Memory&quot;
* &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot; in the title, but &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; in the text? Seems a bit strange.
* The mass of redirects which have been left behind.

Can somebody explain why the changes? Until then, I'll be fixing links. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 06:29, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:I definitely like the new title style, it's more logical and I think it looks better...
:* We could change the colons to dashes I guess (e.g., &quot;Lucid Dreaming - Reality Checks - Memory&quot;), but I don't think it's really that important. :-/
:* I don't think having to type a bit extra in links is that much of a problem, we only need to do that once for each link anyway.
:* &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot; would be the title while &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; (or &quot;lucidly dreaming&quot;) is used in the text, because the wikibook is &quot;The Lucid Dreaming Wikibook&quot;; it's also &quot;the wikibook on lucid dreaming&quot;, but I think the title of the book should be capitalized (though I can see why someone wouldn't).
:* I think the benifits are worth the redirects, and we can always ask an admin to delete them sometime anyway (except for the &quot;Lucid dreaming&quot; and &quot;LD&quot; redirects to &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot;, which we should keep).
:--[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 17:41, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Why &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot; but &quot;Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot;? Why not &quot;Talk: Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot; or &quot;Talk:Lucid Dreaming:Using&quot;? It's illogical. (hint: the spaces) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 22:17, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:The spaces are a problem, and it might have been better using &quot; - &quot; delimeters instead of &quot;: &quot; (or &quot;:&quot;, which I personally think looks ugly), though changing it now will make a lot of redirects. Anyway, &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Appendices: CAT&quot; and &quot;Lucid Dreaming - Appendices - CAT&quot; are both more logical than &quot;LD Appendices CAT&quot; (and it seems to me like a bad idea to use abbreviations too much in chapter titles anyway). --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 16:22, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==New appendix==
Anyone else think we should make a new appendix for exercises that can help with certain induction techniques? For example, there could be a prospective memory training section for getting a better prospective memory (i.e., remembering future intentions) which helps with [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques#MILD|MILD]], or a will strengthening section to strengthen your will. They could go directly in the book, but I think they'd be easier to access with their own appendix. --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 15:59, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Browse buttons?==

What about putting somekinda &quot;browse buttons&quot; on the pages? These things would take you through the book in the right order without having to click on the table of contents or anything else. I know it's kinda redundant, but the wikipedia format really isn't the greatest for books. What about &quot;browse talk pages&quot; too? The buttons could be little pictures of arrows or such, to not add any unnecessary text clutter. [[User:Kaycee|KC]] 20:00, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)

: Just looking at the usage statistics shows that these are not necessary. If you look at the front page stat for May - 758 - it is pretty close to all the other sections added up. In other words, the common browsing style is to follow a link from ld4all.com to the front page (I put direct links to pages up occassionally) and then to visit the page you want, read the information you want, and leave. There are probably very few people reading &quot;cover-to-cover&quot;.
: It might be a good idea, though, to add the navigation bar to the bottom. I have to go to school in a bit, so if somebody else were to do it first, that would be handy. (Not the reality check pages, mind!)

==Unicode characters==

So... should we use [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] characters? I replaced the &quot;--&quot;s with real em [[w:dash|dash]]es (—) and the dashes in ranges (e.g., 45–90) with real en dashes (–) and the straight [[w:Quotation mark|quotes]] with curved quotes (“ ”), but I used HTML entities (&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;ldquo;&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) and it makes the code look a bit messy. If we just use the actual Unicode characters in the code, it should look okay, and Wikibooks uses Unicode (unlike the English Wikipedia, which is still using ISO-8859-1 for some reason :-( ) so there shouldn’t be any problems with that. The only problem I can think of is that some unknown number of people might not have Unicode fonts/support (Windows 9x?). :-/ —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 19:37, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== &quot;Spicing up&quot; ==

I was thinking about the ''old'' dreamviews site: It had beautiful pictures on the side, from the Myst game.

Wouldn't it be cool if the wikibook could be sort of spiced up with colours, pictures, etc? From Myst, or [http://www.mixnmojo.com/galleries/gallery.php?gallery=49&amp;image=293&amp;goback= LOOM], or something.

(Note about LOOM: There were a few versions, some with 16 colours, others with 64, others with 256. I'm obviously thinking of the 256-colour version. The screenshots page I linked to has a variety.)

| Lucid dreaming is dreaming while aware you are dreaming. This allows you to control your dreams and have fantastical experiences.

The lucid dreaming wikibook gives you all the information you need about improving your dream recall, inducing lucid dreams, and using them to do whatever you want. There are also external references from which you can learn more.

&quot;Very nice book: very complete and useful, and also well written!&quot; - [http://ld4all.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7 Johan]

: Reworded the first sentence and added a [[w:serial comma|serial comma]] (sorry, I had to, my eyes were burning just looking at the serial comma–less version). And I think we should keep the last paragraph in the synopsis that's there now, but replace the rest of it with this one. —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 00:23, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Synopsis-except-last-paragraph is:

: This book attempts to teach you the skills that can help you to have lucid dreams — dreams in which you know that you are dreaming. Lucid dreams have been scientifically proven to exist. Being aware that you are dreaming, and still remaining asleep, can give you the ability to control your dreams. Lucid dreaming truly can be a fantastic experience. See the introduction for more details on what lucid dreaming is.

: First, you will find out a little on what dreaming is from the biological aspect. Then, the book will explain how to improve your dream recall so that you remember more of your dreams. Next, it’ll explain how to become lucid during dreams, and how to stay lucid. It’ll also explain how to keep yourself in the dream and prevent it from “fading”. Finally, there will be some suggestions for what you could do within your lucid dreams.

: Each section in each chapter has some information, and at the end of some sections, more information is given in question-and-answer form. There are also yellow boxes with links to related threads on lucid dreaming forums, with the last topic on the list being the latest.

The extra detail seems useful to me, although maybe the third paragraph (&quot;Each section...&quot;) can be removed. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:29, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

The images are beautiful, the world they show is dreamlike, and they're all wonderfully coloured. The problem is that they are pixellated, they're oddly shaped (if you cut the black part of the screen off), and that if somebody recognises them lucid dreaming would definately ''not'' come to mind.

== Misgivings about this book's approach ==

I have to say that I believe that this project of yours is a dangerous project.

There's an allusion here. Imagine a technical support person who works for sony, can he give advice over the telephone to a person who has bought a Panasonic DVD player?-

Now this person probably could go into that caller's home, and fix the problem - because he knows enough about DVD players to do the job, if he has the item in front of his face, and in his hands...

But what's going to happen if he tries to give advice over the telephone about  equipment he isn't familiar with, is that the quizzical person is going to get himself in deeper and deeper problems from the misguided advice of someone who isn't familiar with the specific machine.

Now you say in your introduction in this book that these techniques of getting to a lucid state during a dream, can lead to very serious side affects - including psychotic episodes during the daytime hours.

I'll tell you my appraisal - a person who says he leads a person into blissful experiences, is not being honest, if he also leads that person towards nightmares....

The secret to lucid dreaming is not esoteric mind control techniques. The secret to lucid dreaming, is for the person to understand how his night time thinking processes work, enough to be able to have some agility with them, as he uses them, at night.

Dreams are another form of thinking which is done in the moment. It is a form of topic exploration technique. Just like during the day,  a person at night, will think about positive or negative, or neutral topics... and as that person mulls as topic, he will attract images and patterns in his mind which help him understand that topic.

The mind is a pattern assembler. And during a dream at night, the mind is working with several layers of patterns, piecing these ideas together...

Last night, I was dreaming, and I had a very unusual topic in mind. It was &quot;how does a self in a time of the past interfere with the dreaming process  to where the dream becomes a nightmare?&quot; and this is why I was inspired to comment on your &quot;book&quot; here.

In my dream last night, there was a  character who changed form a lot - his presence even sometimes took the form of simply an inanimate object intentionally placed out of place in the physical environment which the dream described.

But the one thing about this character who was both mysterious and imposing in his presence, was that he wanted to control my thinking process during the dream. It was similar to some mysterious evil manipulative shady character in a hollywood film who hides behind the scenes - where it's not clear to the audience what his relationship to the plot is.

The experience during this nightmare/meditation last night, I can compare to the experience of when a person isn't eating properly - and he feels these odd rushes through his skin and tissues. And he gets scared, because he isn't seeing where his homeostasis issues are in his physiology.

----

This is not something written after experimenting with your techniques - I would never be as foolish as to follow your blind advice in this book... I simply want to describe my understanding of the difference between a lucid dream and a nightmare..

All of my nightmares, I have seen have been defined by this common issue I describe here. Like any normal human being I have these types of dreams infrequently over the course of my life.

Therefore I would very strongly advise, that the writers of this book not teach people to use a mind control technique on themselves. Rather, I would advise that they teach  people how to understand their own mental processes... and how to make wise decisions about doing things in their minds...

By definition &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; means a person is lucid. He is aware of how his thinking processes are working. And this awareness gives him the agility to control his own thinking processes as he would during the day - except in context with a very different form of mental endeavor.

Your warnings in the introduction to this book are all well and good, but consider that the people who died from heart attacks after being given the pharmaceutical VIOXX and other cox2 inhibitors  recently are not helped by an apology. The warnings on pharmaceutical  labels are not an excuse for giving a substance which is harmful to people.

Your warnings go so far as to say that people may experience psychotic episodes by following your advice.

If you don't have the understanding to offer advice to another human being, or a concrete enough appraisal of your own mental processes to share your thoughts wisely, then please don't say anything at all. [[User:Rainbird|Rainbird]] 11:03, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)

===Reply===

Before replying, I would like to say first that 1) I am not the author of the &quot;Possible dangers of lucid dreaming&quot; section and know nothing about its content, and 2) the &quot;Dissociation&quot; section only realistically and fully applies to those who ''already'' have psychological problems. Hundreds of people on the LD4all forum, Dreamviews.com forum, and alt.dreams.lucid USENET group have reported wonderful lucid dreams (using the techniques described on this site) without any such psychotic episodes. There is an Institute which sells courses in lucid dreaming and once selled devices to aid induction of lucid dreams; they have their own forum with hundreds of further reports on how people have had no ill effects. (To join that forum, one has to have given money to the Institute in some way, or to have participated in a study. Therefore, it could be deemed more reliable.)

You say that &quot;The secret to lucid dreaming is not esoteric mind control techniques.&quot; Firstly, almost all the techniques given here are documented in Stephan LaBerge's book, and are not &quot;esoteric&quot;, having been used by thousands of people, with mixed results. Secondly, there is no &quot;secret&quot; to lucid dreaming: a) it is no secret and b) I would never want to suggest that the methods here are the only ones, or the only possible ones.

You continue, &quot;The secret to lucid dreaming, is for the person to understand how his night time thinking processes work, enough to be able to have some agility with them, as he uses them, at night.&quot; I presume you think that you understand how night-time thinking processes work? Would you share information or references? Because quite frankly, nobody does. The exact purpose of dreams, and how they fulfill that purpose, is also unclear (although most researchers in the field agree it is something to do with learning or memory storage).

Nevertheless, you know the &quot;topic&quot; of one of your dreams: &quot;how does a self in a time of the past interfere with the dreaming process to where the dream becomes a nightmare?&quot; To be honest, I have no idea what you mean by this. Were you wondering how past events involving oneself lead to oneself having nightmares?

&quot;there was a character who changed form a lot&quot; - please clarify. Did you feel in the dream that all those forms were connected, or did you later decide it by dream interpretation?

I don't even understand how the dream relates to the rest of your post.

&quot;I would never be as foolish as to follow your blind advice in this book&quot; - please give details. All of it? Even the section on dream recall? What am I (and the other authors) missing which is making us &quot;blind&quot;? (sarcasm begins) You're very kind about the book, and I'm sure you appreciate the effort I and other authors have put into it, and the fact that all this advice is from well-respected authors and dreaming experts. (sarcasm end)

What is the &quot;common issue&quot; which is a recurring theme in your nightmare?

&quot;Therefore I would very strongly advise, that the writers of this book not teach people to use a mind control technique on themselves. Rather, I would advise that they teach people how to understand their own mental processes... and how to make wise decisions about doing things in their minds...&quot; What are these &quot;mind control techniques&quot; you have seen in this book? Are you giving this advice because you (one very individual person) have had certain nightmares throughout your life (as &quot;Therefore&quot; suggests)? How do you know about your own mental processes?

&quot;...a person is lucid. He is aware of how his thinking processes are working. And this awareness gives him the agility to control his own thinking processes as he would during the day - except in context with a very different form of mental endeavor.&quot; No, he is not aware of how his thinking processes are working. He is just in a dream. He can move around, fly, create objects, whatever. He is controlling his thinking processes ''in a way'', but it's a very limited way. If lucid dreaming affected/negated the purpose of dreams, I do not think the mind would allow it, or have evolved to make it possible.

About the last section: Yes, I understand that warnings are not much of a substitute for not actually offering advice. However, I am not the one who put the warning there, and many well-respected sites include LD4all.com, Dreamviews.com and the Lucidity Institute have done without it. I am uncertain why the book even has this warning at all.

&quot;or a concrete enough appraisal of your own mental processes to share your thoughts wisely&quot; - I'm afraid my puny 15-year-old brain is unable to understand what exactly you mean here.

As a final note, thank you for your feedback. I'm always happy to see people speaking up their views. Also, I don't know why you removed the timestamp created by &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but it certainly should be there (to give your words some authorship (and associated credibility) and to give an indication of how fast the discussion was), so I'm putting it back. A space before the &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;~~~~&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; code is also useful for readability.

&lt;s&gt;I suspect you will be interested in my reply, so if you haven't replied in a few days, I will try to send an email to you.&lt;/s&gt; Because you didn't provide an email address when you created an account, that will not be possible.

===Comment on Reply===

I wrote most of the &quot;Dangers&quot; section of the book. I feel that the warnings need to be there, since I believe that in dreams you are actually dealing with your own subconscious and personality in a very direct way. This gives you the power to create both blissful and nightmarish experiences that to a certain part of your mind seem &quot;real&quot;. Not appreciating that fact may, again from my viewpoint, lead you to recklessly mess up your thought processes in a way that will affet your day-time functioning.

About the other comments, I'm with r3m0t here. [[User:Kaycee|KC]] 17:42, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Purpose==
This is a wonderful piece of work that could be a very useful book if it were oriented more purposefully.  As it stands now, however, it seems to be oriented rather frivolously.  Life is a reverent and serious pursuit for high and holy purposes, and going about a subject such as Lucid dreaming without a reverence and appreciation for that purpose is a travesty.  Would it be possible for you to research some of the ways that Lucid Dreaming can contribute to personal growth and societal betterment and orient more toward that end?  Anon Tom

A good example of such an approach is the following passage from a researcher on out of body experiences (possibly closely related to lucid dreaming). Anon Tom [[User:216.160.222.166|216.160.222.166]] 18:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Astral projection enables us to use the part of our mind that has been dormant or sleeping. We can wake up this part and put it to work. It is called the subconscious, and it can be used to give us the knowledge we need to find out more about ourselves, our purpose on earth, and our relationship with God. &lt;snip&gt; I go to the astral realm and communicate with my teachers.   [http://www.near-death.com/gross.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Would such a paradigm shift be possible?  Anon Tom  [[User:216.160.222.166|216.160.222.166]] 18:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

== Translation in french language. ==

Hello,

I'm very interesting in Lucid dreaming. However, french lucid dreaming community isn't very large.

We need documentation about lucid dreaming but we're not enough in order to redact them.

That's why I ask you if I can translate your book into french.

In waiting your approbation, Nicolas.

:No reason why not. Wikibooks is absolutely free and its content can be used for any purpose you wish, so long as it's non-commercial. Translation is definitely one of the purposes which we love, since it lets our writings be exposed to a larger audience. [[User:Rarr|Rarr]] 04:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

== Criticism ==
Great book guys, I've read it through a couple times (hard copy), and not only is it pretty interesting to read, it presents a fairly balanced take on a fairly controvercial topic. Other than the fact that it's not a very long book, I want to make a few points, from the point of view of a critical Wikipedia editor.

Anybody that has though seriously about lucid dreaming will know about LaBerge and his books, and it's obvious that a lot of the verifiable information in this book is supported by his writings. As a somewhat &quot;trusted leader&quot; for everything lucid, it only makes sense. A sceptic who doubts lucid dreaming (a person who may deny it's value, it's meaning, or it's existance) will interperet that fact in the following ways:
#Lucid dreaming = LaBerge
#LaBerge is the pretty much the ''only'' big name in lucid dreaming; a standout
#If LaBerge is wrong, lucid dreaming is a joke

Not to mention that all of LaBerge's books are targeted at a rather non-sceptical population (those eager to believe), not the scientific community. If you've read any of his scientific papers (not the best scientific writer, but nothing I can really criticize), you'll notice how deeply his facts are referenced, because he knows he's dealing with a lot of sceptics, and I think that you (we?) should do a little more of the same on Wikibooks. As it is right now, there's all ''too much'' sci-fi stuff in the book, and it doesn't serve well as an introduction to a sceptic. More details should be referenced from different trusted individuals (LaBerge himself seems to trust a good dozen of other scientific writers), and you have a responsibility to document the popular criticism as well, or else the whole thing just starts sounding like a sales pamphlet for LaBerge's books.

If you had a Wikibook on &quot;how to fly to the moon&quot;, you'd have to make note of the fact that there's a huge percent of the worlds population that doesn't believe it's ever been done, and some who don't think it's possible. I feel that this book should serve as a world-wide, open-perspective introduction to lucid dreaming, and as it has as of yet been written entirely by dreamers and aspiring dreamers, it really seems to present the phenomenon in a much better light than it really deserves.

This is getting a bit long, I'll try to finish up quickly. I have some suggestions, you may or may not think they're necessary.
#Split the entire book into two parts: ''What is lucid dreaming'' + ''Lucid dreaming methodology''
#Remove all references to the LD4all forums
#Take a more scientific approach to listing methods, techniques, etc.

Ok so the first one. I'm glad that this ''isn't'' just a how-to book (thank you), but if the notes about techs gets any longer it will be at great risk of becoming one (IMO). I personally think that it's much more important to present the theories, experimental results, and arguments that make up the description of lucid dreaming, than to describe how the LD community prepares for bed. Why? Well let me put it this way. If a large number of LDers started reporting that eating yoghurt before sleeping increased the chances of going lucid by a large percent, you could add that to one of your sections on methology, and it would probably be a warrented addition. The problem is that it's not scientific and it doesn't teach you anything ''useful'' about lucid dreaming to know that. If yoghurt really was of such great benefit, someone would probably eventually do a real scientific report on it and show that a certain ingredient of yoghurt (or the smell, or a certain texture that triggers a hormone in your brain, etc.) was the culprit, after which that ingredient could be added to the basic lucid dreaming description, because you would have scientific evidence that a certain ingredient has more than a passing influence on the process; it could be part of an essential cycle related to lucid dreaming. Having done that, there's no real need to include it as part of lucid dreaming &quot;methology&quot;, because it will have become a core (referenced) element of the description of lucid dreaming itself.

Number two; you'll probably hate me for this. I know why you've done it, and I don't fully disagree with you for doing it, but nobody is going to insist that LD4all is a good, solid source for anything, and as long as we're all responsible Wikipedians here, I think you should just stick to what is known to be reliable, and what we can trust not to fall victim to symptoms of popularity, desparation, over-enthusiasm, etc. It's an excellent resource for starting lucidians, and it definitely deserves a big mention, but I really don't think it should be used as a source for anything. It only takes a couple clicks before you're bombarded by posts about &quot;verified&quot; telekenisis, alien encounters, and all this new-world stuff that may do well with it's own article/book, but is all too controvercial to risk mixing in with a supposedly verifiable book on lucid dreaming. Use your own judgement.

For my third point, I'm mainly looking at the reality checks section. OK, it's ''useful'', ''informative'', and ''interesting'', but from the POV of a non-believing sceptic, it's complete nonsense. I don't really know how I can explain this from a sceptics point of view without just sounding like I'm starting to cause trouble. ''Basically'', I don't think things like these should be made into a chart. This policy exists en force in Wikipedia as well; charts are easily falsifiable, and it is difficult to make them clear, relevant, and perfectly verifiable at the same time. I just feel this chart could be made into a few paragraphs about how certain actions that work perfectly normally IRL, for some reason ''don't'' work as well in dreams, and it really begs for an ''explanation''. I understand that light switches don't work so well in dreams, but it sounds like a silly statement to be made in such a bold way, and I'm sure there are sources out there which outline theories as to why such actions such as walking steadily, clapping your hands, breathing through your hose, and looking at mirrors give unexpected results while you are dreaming. It's also difficult to present this topic in a scientific manner, because each time you say something like &quot;can you fly?&quot; the sceptic laughs and passes the whole thing off as a moronic fantasy. It may be useful to use wording more similar to &quot;are you able to intice your dream character to fly&quot; or &quot;does your subconcious tell you that you are flying&quot;, which puts some space between the writing and the fact that it's trying to express, i.e. it doesn't   appear in any way that you are claiming anyone is going to be able to &quot;fly&quot;.

I think that's enough for now, I really hope someone reads through this and considers improving this book seriously. It really is an interesting book about a fascinating subject, and there definitely needs to be better organization of the hard facts here (as I said before, there's not only one guy writing the scientific papers here!), better educating the public about the phenomenon. Sweet dreams then. [[User:222.158.118.50|222.158.118.50]] 14:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

: This isn't really &quot;my&quot; book any more, and this is a very late response, but...
: The first point - about the book taking the POV that LD exists. There are a few reasons why somebody wouldn't believe in LD.
:* They've never experienced it themselves - what am I to do to convince them? :)
:* It doesn't jive with their psycho-stuff about interpreting dreams - what am I to do to convinve ''them''? :)
:* They think that people can't (philosophically speaking) distinguish between an LD and a dream that (in the dream) appears to be an LD. The distinction is important to most LDers because in a false lucid dream, they find that their &quot;chosen activities&quot; in the LD don't really match what they actually wanted to do when they went to sleep.
: I don't really see the idea of writing a book about how to levitate for people who don't believe in levitation. Similarly for LD.
: Numbered point one: as long as the non-how-to part remains, it won't become &quot;just a how-to book&quot;. Which is good. The balance between sections only reflects how much people are willing to write in each section. Unfortunately, almost nobody does research on LDs, and there is great personal variance between the people who want to have LDs. Also, there is no placebo for eating yoghurt before bedtime (except comparing, say, yoghurt with some fruit) and there's clearly no placebo for reality checks. Everything we have is on a &quot;works-for-somebody&quot; basis.
: Numbered point two: I was spending time at LD4all, and I liked it - despite the supernatural areas, there are plenty of sceptics, and the LD forums have plenty of people with their feet on the ground, so to speak. (At least when I was there.) Where else am I supposed to link to? Dreamviews? Fine, link to dreamviews. :) The reader is meant to take linked information with a pinch of salt.
: Numbered point three: 'It's also difficult to present this topic in a scientific manner, because each time you say something like &quot;can you fly?&quot; the sceptic laughs and passes the whole thing off as a moronic fantasy' - it's meant to be the question that somebody asks themselves in the dream. &quot;Can I fly? Yes! I must be in a lucid dream!&quot; as opposed to &quot;Am I able to entice my dream character to fly? What dream character?&quot; (Or worse: &quot;Am I able to entice my dream character to fly? *flaps wings in a crowded train* Apparently not - I guess I must be in real life - hey, why is everybody looking at me funny?&quot;). Of course you'll be &quot;able to fly&quot; - as in feel an experience like you would expect flying to feel like. I don't think anybody would misread it as &quot;lucid dreams can make you able to actually fly in real life&quot;.

== Lucid Dreaming: The Psuedoscientific New Age Nonsense ==
I ask you all to look at this site: [http://www.skepdic.com/lucdream.html http://www.skepdic.com/lucdream.html]. It disproves Lucid Dreaming as more New Age nonsense, it should be piled into Astrology with junk sciences. It is possible you can dream you are awake when you are not. It is scientifically impossible to have conciousness in sub-concious sleep. Thus this is nonsense. So please remove claims this is scientific!!

:I looked at the site. Is it the second to last paragraph you're making reference to?
::&quot;Some skeptics do not believe that there is such a state as lucid dreaming (Malcolm 1959). Skeptics don't deny that sometimes in our dreams we dream that we are aware that we are dreaming. What they deny is that there is special dream state called the 'lucid state.' The lucid dream is therefore not a gateway to &quot;transcendent consciousness&quot; any more than nightmares are.&quot;
:The way I interpret this, they're saying that it might not be that we know we're dreaming, but that we ''dream'' we know we're dreaming. Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure it makes any difference. Either way, it's possible for us to behave exactly as if we know that we're dreaming, whether or not we're just dreaming that we know we're dreaming and we don't actually know we're dreaming (and, really, how does that work? We &quot;think&quot; we know we're dreaming, but we don't actually know we're dreaming?). Two more things: Lucid dreaming is not a science, it's a phenomenon. Neurology is a science, as is psychology. And, I don't know about you, but I'm always conscious during my dreams. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to remember them, would I? If I'm consciously aware of a thought, it's a conscious thought. If a thought is not conscious, I'm not consciously aware of it. I am consciously aware of my dreams (even non-lucid ones) as they're occuring, so, it seems to me, they must be conscious.
:I understand what he means by &quot;It is possible you can dream you are awake when you are not.&quot; I myself have experienced &quot;lucid&quot; dreams which were in fact very restrictive, in which I thought I had full realization of the fact that I was dreaming, but I could hardly control any aspects of my dream as I should have been able to if I were actually fully conscious of this fact. This may support the claim that so called &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; is all an invention of our subconscious, and I believe so, but regardless of this, lucid dreaming is enjoyable when experienced as if truly under the dreamer's control. The possibility that lucid dreaming is an illusion of the subconscious is no reason to dismiss the pursuit of such experiences as nonsense or junk. I identify with the first person's wish to remove whatever semblence of scientific support is present in the wikibook, but at the same time believing in such proof is somewhat necessary to the pursuit of lucid dreaming and if a reader &quot;knows better,&quot; good for them. ;) [[Special:Contributions/72.197.183.70|72.197.183.70]] ([[User talk:72.197.183.70|talk]]) 04:35, 2 May 2008 (UTC)
:I'm removing the section you added (&quot;Criticism of Lucid Dreaming&quot;) because it contains no content except for an unsupported claim (&quot;Lucid dreaming is New Age nonsense masquerading as actual science.&quot;) and a link (which, as far as I can tell, doesn't give any support to your claim).

*Why does Green place commercial books at the same level as scientific research? I mean, ''anyone'' can publish a book about any [[wikipedia:Natural Cures &quot;They&quot; Don't Want You to Know About|crackpot nonsense]] they want.  Why should that be as important a criteria as actual science?
*And as an aside, is there any actual science behind any of this? I don't mean some insane study published in Medical Hypotheses, I mean actual science.

:I agree that it can sometimes be inconsistent, that needs to be fixed. In the cases of the commercial books, I believe that it is referring to books published by scientists such as Dr. Stephen LaBerge, and other &quot;experts&quot; in the field. I'm not sure how many people write books that are complete BS about LDing, seeing how it's pretty well established what's true about it. Of course there is actual science. There are many links within the book, and I can provide you the link to the lucidity institutes's page[http://www.lucidity.com/], where you can see two of the books LaBerge has published, as well as a FAQ.

== Tibetan methods ==

First of all, I'd like to apologize for messing up the wikibook with my botched rename.
The Tibetan Method section should be expanded on. It has been at 25% status for some time now. [[User:Ksd5|Emanla Eraton]] ([[User talk:Ksd5|talk]]) 19:20, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

== Things happening because you believe them ==

I've experienced that what happens in a Lucid Dream are only the things I believe in. For instance, if I try to fly, but I think I'm going to fall, I will actually fall. I think it's an useful thing to know, to let go of your real world beliefs when you're in a Lucid Dream.

I wanted to put this somewhere, but I'm not sure where, and I also don't know whether you think the same. Thanks! [[User:Theon144|Theon144]] ([[User talk:Theon144|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theon144|contribs]]) 17:16, 8 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

* Explanation of the AP program
AP (Advanced Placement) courses allow high school students to take and get credit for college-level classes. To get credit for a course, a student must pass the AP test. Unfortunately, not all colleges and universities in the US accept AP tests, and some may have their own independent exams. The AP is prepared by Collegeboard and their buddies at ETS (I think), also the writers of such tests as the SAT and PSAT. Courses cover a wide range of subjects, including Spanish, Calculus, English, Chemistry, and History.


* Types of essays

== Introduction ==
[[Image:Fungi_bracket.jpg|thumb|right|(''Pycnoporus sanguineus'')&lt;br&gt;Fruiting bodies of a bracket fungus on a Christmasberry log'']]

The '''Fungi''' (singular is ''fungus'') are a large group of organisms treated within the science of Botany, but not really &quot;plants&quot; in the usual sense of the term. The Fungi are ranked as a kingdom within the Domain [[Wikipedia:en:Eukaryote|Eukaryota]]. That is, they have eukaryotic cells with distinct nuclei, although in some species divisions between nucleated &quot;cells&quot; are sparse.  However, they all lack chlorophyll, and the species are saprophytic, parasitic or mycorrhizal. Included within the Fungi are the well known mushrooms, but the group also includes many microscopic forms, and fungi inhabit every environment on earth, perhaps second only to the bacteria (Chapter 7) in distribution.

This page describes a number of lucid dream induction techniques. It is recommended that you be able to [[Lucid Dreaming/Dream Recall|recall]] ''at least'' one dream per night in order to maximize the effectiveness of these methods.

==Preliminary Knowledge==
Certain elements are common to many of the lucidity-inducing techniques discussed later in this chapter.  To better understand these techniques, these common components will be discussed first.

===Sleep Interruption===
An element shared by many of the techniques is sleep interruption. Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10&amp;ndash;60 minutes).  This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you. If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off. Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known [[w:Diuretic|diuretic]]) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate. 

Sleep interruption is a natural part of the MILD technique (described below) which trains you to arise immediately after your dreams end.

=== Sleep Continuity ===
If you have trouble initially falling asleep, avoid drinking water for about an hour before going to bed. Otherwise, you may find yourself running to the bathroom, disrupting any attempts at lucidity.  Also, try to avoid caffeine and sugar before bed. However, depending on your sensitivity, caffeine may only stimulate your mind as opposed to your body. This extra grip on consciousness could be helpful in inducing lucid dreams. Exercising during the day is an excellent way of preparing your body for sleep. However, be sure to not exercise inside the three hours before bedtime, as your body will be stimulated for a short time afterwards. The morning or afternoon is the best time for this.

If you still have difficulty getting to sleep, try reading about lucid dreaming just before going to sleep. Your subconscious will likely absorb this information, increasing your chances of experiencing a lucid dream. If you ''do'' decide to read before going to sleep, keep a lamp next to your bed as physically getting up to turn off the lights may reawaken your body.

===Reality checks===
A reality check is a test you can perform to see if you're dreaming or awake. It might seem odd to test reality when you are sure that you're awake, but making a habit out of one or more of these reality checks will hugely increase your chances of having a lucid dream. If, say, you hold your nose and try to breathe in through it several times throughout the day then you're very likely to dream about doing it. And when you dream about performing a reality check, then of course the results should come out differently, in this case you'll find that you are somehow breathing in through your closed nostrils. You'll know that you're dreaming, and be able to take lucid control!

So here are some reality checks. You should be familiar with the entire list even if you only use a few.

Choose a few reality checks which you will do regularly. Take them seriously, do not assume you are awake (even when you know you are). If you practice performing these checks very thoroughly while awake, then you're more likely to perform them thoroughly while dreaming. You should '''always''' carry out more than one reality check. If you find that it is not a dream, look around you and think of what would be different if it were a dream. If you do this it will make it more likely that you will do a reality check in a dream.

Apart from doing reality checks throughout the day, you also need to do a reality check immediately after you wake up. This helps you become lucid in false awakenings, when you dream that you have woken up but in fact are still dozing. Using a digital alarm clock or mobile phone display to do a Reading check, every single time you wake up, is a quick and reliable way to catch false awakenings.

If you have trouble bringing reality checks into your dreams then before going to bed imagine yourself in a dream, noticing odd details and doing a reality check. Then do a reality check in real life. If you do this a few times before bed you will find that you will do it more often in dreams.

If you are in a situation where you cannot do a reality check, such as at a public speaking, try to do one as soon as possible. You can do some reality checks very discreetly, such as looking at some text on a sign. If you start to say “well, I can't do a reality check now” you should not be surprised when you make this mistake in a dream!

'''Which reality checks are best?'''

When selecting reality checks, the most important properties of a reality check are ''reliability'', ''speed'', and ''discreetness''.

* The '''reliability''' of each reality check is how likely you are to recognize the dream-sign's results as showing that you are dreaming '''once you do them in a dream'''. It changes for each person but some reality checks are overall more accurate than others. The figures in the table above are ''rough only'' and differ for each person.
* It is important for a reality check to be '''fast'''. It wastes dream time if you have to search around for a book or (perhaps worse) a mirror. Plus, it could also give your subconsciousness more time to produce real-life results, especially if you believe that the check will give real-life results.
* Third, a reality check should be '''discreet'''; that is, it should not draw too much attention to you when you do it in the waking world. Suddenly jumping in the air or trying to walk through a wall as a reality check could cause much embarrassment!
* Fourth, a reality check should not have &quot;false positives&quot;. These occur when the reality check shows you are dreaming in real life. When you get a dream result, do another reality check to be sure!
* A final important note is whether or not a reality check should have &quot;false negatives&quot;. These occur when a reality check shows you are in real life when you are actually dreaming. If you think you may be dreaming, keep doing tests until you prove yourself right!
 
On the table above, these are scored '''out of 5'''.

'''I have trouble remembering to do reality checks throughout the day. What reminders can I use?'''

You are lucky to have an interesting day and forget about lucid dreaming! You can tag your mind to remember dreaming when you think of certain things, like your friend or your homework. It isn't advisable to explicitly write “reality check” or “lucid” on your hand, as this could create an over dependence on this reminder, which may not exist in a dream. However, you might want to just draw a dot or small circle on your hand. This should be enough to remind you to do a reality check.

Try putting a little label on your clock, mobile phone, or watch, reminding yourself to do a reality check. (Some weird colors will make it more noticeable and it will take longer for you to get used to it and ignore it.) If you check these regularly during the course of your waking day, you will be doing lots of reality checks.

A simple coffee mug with a reminder such as &quot;Are you dreaming?&quot; printed on it or random alarms can also serve well, but try not to become too dependent on them. You can find examples of these at [http://bytered.com/gallery-purchase.html Byte Red] and [http://ld4all.com/ LD4All]. 

Another technique is to write down three things you do regularly in a day. Examples include hearing your name, going through a doorway, turning on a TV, beginning to read a book, or seeing a stranger. In the morning, choose three such events and intend to do a reality check whenever they happen in the following day.

'''I did a reality check in a dream but it said that I was not dreaming. What went wrong?'''

Some reality checks work perfectly for some people and awfully for others. These are mostly the light switches one and the hands one. If you find that the light switch works or that your hands are perfectly normal, you need to change to a different technique.

'''I did a reality check in a dream but I did not quite realize I was dreaming. What went wrong?'''

An example of this is looking into a mirror and seeing some huge boils or a gray mist on your reflection and not realizing that you are dreaming. This is rare if you actually intended to look into the mirror as a reality check. You need to be more careful when doing your reality checks in real life or pick more reliable reality checks which show more obviously that you are dreaming. Also try to pick reality checks that are easy to do. For example, don't rely the Time Reality Check if you never wear a watch, and don't pick the Mirror Reality Check if you rarely look in the mirror during the day or you know that you won't find a mirror in your dream.

Another good remedy for this problem (and a good practice in general) is to perform two or three reality checks at a time. The Time Reality Check, for example, can be easily combined with attempting to push one hand through another. Or, for those with glasses, testing your ability to read text fits naturally with checking for &quot;perfect eyesight w/o glasses&quot;.

==Techniques==
When you read through these techniques, remember that different techniques work for different people. There is no “best technique” and most techniques could be used to have 2&amp;ndash;5 lucid dreams every night! You could have several lucid dreams in a night, but you will not know it unless you remember them!

However, you will probably want some advice as to which technique you should try first. Consider whether you want to use a method which starts from a dream or a method which starts from being awake.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; If you master a technique which starts from being awake, you will eventually be able to have lucid dreams on demand when you sleep. For other techniques, you have to rely on your luck to give you lucid dreams after you have done your technique. Here are some advantages and disadvantages for specific techniques:

(Remember, it is ''essential'' to be able to recall at least one dream per night before attempting these techniques)

===WBTB===

|style=&quot;background-color: #efffef; border: 1px solid #bafaba;&quot;|Rated green. This technique has been successful in scientific research and/or is part of a commercial book about lucid dreaming.
|}

WBTB stands for “Wake-Back-To-Bed”.

Wake yourself up after 4 to 6 hours of sleep, get out of bed and stay up for anywhere between a few minutes to an hour before going back to bed. It is preferable that you do something related to lucid dreaming during this time (such as reading about lucid dreaming), but it is not required. This is best combined with other techniques; many people have amazing results with a MILD/WBTB combination. The WBTB technique significantly increases your chances of a lucid dream, and using MILD (see below) in conjunction increases your success rate if you are planning to sleep an hour or more after your WBTB session. However, you might need plenty of sleep time and therefore you may only be able to use it on weekends.

If you are sleeping too deeply to become lucid, then you can modify this technique. Try returning to sleep somewhere different than where you usually sleep, e.g. on a couch, a different bed, or even on the floor. If you are unable to do this, try changing the way you sleep, e.g. try sleeping with a lighter blanket or reversing the orientation of your body while in the bed (that is, swapping head and feet). Do this in order to teach your body that these different surroundings mean you want to have a more conscious sleep rather than a deeper sleep. In the beginning, different surroundings will also make you more alert, which can heighten your level of consciousness during sleep.

'''I am sometimes awake for very short times, but cannot pull myself together enough to get up and out of bed. What can I do?'''

Put a bright piece of paper on the wall or ceiling so that you will see it when you wake up. Other stimuli could be a hot water bottle, a light turned on under your bed, or an alarm clock. A good technique is to place an alarm clock out of arm's reach so that you are compelled to physically get up from bed and turn it off. If this is still insufficient to restore consciousness, try making a note of your intentions to remain awake and place the note on your alarm clock. After you get a lucid dream with this method, you'll find it easier and easier to get out of bed because you'll have more motivation.

This technique describes how to use [[w:Autosuggestion|auto-suggestion]] to have lucid dreams. It can be especially effective for people who are highly susceptible to [[Hypnosis|hypnosis]] or understand meditation, but for most people, MILD will probably be more effective.

As you are falling asleep, suggest to yourself that you will have a lucid dream either that night or in the near future. You can use a mantra (such as “I will recognize that I'm dreaming”) if you want, but make sure you don't try too hard to get a lucid dream. Instead of putting intentional effort into the suggestion, try to genuinely expect to have a lucid dream. Let yourself think expectantly about the lucid dream you are about to have, but be patient if you don't get one right away.

You may also use auto-suggestion to improve dream recall. Just use the technique as described above, but instead of suggesting that you'll have a lucid dream, suggest that you'll remember your dreams when you wake up. You could also use a mantra with this, such as “When I wake up, I will remember what I dreamt”. Just be careful not to put too much intentional effort into the mantra &amp;mdash; try to genuinely expect to remember your dreams instead.

===MILD===

MILD stands for “Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams&quot;, or sometimes, “Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream&quot;. The MILD technique was developed by Stephen LaBerge, and is described fully in his book ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming''.

With the MILD technique, as you are falling asleep, you concentrate on your intention to ''remember'' to recognize that you are dreaming. Repeat a short mantra in your head, such as “Next time I'm dreaming, I will remember I'm dreaming”. Think about what this means (i.e., that you want to remember that you are dreaming&amp;mdash;in the same way you might go to a grocery store and suddenly remember that you need bread), and imagine that you are back in a dream you've had recently, but this time you recognize that you are dreaming. For example, if you recently dreamed of flying, imagine realizing that it is a dream because you are flying. Keep repeating and visualizing the mantra until you are sure that your intention is set in your mind or you fall asleep. If you stop repeating and visualizing the mantra, then still try to make sure the last thing in your mind before falling asleep is your intention to remember to recognize that you are dreaming.

In general, the MILD technique can be practiced when you first go to bed at night, or after you have awakened from a dream during the night. If you practice the MILD technique after you have awakened from a dream, you should first run through the dream to ensure that you remember it. Some people find it helpful to jot down a few notes about their dream in their dream journal.

Once you have committed the dream to memory, go back to sleep and follow the steps above. But this time, visualize the dream you just had. Move through the dream in your mind until you encounter a dream-sign you originally missed.  Now, instead of missing the dream-sign, imagine yourself recognizing it and becoming “lucid”.

Repeat this until you have fallen asleep. You ''will'' re-enter the dream, and you ''will'' recognize the dream-sign and finally, become lucid.

===WILD===

WILD stands for “Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream”, or “Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams” to refer to any technique that involves falling asleep consciously. These techniques are similar to self-hypnosis. Some people believe that WILDs are not actual dreams, but are instead [[w:astral projection|astral projection]]. Various detailed resources are available under that moniker. 

For most people, they are far easier to induce in the early morning after waking up or in afternoon naps, as the sleep cycle will continue with a REM period. Once you are experienced with inducing WILDs, you can try to induce them at other times.

For WILDs to occur, it is best for your body to be completely relaxed. When you go back to bed, lie down comfortably. Now tense and relax your body, starting from your shoulders and working downwards, then back up to the face. This (or similar relaxation, meditation, or trance techniques) should make your body feel slightly heavy and relaxed. 

There are many different ways to induce WILDs, but they all involve simultaneously attempting to keep the mind aware while attempting to have the body fall asleep. A few techniques are detailed below.

If you pay attention to your physical body while using these techniques, then you will likely enter sleep paralysis (which usually happens after you are already asleep) without losing conscious awareness of your body. You will get a tingling and buzzing sensation (this might be unpleasant). These sensations might be so strong that you feel that you will die (e.g., you might feel a choking sensation), but don't worry, this is perfectly safe! In fact, this process happens to you every time you sleep, you are just not conscious during it. Sometimes you can simply wait until you fall asleep straight into a lucid dream. However, if you do not fall asleep, and you become completely paralyzed (with the exception of your eyes), do not try to move. Imagine your dream hand (or spirit hand if you prefer) going up and leaving your physical hand behind. Now you should have two separate bodies, a dream one and a real one. Control your dream body only &amp;mdash; if you control your real one, you will wake up. Now you can try to roll out of bed into your dream world (alternatively, you can get up and walk through a mirror, or sink into your bed). There is a possibility that after waking up from a dream that you initiated using this technique, you may still be paralyzed. If this phenomenon occurs, it may be accompanied by hallucinations. For example, you may wake up from a lucid dream that you started using one of the WILD techniques, and you will still be paralyzed, this is a state of [[w:Sleep paralysis|Sleep paralysis]].

If you have the experience then you have been given an example of what your mind can do, even without your direction. Before the phenomena was understood, as Sleep paralysis also occurs outside of Lucid Dream experiments it had been given a general negative outlook, while the experience is truly unique (partial awareness, unable to move, and multi-sense hallucinations) it is often linked to cultural fears, nightmares and other night terrors, Americans call it Old Hag Japanese people call it kanashibari, Korean people call it kawi nullida (being pressed by a pair of scissors), Turkish people call it ''karabasan'' and in old French it was called ''Cauquemare'', which was later transformed into the term ''cauchemar''. In any case as soon as you rationalize what is happening you should lose any fear by the temporary loss of muscular control and contextualize any hallucination.

====Chakra Technique====

|}

Using Chakra (&quot;third eye&quot;) meditation is one way to achieve WILDs. Basically, one has to focus solely on his third eye and breathing to achieve a lucid dream. This is a technique over 5000 years old, taught to Parvati by Shiva.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiva&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080104094658/www.totallyok.com/secret/007m.htm 112 Meditations from Shiva to Parvati]. ''Internet Archive.'' Accessed on 2009-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; He is quoted as saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiva&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Eyelid Patterns====

|}

This has been found to be very effective in many cases. However, it may lead to strange after effects, such as up to 15 dreams in one night, but otherwise, nothing harmful. This technique is as follows: When you go to sleep, ensure the room is completely dark. Then, with eyes closed, try to focus on the little dots that should appear to be moving on your eyelids. You will find that you can change their color at will. Continue focusing on these dots; make them dance around and form patterns and change colors, and eventually you should enter a Lucid Dream. This may take a little practice, but is usually very effective for summoning Lucid Dreams at will. Works better in conjunction with WBTB and other techniques mentioned above, but is still extraordinarily effective on its own.

====Hypnagogic Imagery====
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;

|}
Stimulate your thinking patterns by constantly switching your attention. After doing this long enough, the images and sounds should begin to take a momentum on their own (this is called hypnagogic imagery), and may they get very strange and illogical. You should enter a dream at this point and quickly become lucid. Otherwise, you will eventually realize you have entered sleep paralysis consciously (see above).    
Because hypnagogic sleep paralysis involves full consciousness, dreaming can sometimes be frighteningly real. There is often a feeling of being flipped upside down, spun, or being tugged upon by an outside force. Hypnagogic hallucinations may also include strange auditory hallucinations, dark beings and flying. 
It is possible to observe waking reality while in a hypnagogic state, but this is limited to the sensations of your physical body.  Most hypnagogic sleep paralysis states occur when sleeping face up.  There is evidence that the tendency toward experiencing Hypnagogic sleep paralysis may be hereditary.

====Counting====

Another technique is to count up to 100 in your head, optionally adding (for example) an “I'm dreaming” between each number. Alternatively, you can imagine stepping down stairs and reading each floor number, from 100 to 0. Try to make this image as vivid as possible &amp;mdash; include not only what you see, but also what you hear, feel (touch the banister), and smell. At some point this image should continue into a dream or you will begin to get sleep paralysis as described above. It is easy to lose count, especially with counting up to 100 with an 'I'm dreaming' with each number. But stay focused: you are not going to sleep; your body is, and you must concentrate fully.

====Sound Technique====

[Important advice regarding this, may be unsafe, just do one of the other methods instead. Some people have gained the hissing sound of Tinnitus permanently (throughout the day) using this method. See discussion page under [[Lucid Dreaming/Induction Techniques|Facts to know about Tinnitus]]]
|}

This method is for people, who can hear the &quot;tinnitus&quot;. The idea is pretty much the same as the other WILD methods, which is to remain conscious while entering the dream state. In order to use this method, you must sleep in a perfectly quiet place. You need to hear the inner buzzing sound inside your ears. Lay your body down and relax as much as possible while trying to hear the sound. If you are too tired, you will fall asleep too fast and it will be difficult to remain conscious - it this case you should combine it with WBTB. By time you realize that the buzzing sound will increase in intensity. This might frighten newcomers, but be assured - nothing bad is going to happen. No, you will not be deaf when you wake up, it’s perfectly safe! *It is just an effect caused by your brain is trying to change mode, from listening to the ambient sound, to listening to the sound of dreamland, which is not real sound but just electrical charge inputed to the part of the brain to create a sensation of hearing. By that time, you will enter the hypnagogic state. All you need to do is concentrate, do not be afraid or think of anything, just be still, and in time your dream body will float, separating from your physical body, and there you go, you arrive in the dreamworld.

Note: These sounds can be heard when you concentrate, even throughout the day - when you pay attention to them, but they shouldn't be heard much aloud if you are not in silence and concentrating on it - *as author said. The formula to hear it is quite simple:
come into complete silence close your eyes and listen: is there only absolute silence or is there - something else? some...? 
do not create some sound just concentrate - :-) The best thing on this tech is - you can do it when you want.

====Facts to know about Tinnitus====

Tinnitus is a condition termed for a hissing and whistling sound that one hears in his/her ears. It's a medical term for ringing in the ears. Several reasons lead to this irritating condition and the most common cause is the damage to the nerves located inside the ear. However, there are some other factors as well such as earwax buildup, exposure to loud noises, ear infections and certain medications. Remember, the first step in finding a natural care is to determine the actual cause of tinnitus.
Some Facts about Tinnitus.

The foremost thing to remember is that ringing in the ears is a symptom and not a disease. It's normal to a certain extent, however, the condition could be an indicator of a more serious condition. It's often related with hearing loss that is caused by aging. It can be a major nuisance when the ringing becomes very loud. The condition cannot be cured permanently but certainly can be eased.

'''Some Causes of Tinnitus'''

As mentioned above, ringing in the ear has some related causes and the most common out of them are damage of the cochlea due to aging (known as presbycusis), infection of the ear, exposure to loud noises and eardrum rupture. Amazingly, it has also been observed that excess ear wax buildup can also lead to this condition. Also, then there's the overuse of aspirin. Though, it's a very efficient pain reliever, its ototoxic properties (resulting into the damage to the ear) can result in tinnitus and worsen the condition in those that already have this ailment. 

Tinnitus can also be developed by the usage of antibiotics, particularly amino glycoside antibiotics (a powerful form of infection fighting drug) and quinine. Also, many studies have proven the relationship between tinnitus and stress. When the brain is under stress, it has a tendency to read ordinary as well as daily sounds as fearful. After this, the tinnitus develops or becomes worse. Thus, it's very important and critical to manage stress. And if that's not enough, there are other causes for tinnitus that are not that common but are 
quite serious: Some of them are:
* A jaw misalignment disorder known as Temporo-Mandibular Joint (TMJ) Syndrome
* Meniere's disorder which is a disorder with recurring episodes of vertigo
* Head and neck injuries (resulting in tinnitus in one ear)
* A benign tumor known as acoustic neuroma which develops on the cranial nerve that runs from the brain to the inner ear 

'''Treating Tinnitus'''

Putting in some hours with a therapist can really be beneficial and in several situations it's necessary to mental success even after the condition is alleviated. It's not easy to deal with anxiety and depression and knowing how to ignore the problem appropriately rather than indulging in it can be the best solution. It's also suggested to see a psychiatrist or psychologist who are experts with the patient suffering from the condition. This can be one of the [http://tinnituscureone.com/ cures for tinnitus relief] and getting control over your mind can build up tolerance towards this condition which can also benefit you in dealing with other problems as well.

Masking the noise in your head can also provide you with a solution when you're trying to sleep or get rid of heavy waves of noise being produced. As tinnitus can appear loud in a silent room, leaving it on radio static can let you proper sleep. Remember, alleviating your tinnitus is only the cure for ringing in the ear as the condition can only be minimized and not completely cured.

====Slight Physical Discomfort====

For the purpose of helping to retain your conscious awareness, slight physical discomfort is useful while performing any WILD technique. This prevents you from just drifting off to sleep. If you are lying down on your bed to do WILD and you are totally comfortable then your chances of going to sleep instead of remaining conscious are very high. The WILD technique relies on a form of deep trance induction, and many people who induce trances for other reasons rely on slight physical discomfort — for example the lotus position, or sitting in a hard-backed chair. Depending on your own preferences and your requirements of discomfort for success, you could choose from the following methods, arranged in ascending order of discomfort:
# Stacking pillows so that you can sit up in bed — the discomfort is caused by not being in a normal sleeping position.
# Lying down on a hard floor.
# Lifting your forearm vertically upwards, with the rest of your arm resting on the bed.
# Sitting in a hard chair.

===Incubating Dreams===

To incubate a dream about a specific topic, you should first think of a phrase that summarizes that topic (e.g., “I want to go to Atlantis.”). It may help to write the phrase down. If there is something you want to do in the dream, think of a phrase to summarize that too (e.g., “I want to watch Atlantis sink into the ocean.”). If you want to become lucid in the dream, then you should probably write something like “When I dream of [the topic], I will remember that I'm dreaming.” beneath your topic phrase. Immediately go to sleep and focus on your topic phrase. Visualize yourself dreaming about the topic and (if you want to become lucid) realizing that you are dreaming. If there is something specific you want to do in the dream, visualize yourself doing it once you become lucid (not very likely to work if you don't become lucid in the dream). Think about your phrase and topic (and intention to become lucid) as you fall asleep. Make sure that the last thing in your mind before falling asleep is your intention to (lucidly) dream about the topic you want to dream about. You might want to wake yourself up when the dream starts to fade so that you remember more of the dream; you can do this by ignoring your perception of the dream environment &amp;mdash; the opposite of dream stabilization techniques (just make sure you do a reality check when you wake up to make sure you are really awake).

Dream-chaining or “chaining dreams” is a method to re-enter your dream ''after you've woken up''. It can work for lucid and non-lucid dreams, but you will probably want to enter your dream lucidly.

Once you wake up from a dream (if you don't think you were dreaming before you woke up, it may not work well) you should stay still and keep your eyes closed. Small movements are okay, but the less movement, sensory stimulation, and less time awake, the better. Ideally, it should feel less like you've woken up, and more like you've taken a 30 second break from dreaming. Once you are prepared to go back to sleep, close your eyes and either visualize yourself back in your dream, or use the “spinning technique” given in the next chapter to imagine yourself spinning back “into” your dream. Spinning is a little faster than visualization. Be sure to maintain the fact that you are dreaming (unless you don't want to be lucid), or you may lose your lucidity while falling asleep. Once in the dream, stimulate your senses as early as possible (see the next chapter).

====VILD====

VILD stands for “Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams”, or sometimes, “Visually Incubated Lucid Dream”. This technique has been perfected by Peter Harrison, known as Pedro on the [http://ld4all.com/forum/ forums at ld4all.com]. You may wish to read [http://ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4789 the main thread about the technique]. The version described here has been adapted slightly.

First, make sure you are relaxed. You can use the relaxing technique mentioned in the description of the WILD technique. You can also imagine your brain emptying out and becoming sleepier. If you have a hard time falling asleep quickly, it should help to read a book (preferably about lucid dreaming) for a while before you go to sleep, until you feel very sleepy.

Now, you need to visualize a dream which you had prepared earlier. Here is an example of a prepared dream:
: I am in a red room with one door. A friend next to me asks me to show them what a reality check is. I do my reality checks (which show that I am dreaming), tell them that I am dreaming, and head towards the door.
Make sure you know exactly what the dream would be like, such as which friend, the exact words they say, and which reality checks you do. Reality checks that require no props, such as books or clocks, are recommended. Visualize this dream slowly three times, to make sure that you know every detail. Then, start going full-on and visualize the dream over and over. You should visualize the dream as though you are looking through your own eyes, not from a third-person perspective. If you find your thoughts drifting, ignore them and continue to visualize the dream continuously. You will need patience for this &amp;mdash; don't just give up if you think it won't work.

When you actually dream this, you will not notice the difference &amp;mdash; until you do your reality checks! Continue with the dream as you incubated it (e.g., remember to thank your friend!) before continuing through the door.

'''I tried to visualize the dream until I fell asleep, but I just stayed awake. What went wrong?'''

If visualizing keeps you awake, the VILD technique is not the technique for you! You should use a different technique.

====LILD====
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;

LILD stands for “Lucid Induction of Lucid Dreams”, or sometimes, “Lucidly Induced Lucid Dream”.

To use this technique, you need to have a lucid dream in the first place, but it can help you to get more later. The idea is to do something in your dream that will help you to become lucid the next time you are dreaming. For example, you could ask a dream character for help &amp;mdash; ask them to meet you the next night and tell you that you are dreaming. If it works out the way it should, then the next time you are dreaming, the dream character will walk up to you and tell you that you are dreaming, and so you'll (hopefully) become lucid. There are many variations on this technique; you could set up signs in your dreamworld that remind you to do a reality check or eat lucid pills instead! This technique is not likely to be very effective, but it ''can'' work; it relies on the chance that you'll subconsciously induce the reminder (i.e., the dream character or sign or whatever you used) during some later dream, and become lucid because of it.

Note that LILD is best used in conjunction with dream-signs and auto-suggested non-lucid dreams.  The basic idea as explained above is to have something in your dream that triggers the transition from normal dream state to lucid dreaming.  To simply tell a character to tell you that you are dreaming the next time you fall asleep is usually not enough.  There is no guarantee that you will dream about that character and there is no guarantee that your subconscious will believe the character enough to make you snap into lucidity (make you realize that you are in fact dreaming).  

Now as this technique suggests, you must have some previous alternate means of having a lucid dream.  Whatever technique you employ to get into this initial lucid dream state is not really important, but you should try to remember to use this technique (LILD) once you do get into a lucid dream state.  Thinking of this before falling asleep (MILD) sometimes helps and usually takes many lucid dreams before finally remembering.  Once you are in a lucid dream, make up a dream-sign.  It can be anything.  It can be an object.  It can be food or a drink (that doesn't taste like anything).  It is usually best to pick something that isn't quite right.  Something that on the surface would appear normal in the real world, but that upon closer inspection is not quite right.  Food or drinks are good as they can have no taste or not be refreshing in a dream.  But try and pick something that you dream about a lot so that there is a better chance of you dreaming about this dream-sign later on.  Now pick something else that only appears or happens in your lucid dream.  It can be anything.  If there is nothing in your current lucid dream, create something really strange.  Something that could never be confused with the real world.  Now mentally associate the dream-sign (food) with this unusual item or event that could never happen in the real world.  But at the same time, this unusual item or event should equate to &quot;lucid dreaming&quot;.  When you see the unusual item, it should only make you think of when you have a lucid dream as this should be the only time you encountered it.  So we have a 3 item associative link.  Do all of the above while in a lucid dream.

The next time you dream about your dream-sign, your subconscious will think of the unusual item or event.  The unusual item or event will make you think of lucid dreaming.  The two combined impossibilities (1. dream-sign that cannot exist in the real world  2. item or event that only appears in lucid dreams) will make your unconscious try to make a decision on all this.  This will make your conscious mind come to the surface and hopefully you will come to the conclusion that you are dreaming.  Many times, you will not want to deal with it because you are too tired (that is why you are sleeping, no?) and fall back into a normal dream state.  This is why it can take a few tries.  Eventually, your subconscious will start putting clear signs in your dreams like billboards that spell out &quot;YOU ARE DREAMING&quot;.  But once it triggers, it is quite the realization that an instant before, you had no real control over your actions and now you can do whatever you want.  Another note... if it failed, you will usually know why.  So next time, you can choose another dream-sign or slightly different technique or something more shocking.  Once you get this working once, it is relatively easy to use over and over as the hard part just described is over with.  Sometimes disassociative techniques are needed if used too much.

To sum up, this technique is a way to force a reality check while in a normal dream state where your subconscious has no choice but to come to the conclusion that you are in fact dreaming.  Once your mind knows that you are dreaming, there will be no other conclusion than your conscious mind taking over.  And this is what lucid dreaming is all about.

# For one week, go to bed at the same time each night and get up 90 minutes earlier than you usually do. Spend those 90 minutes doing reality checks every 2&amp;ndash;5 minutes.
# Thereafter, on alternate days: follow the routine from step one, and set the intention to do your reality check routine at its regular time, while getting a full night sleep. This will cause the reality check conditioning to kick in during REM prime-time.

===Tibetan methods===
Tibetan Buddhists practice what is known as Tibetan dream yoga. Probably the most time consuming way of inducing lucid dreams, it is also, according to the practitioners, the most rewarding. The basic practice is ''awareness''. Awareness should be practiced while sleeping just as well as while being awake. Meditating on the question “who is aware?” might catapult you into a higher degree of awareness according to Buddhist beliefs. Keeping this level of awareness is another matter. The Tibetans have developed many yogic exercises and disciplines to be practiced. Maybe the most interesting difference between Tibetan dream yoga and modern western methods of lucid dream induction is the Tibetan claim of the possibility to be aware during deep sleep, not only in the REM periods of sleep. For the reader who is interested in these methods a good start is to begin to regard all experience as a dream. After all, from the countless multitude of matter and radiation reaching our senses the nervous system tunes in only to a small fraction of this chaos. For members of the phalanx that believes we, more or less, create our own reality in the above sense this practice should feel natural. In general though, it is recommended to gain instruction from a teacher in the flesh rather than from books (like this one!).

The Tibetan Methods are not &quot;time consuming&quot; if the goal is to go into deeper than Lucid states. From a Raja Yoga stand point, from a Daoist standpoint, and from a Tibetan Yoga standpoint the goal is not to &quot;play&quot; in Lucid Dreams, but to dispel the delusional nature of what we call &quot;reality.&quot; Also, to heal and to develop super-learning. Now &quot;super-learning&quot; is a relative term, it depends on your culture, modernity (in terms of entrepreneurialism - in 3rd world, 2nd world, 1st world sense; &quot;are you developing a better rickshaw or are you developing an engine that runs off of water, what is relevant?&quot;), and on the &quot;energy&quot; you find most attractive: innovative, creative, joyous, blissful, love, power, wisdom, mirth. Are you Ambitious-Worldly or Ambitious-Spiritual? All these factors play into it.

These techniques are very easy to learn and are rooted in a deeper science than the WILD, VILD, LILD -- one that does not use auto-suggestion or forced recall. In conclusion, the Tibetan methods are advanced yogic techniques that only an accomplished practitioner can fully teach. If one does not have access to a Tibetan dream yogi, one should probably concentrate on techniques that are more mundane from a Western point of view.

===Other techniques===
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|style=&quot;background-color: #ffefef; border: 1px solid #fababa&quot;|Rated red. There have been no anecdotes found of these techniques working.
|}

Many of these are combinations of other techniques with some addition or modification.

* '''Inducing dream-signs''' - You can become lucid by trying to induce specific dream-signs to watch for during your dream. You can use auto-suggestion (see above) to associate a specific dream-sign with doing a reality check, or you can just get used to doing a reality check whenever you encounter the dream-sign while awake. Some dream-signs you can use:
** '''Thirst''' - Avoid drinking for very long. Wake up later in the night and put salt on your tongue or eat chili to make you even thirstier. Fill a glass of fresh cold water and take it with you back to bed. Hopefully, you'll dream of getting something to drink. Don't use this technique if you have trouble falling asleep while thirsty.
** '''False Awakening''' - Set your intention as you fall asleep to wake up in the middle of the night. If you are a heavy sleeper, you'll hopefully dream of waking up in the middle of the night. If you are a light sleeper, you are probably more likely to really wake up.
** '''Bladder''' - Drink large amounts of water before going to sleep. You should dream of having to go to the bathroom. You may wet your bed! This technique should be used carefully, to avoid the possibility of [[w:Water_intoxication|water intoxication]].
* '''Conditioning''' - Strictly punish or reward yourself after a dream where you failed to realize you were dreaming or when you do have a lucid dream. This could increase motivation but not necessarily cause lucid dreams in itself. Cognitive psychology, however, states that this punishment/reward system is very counterproductive, because it ties our self-esteem to the outcome of the endeavor. The opposite of this system would be to see each attempt, including those that fail, as another step towards success.
* '''Muscle Exhaustion''' - Lift slight weights with one's arms and legs for about fifteen minutes before one begins to fall asleep.  One should not, however, lift anything that strains the muscles too much, for that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and excites the body.  The method should cause a release of tension in the muscles and tire them out.  This combined with relaxation techniques and any of the -ILD's should produce a positive result.

==Other methods==
===Food and drink===
There are various foods and drinks that you can consume which seem to have some effect on sleeping and dreaming. Note that for most of these there is no explanation or scientific study of how they work, and some may simply be placebos.

Don't go overboard with the consumption of any of these, as overdosing could have nasty effects (well, milk should be safe unless you are allergic). '''Don't experiment without accumulating enough knowledge first.''' The authors in no way encourage the use of legal or illegal drugs.

* The amino acid tryptophan, which can be found in warm milk amongst other sources, is a precursor for the hormone serotonin, and has been proven to help you fall asleep.
* Vitamin B6 and others of the B group are important for neuronal functions.
* [[w:Melatonin|Melatonin]] is a hormone with neuronal effects. It is produced by the pineal gland in darkness and is suppressed by blue light. Wearing blue-blocking sunglasses or avoiding bright light in general the hours before bedtime maximizes night-time melatonin secretion.
* [[w:5-HTP|5-HTP]] or [[w:L-5-HTP|L-5-HTP]] is a supplement that is related to serotonin, which some claim has induced lucid dreaming on approximately half the nights it is taken.
* [[w:Caffeine|Caffeine]] is useful in WILD techniques, as it helps the mind stay focused and think vividly. Please notice that caffeine is an addictive substance and may have negative effects on your health.
* An [[w:Amino Acid|Amino Acid]] Blend made up of 2000mg L-aspartic acid, 4000mg L-glutamine, and 300mg [[w:Theanine|L-theanine]] can substantially increase your odds of having a Lucid Dream.
* [[w:Galantamine | Galantamine]] - acetylcholinesterase inhibitors extract from plants such as ''Lycoris radiata'' (Red Spider Lily) or from chemical synthesis. Works best when taken together with choline and/or alpha-GPC.
Some people who practice Lucid dream (LD) or  Out of body experience (OBE) use Galantamine to increase their odds to achieve LD or OBE. By taking small amount of Galantamine (around 4 to 8 mg) after 5 to 6 hours of deep sleep and practice the induction technique such as [[Happiness/Meditation|meditation]], MILD or WILD many people report more success with Galantamine.

There also report that taking Galantamine without proper induction technique will not lead to LD or OBE but will result in only a vivid dream instead. It should also be noted that due to a long half life Galantamine will stay in the body for a period of up to and over 48 hours, as such it is advisable to space out the use of Galantamine over a period of three days so that the body does not build a resistance to the drug ruining its effectiveness.

Some people report mixing Galantamine with other Nootropic can enhance the degree of lucidity but this is still controversial since some mixtures may work for some people, but lead to failure for others.

===Drugs===
Dissociatives and hallucinogens can be used to create a (more or less) lucid dream-like state, though whether or not these help with lucid dreaming is debatable. '''The authors do not recommend use of these substances for induction of lucid dreams, nor do they urge the breaking of any applicable laws.'''

Some dissociatives and hallucinogens are:
* [[w:Amanita muscaria|Amanita muscaria]]
* [[w:Banisteriopsis caapi|Ayahuasca]]
* [[w:Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] - Common in the shamanic method of drinking Ayahuasca, to the result of entering the spirit realm.

===Gadgets===
There are various gadgets you can use to become lucid easily. They generally detect when you are in the REM state and then provide a light and/or sound signal. This signal is supposed to be adjusted so that it doesn't wake you up but does enter your dream. The signal is then recognized as showing that you are dreaming, and you become lucid.

The most well-known device is the NovaDreamer from the Lucidity Institute. However, this product is no longer produced. Be sure to check for recommendations for devices from lucid dreaming forums.

A similar device is the [http://www.wellnesstools.com/dreammaker_quickinfo.htm DreamMaker].  The DreamMaker works very similarly to the NovaDreamer but without the Dream Alarm feature, which worked to wake the dreamer in the middle of the REM state.  This device comes with a mask, a circuit board with adjustable controls, the batteries needed to operate it, a short owner's manual, a lucid dreaming workbook, and the [[w:Stephen LaBerge|Stephen LaBerge]] book ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming''.  The circuit board is supplied completely ready to use, but you have to insert the batteries and put the circuit board into the mask yourself.

An alternative is the [http://brindefalk.solarbotics.net/kvasar/kvasar.html Kvasar]. The Kvasar costs about $20 in raw materials, but needs to be constructed by somebody skilled in electronics as it is not sold commercially. It can also be hard to operate.

Another do-it-yourself alternative to commercial dreaming masks is Nate True's [http://cre.ations.net/creation/face-mounted-lucid-dreaming-mask Lucid Dream Mask], which does not bother with difficult-to-calibrate sensors and just uses a timer for flashing lights, and has (ostensibly) competitive results with all of the former gadgets.

The owners of Wellness Tools, who makes the DreamMaker, and Kvasar have not had friendly relations; see [http://web.archive.org/web/20080504084354/http://www.dreamviews.com/community/showthread.php?t=11228 DreamViews.com].

====Hypnosis====
The techniques commonly referred to as hypnosis is based in a set of hypnotic suggestions are commonly composed of a series of instructions and ideas that may be delivered by a hypnotist in the presence of the subject, or they may be self-administered (&quot;self-suggestion&quot; or &quot;autosuggestion&quot;), even in a conscious state.

Hypnosis is not a science. In fact, it has in almost every aspect eluded scientific analysis, as it is extremely hard to generalize (each individual responds differently and at different levels) and the methodology is so diverse and based on yet to be completely understood mental/biological phenomena, most related with faith or the placebo effect. For the phenomena to work, whom in aggregate we define as hypnosis, the mind has to be able to turn the suggestions into reality. All hypnosis is ultimately self hypnosis. If you, for instance, take into consideration the problems that faith beliefs have caused to the human race, or even the problems in the field of psychology, you can appreciate the problem of scientifically studying hypnotic phenomena, as they are extremely open to individual interpretation and to one's ability to be open to suggestibility (self-induced or otherwise).

The Wikibook's work on [[Hypnosis]] will covers the subject in greater detail. It will also offer support material, or reference it, such as methods to induce, or reinforce specific mental states (or states of mind) and any attitudes and beliefs that impact the phenomena. Including information on techniques or procedures for hypnotic induction and hypnotic suggestion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Cable cutters.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cable cutters.   These are used also to cut cable housings, (Bowden cables), that are reinforced with several steel wires.]]
Brake and derailleur cables are extremely difficult to cut with a standard pair of wire cutters (sometimes called side or diagonal cutters); when it is finally accomplished, this process usually leaves a frayed mess of the inner cable, which is impossible to slip through the cable housing or the hole in a fastening bolt. In addition, the jaws of these cutters are made for cutting copper electrical wire, and will become notched when cutting steel bicycle cables.

'''Cable cutters''' specifically designed for steel cable, on bicycles or elsewhere, are available at prices low enough to eliminate this nuisance. They are generally similar to regular cutters or scissors, but have extra-hard jaws, each of which carries a v-shaped notch. When cutting a cable, the notches overlap, trapping the cable in a diamond shaped hole with sharp edges, which becomes smaller as the handle is compressed, thereby cutting the cable easily without fraying and with no damage to the tool. They are also useful for cutting the cable housing, although they often close the inner sleeve, and it needs to be re-opened with a piece of cable or other means.   Sometimes their use leaves a small burr on the housing which may need to be filed off.

# Put rice and water in pan or [[Cookbook:Rice Cooker|rice cooker]] to cook, I used the 10-minute variety.
# Spray [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]] with cooking spray, sprinkle in garlic powder and other seasonings. Put in turkey and crumble it as it cooks. Add can of tomatoes (a whole can is actually too much for us but it still tasted good.) Mix with turkey till turkey is cooked.
# Rice will be done before ground turkey. Use a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] or deep [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]], add cooking oil add 1-teaspoon All Spice and/or other seasonings. As pan heats slowly add cooked rice (watch for splattering of hot oil). When rice is heated evenly add Teriyaki Sauce and mix it evenly.

==Talk from en:==

This recipe sounds delicious. I must try it.

Ok. I bite. Where can I get some of this Mrs. Dash stuff?

It should be available at any supermarket. They have different varieties, even. no salt.

:This calls for an awful lot of name brand ingredients. Are you sure it's not taken from a product label or something? -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]]

Oerr new recipe coming up... I'll beat him to it [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]]

The recipe sounded really good. Perhaps, instead of Mrs. Dash, add &quot;salt-free spice&quot; or something to that effect?

What about '''Jennie-O''' turkey and '''Del Monte''' diced tomatoes. lol, are you for real?
:Sounds copyrighted.  Don't forget the Pam (TM) cooking spray.  [[User:Koyaanis Qatsi|Koyaanis Qatsi]]

- just change the brand names to generic terms, and it should be okay. &quot;canned diced tomatoes&quot;, &quot;ground turkey&quot;, &quot;cooking spray&quot;.

I'm not sure I trust the idea of recipes on Wiki. It's too easy for someone to come along and change the ingredients and muck it up. LOL. ~~

::? People can do that with ''any'' fact in Wikipedia. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:::Of course they can. But if I take a recipe from here and it says use 3 gallons of Chicken stock and half a cupfull of rice, instead of a pint of stock and two cups of rice, my guests will be sorely disappointed. Certainly a lot more disappointed than if I relate the story I read on Wikipedia about Adolf Hitler's early life in Liverpool painting ceilings! [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]]

::::I would be equally disappointed if I memorized a fact gleamed from Wikipedia only to fail an exam. --mav

:::::Well Ok. I could easily poison someone if a recipe read to cook something for 20 minutes when it should be cooked for 2 hours. Now I suppose you'll tell me that if I used Wikipedia to help me study my anatomy exam I could accidentally cut the wrong artery or something. LOL [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]]

- good point. I hadn't thought of that.

true! but the recipe sounds too yummy not trying it. Some wikipedians can try it using brand ingredients of their choices and tell us how it tastes.

----
It reminds me to eat my chicken diner now. Hey some articles help people not be Wikipediholic even though they are gonna be. [[kt2]]

Wikipedios Anonymous. It's a 12-wik program &lt;rimshot.wav&gt;.

I am the recipe creator although I posted it somewhere else first I did create it. The reason I mentioned the products so much is 1. allows user an idea of who/what 2. Recently started lifestyle change that makes you a little more responsible with what you put in to your system =*)
Bodyforlife.com is the plan, I have lost 20 pounds in 3 months and feel better than I have in a long time. Enough commercials. Oh by the way it was Kroger brand Butter flavored cooking spray. Mike Feddersen

:That's good enough for me. Please do indicate this in the edit summary next time so that you are not wrongly accused of copyright infringement in the future. --mav

Well, it sounds like a good recipe. I am going to find it, and print it. Is the bodyforlife system based on a lowfat philosophy?

Discussion from [[en:Talk:Cottage Cheese Eggs]]

WTF is this? Sounds revolting, please take out accreditations about your wife and whatnot. Is this copyright somewhere?

:Is there maybe a '''Wikipedia is not a Cookbook'''? -- [[User:Wapcaplet|Wapcaplet]]

:: oddly enough, we have a Wikipedia Cookbook... -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 10:51 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)

:Actually, it's even more revolting than it sounds. [[User:213.107.49.131|213.107.49.131]] 14:35, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

''Makes 16 wontons or 24 small wontons''

==Ingredients==

*1 cup [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
*16 [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrapper]]s or 24 egg roll wrappers
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (for frying)
* [[cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet and sour sauce]]

==Procedure==
#Heat oil in a [[cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat fryer]] or pour into a deep [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]] on high temperature. [[cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] or [[cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]] works best.
#While oil is heating, lay out as many wrappers as you plan to use. Have a small bowl of water nearby to wet your fingers. Put a small dab of cream cheese in one corner of each wrapper, about 1/2” from the edges. Use about 2 tsp. for egg roll wrappers or 1 tsp. for wonton wrappers. Using your fingers, wet the two edges nearest the cream cheese, then fold the other half down and seal the edges, making a triangle shape. Seal the edges tightly, but try to leave small gaps at the corners so the triangles will not expand so much that they burst.
#Drop several wontons into oil at a time. Turn over when the edges start to brown and cook for another minute or two. Set on paper towels to drain, then serve hot with sweet-and-sour sauce.

The '''Au Jus Sandwich''' is also known as '''Roast Beef Au Jus''', and is better known in America as the '''French Dip Sandwich'''. It traces its origins to downtown Los Angeles in either 1908 or 1918, when a local restaurant owner was making a sandwich for a police officer and accidentally dropped a French roll into a pan containing beef drippings. 

The officer liked the sandwich so much that he brought some friends in the next day for the new invention. From that point on, the Au Jus sandwich went on to become internationally known. Two Los Angeles restaurants claim to have created the sandwich: Philippe The Original and Cole's Pacific Electric (P.E.) Buffet. Both have been in operation since 1908. For more information on the history of the sandwich, see the [[w:French Dip Sandwich|Wikipedia article]].

== Ingredients ==

* 3 tablespoon flour
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] roast or other cut of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] 
* 1 beef bullion cube
* 1 can beef [[w:Consommé|consommé]] (~2 cups/10.5 oz), bullion cube equivalent, or additional roast beef
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Onion Soup|French onion soup]] (~2 cups)
* 4 French/sandwich/hoagie rolls
* 1 cup of butter
* 1 can of [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] (optional)
* spices (e.g., salt, pepper) (optional)

== Procedure ==

# Combine all the ingredients except the rolls in a [[Cookbook:Slow Cooker|slow cooker or crock pot]]. Let the mixture [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] for at least six hours. This step is critical because it makes the meat tender.
# You can either pre-dip the sandwich, or serve with a bowl of meat drippings. Serve beef on split hoagie rolls or miniature French bread loaves. When serving the drippings separately, remove the beef shreds from the juices and serve with a small bowl of meat drippings on the side. Dip the sandwiches in the drippings as you eat.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Bread can be toasted and buttered before adding beef.
* In the original sandwich, the bread was dipped in the juice prior to adding the meat, rather than dipped at the table.
* Other meats can be substituted, including [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], and [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]].
* Try adding [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]], or [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] to the sandwich.

== Warnings ==

{{Wikipedia|French Dip Sandwich}}
* Always follow the instructions for your [[Cookbook:Slow Cooker|slow cooker or crock pot]].

== Move ==

I think this recipe should be moved to something like [[Cookbook:Au Jus Sandwich]], since this has nothing to do with the French and have the French Dip Sandwich part be the secondary name.  Could just be me though.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 20:22, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Empanadas.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Peruvian empanadas]]
In Spain, Latin America, and the Philippines, an [[wikipedia:empanada|empanada]] is essentially a stuffed pastry.

The filling usually consists primarily of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]. It may also contain [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], ''humita'' corn with [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel sauce]], or [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]. Fruit is used to create a [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] empanada. Dessert empandas are usually baked, but may be fried. In some [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Argentina|Argentinean]] provinces, empanadas can be spiced with peppers, more akin to those of the rest of South America.

[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chilean]] empanadas also use a wheat flour-based dough, but the meat filling is slightly different and often contains more onion. Chileans consider the Argentine filling ''seco'', or dry. Fried empanadas of shrimp/prawns and cheese are a favourite dish of the coastal areas, like Viña del Mar.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Colombia|Colombia]], common empanadas are filled with chopped meat, pieces of potato, and yellow rice, and are eaten with a spicy sauce made of cilantro and ají pepper, stuffed in a corn-based pastry and fried.

It is likely that empanadas are originally from Galicia, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]], where they were prepared rather like Cornish pasties as a portable and hearty meal for working people and often filled with leftovers or staple ingredients. Tuna and chicken are varieties still seen in Galicia.

==Wheat Dough Recipe==

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], approx. 8 cups
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*200 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]), approx. 1 cup
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2-3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] cold water
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]

===Procedure===
#Dissolve salt in water.  
#Mix eggs, flour, butter and 1 cup of water to form a dough.  While kneading the dough, gradually add in more water until the dough is soft and stretchy.  If the dough becomes sticky, add more flour.  
#Once the dough is the desired consistency, allow to rest for a couple minutes, then roll it out to a thickness of ~2-3 [[Cookbook:mm|mm]] (1/10 inch).  
#Cut the dough into discs roughly 10-15 [[Cookbook:cm|cm]] (4 to 6 inches) in diameter.

For a flakier crust, before cutting it into discs, lightly coat the dough with olive oil and dust with cornstarch.  Fold the dough in half (with the cornstarch on the inside) and again coat with oil and cornstarch. Fold again and roll out to a thickness of ~2-3 mm (1/10 inch).

==Filling (''Relleno'')==

Every household in Argentina has its own special recipe for empanada filling.  The fillings vary from region to region, with some being sweet and others spicy.  The following is a recipe for a sweet empanada filling typical of those found in the province of Santa Fe.

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tblsp]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 tblsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] (''comino''), optional. Cumin is very invasive and gives the filling a whole different flavor.
*1/2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/4 tsp [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1/4 tsp [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]s
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*[[Cookbook:Green Olives|green olives]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Dice|dice]]d hardboiled [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] (optional)
*diced boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es (optional)

===Procedure===
#Dice onion into small pieces and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] in vegetable oil in a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]. Add and [[Cookbook:Brown|brown]] ground beef.  
#While beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar and spices. 
#Once meat has finished cooking, remove from heat and add raisins.  
#If desired add sliced olives, egg or potatoes.

==Filling (''Pino'')==

&quot;Pino&quot; is the name of the filling used in Chilean empanadas. Much like filling for Argentine empanadas, each Chilean household has their own pino. The one below is like the Argentine but includes more onions and does not have the cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves, and uses less sugar.

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tblsp]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 tblsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] (''comino'')
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*[[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
*[[Cookbook:Dice|dice]]d hardboiled [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

===Procedure===
#Dice onion into small pieces and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] in olive oil in a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]. Mince garlic and add to the onions. Add and [[Cookbook:Brown|brown]] ground beef.  
#While beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar, spices and bay leaf. 
#Allow to [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for about 20 mins for flavours to blend.
#Remove bay leaf, and add olives and raisins.

==Empanada preparation==

#Place 1-2 tablespoons of empanada filling into the center of one of the dough discs (''[[Cookbook:Tapas|tapas]]'').
#If Chilean empanadas are being made add one piece of the diced hardboiled egg next to the filling.
#Wet the outer edge of the tapa with cold water and fold the tapa in half to encase the filling, ensuring there is no air left inside (the wet portion will help the dough stick together, air will burst out when cooked).  
#Holding the empanada in the palm of one hand, with the round edge pointing outwards, pinch and twist over a small (finger-sized) portion of the dough at the top.  Continue pinching and twisting around the outer edge until you reach the bottom of the empanada, so that the open edge is sealed shut.  (you can also use a fork to smash together the lips of the outer edge, but it is not the traditional way and the filling can burst through).  
#Repeat for the remaining filling and dough.
#To cook the empanadas, [[Cookbook:Deep fry|deep fry]] in vegetable oil on medium heat until golden brown.  Alternatively, you can glaze them with butter and cook on a cookie sheet in the oven at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|400 °F]] for 8-10 minutes or until light brown. 
#Allow empanadas to cool and then eat.     

Empanadas are usually eaten with your hands (like a [[Cookbook:Taco|taco]] or [[Cookbook:Burrito|burrito]]).

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 tsp ground allspice
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 2 tbsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* 1/2 tbsp dried thyme
* 2 tbsp dehydrated lemon peel
* 3 tbsp dark rum
* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1/4 cup brown mustard

== Procedure ==
#Combine rum and mustard and rub all over chicken.
#Combine remaining ingredients and rub all over chicken. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.(Better if marinated over night
#Place on a greased preheated charcoal grill and cook, turning constantly until internal temperature reaches 165°F. Remove and let rest for 10 minutes. Serves 4.

==Tips, tricks and variations==
The spices always included allspice because the berries of the pimento tree are the source of allspice.
When cooking the meat, barbecue is by far the best technique, failing that oven bake. Basting with beer is worth trying. Serve with rice and peas.

==Warnings==
See the [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper#Precautions|chili pepper]] warnings.

'''Goulash''' ('''Gulyás''' in [[w:Hungarian language|Hungarian]], meaning cattle stockmen) is a dish from the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hungary|Hungarian cuisine]]. 
Here is one very simple Goulash stew recipe, being pretty close to the idealised version.
It is important not to use hot paprika, use the red powder sold simply as &quot;paprika&quot; in most supermarkets instead, hot peppers (chilli) would make the soup too spicy and of the wrong consistency when used exclusively. They can be used for flavouring in various degrees instead.
Sweet paprika can be obtained from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] or central [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] delicatessens and specialist supermarkets. It is normally sold in 250 [[Cookbook:g|g]] sachets.

==Ingredients== 
* 3 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 1 and a half pound (750 g) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper| bell pepper]]s
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Paprika| ground sweet paprika]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Black Pepper| black peppercorn]] 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]] 
* a half [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (6 whole cloves)
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* salt to taste

==Procedure==
# Chop the onions and the vegetables. Fry half of the onions in the pot. Take some beef (leg or stringy meat) and cut it into small cubes. 
#Put a layer of meat on the bottom of a pot over the fried onions, then a layer of onions, vegetables, the whole garlic cloves, spices and salt. (Wait with the potato). Add another meat layer; continue until you have used all the ingredients, except the potato.  
#Cover the meat with water. Put on a lid, simmer on low heat. Add water only if there is not enough while cooking. It requires almost no stirring. 
#When the meat is cooked, add large pieces of potatoes, add water to cover it if needed, and cook for further 15 minutes.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Its colour could be even nicer if you add more paprika in the last 10 minutes.
* Add half pound lean cubed pork meat (if you wish) after 20 minutes.
* If you're not afraid of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]s add some bacon to the dish.
* A pinch of caraway (seeds or grounded) is often used (''caraway'' not cumin)

'''Hungarian cooking'''
Traditional Hungarian cuisine relies on a wide variety of high quality ingredients produced in the country including meats, seasonal vegetables, fruits and honey.

Here are some recipes:
*[[Cookbook:Goulash|Goulash Stew]] (''pörkölt'')
*[[Cookbook:Goulash Soup|Goulash Soup]] (''gulyás leves'')
*[[Cookbook:Paprika Chicken|Paprika Chicken]] (''paprikás csirke'')
*[[Cookbook:Potato Casserole (Rakott Krumpli)|Rackott Krumpli]] (''rakott krumpli''), potato casserole
*[[Cookbook:Silvash Gombotz|Silvash Gombotz]] (''szilvás gombóc''), plum dumplings
*[[Cookbook:Kifli|Vanilla Kifli]], crescent shaped sweet pastry

'''Starters'''

Soup is the quintessential Hungarian starter, and there are literally hundreds of types including cold fruit soups in summer. Another Hungarian speciality is various types of entrails, tripe or particularly pork, duck and goose liver. (foie gras - goose liver).
 
'''Main Dishes'''

Various types of meats are key to many main dishes, particularly pork, beef and chicken. Two breeds unique to Hungary are the Mangalica pig and the Grey long-horned cattle. Game meats such as venison, vild goose,  pheasant and wild boar are also common.  Fresh water fish such as trout, pike, perch and carp are used in the Hungarian cuisine. Potatoes are the usual accompaniment to many dishes, but rice, egg barley, dumplings and pasta are also used. Onions, garlic caravay, parsley and fresh or ground [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] add flavour to many dishes.

'''Desserts and Cakes'''

Hungarians are passionate about their desserts and cakes. A typical dessert is pancakes stuffed with jam, sweet curd cheese or the Gundel pankake, hazelnut puree and served with chocolate sauce. Hungarian cakes tend to be very sweet and are often laced with cream. Famous examples include Dobos and Esterhazy Cakes. Strudel is as much a Hungarian as an Austrian dish, and is typically filled with apple, sour cherries, curd cheese or poppy seeds.

[[Image:Guacamole.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Guacamole is a Mexican dish made from crushed avocado]]

'''Guacamole''' is a spicy [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] paste made from crushed avocado and various [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|seasonings]], usually including [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]].  Guacamole is used as a condiment, an ingredient, and as an [[Cookbook:Appetizers|appetizer]] when served with [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]].

==Recipe I==
===Ingredients===
*4 [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]s
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Pico de Gallo|pico de gallo]]
*Juice of 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*2 chopped [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|Jalapeño]] OR 2 tablespoons crushed [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]] OR 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 1/2 teaspoon chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1/2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 minced jalapeño OR 2 minced [[Cookbook:Chile Pepper|serrano chiles]] OR 2 tablespoon minced any chile pepper like (adjust for spiciness)

===Procedure===
Pit the avocados. Score avocado  without cutting through the skin. Scoop out one avocado with a large spoon and place in mixing bowl. Add the lime juice and stir to evenly coat the avocados. Stir in the Pico de Gallo, garlic, oil, jalapeño, salt,  red pepper, and black pepper, mashing and tossing the avocado pieces until thoroughly mixed. Then scoop out the other avocados and gently mix and toss in the larger pieces. The guacamole is the right consistency when more large pieces than mashed parts remain. Garnish with a sprig of cilantro.

==Recipe II==
''The ingredients and quantities of this recipe are tuned to the tastes of one contributor; you should experiment with it. (Especially note that it has got rather a lot of lime, and you might want to add peppers, chilis or tabasco.)''

===Ingredients===
*2 very ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]]
*1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped
*[[Cookbook:Juice|juice]] of 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]]
*1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|Red onion]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] very small
*1 small [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], diced very small
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaves)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

===Procedure===
Put everything except the avocados into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Halve the avocados and scoop the flesh into the bowl. Using a large fork (or a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]), mash the avocados and combine with all the other ingredients. Taste the mixture and add anything you think necessary (be aware that the flavors, especially the lime, will soften a little by the time it is served). Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow the flavors to blend. When it is removed from the refrigerator, there may be some brown on the top, to avoid brown, add guacamole pit to preserve. - scrape it off.

==Recipe III==

This alternative recipe is somewhat simpler, but gives an extremely tasty Guacamole which is great with [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], or can be used in [[Cookbook:Enchilada|enchiladas]], etc. It also avoids messing about with messy [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], or coriander, which some people do not like the taste of. I have tried many guacamole recipes over the years, this is both the simplest, and in my opinion, the tastiest I know.

===Ingredients===
*3 whole [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]], ripe but not over-ripe
*1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*2 or 3 whole red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli peppers]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===Procedure===
Prepare avocados by halving and removing the stone (the simplest way to do this is to hold the avocado in the palm of your hand and strike the stone squarely and firmly with a chef's knife - the knife will then pull the stone out easily. If it doesn't come out easily, the avocado isn't ripe enough). Keep one half avocado back, skin and blend the rest using a hand-held food processor, add the juice of the lime, finely chop chillies and garlic, add and blend a bit longer. Add generous salt to taste. Finally roughly chop avocado half kept back and add to paste to give chunky texture. Resulting dip will keep for several days in a fridge, shouldn't brown too much if covered (the lime juice will act as an antioxidant as well as giving a nice flavour), but in general will be found to disappear very rapidly by enthusiastic consumers!

==Recipe IV (quick)==
This recipe is great if you have the ripe avocados because you can make it in about five minutes.

===Ingredients===
* 3-4 ripe avocados
* juice of 1/2 lime
* mild store-bought salsa

===Procedure===
# Peel, seed, and mash the avocados.
# Add the juice of 1/2 lime.
# Stir in store bought (but fresh) mild or medium salsa to taste.
# Serve immediately.

===Variant===
# For fancier version, make your own [[Cookbook:Pico de Gallo|Pico de Gallo]] for use instead of store-bought salsa

==Recipe V (simple)==
This is a rather simple recipe, needing only avocado, lime, dried chili and salt.

===Ingredients===
*1 ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]
*1/2 a [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*[[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red pepper]] flakes - to taste 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] - to taste
Note: fresh hot peppers also work well, instead of the red pepper flakes, if available - if used, slice them finely.

===Procedure===
Peel the avocado and pit it, then slice the avocado into small chunks, around a [[Cookbook:cm|centimeter]] or half-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] per side.  Juice half the lime.  Add the lime, some salt, and a moderate amount of red pepper to the avocado chunks.  Err on the side of adding too little spice; it's easy to add more, but too much makes the guacamole really scorch.  Mash the ingredients together.

==Recipe VI (simplest)==
This recipe is the simplest of the group. It is very simple and more attuned to use as an additive. This recipe is a more traditional Mexican guacamole and does not include many of the features commonly associated with the dish be Americans used to the Tex-Mex Version.

===Ingredients===
*2 ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]]
*juice of 1/2 lime
*2 tablespoons (app.) chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
*salt to taste

===Procedure===
Pit avocado by, carefully, lodging base end of chef's knife in pit, twisting to remove, and then pinching the pit off of the knife. Remove flesh with large spoon, being careful to maintain the integrity of the flesh. Dice in large chunks and transfer to mixing bowl. Mash to desired consistency. Add lime, stire to combine. Add other ingredients, stir to combine.

==Recipe VII==
Similar to the first and second recipes, this variant acts very well on its own as a side dish or appetizer, also very good in [[Cookbook:Fajita|fajitas]]. This recipe can easily be multiplied beyond the two avocado serving.

===Ingredients===
*2 ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]
*2-3 tablespoons chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] 
*1/4 cup (app.) of [[Cookbook:Tomato|cherry, grape, or pear tomatoes]] halved or quartered, with 1/8 cup (app.) seeded
*juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], thoroughly juiced
*4 tablespoons (app.) chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
*1/2 red onion, diced
*2 jalapeño peppers, 1 seeded and 1 not, diced finely
*Kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil to taste

===Procedure===
Pit avocado by, carefully, lodging base end of chef's knife in pit, twisting to remove, and then pinching the pit off of the knife. Remove flesh with large spoon, being careful to maintain the integrity of the flesh. Dice in large chunks and transfer to mixing bowl. Mash to desired consistency. Add lime, stir to combine. Add other ingredients, stir to combine.

===Recommended Uses===
Works well on [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]], in [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]] and other Mexican food, or even as a topping for [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]].  It also can add flavor and moisture to overly dry food. However, perhaps the best use is as a dip for tortilla chips.

===Variant===
Avocado salad can be made by not mashing the avocado chunks.  Optionally, add a grated [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]].  This makes a good side dish or small meal.

----
'''Note''':  True guacamole is only mashed avocado with cilantro, and onion, optionally (yet desirable) hot peppers can be mashed along with the avocado. Oil is never used, olives aren't Mexican, so olive oil should be avoided. It should also be noted that guacamole is a dip sauce originally made so it will be consumed almost instantly, meaning there is no intention to store it at all, so you can omit the use of any kind of oils for these recipes, or even lime juice. Both oil and lime juice are added so guacamole lasts a bit longer than normal.
----

'''Tip''': An old [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] trick to avoid or reduce the brown oxidized layer on the top is to put the whole avocado pit back into the guacamole once it's prepared. ''Never'' cut the pit in pieces; that will make the guacamole bitter. This trick doesn't really work though. The only way to prevent the oxidation is to eliminate the exposure to air. Covering the surface with plastic wrap so no air is in contact with the sauce works well. Be sure to include some lime in your recipe, this will prevent such oxidation. 

----
'''Tip 2''': 

One of the most vexing problems with guacamole is that it spoils so rapidly. Traditional strategies, such as the use of a well-placed avocado pit or the use of prodigious amounts the lime and/or lemon juice, are used to prevent premature browning of guacamole. A young chef from El Paso, Texas, has developed a much more effective approach to keep guacamole fresh for up to three times longer than traditional methods. Through trial and error, Alfred M. Gladstein found that the use of a various vegetable oils blended in to the concoction would keep it fresh longer and significantly increase the amount of time before the guacamole browns and spoils. In his studies Gladstein found that mixing olive oil in guacamole worked best when serving the dish independently or with warm foods, while vegetable oil (corn or canola) worked best when the guacamole is served with cold foods and salads. When these techniques are employed, Gladstein, who is also known as Chef Jamir, found that the refrigerated guacamole would stay fresh and green for three days or more. He also notes that when serving the guacamole at room temperature, the oil-treated dish will last up to six to eight hours before starting to brown.

'''Preserved Lemons''' are a common flavoring agent in Moroccan cuisine, particularly in very slow braises known as tagines.  They are also found as an unusual cocktail garnish.

== Ingredients ==
*[[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemons]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]

== Procedure ==
Poke holes in the lemons with a sharp knife.  Pack them in an airtight jar, separating them from one another with salt.  Cover the jar, store in a dark place for a day.  If the lemons have not released enough liquid to cover, add salt and reseal.

Store in a cool dark place for approximately two weeks.  Refrigerate afterwards.

Mexican cuisine is primarily a fusion of indigenous Mesoamerican cooking with European, especially Spanish, elements added after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the 16th century. The basic staples remain native foods such as corn, beans and chili peppers, but the Europeans introduced a large number of other foods, the most important of which were meat from domesticated animals.

Similar to a sandwich, the amount of ingredients for a quesadilla depends on how many you are serving and how big you want to make a particular quesadilla.  Here are ingredients for one serving using the typical size of tortillas most commonly available in stores in the southwestern U.S. (and in many other areas and countries).  Other locally available thin flat breads may work instead of work of tortillas, but, please know, the tortillas are intended to be similar to a 'wrap' to allow the eating of the filling.

==Ingredients==
*2 flour [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortilla]], 6&quot; (15cm), corn tortillas can be used in a pinch at home, but may not hold together or work as well as flour.
*1/3 cup meltable [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]]
*1/4 cup Filling (see below)
*[[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|Cooking Spray]]

==Procedure==
#Warm both tortillas in the microwave to the point of flexibility, at least, keeping one warm.
#Preheat a frying pan or griddle (medium-low heat), seasoned with oil or cooking spray. Drop in the first tortilla.
#Drop on it shredded cheese (typically [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]).
#Quickly add, and spread out, almost to the edges, any combination of the fillings listed below (or whatever additional ingredients you would like), ideally warmed and very well drained.
# Allow the cheese to melt. The tortilla may brown in spots but it should not be cooked to the point of changing color substantially.
#Press the other tortilla over the top of the tortilla in the pan, making sure it sticks a bit.
#Flip the quesadilla and allow to warm until it joins as a unit.  
#Remove from pan, cut in 1/8ths.
#Eat immediately, or, if you need to serve a bigger group, remove to a fairly low temperature 'keep warm' area, below the melting temperature of the 
cheese.

Quesadillas are not usually not very good re-heated.

==Filings==
*[[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]]
* [[Cookbook:Sarza Criolla|sarza criolla]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]s
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* Cooked [[Cookbook:Meat and Poultry|meat or seafood]]
* Fresh spinach--washed and torn into small pieces
* Black beans--canned, rinsed and well drained
* A fairly traditional filling would be grilled chicken, beef or pork, finely minced, sprinkled with a teaspoon of finely minced onion and half of teaspoon of cilantro, with a small amount of some lime squeezed on top.

Usage Note: Some regions of Mexico the quesadilla is a simple corn tortilla with cheese,non-fried.

Moroccan cuisine has long been considered as one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. The reason is because of the interaction of Morocco with the outside world for centuries. The cuisine of Morocco is a mix of Arab, Berber, Moorish, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean African, Iberian, and Jewish influences. The cooks in the royal kitchens of Fez, Meknes, Marrakech, Rabat and Tetouan refined Moroccan cuisine over the centuries and created the basis for what is known as Moroccan cuisine today.

Morocco produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones. The country produces large quantities of sheep, cattle, poultry, and seafood which serve as a base for the cuisine.

{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
* 300 g (10 oz) large [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] spirals (dry)
* 2 Tablespoons of extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], more if you like it
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, crushed and finely chopped, more if you like it
* 4 large ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], well chopped, seeds and skin included. Remove the seeds and skin if you like, but it isn't mandatory.
* handful of well ripped [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
* 4 Tablespoons of freshly, finely grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]]-style [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] ([[Cookbook:Parmigiano Reggiano|Parmigiano Reggiano]] recommended!)

== Procedure ==
# Cook dry pasta in plenty of salted boiling water for 10-12 minutes. By the way, the proper cooking time should be indicated on the pasta box itself. If it's not, you better taste one pasta piece from time to time, and stop the cooking when it's still crispy but not tough though (it should be ''[[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]''). Prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking:
# '''Sauce:''' Heat the olive oil gently in a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] or [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]]. When moderately hot add the garlic and gently [[Cookbook:Pan fry|fry]] until lightly coloured only. Avoid overcooking. Add the tomatoes and cook for several minutes, stirring and folding the ingredients. If there is a lot of liquid from the tomatoes, turn up the heat a little and reduce it a bit. Stir in the basil and turn the heat down.
# By this time the pasta should be cooked. Turn off the heat to the pasta and use a slotted spoon to transfer the pasta to the sauce in the other pan. Don't worry if a little of the cooking water is transferred - this is a good thing as long as you don't swamp the sauce with it(you could also use a colander to drain the pasta alternatively). Season to taste, stir and pour into a large pasta bowl for serving. Scatter the cheese over the whole dish, reserving some for the table.

If someone wants to go through the transwiki log and work on those articles and bring them to Wikibooks standards, feel free.  It'll add more content to the cookbook faster, as right now I'm going to concentrate on moving the pages out of wikipedia.  Thanks, [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:49, 23 Jan 2004 (UTC)

OK, we need to come to a naming convention for recipes.  I've been using Cookbook:&lt;Recipe Name&gt;, others are using Cookbook:Recipes/&lt;Recipe Name&gt; or Cookbook:Recipes/&lt;Recipe name&gt;.  It'll be easier to pick a standard now and just name things as we move them from wikipedia than it will be to decide later.  Anyone else want to weigh in? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:11, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:OK, I'm going to give this a week and if no one replies, I'll assume I'm the only one here and just pick my standard and start moving recipes to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Recipe Name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Time starts .... NOW [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:44, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Personally I like your system. It's simpler. Also I can see a situation where we need subpages for recipes [[cookbook:recipe Name /european verion]] that soer of thing. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:03, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Yes, I started the Cookbook:recipies/* standard just to be descriptive and it the Cookbook:* standard does seem like a better idea. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

==Questionable Ingredients==

==== kinds of sugar ====

Query: Does anyone know what &quot;Castor sugar&quot; is? Is it a brand name or a type of sugar? As long as I'm at it I may as well make a list on this page of questionable ingrediants. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]
: I guess it's a British thing?  Castor sugar is a very fine sugar.  You can make it by putting regular granulated sugar in a blender for a few seconds to make the grains finer. [[User:Solitaire|Solitaire]]
:: That is somewhat correct. Probaly you'll wear out your blender if you abuse it for this purpose! Castor sugar is called superfine sugar in the USA. Unfortunately, castor sugar is the ''default'' sugar in the UK. Many recipes specify it needlessly. As each such recipe is examined, &quot;castor sugar&quot; should be replaced with either &quot;superfine suger&quot; (to indicate a true need for superfine sugar) or just &quot;sugar&quot; (to indicate that any old normal sugar will do). [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:38, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::: Castor sugar is not the default sugar in the U.K. but it is used more frequently than in the United States because it is much more commonplace there. It is called &quot;castor sugar&quot; because it is fine enough to be used in a &quot;caster&quot; which is a &quot;shaker&quot;. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 03:02, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

*'golden syrup' - '''Cane Syrup''' 

:I'm sorry - I have to jump up and down and scream loudly at this comparison. Golden syrup is NOT corn syrup or anything remotely like it. It's a product used mainly in Australia (I don't know if it's available anywhere else...) It is a bit like molasses or treacle only lighter in flavour and consistency. Corn syrup is NOT a suitable substitute for it.[[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 06:46, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::''we have stuff here in the US called ''Cane Syrup'', made from sugar cane, kinda like a light molasses.  Would that be a better compairason to golden syrup? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]''

:::Oh lord this is going to be a nightmare. I asked an american once what corn syrup was and was told it was golden syrup, I didn't check to see it was correct. On wikipedia there is an article on flapjacks, which redirects to pancakes. In the UK flapjacks are oatcakes made with rolled oats, butter amd golden syrup :-( why can't we all speak the same laguage :-( Anyway, I digress. In the UK golden syrup is made by Tate and Lyle. Since this company also label their granulated sugar as cane sugar I assume cane syrup is correct. Sorry about not checking my facts properly. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 11:18, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::: &quot;Tate and Lyle's Golden Syrup&quot; has a pronounced flavour unlike anything generally available in the United States but maple syrup or imitation maple syrup would work well as a substitute. However, it tends to be thinner than golden syrup so one would have to reduce it by boiling to get a similar viscosity. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 03:02, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

*'Castor sugar' - '''Like granulated sugar only smaller crystals so it dissolves better''' - ''so it's like the US baking sugar or bar sugar? gent''
:Castor Sugar is a very finely ground sugar. You can use plain ordinary sugar in a recipe without a problem except the texture will be coarser.[[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 06:46, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::I'm in the US, and sometimes I use &quot;powdered sugar&quot; -- like granulated sugar, but ground into a fine powder. http://sugarindia.com/ has some descriptions of various kinds of sugars. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 18:05, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)
Tate &amp; Lyle's Golden Syrup is, I quote from the tin, &quot;partially inverted refiners syrup&quot;, (that is, some of the sucrose is laevo-rotated, for the chemists out there) &amp; is commonly called treacle in the UK.
Black treacle is the dark stuff like mollasses.
Granulated sugar is your bog-standard sugar, castor sugar is finer, (for using in a caster?) &amp; icing sugar is (very fine, floury), I think, powderd sugar in US. We use it to make icing, (frosting) by mixing with water (&amp; eggwhite for Royal Icing). Hope this is useful, &amp; please correct me where im wrong--[[User:Archolman|Archolman]] 02:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

==== other ingredients ====

*&quot;375g of packet fresh ready rolled Puff pastry&quot; (see [[Cookbook:Mille_Cr%C3%AApe]]) - Any ideas on a universal equivilant? '''why not just link to a recipe for [[puff pastry]]?''' - ''whenever I use puff pastry, I go to the store and buy a box.  Actually, I normally have a box or two in the freezer.  Making puff pastry is hard, time consuming, work, and I'd rather pay Pillsbury to do it. gent''
:Frozen puff pastry is available just about everywhere... I don't see that direction as unreasonable wherever you are. But for perfectionists, link it to 'puff pastry' too so they can see how difficult it is to make from scratch! lol [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 06:46, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

* &quot;2 small cans dry Mustard&quot; (see [[Cookbook:Senf]]) ''well, what's a small can?  1 oz, 4 oz?'' ( I've seen some cookbooks list *both* Imperial *and* SI units on each and every recipe. Should we encourage this ? Something like  &quot;50 g (1.7 oz.) dry ground Mustard&quot;. At least in one cookbook, the primary units were the ones used by the cook who submitted it. Usually ounces for U.S. chefs, grams for French chefs. The secondary units (in parenthesis) were converted. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 18:05, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC) )  

:I'd say we should definitely encourage the use of both imperical and SI units. I've even gone through a few recipies that only have one set of units listed and done the conversions myself when I have too much free time. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]
:: Be very careful! Tablespoons can be 15 mL (Queen Anne), 18 mL (Imperial), or 20 mL (Australian). If you are unsure, let someone else do the conversion. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:38, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Looks like some redirects are in order, once we've got the basic foodstuff articles written.  For the life of me I couldn't figure out what golden syrup or Castor sugar were, thanks Theresa. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:46, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I did suggest that we need a 'glossary' page giving comparisons and equivelants like this. It's easy to get confused, because cooking is universal but ingredients are NOT... [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 06:46, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I started a list of [[Cookbook:International food terms|International food terms]].  I listed US/UK terms, as that is what I'm familiar with.  I'm not sure if the UK terms are pretty much always the same as the Australian terms, and I could lump them together, or if there should be a separate column for Australian terms.

:I added it to the Ingredients section on the [[Cookbook]], along with the [[Cookbook:Substitutions|Substitutions]] list I started, although perhaps there's a better place for them. -- [[User:Loum|loum]] 04:19, 24 May 2004 (UTC)

The UK standard spoons are; Tspoon=5ml, Tablespoon=15ml. i think cup sizes are a bit different to US &amp; Aus.  as well:)--[[User:Archolman|Dick]] 23:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

==Featured recipes==
So far, I've just picked a recipe from this list about once a week to be our featured recipe on the [[cookbook]] page.  Anyone else want to get in on choosing the recipe? (and ingredient, but that discussion should go somewhere else) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:46, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Recipe cleanup?==
A few of the recipes need some work.  For example, look at [[Cookbook:Goulash|Goulash]], [[Cookbook:Jamaican Jerk Chicken|Jamaican Jerk Chicken]], and [[Cookbook:How to cook oysters|How to cook oysters]].  Should we have a central page for these types of cleanup items for the entire wikibooks project, one just for the cookbook, or just use, for example, this talk page to hold this list. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:57, 4 May 2004 (UTC)
:I would say create a link on the cookbook main page that refers to the &quot;Needs Work&quot; recipes. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 16:48, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== links to GFDL and public domain recipes ==

Should I copy-and-paste these recipes to wiki, even though I've never cooked them before ?

* http://www.faqs.org/docs/consumer/recipes/ (public domain)
* ''The Open Source Cookbook: Fuel For Geeks'' by Matthew Balmer (GFDL) http://www.faqs.org/docs/cookbook/

== Conversation from #wikibooks IRC Channel ==

I have bought this conversation and idea here, from #wikibooks, and also from [[Talk:Cookbook|Cookbook Talk]], in the hope that I may be able to help.  I am on multiple restricted diets, being intolerant of Gluten and Lactose, so I am on a Wheat/Gluten Free and Milk Free diet.  One of WB's admins, Uncle G, has informed me that your recipes are marked for which diets they are suitable.  However, I have noticed looking through the index of recipes that there is no immediate identification of suitability for particular diets there.  I also feel that for meals which cross diets, ie, one which is both Gluten Free and Milk Free, having to match recipes from one category and see that they are in another is time consuming. 

What I have proposed is that we look at a simple identification tag to attach to recipes '''in''' the index, to show immediately to the searcher that the meal is gonna be suitable for them to cook.  

Something along these lines:

'''GF''' indicates Gluten Free recipe

'''MF''' = Milk Free

'''LF''' = Lactose Free

'''RS''' = Reduced Sodium (Salt)

which could be combined to show the suitability immediately, like:

Liver &amp; Bacon Casserole (GF : MF)

or for meals which are suitable for diabetics, DS.

Your thoughts on this are welcome, and I have tagged some pages already pointing people here to discuss this proposal.  I can be contacted here, or thru my Wikipedia talk page, [[Wikipedia:User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Talk to Thor]]. Regards, [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 01:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== is this still maintained? ==

wouldn't the category system be a better option? Especially for indicating whether recipes have images or not... [[User:203.214.115.130|203.214.115.130]] 14:32, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

: Yes the category system is better. [[:Category:Recipes]] will probably be better even at this stage of categorization. It will also be more maintainable over the long run. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:24, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

== Sindhi cuisine ==

There were some recipes on the Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_food Sindhi food]. The article's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sindhi_food AfD] determined that the recipes should be transwikied here. I've put them on a subpage [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fang_Aili/sindi_food_temp here], and anyone interested can copy them from there and place them appropriately at Wikibooks Cookbook. I'd appreciate help from someone who knows what they're doing here. Thanks!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Canada's Obligation==

By the 1860s, Great Britain became really concerned that Canada was more of a shining star than an asset to the Empire.  British politicians did not like the expense of providing for the defence of the North American colonies from real or perceived threats from the Americans.  The American Civil War only heightened fears in Canada of a potential invasion.

Americans, on the other hand, always seemed to have a group of people willing to go to war with Britain and invade British North America, often in high places (for example, Lincoln's Secretary of State, Seward).  Britain's trade with the United States at this time had simply become too valuable to jeopardize by maintaining a colonial system in British North America, so prominent British politicians began the process of pushing Canada &quot;out of the nest,&quot; so to speak.

However, the process was not simple.  British North America consisted of no less than seven colonies, and the vast territory of Rupert's Land owned and run by Hudson's Bay Company.  Uniting this area would prove to be difficult.

--- The following passage is inaccurate --
Confederation was achieved for many reasons.  Canada West and Canada East felt that uniting the colonies would help make all of the colonies stronger, more economically stable, and would make the government system more fair.
The maritimes, who were having a boom period, were disinclined to join confederation. They wanted to join together the maritime colonies and have a separate country for only them, however, the Americans had just finished the Civil War, and had about as many soldiers as all the colonies that were thinking about confederation did combined, and posed a real threat to the colonies. The maritimes thought about it, and with the help of a conference with John A. Macdonald decided to join confederation. The only maritime colonies that didn't join were Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, which would join later on. 
At the Quebec conference, representatives from all the participating colonies came together and constructed the 72 Resolutions which outlined all of the laws that the new country Canada would have.

==Dream stabilization==
Once you are able to dream lucidly, you may find that it is difficult to stay in the dream; for example, you may wake instantly or the dream may start “fading” which is characterized by loss or degradation of any of the senses, especially vision. Alternatively, a new lucid dreamer could easily forget that they are in a dream, as a result of the shock of the sensation.

Don't worry if you wake immediately after becoming lucid. As you gain more experience of becoming lucid, it will come as less of a shock and you’ll be less likely to wake up. Make sure you do a reality check to be sure you’re not still dreaming. As you gain more experience, you will have an easier time identifying when and remembering that you are dreaming.

You can avoid more gradual fadings by '''stimulating your senses'''. This means listening for sounds, feeling around with your hands, and paying attention to what you see and smell. The idea here is to load your senses with stimulation from the dream so that your senses cannot shift to the real world. If you close your eyes, you are removing a great deal of sensory information and might wake up. Staring at a single point can cause effectively the same problem if you stop seeing everything else in your peripheral vision, or don't see enough movement. If you hear something loud in real life and are hearing nothing in the dream, your senses may shift to the real world, causing you to wake up.

Ideally you should be able to use the techniques below to stabilize your dream ''before'' it starts to fade (or “black out”). As always, prevention is better than treatment - and the more stable and vivid your dreams are, the more enjoyable they will be.  However, if that doesn't work you may be able to use stabilization techniques to stop the fading; the spinning technique is probably the most effective in this case.

If you still can’t stabilize your dream, you may decide to try and wake up with the aim of remembering your dream as accurately as possible while its still fresh in your mind.

===Hand Touching===
Rub your hands together and concentrate on the rubbing. You should feel the friction and the heat of your hands. If you can concentrate on the feelings that this action generates, your dream is likely to stabilize and become more vivid and detailed. You can also keep one hand on your arm while exploring the dream for a constant sense of stimulation.  This technique is most effective when used in conjunction with the “Slowing it down” technique, by staring at your hands while rubbing them together.

===Spinning===
You spin around in your dream much as you would if you suddenly want to feel dizzy in real life. The sensation of movement is the key here to stabilizing the dream. Many people report success with this technique, but it also tends to cause a complete change of your dream scene (see [[#Changing the dream environment|Changing the dream environment]] below). If the dream scene disappears  completely (e.g., becomes black), it is necessary to visualize the dreamscape to return to the dream.

===Slowing it down===
Some people like to stabilize the dream by “stopping to smell the roses” and slowly staring at a dream object until it becomes clear. The dreamer would then look around elsewhere, noticing how detailed everything is, thereby stimulating the visual portion of the dream. ''However, others find this can cause their lucid dream to end.'' If you focus on one object for too long to the exclusion of everything else, you will likely wake up or lose the dream. It works best to pay attention to everything in your vision, including your peripheral vision, not just the center of the object you're staring at. If staring at a single object doesn't work for you, try to let your eyes wander around instead.

===Touching your dream===
If you feel that your dream is too abstract and fear that it might be fading, you can prevent this by grabbing hold of a solid object in your dream and focus on how real the sensation is. A good tip is to find something you know is stuck, for instance a table nailed to the ground, and pull it with all your muscular power (no ''supernatural'' powers!), and you should feel how solid it is. The idea is that you convince yourself that the dream is solid and real — through tactile stimulation — and nothing abstract.

===Regaining waking memory or skills===
This is also likely to enhance your degree of lucidity. Try to remember facts from your waking life, such as your phone number, address, etc., or do some simple math. Or, start reciting the lyrics to your favorite song. Or perhaps try some sports practice you know well — this all depends on which senses / methods of thought process you tend to rely on most in your waking life.

===False awakening===
A couple of the users on the ld4all.com forums have had success with creating a false awakening to stabilize a dream. If the above techniques are failing and you find your dream still fading, ''and you really want to continue your lucid dream'', do the following:

# Expect to have a false awakening.
# When you think you wake up, perform a reality check.

You will either have a false awakening, reality check, and then end up with an even more vivid lucid dream, or will really wake up, perform a reality check, and realize that you just woke up (bad luck!).

The most important part of this is the reality check. This is what will continue your lucid dream. You should be performing reality checks when you wake up. If you plan to induce false awakenings in order to stabilize a dream, the reality check that you perform as you wake up is as important as the one that got you lucid, if not more.

Perform every check in the book until you are '''positively, absolutely, and completely sure''' that you aren’t dreaming. A series of 10 reality checks is more likely to produce dream results in a dream, especially if you are expecting dream results. This technique is for those who are desperate!

''If you have had a good experience with this technique, please go to the talk page and post your experiences, as there have not been many anecdotes of it working yet.''

If you didn’t do any of these, your best option is probably to try to wake up. That way, you will remember more of the dream.

The general rule of dream-stabilization is to '''stimulate the senses'''. If you listen for sounds, feel around with your hands, and pay attention to what you see and smell, you will stimulate your senses. The idea here is to load your senses with stimulation from the dream so that your senses cannot shift to the real world. If you close your eyes, you are removing a great deal of sensory information and might wake up. Staring at a single point can cause effectively the same problem if you stop seeing everything else in your peripheral vision, or don't see enough movement. If you hear something loud in real life and are hearing nothing in the dream, your senses may shift to the real world, causing you to wake up.

==Recovering from lost visuals==
There are a few things you can try to do if you lose your vision. Most of these are less likely to help prolong your dream than the above techniques.

You can also try these if you have just woken up and are lying in your bed. You may be able to return to your dream.

===Autosuggestion===
You can repeat over and over a phrase similar to “I can see my dream,” or otherwise enforce in your mind that you can see a dreamscape. (See [[w:Autosuggestion|Autosuggestion]])

===Visualising===
You can visualise the scene as it would be if you could see it. You could take this as an opportunity to change the dreamscape by visualising a different environment from the previous one in the dream. This can be made easier by spinning as you visualize. (See [[#Changing the dream environment|Changing the dream environment]] below)

==Altering the dream==
===Changing the dream environment===
You can change the dreamscape by simply visualizing a different environment. Stephen LaBerge, author of ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming'', suggests closing your eyes, spinning around, and visualizing a new location. Alan Worsley, a famous lucid dreamer, describes another technique of summoning a television and remote to switched dreamscapes. By simply “changing the channel” on the remote, imagine your surroundings switching to your desired location, as though you were switching through various television programs. 

In both of these methods, details are key. The more details you provide for your next dreamscape, the easier it will be to get there. For example, if you wanted go to the Superbowl in your dreams, you might simply state:

:'''“I want to be at the Superbowl.”'''

But this statement could be improved by adding details:

:'''&quot;I want be in the endzone seats, drinking a Coke, and wearing my favorite player's jersey at the Super Bowl.&quot;'''

===Summoning objects into your dream===
At some point in your lucid dreaming experience, you'll probably want to handle various objects, or talk with certain people. Both of these needs can be fulfilled by using your mind, and the power of suggestion. There is no set way to &quot;make&quot; things in the dream world; in fact, many lucid dreamers devise their own methods through experimentation. However, here are some of the more common &quot;summoning&quot; techniques:

* Try reaching for objects that are not within your field of vision. For example, think to yourself: “When I reach into my pocket, there will be a green box of mints.” Then, attempt to actually take a green box of mints out of your pocket. Other variations of this include reaching behind you for an object, or reaching through a mirror in hopes of getting a hold of what you want.
* To summon a person, you might say to yourself: “When I turn around, [person's name] will be standing in front of me,” or “When I walk through this mirror, I will see [person's name],” or “In a few moments, [person's name] will walk through that door (or around that corner).”
* More experienced lucid dreamers can try making the object materialize right before their eyes. This will require a fair amount of concentration. Here is an example of this process:&lt;br /&gt;

: “I am lucid dreaming in my backyard, and it's currently night. Now, I don't like the dark in my lucid dreams because I'm more likely to wake up, and I fear there are monsters lurking around every corner. So, I want to '''make the sun appear''' so that it'll be daytime. Focusing on the horizon, I visualize the sun rising above it.&lt;br /&gt;
:At first nothing happens, but I continue focusing and...yes! There's some light filtering over the horizon! And now the sun is rising to the sky and it settles there; so far, so good. But wait...the sky is still black. Peering at bit closer at the sun, I can just make out a faint ring of blue sky encircling it. Lifting my hand towards it I shout, &quot;Blue!&quot;. The blue ring quickly spreads across the sky, creating the full daytime effect.”&lt;br /&gt;

* Some dreamers may have success by closing their eyes and imagining the desired object in front of them once when they open their eyes . 
* Try using mechanical devices within the dream, such as a nearby lightswitch or button, to summon objects or people. (i.e. &quot;When I flip this switch/press this button, X will appear.&quot;)

Remember, in the dream world, your expectations shape your surroundings. If you think a big, scary monster is going to step out of the shadows and attack you...well, a big, scary monster probably ''is'' going to step out of the shadows and attack you. So, don't be a victim; take control of your thoughts and use them to your advantage.
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right; font-size: small&quot;&gt;[[#top|top]]&lt;/div&gt;

==What you can do==
This final section should see you off with a few ideas of what to do in a dream.

It is advised to have a ''clear purpose'' for your lucid dreams whenever you go to sleep. In other words, every night you consider what you want to do when you have a lucid dream, and select one thing, or perhaps two or three if you are skilled. Avoid this:

: &quot;What am I gonna do what am I gonna do? I wanna fly, walk through walls, eat until my stomach explodes, spy on my neighbours, drive in a car real fast, woooeeey I'm gonna . . .&quot; &lt;!--- thanks to BuLLeT-PrOOf at the ld4all.com forums, this is a perfect example of what not to do! ---&gt;

You will either end up doing none of these things in your dream or getting overexcited and waking up.

Now that that’s clear, here’s a list of possible things you could do, ordered in difficulty. Remember that you might find some things unusually hard (or easy) compared to most lucid dreamers, this is perfectly normal! This is a very rough guide — if you’ve managed something in the Easy section, don't be scared to try for something from the Medium section.
===Easy===
* Fly
*: Most people enjoy flying around in dreams. There are different styles of flight that people use, each with a varied level of success for each individual. Methods such as “swimming through the air”, “Superman style” (one arm outstretched), “Neo style” (both arms at your side), and “Airplane style” (both arms out) ,&quot;eagle style&quot; (gliding through the air currents, using your fingered wings to navigate altitudes) are often used. There are a few methods of getting up into the air, such as simply jumping (you can jump really high in dreams if you believe it) or imagining a great force pushing you from your feet or walking up on air as though it is a staircase. Some people summon jetpacks and slip them on to fly. Be creative and dream up your own methods.
* Explore your dream world
*: Be warned, you are quite likely to forget you are dreaming when exploring! Doing reality checks often and muttering to yourself about how real everything seems can help to avoid this. You can also ask a dream character to tag along with you and remind you when you forget that you’re dreaming.
* Walk through a mirror or wall
*: You can pass through dream objects such as walls, glass, trees, and everything else. Confidence is really the key here. Some variations on going through stuff can be going in slowly, wiggling your finger in first, or running quickly into the object and telling yourself you would go through it. Some people particularly like to go through mirrors because of the unpredictable effects this action produces. However, if you tell yourself you will end up at a certain location before passing through a mirror, you can change the dream scene quickly. Be warned, some people experience nothing and wake up after passing through. You may want to hold your arm to keep yourself in the dream.
* Look at the sky
*: People often report amazing skies in lucid dreams. You can also shout colors at it and paint some sunrises.
* Show off to your friends (“Hey guys; I can go through this wall!”)
* Do plenty of sports (trampolining, skiing, swimming, dancing, etc.)
* Use various power such as Telekinesis and magic (a shortcut if you are having problems would be to summon a magic wand/staff or other device)
* Try to read a book that you have never read and remember the content
* Try to browse the Internet and visit sites that you've never visited
* Use things that you have never used
* Last but not least: Edit Wikipedia/Wikibooks articles (see question 90 of the [[w:Wikipedia:Are You a Wikipediholic Test|Wikipediholic Test]]) and see if the changes remain when you awake!

===Medium===
* Eat until you’re near bursting!
* Teleport
* Create some dream characters (possibly from a book or film)
* Try to find your spirit guide
* Experiments (in fact, researchers will often want people of various skills)
* Body swapping/possession (where you enter a different body)
* Morph
* Take some drugs (this is more realistic if you’ve done so in real life)
*: Many people have also experienced realistic effects when trying drugs in dreams that they have never taken in real life.
* Drive a vehicle (This is especially fun if you haven't ever driven in real life)
* Fight
*: Nobody can tell you what you should and should not do in your dreams; the choice remains up to you.
** Use weapons
**: It is usually more interesting to use melee weapons (knives, swords, brass knuckles) than projectile weapons. Machine guns and pistols often run out of ammo and summoning it can be difficult. Misfires and jamming is also common. ''(Your subconscious expectations will shape your dreamscape in all manner of ways, If you believe it is hard to accomplish, if you believe it will jam or misfire, it will. I have had no issues with weaponry such as firearms in my dreams what-so-ever, take this &quot;advice&quot; lightly.)'' However this can be overcome by using Directed Energy Weapons (Lasers, Plasma/pulse rifles), or weapons that can't jam (bows, simple firearms like muskets and so on).

** &quot;Beat up&quot; your enemies

===Hard===
* Have sex
*: The excitement, or closing your eyes, can cause you to wake up. An additional reason for waking up may be fixing your eyes on your partner, as holding a gaze for long is also known to cause waking up. Also your dream partner has a strange way of transforming in the midst of ecstasy. Finding a sex partner isn't very hard, it's keeping them that is difficult. That is why it is best to not panic when they are transforming and accept them for what your subconscious brings you. 
* More morphing like 360 degree vision, [[w:sonar|sonar vision]], etc.
* Create false memories, etc. False memories can be made by having a lucid dream, but scripting it so you will think it is real, e.g. you think what happened in your dream happened in real life. This is hard because you will have to forget it is a dream while staying lucid (knowing it is a dream).
* Compose music or poems (or request them from your subconscious)
* Build a fantasy dream world! (some people build a dream world naturally)

** H.P. Lovecraft's [[w:Dreamlands|Dreamlands]]
* Have precognition (your subconscious can be very good at predicting the future with relationships and career)
* Experience death. This could be a very harsh experience, and depending on your religious or philosophical beliefs may summon you into a different world or nothingness.
* Ask the dream to show you your worst fears/deepest traumas/etc. (be prepared for some bad stuff to surface)
* Build/use impossible objects, such as [[w:Hypercube|hypercubes]], [[w:Klein bottle|Klein bottles]], etc.
* Rewind time

      <text xml:space="preserve">It seems likely that in the distant past Vietnamese shared more characteristics common to other languages in the Austroasiatic family, such as an inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and a richer set of [[consonant clusters]], which have subsequently disappeared from the language. However, Vietnamese appears to have been heavily influenced by its location in the [[East Asian language|Southeast Asian sprachbund]]&amp;mdash;with the result that it has acquired or converged toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and [[tonogenesis]]. These characteristics, which may or may not have been part of [[Proto-Austroasiatic Language|proto-Austroasiatic]], nonetheless have become part of many of the philologically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia&amp;mdash;for example, [[Thai language|Thai]] (one of the [[Tai-Kadai languages]]), [[Tsat language|Tsat]] (a member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group within Austronesian), and Vietnamese each developed [[tonal language|tones]] as a phonemic feature, although their respective ancestral languages were not originally tonal. 

The Vietnamese language has similarities with [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] in regard to the specific intonations and unreleased plosive consonant endings, a legacy of archaic Chinese that can also be found in [[Korean language|Korean]].

The ancestor of the Vietnamese language was originally based in the area of the Red River in what is now northern Vietnam, and during the subsequent expansion of the Vietnamese language and people into what is now central and southern Vietnam (through conquest of the ancient nation of [[Champa]] and the [[Khmer people]] of the [[Mekong river|Mekong]] delta in the vicinity of present-day [[Ho Chi Minh City]]), Vietnamese was linguistically influenced primarily by Indic and Malayo-Polynesian languages at first, until Chinese came to predominate politically toward the middle of the first millennium AD.

With the rise of Chinese political dominance came radical importation of Chinese vocabulary and grammatical influence. As [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was, for a prolonged period, the only medium of literature and government, as well as the primary language of the ruling class in Vietnam, much of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms consists of '''''Hán Việt''''' (Sino-Vietnamese) words. In fact, as the vernacular language of Vietnam gradually grew in prestige toward the beginning of the second millennium, the Vietnamese language was written using [[Chinese character]]s (see [[Chữ nôm]]) adapted to write Vietnamese, in a similar pattern as used in Japan (see [[kanji]]), Korea and other countries in the Chinese cultural sphere. The '''''Nôm''''' writing reached its zenith in the 18th century when many Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in '''''Chữ Nôm''''', most notably [[Nguyễn Du]] and [[Hồ Xuân Hương]] (dubbed &quot;the Queen of Nôm poetry&quot;).

As contact with the West grew, the [[Vietnamese alphabet|'''''Quốc Ngữ''''']] system of Romanized writing was developed in the 17th century by Portuguese and other Europeans involved in proselytizing and trade in Vietnam. When France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, [[French language|French]] gradually replaced Chinese as the official language in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as '''''đầm''''' (dame, from ''madame''), '''''ga''''' (train station, from ''gare''), and '''''va-li''''' (valise). In addition, many Sino-Vietnamese terms were devised for Western ideas imported through the French. However, the Romanized script did not come to predominate until the beginning of the 20th century, when education became widespread and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cryptography''' is the study of information hiding and verification. It includes the protocols, algorithms and strategies to securely and consistently prevent or delay unauthorized access to sensitive information and enable verifiability of every component in a communication.

Cryptography is derived from the Greek words: kryptós, &quot;hidden&quot;, and gráphein, &quot;to write&quot; - or &quot;hidden writing&quot;. People who study and develop cryptography are called '''cryptographers'''. The study of how to ''circumvent'' the use of cryptography for unintended recipients is called '''cryptanalysis''', or codebreaking. Cryptography and cryptanalysis are sometimes grouped together under the '''umbrella''' term cryptology, encompassing the entire subject. In practice, &quot;cryptography&quot; is also often used to refer to the field as a whole, especially as an applied science.

Cryptography is an interdisciplinary subject, drawing from several fields. Before the time of computers, it was closely related to linguistics. Nowadays the emphasis has shifted, and cryptography makes extensive use of technical areas of mathematics, especially those areas collectively known as discrete mathematics. This includes topics from number theory, information theory, computational complexity, statistics and combinatorics. It is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one as it must deal with active, intelligent and malevolent opposition.

An example of the sub-fields of cryptography is '''steganography''' — the study of hiding the very ''existence'' of a message, and not necessarily the ''contents'' of the message itself (for example, microdots, or invisible ink) — and '''traffic analysis''', which is the analysis of patterns of communication in order to learn secret information.

When information is transformed from a ''useful form'' of understanding to an ''opaque form'' of understanding, this is called '''encryption'''. When the information is reverted back into a useful form, it is called '''decryption'''. Intended recipients or authorized use of the information is determined by whether the user has a certain piece of secret knowledge. ''Only'' users with the secret knowledge can transform the opaque information back into its useful form. The secret knowledge is commonly called the '''key''', though the secret knowledge may include the ''entire process'' or algorithm that is used in the encryption/decryption. The information in its useful form is called '''plaintext''' (or cleartext); in its encrypted form it is called '''ciphertext'''. The algorithm used for encryption and decryption is called a '''cipher''' (or cypher).

== Common goals in cryptography ==
In essence, cryptography concerns four main goals. They are:

# message '''confidentiality''' (or privacy): Only an authorized recipient should be able to extract the contents of the message from its encrypted form. Resulting from steps to hide, stop or delay free access to the encrypted information.
# message '''integrity''': The recipient should be able to determine if the message has been altered.
# sender '''authentication''': The recipient should be able to verify from the message, the identity of the sender, the origin or the path it traveled (or combinations) so to validate claims from emitter or to validated the recipient  expectations.
# sender '''non-repudiation''': The emitter should not be able to deny sending the message.

Not all cryptographic systems achieve all of the above goals. Some applications of cryptography have ''different'' goals; for example some situations require '''repudiation''' where a participant
can plausibly deny that they are a sender or receiver of a message, or extend this goals to include variations like:

# message '''access control''': Who are the valid recipients of the message.
# message '''availability''': By providing means to limit the validity of the message, channel, emitter or recipient in time or space.

== Common forms of cryptography ==
Cryptography involves all legitimate users of information having the keys required to access that information.
*If the sender and recipient must have the same key in order to encode or decode the protected information, then the cipher is a '''symmetric key''' cipher since everyone uses the same key for the same message. The main problem is that the secret key must somehow be given to both the sender and recipient privately. For this reason, symmetric key ciphers are also called '''private key''' (or secret key) ciphers.
*If the sender and recipient have different keys respective to the communication roles they play, then the cipher is an '''asymmetric key''' cipher as different keys exist for encoding and decoding the same message. It is also called '''public key''' encryption as the user publicly distributes one of the keys without a care for secrecy. In the case of confidential messages to the user, they distribute the encryption key. Asymmetric encryption relies on the fact that possession of the encryption key will not reveal the decryption key.
*Digital Signatures are a form of authentication with some parallels to public-key encryption. The two keys are the public verification key and the secret signature key. As in public-key encryption, the verification key can be distributed to other people, with the same caveat that the distribution process should in some way authenticate the owner of the secret key. Security relies on the fact that possession of the verification key will not reveal the signature key.
*Hash Functions are '''unkeyed''' message digests with special properties.

Other:

Poorly designed, or poorly implemented, crypto systems achieve them only by accident or bluff or lack of interest on the part of the opposition. Users can, and regularly do, find weaknesses in even well-designed cryptographic schemes from those of high reputation.  

Even with well designed, well implemented, and properly used crypto systems, some goals aren't practical (or desirable) in some contexts.  For example, the sender of the message may wish to be anonymous, and would therefore deliberately choose not to bother with non-repudiation.  Alternatively, the system may be intended for an environment with limited computing resources, or message confidentiality might not be an issue.

In classical cryptography, messages are typically enciphered and transmitted from one person or group to some other person or group.  In modern cryptography, there are many possible options for &quot;sender&quot; or &quot;recipient&quot;.  Some examples, for real crypto systems in the modern world, include:

# a computer program running on a local computer,
# a computer program running on a 'nearby' computer which 'provides security services' for users on other nearby systems,
# a human being (usually understood as 'at the keyboard').  However, even in this example, the presumed human is not generally taken to actually encrypt or sign or decrypt or authenticate anything. Rather, he or she instructs a computer program to perform these actions.  This 'blurred separation' of human action from actions which are presumed (without much consideration) to have 'been done by a human' is a source of problems in crypto system design, implementation, and use.  Such problems are often quite subtle and correspondingly obscure; indeed, generally so, even to practicing cryptographers with knowledge, skill, and good engineering sense.

When confusion on these points is present (e.g., at the design stage, during implementation, by a user after installation, or ...), failures in reaching each of the stated goals can occur quite easily -- often without notice to any human involved, and even given a perfect cryptosystem.  Such failures are most often due to extra-cryptographic issues; each such failure demonstrates that good algorithms, good protocols, good system design, and good implementation do not alone, nor even in combination, provide 'security'.  Instead, careful thought is required regarding the entire crypto system design and its use in actual production by real people on actual equipment running 'production' system software (e.g., operating systems) -- too often, this is absent or insufficient in practice with real-world crypto systems.

Although cryptography has a long and complex history, it wasn't until the 19th century that it developed anything more than ad hoc approaches to either encryption or cryptanalysis (the science of finding weaknesses in crypto systems).  Examples of the latter include Charles Babbage's Crimean War era work on mathematical cryptanalysis of polyalphabetic ciphers, repeated publicly rather later by the Prussian Kasiski.  During this time, there was little theoretical foundation for cryptography; rather, understanding of cryptography generally consisted of hard-won fragments of knowledge and rules of thumb; see, for example, Auguste Kerckhoffs' crypto writings in the latter 19th century.  An increasingly mathematical trend accelerated up to World War II (notably in William F. Friedman's application of statistical techniques to cryptography and in Marian Rejewski's initial break into the German Army's version of the Enigma system).  Both cryptography and cryptanalysis have become far more mathematical since WWII.  Even then, it has taken the wide availability of computers, and the Internet as a communications medium, to bring effective cryptography into common use by anyone other than national governments or similarly large enterprise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classical Cryptography ==
The earliest known use of cryptography is found in non-standard hieroglyphs carved into monuments from Egypt's Old Kingdom (ca 4500 years ago).  These are not thought to be serious attempts at secret communications, however, but rather to have been attempts at mystery, intrigue, or even amusement for literate onlookers.  These are examples of still another use of cryptography, or of something that looks (impressively if misleadingly) like it.  Later, Hebrew scholars made use of simple Substitution ciphers (such as the Atbash cipher) beginning perhaps around 500 to 600 BCE.  Cryptography has a long tradition in religious writing likely to offend the dominant culture or political authorities.  Perhaps the most famous is the 'Number of the Beast' from the book of Revelations in the Christian New Testament. '666' is almost certainly a cryptographic (i.e., encrypted) way of concealing a dangerous reference; many scholars believe it's a concealed reference to the Roman Empire, or the Emperor Nero, (and so to Roman policies of persecution of Christians) that would have been understood by the initiated (who 'had the codebook'), and yet be safe (or at least somewhat deniable and so less dangerous) if it came to the attention of the authorities.  At least for orthodox Christian writing, the need for such concealment ended with Constantine's conversion and the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire. 

The Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cypher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military).  Herodutus tells us of secret messages physically concealed beneath wax on wooden tablets or as a tattoo on a slave's head concealed by regrown hair (these are not properly examples of cryptography per se; see secret writing).  The Romans certainly did (e.g., the Caesar cipher and its variations).  There is ancient mention of a book about Roman military cryptography (especially Julius Caesar's); it has been, unfortunately, lost. 

In India, cryptography was apparently well known.  It is recommended in the Kama Sutra as a technique by which lovers can communicate without being discovered.  This may imply that cryptanalytic techniques were less than well developed in India ca 500 CE.

Cryptography became (secretly) important still later as a consequence of political competition and religious analysis. For instance, in Europe during and after the Renaissance, citizens of the various Italian states, including the Papacy, were responsible for substantial improvements in cryptographic practice (e.g., polyalphabetic ciphers invented by Leon Alberti ca 1465). And in the Arab world, religiously motivated textual analysis of the Koran led to the invention of the frequency analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution cyphers sometime around 1000 CE.

Cryptography, cryptanalysis, and secret agent betrayal featured in the Babington plot during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I which led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.  And an encrypted message from the time of the Man in the Iron Mask (decrypted around 1900 by Étienne Bazeries) has shed some, regrettably non-definitive, light on the identity of that legendary, and unfortunate, prisoner.  Cryptography, and its misuse, was involved in the plotting which led to the execution of Mata Hari and even more reprehensibly, if possible, in the travesty which led to Dreyfus' conviction and imprisonment, both in the early 20th century.  Fortunately, cryptographers were also involved in setting Dreyfus free; Mata Hari, in contrast, was shot.

Mathematical cryptography leapt ahead (also secretly) after World War I.  Marian Rejewski, in Poland, attacked and 'broke' the early German Army Enigma system (an electromechanical rotor cypher machine) using theoretical mathematics in 1932.  The break continued up to '39, when changes in the way the German Army's Enigma machines were used required more resources than the Poles could deploy.  His work was extended by Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, and others at Bletchley Park beginning in 1939, leading to sustained breaks into several other of the Enigma variants and the assorted networks for which they were used.  
US Navy cryptographers (with cooperation from British and Dutch cryptographers after 1940) broke into several Japanese Navy crypto systems. The break into one of them famously led to the US victory in the Battle of Midway.  A US Army group, the SIS, managed to break the highest security Japanese diplomatic cipher system (an electromechanical 'stepping switch' machine called Purple by the Americans) even before WWII began.  The Americans referred to the intelligence resulting from cryptanalysis, perhaps especially that from the Purple machine, as 'Magic'.  The British eventually settled on 'Ultra' for intelligence resulting from cryptanalysis, particularly that from message traffic enciphered by the various Enigmas.  An earlier British term for Ultra had been 'Boniface'.

== World War II Cryptography ==
By World War II mechanical and electromechanical cryptographic cipher machines were in wide use, but they were impractical manual systems.  Great advances were made in both practical and mathematical cryptography in this period, all in secrecy. Information about this period has begun to be declassified in recent years as the official 50-year (British) secrecy period has come to an end, as the relevant US archives have slowly opened, and as assorted memoirs and articles have been published. 

The Germans made heavy use (in several variants) of an electromechanical rotor based cypher system known as Enigma. The German military also deployed several mechanical attempts at a one-time pad. Bletchley Park called them the Fish cyphers, and Max Newman and colleagues designed and deployed the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, the Colossus, to help with their cryptanalysis. The German Foreign Office began to use the one-time pad in 1919; some of this traffic was read in WWII partly as the result of recovery of some key material in South America that was insufficiently carefully discarded by a German courier.

The Japanese Foreign Office used a locally developed electrical stepping switch based system (called Purple by the US), and also used several similar machines for attaches in some Japanese embassies. One of these was called the 'M-machine' by the US, another was referred to as 'Red'. All were broken, to one degree or another by the Allies. 

Other cipher machines used in WWII included the British Typex and the American SIGABA; both were electromechanical rotor designs similar in spirit to the Enigma.

== Modern Cryptography ==
The era of modern cryptography really begins with Claude Shannon, arguably the father of mathematical cryptography. In 1949 he published the paper [http://www3.edgenet.net/dcowley/docs.html Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems] in the Bell System Technical Journal, and a little later the book ''Mathematical Theory of Communication'' with Warren Weaver. These, in addition to his other works on information and communication theory established a solid theoretical basis for cryptography and for cryptanalysis. And with that, cryptography more or less disappeared into secret government communications organizations such as the NSA.  Very little work was again made public until the mid '70s, when everything changed.

1969 saw two major public (i.e., non-secret) advances.  First was the DES (Data Encryption Standard) submitted by IBM, at the invitation of the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), in an effort to develop secure electronic communication facilities for businesses such as banks and other large financial organizations.  After 'advice' and modification by the NSA, it was adopted and published as a FIPS Publication (Federal Information Processing Standard) in 1977 (currently at FIPS 46-3).  It has been made effectively obsolete by the adoption in 2001 of the Advanced Encryption Standard, also a NIST competition, as FIPS 197. 
DES was the first publicly accessible cypher algorithm to be 'blessed' by a national crypto agency such as NSA.  The release of its design details by NBS stimulated an explosion of public and academic interest in cryptography.  DES, and more secure variants of it (such as 3DES or TDES; see FIPS 46-3), are still used today, although DES was officially supplanted by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in 2001 when NIST announced the selection of Rijndael, by two Belgian cryptographers. DES remains in wide use nonetheless, having been incorporated into many national and organizational standards. However, its 56-bit key-size has been shown to be insufficient to guard against brute-force attacks (one such attack, undertaken by cyber civil-rights group The Electronic Frontier Foundation, succeeded in 56 hours -- the story is in ''Cracking DES'', published by O'Reilly and Associates). As a result, use of straight DES encryption is now without doubt insecure for use in new crypto system designs, and messages protected by older crypto systems using DES should also be regarded as insecure. The DES key size (56-bits) was thought to be too small by some even in 1976, perhaps most publicly Whitfield Diffie. There was suspicion that government organizations even then had sufficient computing power to break DES messages and that there may be a back door due to the lack of randomness in the 'S' boxes.

Second was the publication of the paper [http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/340126.html New Directions in Cryptography] by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.  This paper introduced a radically new method of distributing cryptographic keys, which went far toward solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography, key distribution.  It has become known as Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  The article also stimulated the almost immediate public development of a new class of enciphering algorithms, the asymmetric key algorithms.

Prior to that time, all useful modern encryption algorithms had been symmetric key algorithms, in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient who must both keep it secret. All of the electromechanical machines used in WWII were of this logical class, as were the Caesar and Atbash cyphers and essentially all cypher and code systems throughout history. The 'key' for a code is, of course, the codebook, which must likewise be distributed and kept secret. 

Of necessity, the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system (the term usually used is 'via a secure channel') such as a trustworthy courier with a briefcase handcuffed to a wrist, or face-to-face contact, or a loyal carrier pigeon. This requirement rapidly becomes unmanageable when the number of participants increases beyond some (very!) small number, or when (really) secure channels aren't available for key exchange, or when, as is sensible crypto practice keys are changed frequently. In particular, a separate key is required for each communicating pair if no third party is to be able to decrypt their messages. A system of this kind is also known as a private key, secret key, or conventional key cryptosystem. D-H key exchange (and succeeding improvements) made operation of these systems much easier, and more secure, than had ever been possible before.

In contrast, with asymmetric key encryption, there is a pair of mathematically related keys for the algorithm, one of which is used for encryption and the other for decryption. Some, but not all, of these algorithms have the additional property that one of the keys may be made public since the other cannot be (by any currently known method) deduced from the 'public' key. The other key in these systems is kept secret and is usually called, somewhat confusingly, the 'private' key. An algorithm of this kind is known as a public key / private key algorithm, although the term [[asymmetric key cryptography]] is preferred by those who wish to avoid the ambiguity of using that term for all such algorithms, and to stress that there are two distinct keys with different secrecy requirements.

As a result, for those using such algorithms, only one key pair is now needed per recipient (regardless of the number of senders) as possession of a recipient's public key (by anyone whomsoever) does not compromise the 'security' of messages so long as the corresponding private key is not known to any attacker (effectively, this means not known to anyone except the recipient). This unanticipated, and quite surprising, property of some of these algorithms made possible, and made practical, widespread deployment of high quality crypto systems which could be used by anyone at all. Which in turn gave government crypto organizations worldwide a severe case of heartburn; for the first time ever, those outside that ''fraternity'' had access to cryptography that wasn't readily breakable by the 'snooper' side of those organizations. Considerable controversy, and conflict, began immediately. It has not yet subsided. In the US, for example, exporting ''strong'' cryptography remains illegal; cryptographic methods and techniques are classified as munitions. Until 2001 'strong' crypto was defined as anything using keys longer than 40 bits -- the definition was relaxed thereafter.  (See S Levy's ''Crypto'' for a journalistic account of the policy controversy in the US).

Note, however, that it has NOT been proven impossible, for any of the good public/private asymmetric key algorithms, that a private key (regardless of length) can be deduced from a public key (or vice versa). Informed observers believe it to be currently impossible (and perhaps forever impossible) for the 'good' asymmetric algorithms; no workable 'companion key deduction' techniques have been publicly shown for any of them. Note also that some asymmetric key algorithms have been quite thoroughly broken, just as many symmetric key algorithms have. There is '''no''' special magic attached to using algorithms which require two keys. 

In fact, some of the well respected, and most widely used, public key / private key algorithms '''can''' be broken by one or another cryptanalytic attack and so, like other encryption algorithms, the protocols within which they are used must be chosen and implemented carefully to block such attacks.  Indeed, ''all'' can be broken if the key length used is short enough to permit practical brute force key search; this is inherently true of all encryption algorithms using keys, including both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. 

This is an example of the most fundamental problem for those who wish to keep their communications secure; they must choose a crypto system (algorithms + protocols + operation) that resists all attack from any attacker.  There being no way to know who those attackers might be, nor what resources they might be able to deploy, nor what advances in cryptanalysis (or its associated mathematics) might in future occur, users may ONLY do the best they know how, and then hope.  In practice, for well designed / implemented / used crypto systems, this is believed by informed observers to be enough, and possibly even enough for all(?) future attackers.  Distinguishing between well designed / implemented / used crypto systems and crypto trash is another, quite difficult, problem for those who are not themselves expert cryptographers.  It is even quite difficult for those who are.

=== Revision of modern history ===
In recent years public disclosure of secret documents held by the UK government has shown that asymmetric key cryptography, D-H key exchange, and the best known of the public key / private key algorithms (i.e., what is usually called the RSA algorithm), all seem to have been developed at a UK intelligence agency before the public announcement by Diffie and Hellman in '76. GCHQ has released documents claiming that they had developed public key cryptography before the publication of Diffie and Hellman's paper. Various classified papers were written at GCHQ during the 1960s and 1970s which eventually led to schemes essentially identical to RSA encryption and to Diffie-Hellman key exchange in 1973 and 1974. Some of these have now been published, and the inventors (James Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson) have made public (some of) their work and stuff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''transposition cipher''' encodes a message by reordering the plaintext in some definite way. Mathematically, it can be described as applying some sort of bijective function. The receiver decodes the message using the reordering in the opposite way, setting the ordering right again. Mathematically this means using the inverse function of the original encoding function.

For example, to encrypt the sentence &quot;A simple kind of transposition cipher writes the message into a rectangle by rows and reads it out by columns,&quot; we could use the following rectangle:

 Asimplekin
 doftranspo
 sitionciph
 erwritesth
 emessagein
 toarectang
 lebyrowsan
 dreadsitou
 tbycolumns

Then the encrypted text would be &quot;Adsee tldts oirmo erbif tweab eymti rsrya cproi serdo lanta cosle ncegt wiuks iseas tmipp tinao nnohh ngnus.&quot;

This cipher is often complicated by permuting the rows and columns, as in columnar transposition.

== Columnar transposition ==
The standard columnar transposition consists of writing the key out as column headers, then writing the message out in successive rows beneath these headers (filling in any spare spaces with nulls), finally, the message is read off in columns, in alphabetical order of the headers. For example suppose we have a key of 'ZEBRAS' and a message of 'WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE'. We start with:

{|
|-
| '''Z''' || '''E''' || '''B''' || '''R''' || '''A'''
| '''S'''
|-
| W || E || A || R || E || D
|-
| I || S || C || O || V || E
|-
| R || E || D || F || L || E
|-
| E || A || T || O || N || C
|-
| E || Q || K || J || E || U
|}
Then read it off as:
 EVLNE ACDTK ESEAQ ROFOJ DEECU WIREE
To decipher it, the recipient has to work out the column lengths by dividing the message length by the key length. Then he can write the message out in columns again, then re-order the columns by reforming the key word.
== Double transposition ==
A single columnar transpostion could be attacked by guessing possible column lengths, writing the message out in its columns (but in the wrong order, as the key is not yet known), and then looking for possible anagrams. Thus to make it stronger, a double transposition was often used. This is simply a columnar transposition applied twice, with two different keys of different (preferably relatively prime) length. Double transposition was generally regarded as the most complicated cipher that an agent could operate reliably under difficult field conditions. It was in actual use at least as late as World War II (e.g.  poem code).

== Grille ==
Another type of transpositional cipher uses a grille. This is a square piece of cardboard with holes in it such that each cell in the square appears in no more than one position when the grille is rotated to each of its four positions.  Only grilles with an even number of character positions in the square can satisfy this requirement.  As much message as will fit in the grille is written, then it is turned to another position and more message is written.  Removing the cardboard reveals the cyphertext.

The following diagram shows the message &quot;JIM ATTACKS AT DAWN&quot; encoded using a 4x4 grille.

[[Image:Grille_transposition_cipher.png]]

The top row shows the cardboard grille and the bottom row shows the paper underneath the grille at five stages of encoding:

# blank grille on the paper.
# first four letters written in the blanks.
# grille rotated one position, second set of letters written.
# grille rotated two positions, third set of letters written.
# grille rotated three positions, fourth set of letters written.

After the letters in the message have all been written out, the ciphertext can be read from the paper: &quot;JKDT STAA AIWM NCAT&quot;.

The sender and receiver must agree on the initial orientation of the grille, the direction to rotate the grille, the order in which to use the spaces on the grille, and the order in which to read the ciphertext characters from the paper.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Caesar cipher''' (also known as a shift cipher) is a substitution cipher in which the cipher alphabet is merely the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a right rotation of three places:

 Plain:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

To encipher a message, simply look up each letter of the message in the &quot;plain&quot; line and write down the corresponding letter in the &quot;cipher&quot; line. To decipher, do the reverse. Because this cipher is a group, multiple encryptions and decryptions provide NO additional security against any attack, including brute-force.

The Caesar cipher is named for Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to protect messages of military significance. It was secure at the time because Caesar's enemies could often not even read plaintext, let alone ciphertext. But since it can be very easily broken even by hand, it has not been adequate for secure communication for at least a thousand years since the Arabs discovered frequency analysis and so made all simple substitution cyphers almost trivially breakable. An ancient book on cryptography, now lost, is said to have discussed the use of such cyphers at considerable length. Our knowledge is due to side comments by other writers, such as Suetonius.

Indeed, the Caesar cypher is much weaker than the (competently done) random substitution ciphers used in newspaper cryptogram puzzles. The most common places Caesar ciphers are found today are in children's toys such as secret decoder rings and in the ROT13 cipher on Usenet (which, of course, is meant to be trivial to decrypt)...

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the field of cryptanalysis, '''frequency analysis''' is a methodology for &quot;breaking&quot; simple substitution ciphers, not just the Caesar cipher but all monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. These ciphers replace one letter of the plaintext with '''another''' to produce the cyphertext, and any particular letter in the plaintext will always, in the simplest and most easily breakable of these cyphers, turn into the same letter in the cypher. For instance, all E's will turn into X's.
[[Image:Letter_frequency.PNG|thumb|400px| Graph of the relative frequency of letters in the English language]]
Frequency analysis is based on the fact that certain letters, and combinations of letters, appear with characteristic frequency in essentially all texts in a particular language. For instance, in the English language E is very common, while X is not. Likewise, ST, NG, TH, and QU are common combinations, while XT, NZ, and QJ are exceedingly uncommon, or &quot;impossible&quot;. Given our example of all E's turning into X's, a cyphertext message containing lots of X's already seems to suggest one pair in the substitution mapping.

In practice the use of frequency analysis consists of first counting the frequency of cypher text letters and then assigning &quot;guessed&quot; plaintext letters to them. Many letters will occur with roughly the same frequency, so a cypher with X's may indeed map X onto R, but could also map X onto G or M. But some letters in every language using letters will occur more frequently; if there are more X's in the cyphertext than anything else, it's a good guess for English plaintext that X stands for E. But T and A are also very common in English text, so X might be either of them. It's very unlikely to be a Z or Q which aren't common in English. Thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between cyphertext and plaintext letters. Once the common letters are 'solved', the technique typically moves on to pairs and other patterns. These often have the advantage of linking less commonly used letters in many cases, filling in the gaps in the candidate mapping table being built. For instance, Q and U nearly always travel together in that order in English, but Q is rare.

Frequency analysis is extremely effective against the simpler substitution cyphers and will break astonishingly short ciphertexts with ease. This fact was the basis of Edgar Allan Poe's claim, in his famous newspaper cryptanalysis demonstrations in the middle 1800's, that no cypher devised by man could defeat him. Poe was overconfident in his proclamation, however, for polyalphabetic substitution cyphers (invented by Alberti around 1467) defy simple frequency analysis attacks. The electro-mechanical cypher machines of the first half of the 20th century (e.g., the Hebern? machine, the Enigma, the Japanese Purple machine, the SIGABA, the Typex, ...) were, if properly used, essentially immune to straightforward frequency analysis attack, being fundamentally polyalphabetic cyphers. They were broken using other attacks.

Frequency analysis was first discovered in the Arab world, and is known to have been in use by about 1000 CE. It is thought that close textual study of the Koran first brought to light that Arabic has a characteristic letter frequency which can be used in cryptoanalysis. Its use spread, and was so widely used by European states by the Renaissance that several schemes were invented by cryptographers to defeat it. These included use of several alternatives to the most common letters in otherwise monoalphabetic substitution cyphers (i.e., for English, both X and Y cyphertext might mean plaintext E), use of several alphabets -- chosen in assorted, more or less, devious ways (Leon Alberti seems to have been the first to propose this), culminating in such schemes as using only pairs or triplets of plaintext letters as the 'mapping index' to cyphertext letters (e.g., the Playfair cipher invented by Charles Wheatstone in the mid 1800s). The disadvantage of all these attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both encyphering and decyphering, leading to mistakes. Famously, a British Foreign Secretary is said to have rejected the Playfair cipher because, even if school boys could learn it as Wheatstone and Playfair had shown, 'our attaches could never learn it!'.

Frequency analysis requires a basic understanding of the language of the plaintext, as well as tenacity, some problem solving skills, and considerable tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. Neat handwriting also helps. During WWII, both the British and Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the cyphers used by the Axis were breakable using frequency analysis (e.g., the 'consular' cyphers used by the Japanese). Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card machinery) were first used in WWII. Today, the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by the tireless speed of the computer, which can carry out this analysis in seconds. No mere substitution cypher can be thought credibly safe in modern times.

The frequency analysis method is neither necessary nor sufficient to solve ciphers.
Historically, cryptanalysts solved substitution ciphers using a variety of other analysis methods long before and after the frequency analysis method became well known.
Some people even question why the frequency analysis method was considered useful for such a long time.&lt;ref&gt;
Bernard Ycart.
[http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1211/1211.6847.pdf &quot;Letter counting: a stem cell for Cryptology, Quantitative Linguistics, and Statistics&quot;].
p. 8.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, modern cyphers are not simple substitution cyphers in any guise. They are much more complex than WWII cyphers, and are immune to simple frequency analysis, and even to advanced statistical methods. The best of them must be attacked using fundamental mathematical methods not based on the peculiarities of the underlying plaintext language. See [[Cryptography/Differential cryptanalysis]] or [[Cryptography/Linear cryptanalysis]] as examples of such techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before we can start any kind of examination of the abilities of the Bourne Shell and how you can tap into its power, we have to cover some basic ground first: we have to discuss how to enter commands into the shell for execution by that shell.

==The easy way: the interactive session==

=== Taking another look at what you've probably already seen ===

If you have access to a Unix-based machine (or an emulator on another operating system), you've probably been using the Bourne Shell -- or one of its descendants -- already, possibly without realising. Surprise: you've been doing shell scripting for a while already!

In your Unix environment, go to a terminal; either a textual logon terminal, or a terminal-in-a-window if you're using the X Window System (look for something called ''xterm'' or ''rxvt'' or just ''terminal'', if you have actually not ever done this yet). You'll probably end up looking at a screen looking something like this:

 Ben_Tels:Local_Machine:~&gt;_

or
 
 The admin says: everybody, STOP TRYING TO CRASH THE SYSTEM
 Have a lot of fun!
 bzt:Another_Machine:~&gt;_

or even something as simple as

 $_

That's it. That's your shell: your direct access to everything the system has to offer.

===Using the shell in interactive mode===

Specifically, the program you accessed a moment ago is your shell, running in ''interactive mode'': the shell is running in such a way that it displays a prompt and a cursor (the little, blinking line) and is waiting for you to enter a command for it to execute. You execute commands in interactive mode by typing them in, followed by a press of the '''Enter''' key. The shell then translates your command to something the operating system understands and passes off control to the operating system so that it can actually carry out the task you have sent it.  You'll notice that your cursor will disappear momentarily while the command is being carried out, and you cannot type anymore  (at this point, the Bourne Shell program is no longer in control of your terminal -- the other program that you started  by executing your command is). At some point the operating system will be finished working on your command and the shell will bring up a new prompt and the cursor as well and will then start waiting again for you to enter another command. Give it a try: type the command

:&lt;tt&gt;ls ''enter''&lt;/tt&gt;

After a short time, you'll see a list of files in the working directory (the directory that your shell considers the &quot;current&quot; directory), a new prompt and the cursor.

This is the simplest way of executing shell commands: typing them in one at a time and waiting for each to complete in order. The shell is used in this way very often, both to execute commands that belong to the Bourne Shell programming language and simply to start running other programs (like the ls program from the example above).

===A useful tidbit===

Before we move on, we'll mention two useful key combinations when using the shell: the command to interrupt running programs and shell commands and the command to quit the shell (although, why you would ever want to ''stop'' using the shell is beyond me....).

To interrupt a running program or shell command, hit the Control and C keys at the same time. We'll get back to what this does exactly in a later chapter, but for now just remember this is the way to interrupt things.

To quit the shell session, hit Control+d. This key combination produces the Unix end-of-file character -- we'll talk more later about why this also terminates your shell session. Some modern shells have disabled the use of Control+d in favor of the &quot;exit&quot; command (shame on them). If you're using such a shell, just type the word &quot;exit&quot; (like with any other command) and press Enter (from here on in, I'll leave the &quot;Enter&quot; out of examples).

==The only slightly less easy way: the script==

As we saw in the last section, you can very easily execute shell commands for all purposes by starting an interactive shell session and typing your commands in at the prompt. However, sometimes you have a set of commands that you have to repeat regularly, even at different times and in different shell sessions. Of course, in the programming-centric environment of a Unix system, you can write a program to get the same result (in the C language for instance). But wouldn't it be a lot easier to have the convenience of the shell for this same task? Wouldn't it be more convenient to have a way to replay a set of commands? And to be able to compose that set as easily as you can write the single commands that you type into the shell's interactive sessions?

===The shell script===

Fortunately, there ''is'' such a way: the Bourne Shell's ''non-interactive'' mode. In this mode, the shell doesn't have a prompt or wait for your commands. Instead, the shell reads commands from a text file (which tells the shell what to do, kind of like an actor gets commands from a script -- hence, shell script). This file contains a sequence of commands, just as you would enter them into the interactive session at the prompt. The file is read by the shell from top to bottom and commands are executed in that order.

A shell script is very easy to write; you can use any text-editor you like (or even any wordprocessor or other editor, as long as you remember to save your script in plain text format). You write commands just as you would in the interactive shell. And you can run your script the moment you have saved it; no need to compile it or anything.

===Running a shell script===

To run a shell script (to have the shell read it and execute all the commands in the script), you enter a command at an interactive shell prompt as you would when doing anything else (if you're using a graphical user interface, you can probably also execute your scripts with a click of the mouse). In this case, the program you want to start is the shell program itself. For instance, to run a script called ''MyScript'', you'd enter this command in the interactive shell (assuming the script is in your working directory):

{{code:Basic|Running a script|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sh MyScript&lt;/source&gt;}}

Starting the shell program from inside the shell program may sound weird at first,  but it makes perfect sense if you think about it. After all, you're typing commands in an ''interactive mode'' shell session. To run a script, you want to start a shell in ''non-interactive mode''. That's what's happening in the above command. You'll note that the Bourne Shell executable  takes a single parameter in the example above: the name of the script to execute.

If you happen to be using a POSIX 1003.1-compliant shell, you can also execute a single command in this new, non-interactive session. You have to use the -c command-line switch to tell the shell you're passing in a command instead of the name of a script:

{{code:Basic|Running a command in a new shell|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sh -c ls&lt;/source&gt;}}

We'll get to why you would want to do this (rather than simply enter your command directly into the interactive shell) a little further down.

There is also another way to run a script from the interactive shell: you type the execute command (a single period) followed  by the name of the script:

{{code:Basic|Sourcing a script|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;. MyScript&lt;/source&gt;}}

The difference between that and using the ''sh'' command is that the ''sh'' command starts a new process and the execute command does not. We'll look into this (and its importance) in the next section. By the way, this notation with the period is commonly referred to as ''sourcing'' a script.

===Running a shell script the other way===

There is also another way to execute a shell script, by making more direct use of a feature of the Unix operating system: the executable mode.

In Unix, each and every file has three different permissions (read, write and execute) that can be set for three different entities: the user who owns the file, the group that the file belongs to and &quot;the world&quot; (everybody else). Give the command

{{bcode:Example|ls -l}}

in the interactive shell to see the permissions for all files in the working directory (the column with up to nine letters, r, w and x for read write and execute, the first three for the user, the middle ones for the group, the right ones for the world). Whenever one of those entities has the &quot;execute&quot; permission, that entity can simply run the file as a program. To make your scripts executable by everybody, use the command

{{bcode:Example|'''chmod +x''' ''scriptname''}}

as in 

{{code:Basic|Making MyScript executable|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;chmod +x MyScript&lt;/source&gt;}}

You can then execute the script with a simple command like so (assuming it is in a directory that is in your PATH, the directories that the shell looks in for programs when you don't tell it exactly where to find the program):

{{code:Basic|Running a command in a new shell|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;MyScript&lt;/source&gt;}}

If this fails then the current directory is probably not in your PATH.  You
can force the execution of the script using

{{code:Basic|Making the shell look for your script in the current directory|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./MyScript&lt;/source&gt;}}

At this command, the operating system examines the file, places it in memory and allows it to run like any other program. Of course, not every file makes ''sense'' as a program; a binary file is not necessarily a set of commands that the computer will recognize and a text file cannot be read by a computer at all. So to make our scripts run like this, we have to do something extra.

As we mentioned before, the Unix operating system starts by examining the program. If the program is a text file rather than a binary one (and cannot simply be executed), the operating system expects the first line of the file to name the interpreter that the operating system should start to interpret the rest of the file. The line the Unix operating system expects to find looks like this:

{{bcode:Example|#!''full path and name of interpreter''}}

In our case, the following line should work pretty much everywhere:

{{bcode:Example|#!/bin/sh}}

The Bourne Shell executable, to be found in the bin directory, which is right under the top of the filesystem tree. For example:

{{code:Output|Bourne shell script with an explicit interpreter
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh
echo Hello World!
&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World!|}}

Executing shell scripts like this has several advantages. First it's less cumbersome than the other notations (it requires less typing). Second, it's an extra safety if you're going to pass your scripts around to others. Instead of relying on them to have the right shell, you can simply specify which shell they should use. If Bourne Shell is enough, that's what you ask for. If you absolutely need ''ksh'' or ''bash'', you specify that instead (mind you, it's not foolproof &amp;mdash; other people can ignore your interpreter specification by running your script with one of the other commands that we discussed above, even if the script probably won't work if they do that).

Just as a sidenote, Unix doesn't limit this trick to shell scripts. Any script interpreter that expects its scripts to be plain-text can be specified in this way. You can use this same trick to make directly executable Perl scripts or Python, Ruby, etc. scripts as well as Bourne Shell scripts.

Note also that with the distributions using bash as their defaut shell, you can use the #!/bin/sh shebang and have typical bash syntax in your script. It will work. But for the same script to work with a distribution not using bash as its default shell (as example Debian), you will have to modify the script or to change its shebang to #!/bin/bash.

==A little bit about Unix and multiprocessing==

===Why you want to know about multiprocessing===

While this is not directly a book about Unix, there are some aspects of the Unix operating system that we must cover to fully understand why the Bourne Shell works the way it does from time to time.

One of the most important aspects of the Unix operating system &amp;ndash; in fact, the main aspect that sets it apart from all other main-stream operating systems &amp;ndash; is that the Unix Operating System is and always has been a multi-user, multi-processing operating system (this in contrast with other operating systems like MacOS and Microsoft's DOS/Windows operating systems). The Unix OS was always meant to run machines that would be used simultaneously by several users, who would all want to run at least one but possibly several programs at the same time. The ability of an operating system to divide the time of a machine's processor among several programs so that it seems to the user that they are all running at the same time is called ''multiprocessing''. The Unix Operating System was designed from the core up with this possibility in mind and it has an effect on the way your shell sessions behave.

Whenever you start a new process (by running a program, for instance) on your Unix machine, the operating system provides that process with its very own operating environment. That environment includes some memory for the process to play in and it can also include certain predefined settings for all processes. Whenever you run the shell program, it is running in its own environment.

Whenever you start a new process from another process (for instance by issuing a command to your shell program in interactive mode), the new process becomes what is called a ''child process'' of the first process (the ls program runs as a child process of your shell, for instance). This is where it becomes important to know about multiprocessing and process interaction: a child process always starts with a ''copy'' of the environment of the parent process. This means two things:

# A child process can ''never'' make changes to the operating environment of its parent—it only has access to a copy of that environment;
# If you actually do ''want'' to make changes in the environment of your shell (or specifically want to avoid it), you have to know when a command runs as a child process and when it runs within your current shell; you might otherwise pick a variant that has the opposite effect of that which you want.

===What does what===

We have seen several ways of running a shell command or script. With respect to multiprocessing, they run in the following way:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Way of running
! Runs as
|-
| Interactive mode command ||
* current environment for a shell command {{ref|Remark_0}})
* child process for a new program
|-
| Shell non-interactive mode || child process
|-
| Dot-notation run command (''. MyScript'')
| current environment
|-
| Through Unix executable permission with interpreter selection
| child process
|}

===A useful thing to know: background processes===

With the above, it may seem like multiprocessing is just a pain when doing shell scripting. But if that were so, we wouldn't ''have'' multiprocessing—Unix doesn't tend to keep things that aren't useful. Multiprocessing is a valuable tool in interacting with the rest of the system and one that you can use to work more efficiently. There are many books available on the benefits of multiprocessing in program development, but from the point of view of the Bourne Shell user and scripter the main one is the ability to hand off control of a process to the operating system ''and still keep on working while that child process is running''. The way to do this is to run your process as a ''background process''.

Running a process as a background process means telling the operating system that you want to start a process, but that it should not attach itself to any of the interactive devices (keyboard, screen, etc.) that its parent process is using. And more than that, it also tells the operating system that the request to start this child process should return immediately and that the parent process should then be allowed to continue working without having to wait for its child process to end.

This sounds complicated, but you have to keep in mind that this ability is completely ingrained in the Unix operating system and that the Bourne Shell was intended as an easy interface to the power of Unix. In other words: the Bourne Shell includes the ability to start a child process as a simple command of its own. Let's demonstrate how to do this and how useful the ability is at the same time, with an example. Give the following (rather pointless but still time consuming) command at the prompt:

:&lt;tt&gt;N=0 &amp;&amp; while [ $N -lt 10000 ]; do date &gt;&gt; scriptout; N=`expr $N + 1`; done&lt;/tt&gt;

We'll get into what this says in later chapters; for now, it's enough to know that this command asks the system for the date and time and writes the result to a file named &quot;scriptout&quot;. Since it then repeats this process 10000 times, it may take a little time to complete.

Now give the following command:

:&lt;tt&gt;N=0 &amp;&amp; while [ $N -lt 10000 ]; do date &gt;&gt; scriptout; N=`expr $N + 1`; done&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;

You'll notice that you can immediately resume using the shell (if you don't see this happening, hit Control+C and check that you have the extra ampersand at the end). After a while the background process will be finished and the scriptout file will contain another 10000 time reads.

The way to start a background process in Bourne Shell is to append an ampersand (&amp;amp;) to your command.

----
====Remarks====
{{note|Remark_0}}Actually, you can force a child process here as well -- we'll see how when we talk about command grouping

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''truing jig''', aka a wheel truing stand, facilitates the precise [[../../Wheels and Tires/Truing a bicycle wheel|truing]] or building of a wheel. It consists of fork, similar to a bicycle's front fork, and callipers which allow precise measurement of the position of the rim.

It is possible to make your own truing jib. Start by getting an old bicycle fork and finding a way of supporting it. The easiest way is to find a sturdy box, and drilling a hole big enough to accommodate the fork column. The hole should be tight enough to firmly hold the fork and the wheel which will be supported. The fork is now upside down. It is possible to fashion some kind of true indicator or caliper using a nail or pencil attached on one leg of the fork. A metal strap that can be attached with a screw as a pencil or nail holder works best. I try to avoid using tape, string or rubber band since they have a tendency to move which could affect an accurate reading of the wheel's straightness. Straight wheels tend to turn smoothly without deviation when viewed from the front. I start by bringing the nail as closely as possible to the wheel rim. Turning the wheel by hand, warped wheels will occasionally touch the rim or show a large gap. Wheel spokes work by providing enough pull or release on both sides of the rim so that the rim remains straight. By loosening one spoke, the tension is strengthened on the other side and vice-versa. Ideally the spokes on both sides should be even to maintain optimum rim straightness. A sequence of tightening and loosening both sides of the spokes where necessary is the key to rim straightness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''brute force attack''' against a cipher consists of breaking a cipher by trying all possible keys. Statistically, if the keys were originally chosen randomly, the plaintext will become available after about half of the possible keys are tried. The underlying assumption is, of course, that the cipher is known. Since A. Kerckoffs first published it, a fundamental maxim of cryptography has been that security must reside only in the key. As Claude E. Shannon said a few decades later, 'the enemy knows the system'. In practice, it has been excellent advice.

As of the year 2002, symmetric ciphers with keys 64 bits or fewer are vulnerable to brute force attacks. DES, a well respected symmetric algorithm which uses 56-bit keys, was broken by an EFF project in the late 1990s. They even wrote a book about their exploit -- Cracking DES, O'Reilly and Assoc. The EFF is a non-profit cyberspace civil rights group; many people feel that well-funded organisations like the NSA can successfully attack a symmetric key cipher with a 64-bit key using brute force. This is surely true, as it has been done publicly. Many observers suggest a minimum key length for symmetric key algorithms of 128 bits, and even then it is important to select a secure algorithm. For instance, many algorithms can be reduced in effective keylength until it is computationally feasible to launch a brute force attack. AES is recommended for use until at least 2030.

The situation with regard to asymmetric algorithms is much more complicated and depends on the individual algorithm. Thus the currently breakable key length for the RSA algorithm is at least 768 bits (broken publicly since 2009), but for most elliptic curve asymmetric algorithms, the largest currently breakable key length is believed to be rather shorter, perhaps as little as 128 bits or so. A message encrypted with a 109 bit key by an elliptic curve encryption algorithm was publicly broken by brute force key search in early 2003. As of 2015, a minimum key length of 224 bits is recommended for elliptic curve algorithms, and 2048 bits for such other asymmetric key algorithms as RSA (asymmetric key algorithms that rely on complex mathematical problems for their security always will need much larger keyspaces as there are short-cuts to cracking them, as opposed to direct brute-force). 

== Common Brute Force Attacks ==
The term &quot;brute force attacks&quot; is really an umbrella term for all attacks that exhaustively search through all possible (or likely) combinations, or any derivative thereof.

=== Dictionary Attack ===
A dictionary attack is a common password cracking technique, relying largely on the weak passwords selected by average computer users. For instance, if an attacker had somehow accessed the hashed password files through various malicious database manipulations and educated searching on an online store, he would then write a program to hash one at a time all words in a dictionary (of, for example any or all languages and common derivative passwords), and compare these hashes to the real password hashes he had obtained. If the hashes match, he has obtained a password. 

==== Pre-Computation Dictionary Attack ====
The simple dictionary attack method quickly becomes far too time-consuming with any large number of password hashes, such as an online database would yield. Thus, attackers developed the method of pre-computation. In this attack, the attacker has already hashed his entire suite of dictionaries, and all he need do is compare the hashes. Additionally, his task is made easier by the fact that many users will select the same passwords. To prevent this attack, a database administrator must attach unique 32-bit salts to the users passwords before hashing, thus rendering precompution useless.

==Responses to Brute Force Attacks==
There are a number of ways to mitigate brute force attacks. For example:
* Changing a key frequently in response to an attempt to try all possible keys would require an attacker to start over assuming he knew the key was changed or finish attempting all possible keys before starting the attack again from the beginning.
* A system could rely on a time out or lock out of the system after so many attempts at guessing the key.  Systems that time out can simply block further access, lock a user account, contact the account owner, or even destroy the clear text information.
* 2 step verification is a method of requiring a second key to enter the system.   This complicates a brute force attack since the attacker must not only guess one key but then guess a second possibly equally complex key.  The most common implementation of this is to ask for further authentication &quot;What's your first dogs name?&quot;.  There is a new trend on the horizon for systems to utilize two step verification through a time based key that is emailed or texted and having access to an account or particular electronic device serves as a secondary key.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Data Encryption Standard''' (DES) was a widely-used algorithm for encrypting data. It was developed by IBM under the name Lucifer, and was submitted to NBS in response to a 1973 solicitation for better cryptosystems. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology with help from the National Security Agency took IBM's design and made some changes; DES was adopted as a standard in January of 1977.

DES is a product block encryption algorithm (a cipher) in which 16 iterations, or rounds, of the substitution and transposition (permutation) process are cascaded. The block size is 64 bits, so that a 64-bit block of data (plaintext) can be encrypted into a 64-bit ciphertext. The key, which controls the transformation, also consists of 64 bits. Only 56 of these, however, are at the user's disposal; the remaining eight bits are employed for checking parity. The actual key length is therefore 56 bits.

Subsets of the key bits are designated K1, K2, etc., with the subscript indicating the number of the round. The cipher function (substitution and transposition) that is used with the key bits in each round is labeled f. At each intermediate stage of the transformation process, the cipher output from the preceding stage is partitioned into the 32 leftmost bits, Li, and the 32 rightmost bits, Ri. Ri is transposed to become the left-hand part of the next higher intermediate cipher, Li+1. The right-hand half of the next cipher, Ri+1, however, is a complex function of the key and of the entire preceding intermediate cipher. The essential feature to the security of the DES is that f involves a very special nonlinear substitution--i.e., f(A) + f(B) does not equal f(A + B)--specified by the Bureau of Standards? in tabulated functions known as S-boxes. This operation results in a 32-bit number, which is logically added to Ri to produce the left-hand half of the new intermediate cipher. This process is repeated, 16 times in all. To decrypt a cipher, the process is carried out in reverse order, with the 16th round being first. The DES algorithm lends itself to integrated-chip implementation. By 1984 the Bureau of Standards had certified over 35 LSI- and VLSI-chip implementations of the DES, most on single 40-pin chips, some of which operate at speeds of several million bits per second.

When the cipher was first released, the design criteria for the S-boxes was not released. With the National Security Agency's involvement in the design of the S-boxes, most security researchers were wary of DES, and there was the widespread fear that the modifications of the NSA were intended to weaken the cipher. 

In 1990 with the independent discovery and open publication by Biham and Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, it turned out that at least some of the wariness was uncalled for. After the publication of this paper, the IBM personnel involved in the designed publically stated that the main factor in the design was to strengthen them against differential cryptanalysis. The secrecy behind the design criteria at the time appears to have been due to the fact that the technique was not known to the public at the time. 

Notably, DES is theoretically vulnerable to a technique discovered later by Matsui, linear cryptanalysis. It is unknown whether the NSA was aware of linear cryptanalysis at the time DES was finalized, but most knowledgeable observers think not. Don Coppersmith, one of DES's designers at IBM, has stated that IBM itself was not aware of linear cryptanalysis at that time.

Because the key length is only 56 bits, DES can be, and has been, broken by the brute force attack method of running through all possible keys. It is believed that one of the reasons this reduced key length was chosen was that NSA in the mid-'70s possessed enough computer power to brute force break keys of this length. In the years since, computer hardware progress has been such that most anyone now can have sufficient computational capacity. The EFF, a cyberspace civil rights group (with neither much funding nor personnel), did it in a little more than 2 days' search at about the same time at least one attorney from the US Justice Department was publicly announcing that DES was and would remain unbreakable. 

The most obvious way of improving the security of DES is to encrypt the data multiple times with different keys.  Double encrypting data with DES does not add much security as it is vulnerable to meet in the middle attacks.  Going one step about this, many former DES users now use Triple DES (3DES) which was described and analyzed by one of DES's patentees (see FIPS 46-3); it involves DES encryption of each data block three times with different keys. 3DES is widely regarded as adequately secure for now, though it is quite slow. Note, however, that there are several ways to use DES three times; only one of those is Tuchman's 3DES.

After another, long delayed competition, (NIST) has selected a new cipher, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to replace DES (fall -'01). AES was submitted by its designers under the name Rijndael.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|US Cuisine]]

A '''grilled cheese sandwich''' is a simple dish consisting of two slices of bread with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] between them, [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]], optionally with [[#Variations|other ingredients]].

== Ingredients ==
For 1 sandwich:
*1–3 slices of cheese, or shredded to taste
*:Any smoothly melting cheese; typically [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]], gouda, Limberger or [[Cookbook:American Cheese|American]].
* 2 slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
*:Any bread that toasts well: generally white bread (including sourdough).
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*:[[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] can be used, but is not recommended, as direct heating tends to negatively affect the taste of margarine
* [[#Variations|other ingredients]] as necessary (see below).

The key variable is the ratio of cheese to bread; this depends on the thickness and density of the bread, and the amount of cheese used, and varies according to taste; generally more cheese is preferred, so that the bread doesn't overwhelm the cheese.

== Preparation ==
With presliced bread and cheese, there is very little preparation.

=== Grating cheese ===
Grated cheese is recommended for more even melting. If mixing the grated cheese with chopped onions or other ingredients, it is easiest to grate the cheese into a bowl, mix with additional ingredients, and then spoon onto sandwiches, otherwise it can be messy.

=== Buttering bread ===
Buttering the bread makes the outside of the bread brown, rather than dry and burn, and is widely recommended.

Butter the slices of bread, then place butter-side down (the butter is on the ''outside'' of the bread), in the pan or on other cooking surface. Follow this by placing the grated cheese or sliced cheese on top, then the other slice of bread, butter-up. Do not place the butter side down on a prep surface, as it will come off and make a mess.

Alternatively, one may melt butter in a pan, and then place the bread on it; when flipping, one should add more butter, then flip the bread.

== Cooking ==
There are many methods of grilling a sandwich; the main variants are grilling on a stove-top, most common in US, and toasting in an oven, most common in the UK and Australia. There also specialized sandwich toasters or sandwich grills.

Ovens are useful if making multiple sandwiches, rather than grilling one at a time; they also allow one to make open-faced sandwiches.

The goal is to get a nicely browned [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] with melted cheese in the middle.

=== Difficulties ===
The main difficulties are:
* Unmelted or unevenly melted cheese
* Burnt bread
* Soggy bread

To get evenly melted cheese, and avoid burnt bread, cook at low heat (which is a general rule in roasting) – this gives the cheese time to warm up and melt, rather than scorching the bread before the cheese warms up.

If one desires soggy bread, one should melt the butter in a pan, and grill or roast in that. If one desires crisp bread, spread butter on the bread (not on the pan), and toast on a grate or cook in a ridged indoor grill, so the fat runs away.

=== Stove-top ===
Simply heat up a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]], [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] or [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]] (it is best on most stoves to heat on medium), spread the [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] on the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], and place both pieces of bread, butter side down, in the skillet. When the butter sides of both have browned (check periodically), flip one over and place 1-3 slices (this depends on the size of the slices) of cheese on top, and place the other slice of bread on top of the cheese (again, butter side down). At this point, it is advised to compress the sandwich, for example by pressing on it with a spatula. Once the bottom side of the sandwich is browned sufficiently, flip the sandwich over. When both sides are browned, take off heat, cut, and serve.

=== Toaster ===
If you lack a stove, you can prepare a fast and easy version of this sandwich simply with a toaster. This method is good for younger or otherwise inexperienced cooks because it does not require a stove. Take two slices of bread and butter them on both sides (or spread margarine or a similar substitute). Place the double-buttered slices into the toaster and toast until the bread is browned. Remove the two hot, crispy slices of toast from the toaster and place a slice of cheese between them. The cheese melts quickly. Cut and serve immediately. If desired, place the entire sandwich back into one slot of the toaster to melt the cheese even further.

=== Oven ===
To toast in an oven, heat oven to 150° Celsius (or 300° Fahrenheit), then place pan with sandwiches in, toast for 10–15 minutes, flip, and toast another 5–10 minutes, to taste.

One can also make open-faced sandwiches; in these, the exposed cheese tends to puff and bubble. If one only heats from above (via radiant heat), one melts the cheese and leaves the bread untoasted or lightly toasted, which may be desired, but generally one should have heat from both sides.

=== Sandwich toaster or grill ===
There are a variety of specialized Sandwich toaster and general-purpose indoor grills (aka, sandwich press, panini press).

These have the advantages of:
* not needing to flip 
* sealing in sandwich / no drips (in specialized toasters)
* attractive browning marks

=== Quotes ===
:“Butter the bread rather than the skillet, grate the cheese, and cook over low heat for sandwiches with a lacy-crisp exterior and a tender, oozing interior.” (Cooks, 1998)

== Variations ==
There are three main classes of variations:
* spreads, added to inside of bread
* fillings, large sandwich ingredients forming a layer
* mix-ins, mixed into (shredded) cheese

=== Spreads ===
Spread on inside of one or (better) both slices of bread before adding the fillings:
* [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
** mayonnaise and a little mustard (mix in a cup)
** mayonnaise and BBQ sauce.
* a garlic-flavored spread

=== Fillings ===
One can layer other ingredients; this works particularly well with slices of cheese.
* Place 1 or 2 slices of [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] or seeded fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] inside the sandwich.
* Use slices of cheddar cheese and some shredded pork rib meat.
* For a [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]]-like variant, spread [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] on both pieces of bread, add cheese and some slices of [[Cookbook:Salami|salami]].

=== Mixed with cheese ===
It is easiest to mix ingredients into the cheese if it is shredded, rather than in slices. Common mix-ins include:
* diced raw onion, or other vegetables of the allium]genus, such as garlic, leeks, or shallots
* few sweet pickles
* crumbled bacon

One can also mix in or sprinkle spices, such as:
* pepper
* cumin
* thyme

== Examples ==
* [http://www.kappacasein.com/ Kappacasein] of Borough Market uses cheddar cheese, sourdough bread, and mixes in onions, leek, and garlic. Bread is sliced ~6~8 mm, and cooked in a flat sandwich press, until entire surface is crisp.
* It is common practice at the Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation in Pearson, WI to substitute a garlic-flavored spread for the butter.

== Accompaniments ==
It is often served with [[Cookbook:Tomato Soup|tomato soup]].

I removed the part about pressing down with a spatula.  I've never done this before in my life, and I even make grilled cheese sandwiches using frozen bread.  It is not necessary to press down.  Just flip it carefully using your free hand to hold the top piece of bread.  The instruction about the spatula just complicated the recipe unecessarily.

'''Mincemeat''' is a spiced fruit preserve that does not in fact contain meat, although it may contain animal suet. The name is a throwback to Middle English from when &quot;meat&quot; was a word for all food, or to Victorian and earlier recipes that did combine minced lamb or beef with the spiced, preserved fruits.

Mincemeat Tarts are large (8 inch (20cm) diameter or more) open pastry tarts, sometimes with a lattice pastry top, and occasionally also containing baked or stewed apple. The smaller pastry topped tarts traditionally served at Christmas are known as Mince Pies.

==Ingredients for Mincemeat ==

*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (500 [[Cookbook:gram|g]]) seeded [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*1 lb (500 g) [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]]
*½ lb (250 g) finely ground beef [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]]. Suet is pure beef fat and can be obtained from the butcher at the market. (They will grind it on request.) Vegetarians can substitute a solid vegetable fat such as Pura Vegetable Suet.
*Rind of 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
*½ lb (250 g) candied [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] peel
*½ lb (250 g) candied [[Cookbook:Citron|citron]]
*12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (375 g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 lbs (1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) green [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], peeled
*½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (3 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*½ tsp (3 mL) [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 mL) [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]] or [[Cookbook:Rum|rum]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbsp]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

Wash currants and dry. Set aside. Put remaining ingredients--citron, orange peel, lemon rind, raisins, apples and suet--through a meat grinder using the course grinder blade. Add currants, brandy, spices and mix together.

Store in a tightly covered plastic container in the refrigerator (do not freeze.) for up to one year. Makes 4½ [[Cookbook:Pint|pints]] (2.25 [[Cookbook:Liter|liters]]).

Note: Candied orange peel and citron can be found in most markets around Thanksgiving.

==Pastry for Tarts==

Traditional British Mince Pies are made using a good [[Cookbook:Shortcrust Pastry|Shortcrust Pastry]], although Wheat Flour would be used in place of the given Potato flour in the recipe linked.
Pillsbury Pie Crusts, found in the dairy section of most grocery stores in the USA, work very well. 

Let the slices warm slightly to almost room temperature. Unwrap and place on a floured cutting board. For best results, roll the dough slightly thinner. Use a doughnut cutter with the center removed or a 2½ inch round cookie cutter to cut the tart shells Gently press into 1½ inch (4 cm) tart pans. Fill with mincemeat and top with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) round piece of pastry cut with the doughnut hole cutter. For added decoration, cut or press a design into the 1 inch pastry round before placing in the center of the filled tart. For a glazed top, lightly brush the pastry lids with milk, or a mixture of milk and beaten egg.

Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|425 °F (220 °C)]] for approx. 20 mins or until pastry is lightly browned at the edges. Allow to cool on a wire rack, and dust with icing sugar. People wanting a more alcoholic kick to their Mince Pie may also want to inject them with a little extra Brandy.

Discussion from [[w:Talk:One-Hour Thanksgiving Dinner]]

I '''''really''''' dislike the use of brand names for all of these ingredients.  Is this copied from the back of a package?

''Place the vegetables on the stove under low heat.'' - '''''under''''' the heat? [[User:RickK|RickK]] 06:11, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)


:Not copied from any package.  The brands dont match anyhow and compete against one another.  

The mention of Pillsburry instant frozen biscuits was intentional as they have a flufier and better consitincey than other brands and do not burn in the time frame.  

The HoneySuckle White turkey breast is the only precooked cook and serve breast consitently available across stores. Stove Top Stuffing is specifically mentioned becuase it is a quick cooking instant range stuffing that is available across supermarkets.  

Stove Top works in this case where as other brands would not becuase it is specifically designed for the range and &quot;quick cooking instant range stuffing&quot; will confuse people.

:Fixed the grammer a bit

::And perhaps the spelling... what exactly is a ''convince food''?  Is it something you convince your family to eat? ;-) --[[User:Lexor|Lexor]] 15:48, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)

This is very parochial - if it's purpose is to educate readers how to cook a turkey dinner within one hour, then so be it, however, as it stands it's merely a list of processed food items available in the USA only. The use of the word biscuit is very confusing! --[[User:Markb|Markb]]


I did some research on it.  These products should be availble in Brazil, Canada, and the US (Although not at US prices except in the US).  The Turkey most certainly is.   Canada Thanksgiving is celebrated more like Erntedankfest, Certainly celebrated in the US in areas with very high levels of German imigration such as the Missouri Rhineland and St. Louis and in in certain other states, along with Oktoberfest (Celebrated throughout the US often times state-wide as is the case with Missouri) and Halloween (All Harvest end festivals).  

It is dubios practice to link American (US, Brazil, Argentina- all observed on the same day) Thanksgiving to the Harvest festivals, except Canada's, since; 

1.) It is celebrated in Dec-Nov in all countries except Canada and at first in the US only in New England, where the harvest actually ends by October, 

2.) In Brazil(since 1949) and Argentina (Since 1997) it is the end of spring. 

3.) Also not noted is that the 2'nd American Thanksgiving, in 1641, was also called &quot;Scalp Day&quot; and it was held becuase the colonist were thankfull for finding suitable Native Americans to sell into slavery and one of the festivities was kicking decaptated heads around.  These &quot;Thanksgivings&quot; were often held by each community after each time they defeated the indiginous population.  It was Washington who decided that all these &quot;Celebrations&quot; should be held on one day &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;.  Even when Lincoln established &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; as an official holiday he sent the army against the Sioux.

Ergh... I can't remotely imagine anyone ever being desperate enough to want to make this, or to eat it! Still, I guess it's a big world out there. I hope somebody can give us instructions for a REAL thanksgiving dinner to go along with this fake. (I wouldn't worry about brand names in this instance because it's more a curiosity than a recipe.) [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 07:21, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I wouldn't eat it either, but based on the wikipedia article it came from, this is targeted at college students who can't get home for thanksgiving.  I suppose we should put together traditional menus for the various holidays, linked to the recipes for those dishes. However, what is traditional is different based on where you are.  For example, Californians will often include crab in thanksgiving dinner as the dungeness crab season starts in mid November here, so crab is cheap at that time, but its inclusion in Thanksgiving dinner in Iowa would be unheard of. hrmmm, sounds like a project to consider. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 07:50, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)

As changed, this is totally useless! It's not a recipe or even a compilation of recipes 'take two cans of chosen vegetables'? What sort of instruction is that?!  You might as well delete the timeline.

I believe that this dinner needs something else.  How about a fruit salad?  I suggest the following:  Drain and then combine a can of pineapple chunks with a can of mandarin oranges.  Add some crushed walnuts and flake coconut.  Slice in a fresh banana.  This is an easy salad that would add some variety and some color.</text>

Hi Chris! 

  I work on Wiki a lot, and am interested in talking with you.

  I share the vision of wiki for practically *everything,*
  with highly organized systems connecting them.

  I'm working aggressively towards manifesting this vision.
  You seem similarly motivated, and I'd like to connect with you.

  You can see my friends and I working on:

* http://communitywiki.org/
* http://wiki.taoriver.net/

  You might be particularly interested in ''plog.''
  http://plogdev.wiki.taoriver.net/
  (...though there are many other projects we do, as well.)

I am also a big fan of Wikis.  I'm trying to get a couple started at work, which is requiring me to learn about how they are hosted.  It seems a shame not to share what I learn, but I'm actually having trouble figuring out where at wikibooks or wikipedia it would best reside.  Do you have any ideas?  

Thanks, [[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 17:39, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: Clearly, the answer is... on the [[Wiki Science]] wiki!</text>

{{cookdp}}

'''Sandwiches''' are generally two slices of bread, with other food in between. They are named after the [[Wikipedia:John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Earl of Sandwich]].

When serving sandwiches at a dinner party, they should be triangular, easily held between a finger and thumb, and have all crusts removed. Typical fillings for such sandwiches are smoked [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], or [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]. At a sandwich buffet, cocktail sticks are often stuck through the sandwiches, making them easier to lift by partygoers.

There are various slang terms for a sandwich, such as butty and sarnie.

There are many possible fillings for a savoury sandwich, including [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], [[Cookbook:Pastrami|pastrami]], [[Cookbook:Corned Beef|corned beef]], [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]], [[Cookbook:Tongue|tongue]], [[Cookbook:Clam|fried clams]], [[Cookbook:Fried Fish|fried fish]], [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], and [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]].

Sweet sandwiches typically include a combination of [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]].

==A Technical Definition of a Sandwich, For the Reader’s Amusement==
# A sandwich must contain at least one piece of bread which, prior to assembling the sandwich, has been sliced, cut, or pulled open. 
# All of the filling ingredients of a sandwich must, prior to assembly of the sandwich, be edible (i.e: previously cooked, if needed).
#Assembly of a sandwich involves putting sandwich filling ingredients of the cook's choice:
##in a pocket or slot, which has been cut or pulled open in the bread (for example in a bun or a bread roll), 
##between two (or more) pieces of sliced bread (which may be a bun or a  bread roll sliced entirely in half), 
##or, at  the very  least, on top of one piece of sliced bread.
#A sandwich should be capable of being eaten, as is, after it is assembled, although some recipes may call for further steps before serving.  
#Sandwiches should be designed to allow them to be picked up and eaten by hand, without utensils, although there are few limited exceptions to this requirement.

*The definition excludes food items in which uncut breads (such as tortillas or crepes) are:
**wrapped around the ingredients (for example, as in a burrito), which are considered wraps or rolls, instead of sandwiches; or 
**folded around the ingredients (for example, as in a taco, which is a class of food items in its own right.)

*The definition includes sausage-on-a-bun and hot dogs, although these items are not commonly referred to as sandwiches. 

*In a wider sense, the word ‘sandwich’ can mean ‘any assembly of one thing between two other things’.  In that sense the term sandwich is applied to a wider variety of foods, including ice cream sandwiches ‘sandwich cookies,’ and, perhaps, quesadillas, which meets many of the requirements for being a sandwich, although it is cut only after it has been prepared.

=Goals=
==Book==
The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive coverage of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) in a textbook format. This book is written and edited by students for students. Each student who uses the book should improve its quality by correcting errors, adding exercises, adding examples, starting new chapters and so forth.

Chapters 2 through 6 take the perspective that an XML schema is a representation of a data model, and thus these chapters deal with mapping the complete range of relationships that occur between entities. As you learn how to convert each type of relationship into a schema, other aspects of XML are introduced. For example, stylesheets are initially introduced in Chapter 2 and progressively more stylesheet features are added in Chapters 3 through 6.

Consolidation chapters (e.g., Chapter 7 &quot;Data schemas&quot;) bring together the material covered across previous chapters; in this case, Chapters 2 through 6. This means students see key skills twice: once in the context of gradually developing their broad understanding of XML and then again in the specific context of one dimension of XML. 

Application chapters cover particular uses of XML (e.g., SVG for scalable vector graphics) to give the reader examples of the use of XML to solve particular types of problems. This part of the book is expected to grow as the use of XML extends.

==Project==
Professors typically throw away their students’ projects at the end of the term. This is a massive waste of intellectual resources that can be harnessed for the betterment of many by creating an appropriate infrastructure. In our case, we use wiki technology as the infrastructure to create a free open content textbook.

University students are an immense untapped global resource. They can be engaged in creating open textbooks if the right infrastructure is in place to sustain renewable student projects. This book is an example of how waste can be avoided.

=History=
* Graduate students at the [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia] started writing this book in January 2004. They were students in an Advanced Data Management class, and most were studying for a [http://ebiz.terry.uga.edu/ Masters in Internet Technology].
* Students at two German Universities, the [http://www.uni-passau.de/ University of Passau] and the [http://www.uni-halle.de/MLU/index_e.htm Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg], added material to the first few chapters in May, 2004.
* A [[:zh:XML/引言|Chinese translation]] was started in mid 2004 by Dr. Xu Zhengchuan of [http://www.fudan.edu.cn/english/index_en.html Fudan University] in Shanghai.
* An [[:it:XML|Italian translation]] was started in late 2004 by [[User:Jubjub68|Jubjub68]].
* Students in Data Management classes at the University of Georgia use the book each semester and continue to improve it.
* In the first semester of 2006, the Advanced Data Management class at the University of Georgia undertook a complete review of the book to improve quality and consistency.
* 2006-Aug-31: [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-08/uog-gtp083106.php &quot;Global Text Project aims to create free, Wiki-based textbooks for developing nations&quot;]: press release links directly to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XML .

==Hello world==

When learning to program, the first thing usually learned is how to write a program that prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console. It gives programmers a feel of how simple programs are structured. Io has many ways to write things to the console, so at times it can be confusing about which one to use. The one that's most often used is the write function. Enter the Io's interactive interpreter (by typing &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt; at the console) and type the following:

 write(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)

With the interactive interpreter, this should look like:

 user@computer:~$ io
 Io&amp;gt; write(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)
 Hello, world!
 ==&amp;gt; nil

Another way would be:

 &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot; print

Some of this makes sense. It looks like &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; is telling Io to write something to the console, specifically the stuff after it. The stuff after it is in quotes so it's some text, and it's what's going to be printed. But why are those parentheses there, what's with that &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; at the end of it, and why was there an arrow with the quoted text after it?

The parentheses are telling &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; to use the thing within the parentheses, which is called an ''argument''. &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; is called a ''function'' (remember functions in math?). There might be multiple arguments within the parentheses separated by commas in a single function. The first and only argument for &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;, namely &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, is a ''string'' (because it's a string of letters).

The &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the string is an ''escape sequence''. You can tell that because it begins with a backslash. This particular escape sequence signals a newline, the equivalent of pressing enter. If you just pressed enter in the middle of the string (or at least this type of string -- we'll get to that later), it would confuse Io.  

The thing where there's an arrow and then the string that was the argument of the &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function is the value that &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; ''return''ed. Every function returns a value. With some functions, it makes sense to return something (such as a function to add two numbers), but with other functions, it just returns something simple done with the arguments. In this case, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; returns the special value &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it has nothing to return.

== Concatenate Strings ==

Use '''the double dot operator''' to concatenate strings. Or, you can use string interpolation, as shown below.

Let's say &lt;code&gt;olle&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; instance, and it has both a first name and a last name:

 Io&amp;gt; olle
 ==&amp;gt; Object_0080B818 do(
   appendProto(Object_00806B58)
   lastname := &quot;Jonsson&quot;
   title := &quot;Developer&quot;
   firstname := &quot;Olle&quot;
 )

We want a method to show first and last name with a space in-between:

 Io&amp;gt; olle fullname := method(firstname .. &quot; &quot; .. lastname)
 ==&amp;gt; method(firstname ..(&quot; &quot;) ..(lastname))

or, using string interpolation:

 Io&amp;gt; olle fullname := method(&quot;#{firstname} #{lastname}&quot; interpolate)
 ==&amp;gt; method(&quot;#{firstname} #{lastname}&quot; interpolate)

Now, calling &lt;code&gt;olle fullname&lt;/code&gt; will yield &lt;code&gt;&quot;Olle Jonsson&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Looking at the returned method object, we can see how the Io interpreter creates regular message calls (the parentheses) for the method &lt;code&gt;..()&lt;/code&gt;.

So, this is the new &lt;code&gt;olle&lt;/code&gt; instance:

 Io&amp;gt; olle
 ==&amp;gt; Object_0080B818 do(
   appendProto(Object_00806B58)
   fullname := Block_007B5030
   lastname := &quot;Jonsson&quot;
   title := &quot;Developer&quot;
   firstname := &quot;Olle&quot;
 )

(Note: only this instance has the &lt;code&gt;fullname&lt;/code&gt; method. You could add the &lt;code&gt;fullname&lt;/code&gt; method to &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; instead, which would make it available to &lt;code&gt;olle&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;olle&lt;/code&gt;'s prototype, &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;. Also, the firstname and lastname and title could also be moved up to the Person. But this is the way pieces of example code are.)

==Simple arithmetic==

In Io, you can use arithmetic expressions and they will work correctly. Arithmetic in Io is just like functions, except it uses objects to help. Objects make it so that instead of typing something like +(1, 2), you can type 1+2. More about objects later. + is still a function, though, so it returns a value. This is very useful; it makes it so you can use Io as a simple calculator. Notes about what it's doing are put after two slashes (like this: //).

 Io&amp;gt; 1+2 //addition
 ==&amp;gt; 3
 
 Io&amp;gt; 4-5 //subtraction
 ==&amp;gt; -1
 
 Io&amp;gt; 7*3 //multiplication
 ==&amp;gt; 21
 
 Io&amp;gt; 3/6 //division
 ==&amp;gt; 0.50000
 
 Io&amp;gt; 2**3 //exponents
 ==&amp;gt; 8
 
 Io&amp;gt; 7%2 //remainder of 7/2 (technically, 7 mod 2)
 ==&amp;gt; 1

This follows normal order of operations (called ''precedence'') and parentheses can be used. As you'd expect, you can use &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; on numbers, but the newline isn't included. You have to use multiple arguments with &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; to print multiple things and then it returns all of those things put together. So to print &lt;code&gt;(1/3)**2&lt;/code&gt;, you would write:

 write((1/3)**2, &quot;\n&quot;)

As you would expect, this prints 0.11111. It returns the string &quot;0.11111\n&quot; because with the &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function, multiple arguments are converted to strings and joined together. Then that value is printed and returned.

==Variables==

A ''variable'' is basically a word that stands for a value. They are somewhat like variables in mathematics, except in mathematics, variables could only be numbers and they were one letter long. In programming, functions, objects, strings, and numbers are all types of variables, but we haven't defined any yet.  Many variables, such as write, 3, and &quot;Hello, world!&quot; can already be used, but only some of them can be changed. You can make your own variables using = and :=. Below are some examples of making and using variables:

 x := 3
 line := &quot;\n&quot;
 write(x, line)

Can you tell what's happening? The variable x is being set to 3 and the variable line is being set to &quot;\n&quot;, which is equivalent to a newline. Then, the contents x and line are being written to the console. Since x is 3 and line is a newline, this prints 3 and then goes to the next line on the console. The function returns &quot;3\n&quot;.

In Io, there is a difference between creating and changing the value of variables. If a variable doesn't exist yet, you have to use :=, but if you've already given it an initial value using :=, you can use = for subsequent definitions. Here's an example:

 x := 1
 incrementor := 2
 write(&quot;x is &quot;, x, &quot;\n&quot;)
 x = x + incrementor
 write(&quot;but when we added &quot;, incrementor, &quot; to it, it became &quot;, x, &quot;\n&quot;)

It may be confusing that sometimes we use := and other times we use =, but you'll get used to it. If you want to, you can always use :=, but when we get into objects later, it will become very inconvenient to keep using :=, so you should probably start using = whenever appropriate.

==Programs==

Until now, you've been simply been going to Io's interactive interpreter. This prevents you from making larger applications or writing things for others. If you want to write code to be reused, simply put it in a text file and run it with &lt;code&gt;io &amp;lt;filename&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &amp;lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you use. Here's an example of using a file on Linux to store a program:

 user@computer:~$ cat &gt; incrementor.io
 x := 1
 incrementor := 2
 writeln(&quot;x is &quot;, x)
 x = x + incrementor
 writeln(&quot;but when we added &quot;, incrementor, &quot; to it, it became &quot;, x)
 user@computer:~$ io incrementor.io
 x is 1
 but when we added 2 to it, it became 3
 user@computer:~$

That was the last example we just did. If you noticed, I used a .io file extension. This is in no way mandated, it is merely a convention. Something happened differently this time then when we did it from a file, if you noticed. Unlike before, we didn't see what each function returned. Instead, we only saw what was explicitly output by &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.

If you're on Linux or a similar system (such as Unix, Mac OS X, or Cygwin), you can make it so that your file can be run simply by typing &lt;code&gt;./yourProgram.io&lt;/code&gt; (where yourProgram.io is the name of your program), without needing to precede it with &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt;. This can be accomplished by putting a line of code at the beginning of your program and then giving it executable permissions. On Linux, that code is:

 #! /usr/bin/env io

It may differ for other systems. To give it executable permissions, simply type the following:

 chmod +x yourProgram.io

Again, this may be different on different systems. Once you do this, nothing will change about the actual execution of the code, but you can, for example, just double click on a source code file in a GUI and it will run.

==Writing functions==

As I said before, functions are just another type of variable, so you can create them using := and change them using =. Functions themselves are created with a function called &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt;. Here's an example of a function:

 add := method(a, b, //function to add 2 numbers
   a + b
 )
 writeln(add(1, 2)) //writes 3
 x := 1
 writeln(add(3, x)) //writes 4
 x = add(4, 5) //9
 writeln(x) //writes 9
 x = add(x, 1) //in effect increment x by 1
 writeln(x) //writes 10

The function add takes two arguments, a and b, and then returns a + b. It would do exactly the same thing if, instead of a and b, we used the variable names 'this' and 'that', everywhere that a and b were used. In that case, the function would be  written as:

 add := method(this, that,
   this + that
 )

What a function really does is take a list of arguments; then it assigns the arguments to ''local variable''s, which are specified when you make the function. Local variables stay in the function you're working in and you can't get to them outside of the function. In the most recent case, those local variables are 'this' and 'that', so the variable 'this' will take the first argument, and the variable 'that' will take the second argument. Then it executes the rest of the function and returns the result. The function can have multiple lines of code and the last line will be the value returned. Here's an example:

 examineArgs := method(this, that,
   writeln(&quot;This is &quot;, this, &quot;.&quot;)
   writeln(&quot;That is &quot;, that, &quot;.&quot;)
 )

 // usage:
 examineArgs(3, 5)
 /* writes:
 This is 3.
 That is 5. */

 x := examineArgs(&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;bye&quot;)
 /* writes:
 This is hi.
 That is bye. */

 write(x)
 /* writes:
 That is bye. */

Why was x set to &quot;That is bye.\n&quot;? Because that's what examineArgs returned. It returned the value of the last line, the value of write(&quot;That is &quot;, that, &quot;.\n&quot;). That was set to &quot;bye&quot;, so it printed the string &quot;That is bye.\n&quot; and returned the same string.

If you want to return something before the function ends, you can use the return function. Unlike most functions, you don't need to put parentheses around the argument to call the return function. Here is an example of its usage:

 returning := method(this, that,
   writeln(this)
   return this
   writeln(that)
 )
 x := returning(1, 2)
 //writes &quot;1\n&quot;
 write(x) //writes 1 with no newline

As you can see, the code after return isn't used at all. Right now, this doesn't seem very useful, but later, when we get into flow control, it will be used very often.

==Conditionals==

Conditionals in Io are made using the if function:

 if(a == 1) then(
   writeln(&quot;a is one&quot;)
 ) else(
   writeln(&quot;a is not one&quot;)
 )

However, the preferred way to write this (without the need for then() and else() messages, so it is faster):

&lt;pre&gt;
if(a == 1, writeln(&quot;a is one&quot;), writeln(&quot;a is not one&quot;))
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breaking the Caesar cipher''' is trivial as it is vulnerable to most forms of attack. The system is so easily broken that it is often faster to perform a brute force attack to discover if this cipher is in use or not. An easy way for humans to decipher it is to examine the letter frequencies of the cipher text and see where they match those found in the underlying language.

===Frequency analysis===

By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext and those in the original language of the plaintext, a human can spot the value of the key but looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. For example in the English language the frequencies of the letters Q,R,S,T have a particularly distinctive pattern.

Computers can also do this trivially by means of an auto-correlation function.

===Brute force===
As the system only has 26 non-trivial keys it is easy even for a human to cycle through all the possible keys until they find one which allows the ciphertext to be converted into plaintext.

===Known plaintext attack===
If you have a message in both ciphertext and in plaintext it is trivial to find the key by calculating the difference between them.

==“今天她们没有一节课” really sounds unnatural==
I would say &quot;今天她们一节课都没有”
 
Does the character “都” in “今天,他們一節課&quot;都&quot;沒有。” mean &quot;any&quot;? I don't think so .I think &quot;even&quot; would better.There can be a feeling of envy.Like &quot;They don't 'even' have one class today&quot;.--[[User:Shinylight|Shinylight]] [[User talk:Shinylight|talk]]


&quot;今天她们没有一节课&quot; is just wrong.  When negating posession, you don't give a quantity: 他們沒有課.
(To get the idea of how wrong it feels, think of someone who has no money trying to express it in
English by saying &quot;I don't have three dollars and fifty four cents&quot; - it is true, but it is so
specific that it misses the general meaning that he wants.  He should say &quot;I have no money&quot;.)
If you want the emphasis of &quot;does not have even one class&quot; you could use 都 (dou1) or 也 (ye3),
but the word order is a little different from English: 他們一節課都沒有 or 他們一節課也沒有.
Literally, 都 (dou1) by itself means &quot;all&quot; and 也 (ye3) means &quot;also&quot;, but this is just one of
those patterns that does not map neatly onto English word-by-word.
I'm sure you could work 連 (lian2) &quot;any&quot; in there, but it would be icing on the cake; you
already have that meaning by using either of those constructions with 都 or 也.

Also, it looks like some discussion is creeping into the lesson itself (&quot;Actually,We seldom say...&quot;).
That's got to go.  :-)  --[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 07:11, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

I have cleaned up the area by creating separate examples for &quot;今天他们没有课&quot; and &quot;今天他们一门课都没有&quot;, with some explanation of the latter. Since I am a new editor, it would be awesome if someone could check it for formatting and quality. :) --[[User:Electricwhisper|Electricwhisper]] ([[User talk:Electricwhisper|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Electricwhisper|contribs]]) 02:56, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

==Something about the &quot;Guo4&quot;(過)?==
 --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:53, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Might be useful to have word-by-word translation of examples?


I'm going to change 你早 to 早安 as I, the native speaker I asked, and the Apple Simplified Chinese Input Method have never heard of the former, but have commonly heard the latter.

Someone had put in Roman spaces between Chinese punctuation marks and the first character of the next sentence.  This is superfluous since the Chinese punctuation already has space built in.  It also makes things look bad, as it keeps the characters from aligning vertically.  So I removed the spaces.

:I found this text a little bit &quot;English&quot;, seems like a word-to-word translation from English to Chinese. We seldom hear &quot;你好吗&quot;, &quot;我很好，谢谢。你呢？&quot;, &quot;我也很好。&quot; in Chinese. And the sentence &quot;一节？！太少了！&quot; a little bit unnature for me. they are all grammatically correct, just not sound native for me. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 18:19, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::As for &quot;你好吗&quot; and so on, that seems to be the starting place for most Chinese texts, even if it's not actually used every day.  After all, you have to start somewhere really simple and can't just immediately jump in to exactly how a native speaker would say something.  For &quot;一节？！太少了！&quot;, how would you say it?

::: Maybe  只一节？ (zhi3 yi1 jie2?)  But then, this lesson doesn't exactly need more vocabulary, does it? --[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 07:07, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

:So what's the deal with having different word choices in the simplified and traditional versions of the first sentence?  (&quot;早上好&quot; vs. &quot;早安&quot;)   Even if the most common usage differs between the mainland and Taiwan, the beginning lessons should present something that is acceptable in either locale.  If we want to show both greetings, maybe 東尼 could say &quot;早上好&quot; and 艾美 could reply with &quot;早安&quot;? --[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 07:07, 17 March 2009 (UTC)



:::Most (if not all) of the pronunciation for the vocabulary in this lesson is now uploaded at Commons. Since I'm not going to work on the actual content of this book, I thought it be best if someone else implemented the audio links here.
:::Enjoy.
:::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

::::Thank you, Peter. I'll link to them now.
::::[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 21:35, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

I think putting 今天 at the beginning of the sentence sounds weird when spoken.  I think it should be 你今天忙不忙. -[[User:Deranged_physicist|deranged_physicist]]

== By Lie-Hap-Po ==

Good morning : 你早/早安
Both exist in Chinese so you can use both.

uhh no... the first is not used in standard Mandarin.

It is worth pointing out that the word ‘早’ literally means 'early' in chinese, and it can only 'literally' mean morning if it is ‘早上’. The first one - referring to 你早/早安 - could be used in dialects like Cantonese (but I'm not so sure about that), but I've never heard a person saying '你早' 'in Mandarin. - chinzh

:yeah 你早 is kinda informal, thou im sure you do get to hear this in somewhere of china, it would be a bit misleading for beginners. 
and unlike in English where different kind of saying may mean completely another word, even you dont give learners this word, when later as their knowlege about chinese lang grows they'll easily understand what 你早 means whenever they meet/hear it. [[User:KonW|KonW]] ([[User talk:KonW|talk]]) 15:01, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

== By  Lie-Hap-Po ==

Chinese uses different words and different topics when they are talking to foreigners than when they are talking to other Chinese.
Example How are you? CtC : 你吃了吗？CtF ：你好吗？
Example2 Your Chinese is very good. CtC:你普通话说得很好。CtF:你中文说得很好。

== Suggest reducing vocabulary and adding a writing lesson ==
I think that, compared to most mainstream textbooks, this introduces vocabulary slightly too quickly for people who are new to characters. Someone who is new to characters would struggle with memorizing this many words at once. For example, the DeFrancis book has ten characters per lesson at the beginning.[[User:86.137.109.142|86.137.109.142]] 11:06, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== Need simplified characters in vocab list ==
The characters in the vocab list are all traditional. Only the ones in parentheses should be traditional. I'll see if I can cut and paste; if not, someone else can do it since I don't have a chinese character typing tool on my computer. [[User:Emmaskis|Emmaskis]] ([[User talk:Emmaskis|talk]]) 17:59, 5 March 2009 (UTC)


Never mind, I just changed them a couple of minutes ago. [[User:Emmaskis|Emmaskis]] ([[User talk:Emmaskis|talk]]) 18:04, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

== Zaoshang ==
Using this to learn mandarin for the first time, notice zaoshang isn't the vocabulary, just zao. It doesn't really change the meaning, but it was confusing for me as I thought there was an extra word that i didn't understand.

==Jie2==
There is no definition for Jie2 in either this lesson or in lesson one
:both &quot;mén&quot; and &quot;Jie2&quot; are measure word for school courses. --[[User:KaurJmeb|KaurJmeb]] ([[User talk:KaurJmeb|talk]]) 15:48, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

:门 refers to one course as a whole, whereas 节 refers to a single class period. It sounds a bit unnatural to me to say &quot;今天我有四门课,&quot; where I would be more likely to say &quot;这个学期我有四门课.&quot; I would rather say &quot;今天我有四节课.&quot; I think 节 should be incorporated into the examples to reflect this. --[[User:Electricwhisper|Electricwhisper]] ([[User talk:Electricwhisper|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Electricwhisper|contribs]]) 03:02, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

== Disapearing Pīnyīn ==

Pīnyīn disappears half-way through the dialogues and also half way through the grammar. This is not consistent, and also makes that part of the lesson useless for anyone who cannot read Chinese characters.</text>

This is the traditional Lippischer '''Pickert''', a type of [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] dish somewhere between a [[Cookbook:Dumpling|dumpling]] and a [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]].

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] (5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:L|litre]] (4 cups) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*10 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*6 big [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], grated
*1 cube [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (about 16 g or 0.6 oz dried yeast)
*500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying

==Yield==

10-15 pickerts - enough for four to five people.

==Procedure==

#Put the yeast in a very big pot. Mix it with hand warm milk and with the grated potatoes. Put all the flour into the pot and the eggs too. Finally add salt and sugar. Now stir it until it is a homogenous mass. It should be neither runny nor solid, but have a consistency like soft cookie dough; add milk or flour to adjust. Let sit for 30 minutes.
#Put palm-sized amounts into a frying pan and fry them on low heat with lots of oil. 
#Serve it with [[Cookbook:Liver|liver]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] (Leberwurst), syrup, [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]] [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or a small chunk of butter. After a few Pickerts you will get desire for another special pleasure from Lippe: a glass of Wacholder schnapps.

==Variants==
To make a ''pfannenpickert'', add half a handful of raisins to the dough and fry a larger amount of dough (approx. 15 centimeters across). A single pfannenpickert is often enough for one person.

Computer languages come in many flavors.  Generally there are high-level and low-level languages.  The term &quot;language level&quot; is an attempt to convey information about how close the programming language is to the machine language of the particular hardware.  Low-level languages are closer to the machine language, and high-level languages are further away from machine language, and close to natural languages (e.g., English).

An extreme example of a low-level language is the machine language which consists of ones and zeros.  It is extremely rare (difficult, and error prone), however, for people to write programs in machine language.  The closest programming language to machine language is assembly language, which normally has one instruction, or statement, for each machine language instruction.  An example of the kind of instruction that exists in assembly language is to copy the contents of a particular memory address into a machine register.

One example of a high-level computer language might be [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic|Visual Basic/VB6]], where the language is programmed by the user with specific words which can be found in the English dictionary.

Any language (computer or natural) still must have certain structures, though. English sentences are made of English words which are combined to respect the grammar (i.e., the structure) of English. We understand a sentence if the grammar is (more or less) correct. However, just because a high-level language uses some words which seem to be natural English does not mean that the computer can directly understand English sentences as we would speak them to a person.  A program must be written to respect the structure (grammar) of the computer language used, if the computer is to understand. Typically the grammar of a computer language is more rigid than the grammar of a natural language.

[[Image:NCI cream cheese bagel.jpg|thumb|A bagel with cream cheese, a light breakfast meal in some parts of North America.]]

'''Breakfast''' is the first meal of the day, eaten in the morning to ''break'' the ''fasting'' period of sleep. Breakfast traditions vary greatly around the world, from the minimal [[Cookbook:Café au lait|Café au lait]] of France to the hearty spreads to the substantial [[Cookbook:English Breakfast|English Breakfast]]. A breakfast should provide enough energy to realize the daily activity until noon or lunch but it should also be light enough as to be easy to digest.

==Ingredients==
*4 slices [[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|Eggs]]
*2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]]
*1 Tbsp. chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*[[Cookbook:pepper|Black pepper]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]], melted
*1 Tbsp. cold [[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*2-3 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemon]] juice
*[[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|Cayenne pepper]]
*crusty [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]

==Procedure==

===Eggs===

#Separate eggs. Mix whites with milk and parsley, then add salt and pepper. Beat with a fork until slightly bubbly. Set aside.
#Cook bacon on medium-high heat in a large, nonstick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] and set on paper towels or napkins to drain. Pour off all but 1-2 tablespoons fat. Turn heat down to medium-low and add egg whites.

===Hollandaise sauce===

#As egg whites cook, mix egg yolks with water in [[Cookbook:Double boiler|double boiler]] on medium to medium-high heat. Water should simmer, not boil. Stir constantly with a fork until yolks increase in size and thickness and turn a pale, opaque yellow. Remove from heat and slowly stir in melted butter. Then add lemon juice and salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
#Place cooked egg whites on a plate, top with bacon, then cover with Hollandaise sauce. Serve with warm crusty bread for dipping in the sauce.

Serves 1 for a full meal or 2 for a light breakfast.

Notes: 
The amount of butter in this recipe is less than in standard recipes for Hollandaise sauce. This is the smallest amount that still produces an acceptable sauce. If fat is not a concern, however, increase the amount to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.

Egg whites usually cook in the same amount of time as the sauce, but keep an eye on them and remove them to a separate plate if they finish cooking before the sauce is done.

The Sunglow Motel-Cafe in Bicknell, Utah serves the unique '''Pickle Pie''', developed by Cula Ekker.

This is their recipe, as it appeared in a ''Salt Lake Tribune'' article that is framed and hangs on the cafe's wall.

==Ingredients==
*5 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1 tsp. lemon extract
*2 tbsp. cornstarch
*1 cup + 2 tbsp. light cream
*1/8 cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], melted
*12 oz. sweet pickles, drained and ground
*2 unbaked 9-inch pie shells

==Procedure==
#Beat eggs and sugar until lemon colored and thick; beat in cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon extract, cornstarch, cream and margarine. 
#Stir ground sweet pickles into mixture.
#Pour pickle mixture into unbaked pie shell. 
#Bake at 350 degrees for one hour to one hour and 15 minutes, until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.

Makes two pies.

==Notes==
''Note: Although the recipe says to bake for one hour to one hour and 15 minutes, I'd suggest checking it earlier (perhaps at 45 minutes) just to be safe, because when I tested it at one hour the pies I made were already clearly past done.'' -- [[w:User:RTC|RTC]] 15:22 Nov 14, 2002 (UTC)

''Note: I found by accident that increasing the pickles from 12 oz. to about 17 oz. introduces a distinct &quot;fruity&quot; flavor that the original recipe does not have. Both versions are very good, in my opinion!'' -- [[w:User:RTC|RTC]] 19:04 Nov 17, 2002 (UTC)

'''Potato Salad''' is able to trace its origins to Germany before the turn of the 17th century, where it first became popular to use vinegar and spices on the potato as side to a meal.  The salad has a bite to it and is served warm as often as not.

__NOTOC__
A traditional '''Pound Cake''' recipe would specify one pound each of the following ingredients.  These quantities are too great for most modern families, but an excellent cake can be made with half quantities.  It is usual to weigh the eggs first and then use the same weights of the other ingredients; with a traditional pair of kitchen scales, the eggs are simply used instead of weights.

==Ingredients==
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (4 eggs)
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
*&amp;frac12; pound assorted dried fruit ([[Cookbook:Currant|currants]], [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultanas]], and [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], with perhaps a lesser quantity of [[Cookbook:Glacé cherry|glacé]] [maraschino] cherries).
&amp;frac12; pound is equal to 227 grams. Needless to say, in this recipe, 250 grams of each ingredient could be used.

==Procedure==
#Cream the butter and sugar together until fluffy. 
#Beat in the eggs. 
#Gradually sift in the dry ingredients. 
#Transfer to a greased and floured baking pan. 
#Bake at 175 °C (350 °F), until a skewer inserted shows no moist crumbs when removed.

==Variations==

===Lemon Pound Cake===

====Ingredients====
Cake:
*16 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon, softened, for greasing pan
*1.5 cups cake flour, plus 1 tablespoon for dusting pan
*1 teaspoon baking powder
*0.5 teaspoon salt
*1.25 cups sugar
*2 tablespoons grated zest from 2 medium lemons
*2 teaspoons juice from same 2 lemons
*4 large eggs
*1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract

Lemon glaze (optional:)
*0.5 cup sugar
*0.25 cup juice from 1 or 2 medium lemons

====Procedure====
Cake:
#Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Grease 1 9 by 5 inch Pyrex™ loaf pan with 1 tablespoon softened butter; dust with 1 tablespoon cake flour, tapping out excess.  In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
#In glass measuring cup or microwave-safe bowl, microwave butter, covered with plastic wrap, 1 to 2 minutes or until melted.  Whisk melted butter thoroughly.
#In food processor, pulse sugar and lemon zest until combined.  Add lemon juice, eggs, and vanilla; process until combined.  With processor running, drizzle melted butter through feed tube.  Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Sift flour mixture over eggs in three steps, gently whisking after each addition.
#Pour batter into prepared pan and bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and continue to bake until deep golden brown and skewer inserted in center comes out clean (about 35 minutes,) rotating pan halfway through baking time.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn cake onto wire rack, poke on top and sides with a toothpick or skewer, and brush on lemon glaze (see below.)  Cool to room temperature (at least 1 hour.)  Once cooled, cake can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 5 days.

Lemon glaze:

While cake is cooling, bring sugar and lemon juice to boil in small nonreactive saucepan, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes.  Brush glaze onto cake.

===Lemon-Poppy seed Pound Cake===
Follow recipe for Lemon Pound Cake through step 1.  Toss 1 tablespoon flour mixture with 0.66 cup poppy seeds in small bowl; set aside.  Continue with recipe from step 2, folding poppy seed mixture into batter after flour is incorporated.

== Better recipe ==

I have found a new and supposedly better recipe for lemon pound cake in an old issue of ''Cook's'' magazine, along with a lemon glaze and a lemon-poppyseed variation.  The same magazine claims that the classic recipe (shown here) was recieved poorly by tasters, saying that &quot;the texture was described as 'leaden' and the taste resembled 'an underbaked sugar cookie.'&quot;  Should it replace the current recipe and be cited? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] ([[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|talk]]) 16:55, 30 December 2010 (UTC)

{{recipesummary|turkey recipes|6-12|4 hours|4|Image=[[Image:Oven roasted brine-soaked turkey.jpg|350px]]}}

This recipe is for a 16-18 pound turkey. Roughly 2 days are required to prepare the turkey. The first day is for preparations and for brining, and the second day is for cooking the turkey.

==Ingredients==
* 8.5-14 pound [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]
* 2 Tbs. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter to coat skin of turkey
* 1/2 gallon of water
** 2 cups salt
** 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
** 2 Tbs. peppercorns 
* 2 gallons of ice water (50% ice)

==Brining==
#In 1/2 gallon of water, combine the salt and brown sugar for the brine and bring to a boil for about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and add to 5 gallon bucket.
#Add the remaining ice water.
#Remove neck and giblets from turkey and put in 5 gallon bucket. If brine won't cover turkey add a little more water. 
#Put bucket in a cold area for 6 to 24 hours.

==Roasting Procedure==
The tricky thing about cooking poultry is that the dark meat needs to be about 15 degrees hotter than the white meat. White meat is safe to eat at 165°F (73.9°C), which is the temperature at which salmonella instantly dies. (Though 12 minutes at 140°F (60°C) will kill it as well, so odds are fairly good that, for a roast, you'll kill it all on the way to 165°F (73.9°C)) The problem is that dark meat isn't very good at 165°F (73.9°C). Further complicating this is that if the breast meat gets to the 180°F (82.2°C) that the dark meat wants to be cooked to, it's going to be dry, flavorless, and generally unpleasant.

The white meat parts of the turkey are the breasts and wings. The dark meat are the thighs and drumsticks. Now, the wings and drumsticks are going to cook a bit faster than the bits of meat that are better attached to the bird. That said, you want the drumsticks cooked more, so don't worry so much about them. The wings, however, are probably worth attaching more firmly to the bird. You can do this by imagining you were twisting someone's arm behind their back.  Do this with both wings.  Once you figure out the right twist, you'll find that the tips of the wings will stay firmly in place near the center of the back of the turkey (near its backbone).


Next:
#Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). (You'll drop the temperature later, but start it hot to get a crispier, more flavorful skin. The effect will be to keep the fat from melting and rolling down the side of the turkey, which is only going to dry it out.) Roast at lowest level of the oven.
#Place the turkey drumstick side down on a roasting tray (with slots to allow drippings through into a pan), or on a rack sitting in a pan.  You will need a basting tool to get the drippings from this pan throughout the roasting process.
#Place the turkey in the oven.
#After about 30 minutes, drop the heat to 350 °F (176.7°C), remove from oven and put a tent of aluminum foil loosely over the breast of the turkey. This is going to keep the breast meat from overcooking and drying out.
#For optimum safety and uniform doneness, it is recommended to cook stuffing outside the bird. #The internal temperature should be checked with a food thermometer and the breast must reach a minimum of 161 °F (71.67°C) before removing it from the oven. The thigh, ideally, will be around 180°F (82.2°C) at this point.  It should take about 2 3/4 to 3 hours to reach this temperature, a 14-16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2hours of roasting. 
#Let the bird stand 15-20 minutes before carving.

==Alternate Recipe==
America's Test Kitchen also had a similar recipe on their show called &quot;The Perfect Roast Turkey&quot;.

===Ingredients===
*4 cups kosher salt or 2 cups table salt
*1 turkey (12 to 14 pounds gross weight), rinsed thoroughly; giblets, neck, and tailpiece removed and reserved to make gravy
*3 medium onions, chopped coarse
*1 1/2 medium carrots, chopped coarse
*1 1/2 celery stalks, chopped coarse
*6 thyme sprigs
*3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

===Instructions===
# Dissolve salt in 2 gallons of cold water in large stockpot or clean bucket. Add turkey and refrigerate or set in very cool (40 degrees or less (4.4°C)) spot for 4 to 6 hours.
# Remove turkey from salt water and rinse both cavities and skin under cool running water for several minutes until all traces of salt are gone. Pat dry inside and out with paper towels. Place turkey on meat rack set over rimmed sheet pan. Place turkey in refrigerator, uncovered, and air-dry for at least 8 hours or overnight.
# Adjust oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 400 degrees (204.4°C). Toss one-third of onion, carrot, celery, and thyme with 1 tablespoon of melted butter and place this mixture in body cavity. Bring turkey legs together and perform a simple truss.
# Scatter remaining vegetables and thyme over a shallow roasting pan. Pour 1 cup water over vegetables. Set V-rack in pan. Brush entire breast side of turkey with half of remaining butter, then place turkey, breast side down, on V-rack. Brush entire backside of turkey with remaining butter.
# Roast for 45 minutes. Remove pan from oven (close oven door); baste with juices from pan. With wad of paper toweling in each hand, turn turkey, leg/thigh side up. If liquid in pan has totally evaporated, add another 1/2 cup water. Return turkey to oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven again, baste, and again use paper toweling to turn other leg/thigh side up; roast for another 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven for final time, baste, and turn it breast side up; roast until breast registers about 165 degrees (73.9°C) and thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees (76.7°C to 79.4°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove turkey from pan and let rest until ready to carve. Serve with gravy.

'''S'mores''' are a traditional American campfire treat, prepared over an open fire or even in your own home.

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Marshmallow|marshmallows]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|graham crackers]] (4&quot; x 2&quot; - 10cm x 5cm)
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (55g) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] bar

Makes 4 single serving s'mores

==Procedure==
#Build a [[Do-It-Yourself/Campfire|campfire]] for [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasting]] the marshmallows.  
#A long thin stick from the woods is hard to find (a thin, long wooden dowel may be a good substitute but will catch fire easily). The stick, which is usually taken from the ground as part of a dead tree branch, does not have to be sterilized, but simply clear of any dirt. Alternately, you may purchase a metal roaster stick. Don't use a coat hanger or chrome or galvanized metal (like fence wire).  Use stainless steel. 
#Before roasting the marshmallows, one must prepare the pieces of graham cracker, and a layer of chocolate.  Break the crackers in half, so you have 2 2&quot;x2&quot; (5cm x 5cm) squares for each s'more.  Break the chocolate bar into 1/2 oz (15g) pieces.
#Push a marshmallow on to the end of the stick. Using the stick to place the marshmallow directly above the flame or source of heat, toast the marshmallow until it is golden brown around the outside. Some prefer their marshmallow burned.  Others like to burn the marshmallow and peel off the burned outer skin to get to the gooey center.
#Place the toasted marshmallow in between two pieces of graham cracker, with a layer of chocolate bar in between.  The marshmallow should be hot enough to melt the chocolate.  In a family setting, sometimes it is helpful for children to roast the marshmallows, and adults to supervise and assemble the s'more while preventing the child from touching the hot end of the stick.  Enjoy!

If you are not camping, patio/backyard firepits work great.  Here is a way to do it indoors in your own home:

#Prepare the pieces of graham cracker, and a layer of chocolate.  Break the crackers in half, so you have 2 2&quot;x2&quot; (5cm x 5cm) squares for each s'more.  Break the chocolate bar into 1/2 oz (15g) pieces.
#Place the chocolate on one of the pieces of graham cracker, and then place a marshmallow on top.
#Put it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds (depending on the microwave).
#After it has been microwaved, the marshmallow should be much bigger, fluffier, and molten, and the chocolate should be semi-melted. Place the other half of the graham cracker on top of the marshmallow and squish it down.  Enjoy!

==Variations==

70 variations on the basic s'more recipe were published in 2007 in [http://www.smoresbook.com S'mores: Gourmet Treats for Every Occasion] by Lisa Adams. Recipes include:

===The Patriot===

*Milk chocolate
*1 graham cracker, broken in half
*Fresh blueberries
*1 marshmallow
*1 thick strawberry slice

Arrange the chocolate on half of the graham cracker. Set blueberries atop chocolate and melt, being careful not to lose the blueberries in transport. Roast the marshmallow. Once chocolate has melted, remove graham cracker from heat and lightly press blueberries to secure them in place. Top with the strawberry slice, roasted marshmallow, and remaining graham cracker. 

===Minty Brownie===

*1 marshmallow
*A handful of Junior Mints
*2 brownie squares 

Roast the marshmallow. If desired, melt chocolates on the brownie bottom. Once the chocolates have melted, remove brownie from heat. Add roasted marshmallow and top with remaining brownie square.

===Tracey’s Caramel Apple===

*1 marshmallow
*2 chewy caramels
*2 green apple slices, about 1/2 inch thick

Skewer the marshmallow, then the two caramels, on the same roasting stick. Roast the marshmallow and caramels. When the caramels have melted over the top of the marshmallow, and the marshmallow is cooked to your liking, slide the concoction onto one of the apple slices. Top with remaining apple slice. 

===Belgian s'more===

*1 set of s'more ingredients (can be any recipe, but usually the standard one)
*2 red and/or black licorice

Prepare the s'mores as usual, then at the end insert either a strip of red or black licorice (or both.)

*2 Slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]] (preferably [[Cookbook:Organic|organic]] [[Cookbook:Wholemeal|wholemeal]] bread)
*Sliced [[Cookbook:Vegetable|Vegetable]]s (e.g.- [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Mushroom]]s, [[Cookbook:Courgette|Courgette]]s, [[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Capsicum|Peppers]], etc.)
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive oil|Olive oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Oregano|Oregano]]

==Procedure==
#Place two slices of bread next to each other on a baking tray.
#Arrange the vegetables evenly across both slices.
#Drizzle the olive oil over the vegetables, and add liberal sprinklings of oregano.
#Grill on medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes, or until golden brown.

Serve open, or carefully combine the two parts of the sandwich for the ultimate eating pleasure.

Does anyone else think that this is a little harsh when it talks about the mentally ill?  It seems as though it clumps every mental disorder together and considers the brain unstable for anything.  Is how lucid dreaming affects them proven, or is it just a guess by the authors? Or is this a general consensus among the lucid sleepers? --[[User:Emlnxrz|Emlnxrz]] 15:30, 18 June 2004 (UTC)

Are they &quot;levels&quot; of sleep or &quot;stages&quot;.  Or aren't these actually used synonymously?  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 04:53, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Synonymous. I will change all uses to levels because they are usually called levels 1 to 4. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 05:02, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)

&quot;We awake quite often throughout the night, but if it is for less than 3 minutes it is usually forgotten by the time we wake up.&quot;
:Really?

::[http://www.here-be-dreams.com/sleep/stages.html source]. Now that I look at it, it seems it only happens after some REM and not after every REM. I'll try to clarify... it's only quasi-awake (or pseudo-awake ;) ) anyway, you get hypnagogic/hypnapompic imagery which probably goes along the same lines as the dream.

:::Why can't I seem to remember hypnagogic/hypnapompic imagery?

::::I have found that it slips away as I get out of bed in the morning. Can't you remember that you have wierd thoughts, illogical, irrational etc. when you are still drowsy in bed? That is hypnagogic/hypnapompic imagery. Also voices and any other vivid odd feelings (such as falling).

The &quot;I can't control my dreams&quot; section is badly written in my opinion. I can't do it better myself, so I just complain here instead. It's not clear if it refers to lucid dreams or not (this is an introduction, most people probably haven't much lucid dream experience yet). Further, I would say there are many levels of lucidity. You might vaguely know that you are dreaming without being able to control the dream, ''especially in the beginning''. Control is something you practice. Moreover, the connection between the Mother Theresa section is quite week. What is it really about?

: I'm glad you realise that you're able to correct it :). I was not referring to lucid dreams, but more the feeling of &quot;watching&quot; a dream and not &quot;acting&quot; in it. There certainly are different levels of lucidity, and lucidity in lucid dreams should generally increase with practice. Now that I look at the second paragraph of that question, I have no clue why I put that in. I'll take it out soon if I don't remember, or link it in more fully if I do. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:43, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I believe the whole introduction feels more like a &quot;Lucid dreaming FAQ&quot;. It answer questions newbie lucid dreamers might have rather than introducing the reader to the subject.

: It seems to me to get the content through. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:43, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

====Dissociation====

What do you think about the addition I made to the Dissociation section (things you should NOT be experiencing)? It does seem a bit scary to me, is it worth including at all?

[[User:Kaycee|KC]] 23:08, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)


Yes, it does seem a bit scary -- just about everything in that list has happened to me at one time or another in real life.
&quot;''Finding oneself in a place but unaware of how one got there''&quot; ?
I thought this happened to just about everyone the first few times they wake up in an unfamiliar place.
I remember that happened when I woke up after the first time I spent the night at Grandmom's house.

Perhaps we should move the Dissociation section to a completely different page and merely link to it.
Would [[wikipedia:dissociation]] be appropriate ?

Hello from a wikinewbie! I have had many LD's and would like to offer a few comments, I have chosen to put them all here until I have more time, and hopefully sources other than my (and friends') experiences. Also please inform if I am breaking with convention in this post. 

RE: &quot;signs you weren't&quot;...Entering a dream within a dream is a technique for better lucidity, also some of the most profound are when one already lucid enters another realm, often experienced as going to sleep when you already know you are dreaming. (one ref. would be works by Dr. Alberto Villoldo)

RE: Dissociation: I think it is scary, and maybe misleading. I think it's a great idea to have some mention here, but perhaps it could be shortened and refer to some authority on dissociative behavior. (If community thinks it's important enough to mention, then it's too important for us nonpsychology experts to advise much)
:also on this topic, I feel that some of these things are common (if very brief), and may be a sign of personal progress. e.g. ability to see oneself as other can be healthy analization. I hate to over discourage folks on a good path, so while I'm not able to do better with this page, it strikes me as analogous to quitting playing an instrument if you suddenly play a song very well, or improvise music that is better than you thought yourself capable of.
I would appreciate knowing if I should post differently.
Would it be helpful to this book to find links to forums, or maybe start a &quot;recomended reading list&quot; [[User:GreenTwin|GreenTwin]] 18:36, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: Hello to you! There is no convention you should follow in the talk pages. If you'de like to contribute to the main book though, check [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming]] first for a few basic guidelines.

: Dreams within dreams: I've never heard of that and can't think why it would work (beyond the placebo effect). Besides, that's a different case. That's somebody who ''knows'' about lucid dreams who then becomes lucid and uses that technique in order to gain better lucidity. The fact is, generally people who enter a lucid dream from within a dream aren't really lucid, they're only dreaming that they are.

: Community no more. I don't have an opinion on the dissociation section because I don't understand it.

: (Why did you indent that twice?) What do you mean by &quot;ability to see oneself as other&quot;? What do you mean by things being brief? What is &quot;healthy analization&quot;? Sorry, I don't understand you.

: There is already a &quot;recommended reading list&quot;. It's called &quot;Further Reading&quot; and it's on the nav:
{{LDTOC}}
: It includes links to forums and books. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:52, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

----

I'm a little concerned that the book presents 'symptoms' that only a few may have experienced  as concrete aspects of Lucid Dreaming. Most of the list of dissociations could possibly be explained by other psychological explanations and not related to Lucid Dreaming, and yet here they are being listed as factual symptoms.

It might be better to have this introduced as things that some people have experienced whilst attempted to experience Lucid Dreaming'.

====Spinning?====

&quot;Attempting to spin&quot; - what does it mean? If it means literally spin, what is so special about it? And if you use a different meaning, please elaborate.

:Anything that gives your senses input from the dream world is fine. Spinning is a good way to &quot;lock&quot; yourself more into the dream consciousness, by asking your brain to generate more substance to the dream. Another way is to focus on dream visuals to make them more stable. Am I making any sense? [[User:Kaycee|KC]] 22:03, 18 May 2004 (UTC)

:Yes, it means literally spin. It's the sort of thing which somebody who knows about lucid dreaming would do. It's the sort of thing I do in a lucid dream, because it prolongs my dreams (see [[LD Using]] and the above post) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 06:21, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

== Reasons to pursue lucid dreaming ==

Thanks for all the work you have put into this wikibook.  When I came upon this subject initially, I had one central question on my mind.  Namely, is lucid dreaming a fruitful pursuit, or merely a frivolous diversion from the transcendental purposes of life?  I decided to give lucid dreaming a try.  I got a notebook and began to record my dreams.  I began to ponder the matter of how I knew during waking moments that I was in the physical world.  I hydrated copiously before  retiring.  In the end I lost interest because I just couldn't convince myself there was transcendental purpose in lucid dreaming.  It would be a great contribution to this Wikibook to have a more fully developed section about the rationale for studying/pursuing lucid dreaming.  Does lucid dreaming enhance one's ability to understand and practice sacrificial love and to make the best use of one's time in this world?  How?  Why is it that the majority of discussion of lucid dreaming seems to be from a purposeless or frivolous perspective?  I think all this would make a very interesting addition to the Wikibook.  [[User:216.160.223.49|216.160.223.49]] 21:41, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Most people take it as a &quot;frivolous pursuit&quot;. However:
* Some people have said that meditating (or dreaming) within a dream has felt to them particularly deep, that they found it easier to relax, etc.
* You can try shared dreaming from it as well as attempt astral projection.
* Considering that (healthy people) spend about 1/3 of their time sleeping and 1/4 of their time dreaming, I would say that lucid dreaming aids effective use of time. You're using that remaining 1/12 of living life at not much cost to the rest of your time. As some people have reported solving problems in dreams, you might be able to solve some of your own. Also, your artistic side is probably more &quot;open&quot; - pasQuale dreamed up the two most recent designs of [http://ld4all.com LD4all.com].
: I would imagine that there is not much interest in lucid dreaming for spirituality because Stephen LaBerge, who proved lucid dreaming, did not publish any mention of it in his book. Therefore people went along the &quot;fun and silly&quot; route. However, I don't see why this should stop you from trying lucid dreaming, because it honestly is great fun and very satisfying when you become lucid. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:32, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC) PS You will get more replies by joining a forum or asking on alt.dreams.lucid. Check the &quot;further reading&quot; section.

== last section and hypnosis ==

I believe the last part is way off. Self hypnosis as I understand doesn't lead to any visual/etc experiences and can't really be compared with lucid dreaming. Apart from the fact that you are interacting with your subconscious on a different level.

: Well, it does say '''If'' you often enter a &quot;dream world&quot;' . . . but I see your point. I don't have any strong feelings about it either way; if you want to remove that part, go ahead. —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tharenthel|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Tharenthel|(Contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:07, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== False Awakenings ==

The section on false awakenings really needs improvement!  I don't understand what it is about.  Link it or expand it, something needs to be added. -- [[User:Phyzome|Phyzome]] 22:34, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

: I tried to clarify it some. It does still need some work, but it hopefully makes more sense now. —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tharenthel|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Tharenthel|(Contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I disagree with this system.  I much prefer the Book:Title system for naming articles.  There shouldn't be that many modules in a book that you'd need a 4X hierarchy. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 11:17, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)

== interwiki ==

Doesn't the : seperater create a problem for inter wiki? Lets say I write a book on wikipedia, the chapters would be called [[wikipedia:something]]. This goes to wikipedia article something insted of the chapter on something. With interwiki growing and the likelyhood of a wiki named the same as a book growing, this may be a bad practice.

Yes, good point.  I agree. [[User:dan_aka_jack|Dan_AKA_Jack]] 17:10, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:I agree. We should be using subpages, but they are not enabled on the main namespace. Please, read my opinion about this topic on [[m:Wikibooks should use subpages]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 13:26, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== subpages ==

Now we have subpages, I recommend using them. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:17, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Do we agree on using subpages? If yes, we could put the recommendation on the &quot;about&quot; page itself, placed prominently on top, instead of recommending it only on the &quot;talk&quot; page and listing it as one of many many options. Is there a clear community opinion about this point already? Most of the new books still use the &quot;booktitle:name&quot; convention. I guess newcomers would also be happy about a clear directive for the future. (That does not mean that all existing books should be converted, but some would benefit.)
: I would recomment:
:* Booktitle/chapterdescription
: that is, only one layer of subpages, and use the description of the content instead of the chapter number (which would make including new chapters hard)  --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 14:13, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: While I am in favor of Sub-Pages I may ask: Is there actualy a way of converting pages without leaving hundreds of move pages. i.E. [[:Category:Ada_programming_language|Ada]] has about 103 pages - I would not want to convert that by hand. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 16:06, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Would using subpages apply just to textbooks or to everything?  I wouldn't want to see [[Cookbook/Rice pudding]], for example, but [[Biology/Chapter 3]] is fine. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 16:25, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::I don't see any difference between the two, but I think that the first decission to take is wether to give a clear recommendation for new books to use subpages. I think we should. For current books, that is another issue, probably the best approach is to start promoting subpages and let the authors decide whether to change or maintain their current convention.   Only if the new convention is widely accepted then we can regard it as a new policy. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 00:09, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I still think that there may be more benefits to real namespaces for books.  Other wiki software packages provide namespace specific recent changes, searches, stylesheets, etc.  I can see a lot of benefits for each book operating as its own somewhat independent wiki.  The only benefit right now for subpages is the automatic linkback to the main page. I have no objection to them being used, but to suggest that all new pages and books be forced to use them is simply not a good idea. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:40, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: The mediawiki software currently only allows for 256 different namespaces (it is a TINYINT(2) variable in the SQL database), so the number of books getting the real benefit out of it would be comparatively small. I think, a mixed approach would be best: For the majority of small and medium-sized books subpages are the optimal thing to do, large projects, like &quot;Cookbook:&quot; or &quot;Programming:&quot; could have their own name-space if desired. Let us move the further discussion to [[Wikibooks:Hierachy_naming_scheme]].--[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 06:47, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Real-Namespaces  ==

Just a thought: while 256 Real-Namespaces are not enough for all the books - they would be enough for Bookshelfes.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 06:49, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

Adding a new namespace requires minor changes to the software, or at least done on a developer level (developers also tend to be very Wikipedia-centric, and thus developments that would greatly help Wikibooks, eg. a way in the software to tell what book a given module is a part of, are held on the back burner).  There was a large movement in the past of moving [[Cookbook]] and [[Programming]] (among others) to separate namespaces, but that idea largely died out - the idea however did transform into the &quot;:&quot; delimiter in [[WB:NC]].  As for bookshelves, part of the bookshelf overhaul was that they'd be moved under the Wikibooks namespace, to reserve the main module space for actual books.  The bookshelves merely serve as an informal way of organizing books that exist.  There are plans to have bookshelf management placed under the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], but this is a very new idea that is in serious need of discussion.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 08:04, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

: Using real namespaces would make it more difficult to move books between bookshelves, should the scope of those bookshelves evolve. The current POV in the CCO-project is to use Categories as much as possible. This way we can classify books not only by our bookshelves, but also by Dewey codes and Library of Congress codes (and anything else we might want to add in later). To change a book's classification would be a simple as changing a single parameter of a template to be included on the book's main page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:43, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== Template naming conventions ==

moved to [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy#Template naming conventions]]

== category guidelines ==

Are there any tips or guidelines for using category tags?
(A category tag starts with &quot;&lt;code&gt;[&lt;nowiki&gt;[Category:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, then the name of the tag, then ends with &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. When a reader clicks on the tag, wikibooks automagically makes a list of every module that includes that tag -- this is often much more convenient than manually creating and maintaining such a list.)

Such category guidelines would say something like

* make sure the category tag &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Programming]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is on the &quot;main module&quot; of a programming language book, but no other module of the book. For example, you would put it on &quot;[[C Programming]]&quot;, but not on &quot;[[C Programming/Control]]&quot;.
* Put the book-specific category tag on every module and template used in the book. For example, you would put the category tag &quot;&lt;code&gt;[[:Category:C Programming]]&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on both modules &quot;[[C Programming]]&quot; and &quot;[[C Programming/Control]]&quot;, but not on any modules in any other book.
* make sure the category tag &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Programming]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is on the book-specific category page. For example, you would put it on the &quot;&lt;code&gt;[[:Category:C Programming]]&lt;/code&gt;&quot; category page.
* It's fine to have a module or template have several different category tags. In particular, if a template is used in multiple books, put the book-specific category tag from each of those books on that template.

Is there a page for holding guidelines like this?

By the way, what is the difference between &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Programming]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Programming languages]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;?

: Hi David - you are so right (in my view) to bring this up.  It's one that has been lurking in my mind for a while now.  I see categories as very important and quite often badly handled.  That said you are posting this in quite a remote backwater of Wikibooks which will probably not be seen by many.  If you want to go to [[Category talk:Main page]] I promise I'll join it the conversation there (tho it will be tomorrow it being late in my timezone!).  Browsing [[:Category:Main page]] will give you some idea how good and bad things can be - personally the Wikijunior section is pretty good but the rest ...
: Hopefully see you there and get some discussion going about an important topic.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Ambersweet Oranges]]
An '''orange''' is a common [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. Oranges need not be orange in color; depending on climate and variety, an orange may have green patches when ripe. Some will even experience regreening, which is when an orange-colored orange loses its orange. To deal with this aesthetic problem, oranges are often dyed. Rough brownish patches are indications of abrasion against the tree, which does not affect taste.

The orange has a sweet-tart taste and is commonly peeled and eaten fresh, or squeezed for its juice. It has a thick bitter rind that is usually discarded, but can be used in cooking. The outermost layer of the rind can be scraped off to make [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]], having a similar flavor to the flesh. This is the part which contains orange oil. The white part of the rind is almost always discarded as it is extremely bitter, but it does contain lots of pectin. Orange peel can be made into [[Cookbook:Candied Peel|candied peel]] and used in sweet dishes.

==Varieties==

A number of varieties of orange are now cultivated widely. The '''sweet orange''' (''Citrus aurantium'') was first grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]], and has become the most popular variety. The sweet orange will grow to different sizes and colors due to local conditions, most commonly with ten ''carpels'' (slices) inside.

A single mutation in an orchard of sweet oranges planted at a monastery in 1820 in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Brazil|Brazil]] led to the '''navel orange''' (aka Washington, Riverside or Bahia navel). A single cutting of the original was then transplanted to [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] in 1870, creating a new market worldwide. The mutation caused a ''diploid'', or twin, fruit, with a smaller orange embedded in the outer fruit near the stem. From the outside the smaller, undeveloped, twin leaves a human navel-like formation at the top of the fruit. Navel oranges are almost always seedless, and tend to be larger than the sweet orange.

The Valencia or Murcia orange is one of the sweet oranges used for juice extraction.  It is a late-season fruit. It is a popular variety when navel oranges are out of season.

The blood orange (sometimes called &quot;ruby orange&quot; by the squeamish) has streaks of red in the fruit, and when squeezed the juice is often reddish. The mandarin is similar, but smaller and sweeter, and the scarlet navel is a variety with the same diploid mutation as the normal naval orange.

Bitter oranges are used in [[Cookbook:Marmalade|marmalade]] and as an ingredient in the liqueurs Triple sec and Curacao.

==Oranges in Cooking==

Orange juice is produced by [[Cookbook:Juicing|juicing]] oranges. Brazil is the world's largest producer of orange juice, followed by Florida. Orange juice is available in fresh-squeezed or 'reconstituted' forms, and in refrigerated or pasteurised long-life bottles. The heat-treated juice is made from whole crushed oranges, including the peel, giving it a much more bitter taste than fresh-squeezed.

In the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], orange juice is sometimes also sold in the form of frozen concentrate blocks, so a recipe may say 'one box or block frozen orange juice'. These are not available in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]] and some other countries. 

Oranges are not often used in savoury cooking, but they are an important flavouring ingredient of several recipes, including [[Cookbook:Orange Chicken|orange chicken]], and the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] dish [[Cookbook:Duck a l'Orange|duck a l'orange]]. Orange zest, candied peel and orange juice are frequently used in making cakes and sweets.

Orange blossom water is sometimes used as an alternative to [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]] in [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern cookery]], especially in sweet pastries and jams. 

Orange blossom [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] (really &quot;citrus honey&quot;) is produced by putting beehives in citrus groves during bloom, which also [[w:pollination|pollinates]] seeded citrus varieties. Orange blossom honey is highly prized, and has a distinct &quot;orangey&quot; flavor.

'''Fairy Cakes''' are the British term for what Americans call [[Cookbook:cupcakes|cupcakes]]. A common variant on fairy cakes is '''butterfly cakes''', where the top of the cake is cut out and shaped to look like butterfly wings.

==Ingredients== 
*125 grams [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]] 
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon extract|lemon extract]]

# Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla or lemon extract until creamy. 
# Beat in the eggs one at a time. 
# Fold in the sifted flour alternately with the milk. 
# Three-quarters fill 18 well-greased paper patty cases or well-greased muffin tins. 
# Bake at 180°C for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden. Cool on a cake rack. 
# If you want to make the '''fairy cakes''' into '''butterfly cakes''':

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''How to Find a Book''' depends on how much information you have about the book and whether you want to buy it or simply read it. 

== Acquiring information about the book ==

Normally, title and name of the author of a book is enough to locate more information about it. You can then use online bookstores or online library catalogs to identify publisher, publication date, edition and [[w:ISBN|ISBN]]; these items are sometimes required by libraries or bookstores to order the book.

Occasionally, the author's name is misspelled, especially with foreign authors. In this case try searching for the title alone, until you find the proper spelling of the name.

'''If you only have the book's ISBN, you should be aware of the fact that different editions as well as hardcover and soft-cover versions of a book have different ISBNs.''' It is possible that the version of the book with your ISBN is already out of print, while another version is still available. It is therefore best to use an online service to get the author and title information, and then proceed with that information.

Locating a book is much more difficult if you want to educate yourself about a topic but don't have a particular author or title in mind. Library shelves are organized by subject; learn the system used by your library, go to the relevant shelve and browse the books about your topic. Some of this can also be done online: library catalogs allow subject and keyword searches and the Library of Congress permits browsing by call number, which can often locate closely related materials. For an effective subject search, you need to know which subject words are being used; this is contained in the &quot;Library of Congress Subject Headings&quot;, a red five-volume work that many libraries have but can not be found online (most library subjects can be searched and browsed on [http://isbndb.com/d/subject/ ISBNdb.com's subject search]).

Most topics have one or two &quot;standard references&quot;, the generally acknowledged best treatments of the subject. To find these, you need to talk to a specialist in the field. A [[Usenet]] posting to a relevant newsgroup, asking about good books, also often yields excellent results. Closely reading the user-supplied book reviews on amazon.com will also often point you to standard references: they are often only identified by author and everyone seems to know them.

== Acquiring the book ==

You have to decide whether you want to buy the book or just read it. If you want to buy it, you have to decide whether to buy it new or used (the only option if no version of it is in print, unless you can find a new after-market copy or a [[w:Remaindered book|remaindered book]]). 

To buy used books, you can try a local used book store. These can also often help you buy books that they don't have. You may also go to a professional book finder with connections in the used-book markets. These used-book markets are now open to everyone with a web browser and a credit or debit card, and books can also be found via auction websites.  The three best sites for used-books, which between them cover countless thousands of sellers are: [[w:Abebooks|Abebooks]], [[w:eBay|eBay]] and [[w:Amazon.com|Amazon]] (on an Amazon book entry look for the link to &quot;new and used books&quot;, which takes one to many sellers of used books).

A book in print can be ordered at any bookstore and can also be ordered online; several price comparison services exist. By ordering online, you typically save sales tax but you have to pay shipping and handling costs.

Depending on what you need, you may be able to find a book at a public library or a good local college or university library. These can be used by non-students for free or for a small fee. 

If your reading interest is general, or if you want to read a popular novel, a public library is the place to go.  Membership is usually free.  If you cannot find the book on your own, you should visit an information desk because many libraries offer the ability to place &quot;holds&quot; on materials so you can get them when you return. 

At college and university libraries, Research librarians can help you locate books and journal articles of academic interest quickly. On campus, you can often use expensive databases such as [[w:LexisNexis|LexisNexis]] for free. Libraries are connected by an Inter Library Loan network: if the book exists, and is held by a library willing to loan it, you will have it in as little as a week or so.

Most libraries also offer an Inter-library loan service.  This means that items that do not appear in their catalog can be requested from libraries elsewhere.   Depending on the library and how far the book has to travel, there may be charges for this service.

Libraries use [[w:WorldCat|WorldCat]] at [[w:OCLC|OCLC]] in order to find books at other libraries. It is by far the most extensive database of library holdings. Some libraries allow access by their patrons; ask your librarian how to access WorldCat. Unsuccessful ABEbooks searches are directed to WorldCat as unsuccessful WorldCat searches are to ABEbooks. WorldCat attempts to restrict use of its data but such terms are not legally valid under US copyright law, since only the specific and creative original expression, if any, can be protected by copyright and the right to use public domain works cannot be restricted by contract (see [[w:Feist v. Rural|Feist v. Rural]] and [[w:Assessment Technologies v. WIREdata|Assessment Technologies v. WIREdata]])
*&quot;WorldCat® records, metadata and holdings information (&quot;Data&quot;) may only be used by Users (individuals accessing WorldCat via OCLC Web interfaces) solely for the personal, non-commercial purpose of assisting such Users with locating an item in a library of the User's choosing.

Hallole, ich habe mir gerade diesen Deutschkurs durchgeschaut und der erste Eindruck ist recht vielversprechend. Bei dieser Lektion bin ich aber über einen Satz gestolpert: 

&quot;Die Tour de France ist das bei weitem berühmteste der Welt und eines der wichtigsten sportlichen Großereignisse überhaupt.&quot;

Ich hatte die Grammatik dieses Satzes erst beim dritten Lesen verstanden (und das obwohl deutsch meine Muttersprache ist) imho ist dieser Satz für einen Ausländer, der deutsch lernen will nicht geeignet. 
Ein Freund von mir hält es sogar für gramatikalisch falsch. Eine bessere Formulierung (die dann halt nicht mehr aus der Wikipedia stammt; aber da kann man es ja auch ändern) wäre: &quot;Die Tour de France ist das bei weitem berühmteste sportliche Großereignis der Welt und eines der wichtigsten überhaupt.&quot;

Mit den Lektionsnummern ist hier übrigens auch noch was nicht korrekt. --[[User:Berni|berni]] 13:45, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:No time to fully respond right now, except to point out that this Lesson is supposed to be an advanced lesson, presently being stored here. You are correct, it is too difficult for the basic lessons, but may be appropriate for the Advanced Lesson, if not here, the further on.

=== Chemistry is Everywhere ===

[[Image:VysokePece1.jpg|thumb|150px|Chemistry: the study of the properties, composition, and transformation of matter.]]

The modern human experience places a large emphasis upon the material world. From the day of our birth to the day we die, we are frequently preoccupied with the world around us.  Whether struggling to feed ourselves, occupying ourselves with modern inventions, interacting with other people or animals, or simply meditating on the air we breathe, our attention is focused on different aspects of the material world.  In fact only a handful of disciplines—certain subsets of religion, philosophy, and abstract math—can be considered completely unrelated to the material world. Everything else is somehow related to '''chemistry''', the scientific discipline which studies the properties, composition, and transformation of matter.

=== Branches of Chemistry ===

Chemistry itself has a number of branches:

*''Analytical chemistry'' seeks to determine the composition of substances.
*''Biochemistry'' is the study of chemicals found in living things (such as DNA and proteins).
*''Inorganic Chemistry'' studies substances that do not contain carbon.
*''Organic chemistry'' studies carbon-based substances. Carbon, as described in more detail in this book, has unique properties that allow it to make complex chemicals, including those of living organisms. An entire field of chemistry is devoted to substances with this element.
*''Physical chemistry'' is the study of the ''physical properties'' of chemicals, which are characteristics that can be measured without changing the composition of the substance.

[[Image:Sodium_chloride_crystal.png|thumb|left|200px|This is the structure of table salt, or ''sodium chloride''.]]

Chemistry as a discipline is based on a number of other fields. Because it is a measurement-based science, math plays an important role in its study and usage. A proficiency in high-school level algebra should be all that is needed in this text, and can be obtained from a number of [[Algebra|sources]]. Chemistry itself is determined by the rules and principles of [[Physics Study Guide|physics]].  Basic principles from physics may be introduced in this text when necessary.

=== Why Study Chemistry? ===

There are many reasons to study chemistry. It is one pillar of the natural sciences necessary for detailed studies in the physical sciences or engineering. The principles of biology and psychology are rooted in the biochemistry of the animal world, in ways that are only now beginning to be understood. Modern medicine is firmly rooted in the chemical nature of the human body. Even students without long term aspirations in science find beauty in the infinite possibilities that originate from the small set of rules found in chemistry.

Chemistry has the power to explain everything in this world, from the ordinary to the bizarre.  Why does iron rust?  What makes propane such an efficient, clean burning fuel?  How can soot and diamond be so different in appearance, yet so similar chemically?  Chemistry has the answer to these questions, and so many more.  Understanding chemistry is the key to understanding the world as we know it.

=== This Book: General Chemistry ===

An introduction to the chemical world is set forth in this text.  The units of study are organized as follows.

[[Image:Chemicals_in_flasks.jpg|thumb|150px]]

# '''Properties of Matter''': An explanation of the most fundamental concept in chemistry: ''matter''.
# '''Atomic Structure''': While technically in the domain of physics, ''atoms'' determine the behavior of matter, making them a necessary starting point for any discussion of chemistry.
# '''Compounds and Bonding''': Chemical ''bonding'' is introduced, which explains how less than one hundred naturally-occurring elements can combine to form all the different compounds that fill our world.
# '''Chemical Reactions''': Things get interesting once chemical ''reactions'' start making and breaking bonds.
# '''Aqueous Solutions''': Substances ''dissolved'' in water have special properties.  This is when ''acids and bases'' are introduced.
# '''Phases of Matter''': A detailed look at the ''organization of substances'', with particular focus on ''gases''.
# '''Chemical Equilibria''': Chemical reactions don't go on forever.  ''Equilibrium'' is the balance that reactions seek to achieve.
# '''Chemical Kinetics''': ''Kinetics'' explain why it takes years for an iron nail to rust, but only a split second for a hydrogen-filled hot air balloon to explode.
# '''Thermodynamics''': Two things decide which reactions can occur and which reactions cannot: heat and chaos.  Or ''enthalpy and entropy'', as they are called in thermodynamics
# '''Chemistries of Various Elements''':  An exploration of the ''elements'' that make up all substance.  Includes an introduction to ''nuclear chemistry'' and carbon, the essence of ''organic chemistry''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The MIPS microprocessor paradigm was created in 1981 from work done by J. L. Hennessy at Stanford University. Since that time, the MIPS paradigm has been so influential that nearly every modern-day processor family makes some use of the concepts derived from that original research. This book will discuss the MIPS architecture and (perhaps more importantly) MIPS assembly programming.

[[Image:ChessSet.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Some chess pieces: (from left to right) a white king, a black rook, a black queen, a white pawn, a black knight, and a white bishop]]Chess is an ancient strategy game that originated in India.  It is played by two individuals on an 8×8 grid. The objective is to maneuver one's pieces so as to trap the opposing king in &quot;checkmate&quot;. This book will cover the basic pieces of chess, before going on to some more advanced topics. 

The history of chess began in India during the Gupta Empire, where its early form in the 6th century was known as ''chaturanga'', which translates as &quot;four divisions of the military&quot; – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.  

In Sassanid Persia around 600, the name became ''shatranj'', and the rules were developed further.  Shatranj was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names.  In Spanish, &quot;shatranj&quot; was rendered as ''ajedrez'', in Portuguese as ''xadrez'', and in Greek as ''zatrikion'', but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian ''shāh'' (&quot;king&quot;).

A small tip, if you want to have an automatic signature, you can just type &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and it will come out like below. Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:50, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Re [[Chess]] - please stick with &quot;N&quot; for the knight - this is more standard notation. Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:45, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Hi WarrenWilkinson! Hope you enjoy yourself, let me know if you have any questions or think that I could help you with anything. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== [[Electrical Engineering, Basic signals]] ==

I have proposed a merge between your book at [[Electrical Engineering, Basic signals]], and another book already on the EE bookshelf called [[Signals and Systems]]. The Signals and Systems book already has a nice page hierarchy, it has a few contributers, and it's covers alot of the same material. I would like to merge the two books soonish because i have lots of time on my hands for the next few days. If you disagree with the merge proposal in the near future, let me know. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:34, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Guitar ==

I was thinking we could do something with the Guitar page based on your idea.  I am still in school now, but it is second semester of my Senior year of high school, so I should have plenty of free time.  I posted something in the Guitar discussion page.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

'''ANZAC biscuits''' have long had an association with the Australia/New Zealand Army Corps ([[w:Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]]) troops sent to Gallipoli during WWI. The biscuit appears to be a variant of the Scottish oat cake, said to be from the Scottish-influenced city of Dunedin. The recipe was created to ensure the biscuits would keep well during naval transportation to loved ones who were fighting abroad.

==Ingredients==
* 2 cups plain (non-self raising) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup white or brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]] (cane syrup) or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 1 cup desiccated [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 2 tablespoons of water
* 2 cups rolled or instant [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]
* 225 grams [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

==Procedure==
#Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl, and melt the syrup and butter in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Add the baking soda and water to the syrup mix.
#Mix the wet and dry ingredients, adding water if necessary.
#Separate and roll the mixture into small balls, and flatten them on oven trays.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] at 150°C (300°F) for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.

The finished biscuits are quite chewy and crisp, and have a long shelf-life.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
{{Wikipedia|Anzac biscuit}}
* Using brown sugar instead of white sugar gives more colour and flavour
* You can replace coconut with more syrup and oats.
* Don't omit the baking soda and water. They give the biscuits crispness and colour.
* See [http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/anzac/biscuit/recipe.htm http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/anzac/biscuit/recipe.htm] for the official ANZAC recipe

== Query origin of recipe==
The article states ''ANZAC biscuits were originally invented in the trenches of WWI, on the Gallipoli front. Troops from the Australia/New Zealand Army Corps (hence ANZAC) developed the biscuits out of the meagre rations that they had.''  Is there a source for this info?  Not even the war memorial claims this. --[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle]] 19:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

The assertion was added by an anon in December 2005 [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Anzac_Biscuits&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=261216]--[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle]] 19:51, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

:It sounds like that may be an urban myth, reading the [[w:Anzac biscuit|Wikipedia page]] about the biscuit. Certainly, it is taken for granted in NZ and Australia that these biscuits are related to the ANZAC effort in WWI, however. I think the article could do with revising, but without losing reference to the ANZACs.

* Shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]

##Optionally season the pocket with some of salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, olive oil 
#Dip the oysters into the Worcestershire sauce, and then place them in the pocket in the steak.
##Substitutes for Worcestershire sauce include teriyaki sauce, oyster sauce or red wine vinegar marinades, or the steak has the marinade or sauce
##Substitutes for oysters include mushrooms, yabbies, prawns
##Optionally add lime pulp or some shredded cheese  into the pocket.
#Seal the pocket with a moistened skewer and barbecue, grill. broil or cook over a moderate heat in a heavy based [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]].

##Some recipes poach or saute the oysters first a little, if the diners prefer rare steak but not raw oysters
##Some recipes wrap the steak in bacon or pancetta

Discussion copied from en:Talk:Pavlova

Does anybody else dispute the sentence &quot;Pavlova is rarely made at home in Australia or New Zealand today&quot;?  In New Zealand, virtually every pavlova I have had the pleasure of eating was home made.  - [[User:GaryW|GaryW]] 20:21 Mar 28, 2003 (UTC)

I agree!  Supermarket pavlovas - yuck.   [[User:Piha|Piha]] 21:29, 24 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I think supermarket pavlovas are nice! :-) and a hell of a lot easier.

:Do other countries have them? The article doesn't really emphasise NZ/Aussie thing. [[User:Tristanb|Tristanb]] 12:38, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)
::Not sure, but I just had Christmas dinner with a Californian visitor who'd never seen one before. [[User:Securiger|Securiger]] 12:18, 30 Dec 2003 (UTC)

The NZ/Australian origin of the Pavlova is an interesting question.  As far as I can tell, New Zealand can certainly claim credit for the name &quot;pavlova&quot;.  But, and it is a big but, the &quot;pavlova&quot; that was created in 1926 in New Zealand is not the same thing as the &quot;pavlova&quot; that was created by Bert Sachse in Perth in c. 1935.  The New Zealand &quot;pavlova&quot; contained gelatine.  The Aussie &quot;pavlova&quot; does not.  There are probably other, more significant differences.  The point is that when the world says &quot;pavlova&quot; nowadays, it means the entity that had its origin in Australia, not the entity that had its origin in New Zealand.  So, it is an Australian recipe.  I think we Aussies are being more than generous in allowing our Kiwi cousins to claim credit for coming up with the name - but only the name.  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] 06:35, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Weight ==

I have modified the weight reference from 9oz. to 250g (9 oz.). Firstly, this is a New Zealand and Australian recipe so units that will generally be used by most New Zealands and Australians should predominate. This would be grams  not ounces. As far as I can tell (being new to Cookbook) there is no policy requiring that American units predominate. Secondly and more importantly, 250g (9 oz.) was the original recipe. Without discussion, Eadmund remove the 250g completely. This is unacceptable IMHO and should not be repeated without discussion. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 12:17, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== Pavlova in the U.S. ==

Pavlova isn't sold here in the U.S..  I only found out about it after randomly trawling through h2g2.com.

:Lucky for you, we have a recipe here for making it then, eh? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:33, 11 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Discussion coppied from [[w:en:Talk:Quesadilla]] ==

I removed this recipie:

Preheat a frying pan, seasoned with an oil, to simmering heat.

Drop in a tortilla.

Drop on it shredded cheese (typically MontereyJackCheese), and any of the following:

 * salsa
 * sarsa
 * chilies
 * meat
 * avocado or quacamole

Cover with another tortilla, simmer until the cheese binds the two tortillas together and the outside starts to brown, flip it over, simmer a little longer.

Slice into strips and serve with any of those optional ingredients on top, or with a dipping sauce.&quot;

from the main article. IMHO it seems out of place in an encyclopedia. --[[Wikipedia:User:Grimm_Ripper|Grimm]]

I put it back in.  There are recipes all over wikipedia.  -- [[Wikipedia:User:Zoe|Zoe]]

End of copied discussion [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:47, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)

For the sake of sanitiation and food saftey, I added &quot;Cooked&quot; to &quot;meat or seafood&quot;.  In the quick time required to melt the cheese and warm the remaining ingredients, raw meat or seafood will mostlikely not fully cook.  I started writing the artical for Microwave Quesdillas.  I barrowed some text from here, but feel they should match. -- Vanmankline

A very warm welcome to wikibooks ! I'm working 3 jobs right now and real busy but I will set aside time to help you as you need. I see your contribution of the intro to the Chemistry book ... its a start !

If Karl isn't about, I'll be glad to help too. I saw your comment on slashdot and was wondering if you'd come and join our fun. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 22:19, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called PingPongBoy. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name PingPongBoy~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

==Information Habitat==

G'day Chris

There's a proposal to move some problematic stuff from the English Wikipedia to the [[Wiki Science]] book you started. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:VfD-User_Information-Habitat_subpages this current deletion debate] and especially scroll down to the bottom of the page.

Obviously, I'd like your comments and those of other authors. 

I'm also a big Wiki fan, see my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Andrewa Wikipedia User page] which reads in part

''I'm excited about Wiki in general and the Wikipedia in particular. I suspect that Wiki is the fourth killer app for the internet, with usenet, email and WWW being the first three. No, I didn't forget ftp. We'll see.''

So who knows, I could even go from being a thorn in the side of this project to a contributor, assuming we can find it a home. Please get back to me. Better on my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:VfD-User_Information-Habitat_subpages Wikipedia talk page] than the Wikibook one, although I will try to watch both for a little bit, or on the deletion debate page itself would be even better. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:53, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:This is now well underway, but has gone to a Wikibook of its own instead (a much better solution), see [[Information_Ecology]]. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 17:44, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</text>

----
Physical changes in chemistry include phase changes and anything else that changes the way that matter is arranged in space. 

Examples of physical changes are: 
* breaking a stick 
* crushing ice
* melting ice
* stretching a rubber band
* boiling water

== Phase changes ==
The three basic phases of matter are [[Solids (General Chemistry)|solid]], [[Liquids (General Chemistry)|liquid]], and [[Gases (General Chemistry)|gas]]. (Under certain unusual conditions matter can transform into a phase called [[w:plasma|plasma]].)

A phase change is a change from one phase to another. The most common example is liquid water freezing into ice or evaporating into a gas. Phase changes result in different properties for the substance changing phases but the chemical identity of the material does not change. In the case of water, its molecules are always composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. However, in frozen water the molecules are frozen into place in relation to each other in a structure called a crystal; in liquid water the molecules flow relative to each other; and water molecules in the gas phase are flying freely in space and seldom even contact each other.

Phase changes are controlled by temperature and pressure. By lowering the temperature of a gas it can be condensed into a liquid and then even into a solid. Heating a solid melts it into a liquid and then, with further heat, into a gas.gas solid liquid

==Appendix 3 - Voornaamwoorden ~ ''pronouns''==

Like English, Dutch has pronouns. These can mark '''number''', '''case''', '''gender''','''politeness''' and '''emphasis'''.

Pronouns can function either as substantives (nouns) or as adjectives. There is also a number of related adverbs that will be treated here. Adverbs are typically not considered pronouns in grammatical analysis, but they deserve mention when discussing the Dutch language because pronouns are often ''replaced'' by [[../Lesson 8|pronominal adverbs]].

===Persoonlijke voornaamwoorden ~ ''Personal pronouns''===

In this table personal pronouns are given in nominative, accusative and dative case. These cases signify the role the pronouns have in the sentence. For example: In &quot;I am hitting you&quot;, &quot;I&quot; is nominative (subject) and &quot;you&quot; is accusative (object). Also words with a preposition are in accusative case (&quot;you&quot; in &quot;I am looking at you&quot;). Dative case is special and tells us something is indirect object, as &quot;me&quot; in &quot;He gave me that&quot; or &quot;He built me a snowman&quot; or, with a preposition, &quot;He gave it to me&quot;.

|-
| South || '''gij''' || you || '''u''' || you
|-
| 3rd || || '''zij/ze''' || they || '''hen/hun'''*&lt;br&gt;'''ze'''
| them
|}

Remarks:
*Sometimes there are two forms (jij/je etc.), which can be interchanged most of the time. (See [[../Lesson 5|5]])
*Officially the plural 3rd person accusative form is '''hen'''. '''Hun''' is (officially) only used as a dative without preposition: &quot;''We hebben het hun verteld''&quot; (&quot;We told them about it&quot;). After a preposition '''hen''' should be used. This refers almost entirely to the written standard language and was artificially constructed by the grammarians of the past. In the spoken language ''hen'' is seldom heard. Even ''hun'' is increasingly replaced by ''ze'' as people tire of being told their use of ''hun'' is wrong by the schoolmasters. In the inanimate case the use of preposition+pronoun is rare, replacement by a pronominal adverb being preferred (See [[../Lesson 8|8]]).
*For inanimate objects personal and possessive pronouns are often [[../Lesson_4#Using_demonstrative_pronouns_instead_of_personal_pronouns|replaced]] by demonstrative pronouns.
*In the South -mostly Flanders- the gij-form is in regular use for the second person. It has its own verb endings. It adds a -t both in the present and the past: komen - gij kom'''t''' - gij '''''kwaamt'''''. In the North its use is limited to Biblical quotes like: ''gij zult niet stelen - thou shalt not steal''. Notice that ''u'' is used as object, ''without'' implying politeness.
 
====Bezittelijke voornaamwoorden ~ ''Possessive pronouns''====

Pssessive pronouns are essentially the adjectival forms of the personal pronouns.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| number || person || || Dutch || English
|-
| rowspan=&quot;6&quot; | singular || 1st || || '''mijn''' || my
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 2nd || fam. || '''jouw/je'''
| your
|-
| polite || '''uw''' || your
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | 3rd || m || '''zijn'''*3
| his
|-
| f || '''haar'''*3 || her
|-
| n || '''(zijn)'''*3 || its
|-
| rowspan=&quot;4&quot; | plural || 1st || || '''onze/ons''' || our
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 2nd || fam. || '''jullie'''
| your
|-
| polite || '''uw''' || your
|-
| 3rd || || '''hun''' || their
|}

Remarks:
#The difference between '''jouw''' and '''je''' is matter of emphasis or the lack thereof: &quot;''Dat is '''jouw''' huis.''&quot; vs. &quot;'''''Dat''' is je huis.''&quot; 
#'''Ons''' has an inflected form '''onze''' as most adjectives do (See [[../Lesson 2]]). Other possessives are seldom inflected in the modern language: ''Mijne Heren!'': ''Gentlemen!'', ''Hare Hoogheid'': ''Her Highness''. More regularly inflected forms are used when the pronoun is used as an independent noun: ''Met welke auto gaan we? De mijne of de jouwe?''. Jullie is never inflected, instead ''die van jullie'' is used.
# The neuter possessive pronoun ''zijn'' is very rare as Dutch usually opts for a construction involving a pronominal adverb like ''ervan''. (see [[../Lesson 8|8]]). The masculine and feminine forms are increasingly reserved for natural gender (persons, as in English) in other cases pronominal replacement is more and more the norm.

====Personal Adverb - ''er''====

Dutch has a somewhat curious personal locative adverb '''''er''''' that replaces ''het'' and ''ze'' particularly in inanimate cases (i.e. for things more so than for persons). It occurs as the locative part of many pronominal adverbs, such as :erin, erdoor, ervan etc. but it can also be used independently:

:er is koffie - there is coffee.
:er zijn mensen die dat lusten - there are people that like that

Notice that ''er'' is not considered the subject of these sentences (''koffie'' and ''mensen'' are the subject resp.)

===Aanwijzende voornaamwoorden -- Demonstrative pronouns===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!location!!neuter sg. !! all other !! English
|-
|close||dit||deze ||this, these
|-
|far||dat ||die|| that,those
|}

#Notice that the distinction dit-deze does '''''not''''' correspond to the distinction this-these. ''Deze'' is used in the plural but it also used in the singular for m/f words. (It replaces ''de''.)

Demonstrative pronouns are typically used as adjectives:

:Dit huis
:Deze auto

they can also be used independently:

:dit is een huis
:Zijn auto? Die heb ik gezien

They are more and more used to replace inanimate personal pronouns.

====Aanwijzende bijwoorden - demonstrative adverbs====

;temporal

Dutch has three demonstrative adverbs of time:

#past: toen -then
#: hij heeft toen een huis gekocht - he bought a house then
#present: nu - now
#: nu woont hij er - now he lives there
#future/conditional: dan - then
#: hij het dan verkopen - then he'll sell it

;modal

One modal demonstrative adverb is common:

: zo - so

Occasionally a more proximate one ''zus'' is used for contrast

: Dat doe je zus en zo - You do that this way and that.

;locative

Two locative adverbs are in common use:

#close by: hier - here
#far off: daar - there

Both of them are used as the locative part of demonstrative pronominal adverbs like: hierdoor, daarvan etc.

A third adverb is less common:

#remote: ginds, ginder, daarginds -yonder

===Betrekkelijke voornaamwoorden -- Relative pronouns===

====Zelfstandig- substantive====

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!antecedent!!neuter sg. !!all other!! English
|-
|after||dat||die || that/who
|-
|included||wat||wie|| the one that/who&lt;br&gt;whoever/that which
|}

Without ''antecedent'':

:Dit is het huis '''dat''' ik koop -this is the house that I buy
:Dit is de auto '''die''' ik koop - this is the car that I buy
:Dit is de vrouw '''die''' ik lief heb - the is the woman whom I love

With inclusion of antecedent.

:'''Wie''' mij steunt zal ik belonen - whoever supports me I shall reward
:Ik verkocht '''wat''' ik eerder gekocht had - I sold that which I had bought earlier.

There are a number of archaic forms that can be used with prepositions:

:neuter:'''hetwelk''', '''hetgeen''', '''hetgene''', '''datgene''' : that which
:other: '''dewelke'''
:persons '''degene die''': he who, '''diegenen die''': those who

As in English the genitives '''wiens''' and '''wier''' (whose) can be used in relative clauses referring to persons:

: ik ontmoette de man wiens vrouw voor ons werkt - I met the man whose wife works for us.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!case!! masc sg.!!fem sg./plur!! English
|-
|genitive||wiens||wier || whose
|}

In inanimate cases the relative pronominal adverb '''waarvan''' is virtually mandatory.

====Bijvoeglijk - adjective====

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!neuter sg. !!all other!! English
|-
|welk||welke || which
|}

:ik weet welk boek hij gebruikt - I know which book he uses
:ik weet niet in welke steden trams rijden - I do not know in which cities streetcars are operated

====Bijwoordelijk - adverbial====

;locative

'''waar''' - where

:''Waar'' can be used to initiate a dependent clause:

:dit is de stad waar ik geboren ben - this is the town where I was born

''Waar'' is also used to form the relative pronominal adverbs like waarvan, waarvoor etc. that frequently replace relative pronouns.

==Gesprek 3-1==

Mam teaches her toddler, Jeroen to count:
{{Dutch/Textbox|

:''Mam'': Hoeveel vingertjes heb je, Jeroen?
:''Jeroen'': een, twee, drie, vier, vijf.

}}

==Leren 3 ~ Tellen van 1 tot 12==
In Dutch, as in English, there are both '''ordinal''' and '''cardinal''' numbers, and number formation is similar in that the first twelve numbers are unique. Above twelve, numbers are formed by combination. For example, 15 is ''vijftien'' and 16 is ''zestien''. Other numbers will be the subject of more advanced lessons.

Note in the table how ordinals are formed from the cardinals in Dutch by adding '''''-de'''''. 'Ten' becomes 'tenth' in English; '''''tien''''' become '''''tiende''''' in Dutch. As in English, there are several variants: ''eerste'', ''derde'', and ''achtste''.

Remark: '''een''' is used both as an indefinite article (''a'' or ''an'') and a number (''one''). One often puts accents on the e's when ''one'' is meant in case of ambiguity: '''één'''. In Dutch spelling such accents are allowed but only if otherwise ambiguity would arise. There is also a difference in pronunciation: /ən/ ([[Wikipedia:en:schwa|schwa]]-n) for the article and /e:n/ (ayn) for the number.

===Eerst en laatst===
The ordinals are a special kind of adjectives. They always have the inflection -e. So, words like *zesd do not exist. The only exception is ''eerst''. As in English, it can be used as an adverb:

:Hij gaat ''eerst'' naar huis - he ''first'' goes home

Its opposite (antonym) is ''laatst'' as adverb and ''laatste'' as adjective:

:de laatste trein - the last train.

Asking for the time is accomplished by the sentence: 
:''Hoe laat is het?'' (&quot;What time is it?&quot;, ''lit''. &quot;How late is it?&quot;).

The answer is:
: ''Het is ____ uur'' - &quot;It is ____ o'clock&quot;, substituting the correct cardinal value.

===Half en kwart===

The half hours are indicated differently in Dutch:

:het is '''''halfvier''''' - '''''3''''':30
::it is half past ''3''

The quarter hours are similar
:{{knp2|het is kwart over drie}} - 3:15
:{{knp2|het is kwart voor vier}} - 3:45

==Syntax 3-1 ~ Some more word order: inversion==

We have seen that inversion of subject and verb is used to create a question:

:{{knop|het is twee uur}}'''Het is''' twee uur 
:{{knop|hoe laat is het}}Hoe laat '''is het'''?

However, recall from the conversation that inversion happens for other reasons.

:...daarna ''breng je''... 
:...''op een middag komen ze''...

These are not questions, still there is inversion. The reason is that the adverb ''daarna'' or the adverbial expression ''op een middag'' was put before the ''subject'' + ''verb'' part for '''''emphasis'''''. This causes inversion. We could also have said:

:Jij brengt mij daarna op je motor naar huis.
:Zij komen elkaar op een middag tegen.

Notice that the verb loses final -t when using the informal second person jij or je in such cases as it does in questions:

:jij brengt - breng je

{{Dutch/Exercise|inversion for emphasis
| 
The following sentences end in an adverbial expression like ''in the morning''. Put this expression a the front of the sentence for emphasis. Be sure to use clitics when appropriate and not when not.

# wij voetballen niet ''op straat''.
# hij komt ''om twee uur''
# het gaat goed ''met je'' 
# het rode huis staat ''op de hoek''
# hij heet ''Jan van 't Hoff''
# wij brengen jou niet ''met de motor'' naar huis
|
# ''op straat'' voetballen we niet .
# ''om twee uur'' komt hij.
# met jou gaat het goed  
# ''op de hoek'' staat het rode huis  
# ''Jan van 't Hoff'' heet hij
# ''met de motor'' brengen we je niet naar huis
}}

==Grammatica 3-3 ~ Introduction to ''naamwoorden''==

Dutch grammar uses the word ''naamwoord'' (''lit.'' name-word) that does not translate well into English. ''Naamwoorden'' indicates a rather broad class of words, both independently used (like nouns) or used to specify another word (like adjectives). Dutch grammar is therefore structured a bit differently from the English one. Besides ''naamwoorden'' there are two other large classes of words in Dutch: ''werkwoorden'' (verbs) and ''bijwoorden'' (adverbs).

A '''[[Wikipedia:en:Noun|noun]]'''  is a fundamental part of speech, occurring in sentences in two different ways: as subjects (performers of action), or objects (recipients of action). As a generality, a noun is the name of a &quot;person, place, thing or concept&quot;. 

Nouns are classified into 
#proper nouns (''eigennamen''): e.g. &quot;Janet&quot;
#common nouns (''zelfstandige naamwoorden''): e.g. &quot;girl&quot;
#cardinals (''telwoorden''): e.g. one, two, three, etc.
#pronouns (''voornaamwoorden''): e.g. &quot;she&quot;, &quot;her&quot;

The latter group is often considered a separate class of words. They stand in for (pro-, voor-) nouns. Words like &quot;hij&quot; - &quot;he&quot; are known as personal pronouns (''persoonlijke voornaamwoorden'')

Dutch has its own grammatical nomenclature and to use dictionaries and grammars it is useful to know it.

Noun is rendered as ''zelfstandig naamwoord'' ('nameword that stands on itself'). An adjective is called ''bijvoeglijk naamwoord'' (nameword that can be added). ''Naamwoord'' is more general than noun. It derives from the Latin term ''nomen'': nomen substantivum (zelfstandig naamwoord) and nomen adiectivum (bijvoeglijk naamwoord).

Adjectives are usually added to nouns to further determine them:

:&quot;mooi&quot; weer
:&quot;beautiful&quot; weather

Some pronouns, e.g. possessive pronouns (''bezittelijk voornaamwoord'') are used as adjectives:

:&quot;mijn&quot; auto
:&quot;my&quot; car

A special class of adjectives is formed by the articles (''lidwoorden''):

:&quot;the&quot; car
:&quot;de&quot; auto

===Gender of Nouns===
We have seen evidence of word gender in the pronouns we have been encountering; notably 'he', 'she', and 'it' in English and '''''hij''''', '''''zij''''', and '''''het''''' in Dutch. We also saw that adjectives depend on gender in Dutch.

There are a few rules that help to determine a noun's gender, but mostly it must be learned as children do: word by word.

Noun gender is also reflected in the ''definite article''  It should always be learned as ''part of the noun'', as this is a good way to memorize gender.

===Definite Articles===
Definite articles are equivalent to an English 'the', and the two basic gender forms in Dutch are as follows:

:'''het''': neuter singular (pronounce /hEt/, &quot;h-eh-t&quot;)
:'''de''': (pronounce /də/) all other cases

====Animate nouns====

Much like in English there are three genders for animate nouns (people, pets etc.) and this shows up clearly in their personal pronouns: ''hij, zij and het''  (he, she and it) and their possessive pronouns ''zijn, haar and zijn'' (his, her, its):
[[File:Nl-eenmanenzijnhond.ogg|noicon|40px]]
:To say 'the man' in Dutch, you would say '''''de man''''', because ''man'' is a '''masculine''' noun.
::You refer to ''de man'' with ''hij'' (he): '''''Hij''' is een man''. ''Een man en '''zijn''' (his) hond'' - &quot;He is a man. A man and his dog&quot;
:To say 'the woman' in Dutch, you would say '''''de vrouw''''', because ''vrouw'' is a '''feminine''' noun. 
::You would say: '''''Zij''' (she) is een vrouw''. ''Een vrouw en '''haar''' (her) werk'' -&quot;She is a woman. A woman and her work.&quot;
:To say 'the calf' in Dutch, you would say '''het kalf''', because ''kalf'' is a '''neuter''' noun. 
::You would say: '''''Het''' (it) is een kalf''. ''Een kalf en '''zijn''' (its) stal'' - &quot;It is a calf. A calf and its stable&quot;

However, ''zijn'' is not used much anymore to refer to a neuter word and we will see a different way of expressing &quot;its&quot; later.

In the plural the gender distinctions are absent: ''de mannen, de vrouwen, de kalveren'' are all referred to by ''zij'' (they) and ''hun'' (their).

As you see the definite article is the same for masculine and feminine, but it is not just definite articles, but also adjectives and pronouns that must match the gender of the noun they are related to.

====Inanimate nouns====
[[File:Map of the Netherlands highlighting the Great Rivers.svg|thumb|Map of the Netherlands highlighting the Great Rivers|250px]]
In the Netherlands (the North) the distinction between masculine and feminine was lost for ''inanimate'' nouns (things, concepts etc.) in the 17th century. The feminine and the masculine have merged into a ''common'' gender north of ''de grote riveren'' (the Great Rivers: the Meuse, the Rhine and its branches) almost entirely. Someone learning the language therefore best considers Dutch a '''''two-gender language''''' for anything but persons:
[[File:Nl-deklokhetboek.ogg|noicon|40px]]
:the clock is ''de klok'', because it is ''common gender''
:the book is  ''het boek'', because it is ''neuter gender''

This does not hold for the South, where a &quot;de klok&quot; may still be referred to as &quot;zij&quot; (she), but it is acceptable standard Dutch to disregard the masculine-feminine distinction.

By contrast, the twofold split common-neuter is still very much alive in Dutch and this must be mastered by any beginner to learn the language well. Therefore, it is important when learning Dutch nouns to always learn them '''together''' with their correct '''definite article'''. That is:
:: Memorize the word for 'book' in Dutch as '''''het''' boek'', not simply ''boek''.
:: Memorize the word for 'clock' in Dutch as '''''de''' klok'', not simply ''klok''.

This is by far the most important thing you should do right now. The fine distinctions between the varieties of the language can wait.

====Referring to inanimate common gender====

As we saw above the personal pronouns (hij,zij,het) still show the three-gender distinction that Dutch inherited from its Indoeuropean ancestry. That makes it hard to use personal pronouns for an inanimate common gender word. In the South ''de klok'' may still be called a ''she'', but Northerners avoid such references and so should you. Strictly speaking it would be correct for Northerners to call a clock a &quot;he&quot;, but they often avoid that as well.&lt;ref&gt;For three centuries they have been chided and ridiculed by grammarians, school teachers and Southerners for not knowing whether a noun is masculine or feminine. Grammarians and school teachers have finally given up on that since 1947, but now insist that ''hij'' should be used for ''de klok''. Northerners have a long history of ignoring them and will stick to avoiding both hij and zij.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays ''hij'' and ''zij'' are pretty much restricted to people or their pets, so they indicate ''natural'' rather than ''grammatical'' gender, certainly in the North.  Notice that Northerners cannot resort to ''het'' (it) as done in English, because ''de klok'' is '''not''' neuter...

This leaves roughly two thirds of all inanimate nouns without a personal pronoun to refer them by. For possessive pronouns (his, her, its) a similar problem exists.

We shall see three common ways that speakers use to avoid inanimate hij/zij references:

*[[Dutch/Lesson_4#Using_demonstrative_pronouns_instead_of_personal_pronouns|using demonstratives]] 
*[[Dutch/Lesson_8#Grammatica_8._Er_and_the_pronominal_adverbs|using pronominal adverbs]]
*[[Dutch/Lesson 7#Grammatica 7.2 Diminutives|using diminutives (always neuter)]]

These three aspects of the language have come to play a more prominent role in Dutch than they do in English. One could say that the merger of m/f into common gender&lt;ref&gt;together with the often punitive nature of the imposition of prescriptive grammar&lt;/ref&gt; has triggered a number of shifts in the language, that for example German or English do not have and must be mastered to speak Dutch well.

===Rules for gender===

There are a few general (and helpful) rules for gender:

#Diminutives are neuter: de klok → het klokje
#Words in -ing, -heid, -teit, -te carry ''de''. (they are actually feminine, but do not worry about that).
#Loans usually retain their gender: (''Latin'') museum → het museum (both neuter).

Another helpful fact is that all genders behave the same in the plural, all use ''de'', ''die'', ''zij'' etc.

Apart from these general rules, nouns should be memorized '''''together with their definite article'''''. So, learn &quot;de klok&quot;, not just &quot;klok&quot; and &quot;het paard&quot; not just &quot;paard&quot;

===Double gender===

There is an interesting group of words for which the natural gender is in conflict with the grammatical gender, e.g. diminutives of people:

:The girl: ''het meisje''
:The (little) boy: ''het jongetje''

Grammatically they are neuter and their articles, adjectives and demonstratives follow the neuter pattern. However the personal and possessive pronouns follow the natural gender:

: Een mooi (n!) meisje en ''haar'' (f!) [[wikt:en:moeder|moeder]]
: Dat (n!) jongetje? Hij (m!) is niet hier

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorry yo, but what use is Interlingua anyway? 

Reduce EU Budget? 
What should I do with my degree, then?

Improve communication?
Were the Esperanto/Anglic/... experiments not enough?

Should it be THE international language?
Don't we have English, already?

And try to get Americans (still more than 60% of internet users) to speak Interlingua, if you can!

And sorry, but it just sounds too... Latin - how about 5.something billion people speaking a non-latin language?

DS

:I'm no Interlingua supporter, and I probably shouldn't go off-topic like this here, but...
*Interlingua itself is spoken by very few. The only successful IAL has been Esperanto, with about 1 to 2 million speakers.
*I have no idea what your degree is, but unless you're a translator I don't see it affecting you greatly...
*The only &quot;widely&quot; spoken IAL is Esperanto. Its nearest follower, an old offshoot called Ido, has between 500 and 5000 speakers.
*Yes, an IAL of some sort should be the international language. It would be neutral, fair, and protect minority languages, of which hundreds are expected to perish this century if something isn't done. English is spoken by about 8.5% of the world's population - not quite international.
*The point of an IAL, to my mind, is that it should be very easy. Even Americans should have no problem learning one like Esperanto :)
*I doubt the five-billion figure you quoted there very much. But, you have to pick somewhere to take words from, otherwise you just start creating them, which helps no-one. One view is that it's fairer to have Latin-group speakers learning in one year and non-Latin-group speakers learning in two years than for the Latins to do nothing and the non-Latins to learn for ten years.
*&lt;shamelessplug&gt; May I suggest you see [[Esperanto]]? &lt;/shamelessplug&gt; -- [[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 01:09, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)

But why not to learn [[Interlingua]] or give an opportunitiy to folks to learn it, at least?

::Wow...  Is this really the comment page for &quot;Introducing Interlingua&quot;?  I'm amazed at the two comments above.  They show a complete lack of understanding of what Interlingua is all about.  The article merely stated that Interlingua is a great option for speakers of one language (such as English) to learn another (such as most Romance languages).  It said nothing about forcing the world to speak this language, or that it should even be employed when Japanese people speak to Chinese people, etc.  Yes, we have an International language (English) and yes, we have a constructed language that its proponents hope will become the main second language of the world (Esperanto).  Interlingua claims to be neither.

::Instead, the biggest reason I'm learning Interlingua now is that I've always wanted to learn Spanish or Italian and such, and I've in fact tried to learn Spanish, but I gave it up because I just hated the unnecessary verb conjugations, including loads of irregular verbs.  Latin is even harder, with noun declension and such.  However, Interlingua is a cinch.  Thus, I've been able to focus on the vocabulary instead of the grammar, and have gotten much farther in it in a much shorter time than I normally would have.  I can also see so many similarities between English words and Romance language words that it borrowed, and which make up half of the English language.  Learning Interlingua helps me not only learn all of the Romance languages (I'm now much better at reading Spanish, for example), but also increases my English vocabulary, because many of these Romance language words are scientific and such.  This is the use that Interlingua was intended for.

::The fact is, Esperanto is an interesting language, but it won't help you learn Spanish.  Nor should it, for its purpose, which is different than Interlingua's.  Gabriel Beecham, above, wrote that we need to protect minority languages instead of trying to extinguish them.  I agree completely.  So that's why I don't understand why you're trying to put down Interlingua, when some people are interested in it.  Although I'm sure that Gabriel doesn't speak for the Esperanto movement, I must say that I thought that Esperanto's ideals were peace and understanding, not fighting amongst ourselves.  Yet Gabriel jumps in and insults a language that has no bearing on his life.  It's like saying &quot;Hungarian shouldn't be the world's official language!  Few people know it and it's not fair to non-Hungarians!&quot;  Well, duh.  But Hungarian is not trying to be the world's language, and neither is Interlingua.  But I do appreciate Interlingua for helping me out, and I do appreciate those who have given their time freely to help me learn it.  To the above commenters, I should also note that I AM an American (and not stupid as a brick, as you might believe), and I'm learning Interlingua (for my own happiness, and my own reasons, not so that I can communicate with you two), and that I have no plans to learn Esperanto, although I might some day.  I'm too busy also with Japanese and Chinese right now. --[[User:202.215.70.67|202.215.70.67]] 13:41, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__
We've got that large tabley thing set up in the conventions (It might be better placed under the board set up section). However that table would be a real headache to use repeatedly (its huge HTML code). The best solution I've seen yet is that chess board tex markup from wikisophia (see it here: http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex#Chess). However from my simple little tests that isn't supported yet here.

So for standard representation of chess boards, for now I recommend we just stick to simple to complex Ascii diagrams, using PNBRKQ/pnbrkq for black and white respectively. That should do until that sweet sweet wikitex project becomes more standard in the wikiworld.

: I hope you're not referring to algebraic notation, the virtual ''lingua franca'' of chess notation. Fine for ASCII showing the boards or whatever, but its important to teach writing chess as well... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:59, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: Why is uppercase for Black and lowercase for White? The standard convention is the opposite, e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation Forsyth-Edwards_Notation]. --[[User:68.122.41.19|68.122.41.19]] 18:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

No (that former post was mine), the tex markup, just lets a tex backend generate a diagram of the chess set up. A very very nice looking diagram. As we'll it labels the move history, so its ideal for transcribing chess games.
[[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 21:53, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: Problem is it uses ''long'' algebraic, not short! :C I like the rendering, but it means I have to sit there and by sight transcribe famous games if I want them to be rendered by WikiTeX! [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:22, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::WikiTeX now supports SAN and PGN in addition to algebraic. [[User:Peter Danenberg|Peter Danenberg]] 11:28, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'm still not entirely sure what you mean. Do you mean it uses the notation like QP2-QP4, instead of like e4-e6? Or are you against having to reproduce a chess match in part to display a picture of the certain result? [[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 03:33, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)
: long - b1-c3 , short - Nc3. The Wikisophia Chess markup handles moves ''only'' in long algebraic, and ''not'' short which all game records use, so in order to use the Wikisophia markup to show a game it has to be translated into long algebraic first which is a pain - the \move or \ply commands only does b1c3, for example. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:56, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

(Brainstorming) How about a special moves section that details moves like castling and ''en passant'' and where they apply.  Possibly also mention non-standard chess pieces and chess problems? -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 19:12, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)
: Yeah, I was just thinking where to slot it in... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 20:59, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I didn't know there were non-standard chess pieces. Do you mean chess varients? Or do other places play standard Chess with an alternate piece set? If its the former a section on chess varients may be appropriate, if the latter we should try to slot them into the actual document. Does anyone here know the names of different Chess notations? I'd like to include them, currently I've added the relative position, for lack of a better name, it looks like this

:'''1. QN1-QB3, ... ''' (1. B1-C3) (Queens Night to Bishop 3)

I've added that under the topic 'Alternate' Notation. Does anyone know its name, and/or the names of other notations?[[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 03:17, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:: That's a European style notation, and is really rather ancient, and not many use it any more. Should we really include it here? (I'll find the name, in any case). There aren't really nonstandard ''chess'' pieces, but in chess ''variants'' you can have these. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:46, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Non-standard chess pieces... aka [[en:Fairy chess piece]]s. -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 07:40, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

The alternate notation is called 'Descriptive Notation' and although it is not used much anymore it is worth knowing because there are a few books written in it which are worth reading (e.g. Irving Chernev's &quot;The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played&quot;).

== Organizing the book ==

Hi, the chess book has been growing for a while, and it covers enough content to think about splitting it into several sub-pages. There are various ways of doing this, as discussed in [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. I would recommend having only a short introduction on the main page of chess, and a table of contents like
 [[Chess]]
 [[Chess/Conventions]]
 [[Chess/Basics]]
 [[Chess/Playing The Game]]
 [[Chess/Notating The Game]]
and so on. Avoid having red links or very short pages. A couple of chapters should be enough. Using subpages, each page gets an automatic link back to the main chess page. Have a look at [[Hamster Care]] or [[How To Build A Computer]] how it is done there, or look at the recent conversions [[User talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization of the Golden Bough]] or [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. Let me know if you need help or if there are questions. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:53, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

There is a section called 'Notating The Game'. Could it be renamed to 'Annotating The Game' because notating is not a real word, and the correct word is annotating
-- CRF - Chessplayer
:No, we can't. &quot;Notating&quot; is in fact a real word. However, you're right in that &quot;Notating&quot; is not the correct term, but &quot;annotating&quot; refers to making comments about the moves played in the game, giving variations, evaluating positions, etc. The correct term is &quot;scoring&quot;.

:I was just going to suggest that but I see you were faster. :) I would break it using the existing top level headings:
 [[Chess]]
 [[Chess/Basics]]
 [[Chess/Playing The Game]]
 [[Chess/Notating The Game]]
 [[Chess/Tactics]]
 [[Chess/Strategy]]
 [[Chess/Basic Openings]]
 [[Chess/The Endgame]]

:I have split the book into the heading listed above.  This should allow for quicker load times and easier editing. [[User:Darvian|Darvian]] 20 Apr 2005

::[[Chess/Basics]], and [[Chess/Conventions]] got deleted.

== Maybe use template? ==

What do you think of using the template for chess boards (borrowed from the English Wikipedia), instead of the long table? Here is an example of its use, along with the old style:

::There is a nice project going on for a cross-wiki Chess diagram template.  See [[:meta:WikiProject_Chess]] for details.  I've copied the new &quot;standard&quot; template from Commons to WikiBooks.  The template is called Chess_diagram, and here's what it looks like:

::If there are no objections, I'd like to start using this template to clean up the Chess WikiBook. [[User:Bjimba|Bjimba]] 14:59, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

== Chess variants ==

There is a VfD discussion that has an impact on this Wikibook at the moment.  Don't worry, we are not trying to delete this Wikibook, but there is a Wikibook that appears to be a chess variant, and perhaps its content could be modified and adapted to be included in this Wikibook.  See [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#NeoRandom Chess]] for further details.  The point here is that this Wikibook is inappropriate if left alone, but my opinion is that it should be included in this Wikibook.  If you (any reader who gets to this point) feel it perhaps should go elsewhere, speak your mind on the VfD page or &quot;forever hold your peace&quot;.  If there are any active participants on this Wikibook, I would invite you to join in the discussion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:42, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

== Important notice ==

The Chess wikibook had separate chapters called Basic Openings and Opening Theory. The Opening Theory module covered the same broad subject as Basic Openings but using a significantly different approach. While Basic Openings was a linear chapter, Opening Theory aimed to be an opening explorer along the lines of this web site [http://www.eudesign.com/chessops]. In addition, Basic Openings was... basic, while Opening Theory had a theoretically unlimited depth.

'''I have made the former Opening Theory chapter of the Chess wikibook into a separate wikibook, called 'Opening theory in chess'.'''

My reasons for doing this centre on the fact that the Chess wikibook is meant to a) reach 100% completion eventually and b) be something that a reader can get through from cover to cover and which will provide a working knowledge of the basics of chess. The Opening Theory chapter was inconsistent with this because:

*Opening theory ''dwarfs'' the rest of chess literature. One needs only to look at the typical bookstall at a chess tournament to see this. It would take a long time and a lot of effort to create the definitive guide to chess openings, which would retard the completion of the Chess wikibook as a whole. Indeed, Chess is nearing completion, while Opening theory in chess is close to 0%.
*The Opening Theory chapter was intended to be open-ended and constantly evolving in breadth and depth, like the Cookbook, with the result that Chess could ''never'' be 100% complete. Better, to my mind, to have one complete and readable book with a link to another constantly evolving one 'for further information'. 
*The concepts behind opening theory get complicated and potentially off-putting to someone who simply wants to know a bit about chess.

I believe this complies with Wikibooks' no-forking policy because:
*The approaches used by the two books are completely different
*The content itself differs in scope and depth
*The minimal actual duplication of material is for the greater good of Wikibooks as I have explained above.

== Chess puzzles for one and all ==

I am preparing a set of chess puzzles from actual games and published problems for my students in a real-life chess class.  I have decided to use the Wiki software to make the chess diagrams.

The puzzles, with solutions given on a separate page, are available on my userpage.  At some later time, I intend to copy them into the chess book.  If anyone wishes to do it immediately, I have no objection, as long as I can keep the original copy in my userspace.

I hope everyone who wants to try the puzzles will enjoy them. [[User:Shalom|Shalom]] ([[User talk:Shalom|talk]]) 02:59, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vietnamese creates comparatives and superlatives out of adjectives and adverbs simply by adding a word to the end. First of all, what are [[Wiktionary:comparative|comparatives]] and [[Wiktionary:superlative|superlatives]]? Comparatives are demonstrated in the following sentences:

:He is '''taller''' than I am.
:You have '''more''' than I do.

They simply express a comparison between two items. Superlatives are demonstrated in the following sentences:

:He is the '''tallest''' of the three.
:She brought the '''most''' cookies.

They express the outcome of a comparison between more than two items. (All of the items being compared, except for &quot;she,&quot; are implied in the second sentence.)

===Comparatives===
In Vietnamese, comparatives are formed by placing ''hơn'' after the adjective or adverb. For example:

:Nó cao '''hơn''' anh.
::''He is taller than I.'' (literally: ''He tall more me.'')
:Ông có '''hơn''' con.
::''You, sir, have more than I.'' (literally: ''You (sir) have more me.'')

''(More to come.)''

I have switched to an alternative.  Wikibooks is nice, but the lag is a problem for me.  It is better after hardware upgrades and the download page seems to work now.  However I was not successful with installing the software locally.  The install script would not complete.  Instead I have started work on a similar project at http://orca.st.usm.edu/~seyfarth/wiki

If anyone wants to copy any of the orcawiki material to this wikibooks site, that is fine with me.  I will probably try to install wikibooks again when another release is available.  I could be happy with a wikibook setup with a local copy on orca so I can count on adequate performance.

== Page Merger ==
I did a history merge, which is better than a copy and paste history. Thanks for remembering to move the history though. In the future, when you need to move modules, use the ''merge'' tab at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can ask an admin to do it (ie. if a page already exists at the new location). Thanks!

:::Barry did move the modules. I think Barry was trying to merge two talk pages as part of a plan to reorganize this book. I guess I should of mentioned requesting a page merge when copy+pasting the contents of one page into another one. However this doesn't really work for partial attempts to merge two pages, while keeping the rest separate. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:18, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
::::This does now pose a question, would you rather i notified the administrators to perform the merge? As the existing pages in the book such as this one [[LPI_Linux_Certification/LPIC1_Exam_101/Hardware_&amp;_Architecture]] will need splitting and placing into the new layout. I am only to aware of how busy the admins are. [[User:Barry Sharpe|Barry]] 17:28, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
:::::I believe Mike.lifeguard thought you were trying to move a page, and had copy+pasted because you didn't know how to move pages, but what you were trying to do instead was combine two pages. When you plan to combine two pages, you need to copy+paste, because the other page already exists, and add {{tlx|now merged|what page to merge with}} to the page you copy and pasted from, which will allow any active administrators know you need two pages to be merged. A merger is required to preserve the contribution history of other contributors. When you split a page there shouldn't be anything else you need to do. I didn't think that the LPI 101 and 102 test objectives were going to be combined, so I didn't think to tell you what needed to be done when you want you combine two pages. Also since I'm mentioning it, in a more active book with active contributors you would probably want to use {{tlx|mergeto}} and {{tlx|mergefrom}} and discuss merging the pages first. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:17, 22 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Bubble and Squeak''' is a traditional English vegetable dish made from the leftover vegetables from a Sunday roast.  The name is derived from the sound the dish makes while cooking.

==Ingredients==
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped (optional)
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|fat or oil]]
*Various cooked [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]]s, [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], optionally [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]], and [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]].

==Procedure==
#Start by frying a chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] in fat or oil. (if using)
#Chop the vegetables (which will have been boiled the previous day) together, and add to the pan.  
#Cook over a medium heat till the underside is golden brown and crispy, then turn it, scraping the crispy bits into the mix.  
#Repeat the turning and scraping a few times until browned and cooked through, then serve (often on crunchy toast).

'''Christmas pudding''' is the dessert traditionally served on [[Cookbook:Holiday Recipes#Christmas|Christmas]] day in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (especially England) and some other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.  It is sometimes known as '''plum pudding''', though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving a lot of dried fruit.
[[Image:Christmas-pudding-flames.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Christmas pudding being flamed with brandy]]
The pudding needs to be made and cooked well in advance, to allow the flavours to mix (and to save the cook labour on Christmas Day); it is merely reheated when it is to be eaten.

The following is a Sussex recipe for Christmas pudding that is known to have been in annual use for over 50 years without a break, and is believed to have been used largely unaltered since the late nineteenth century, despite the difficulties in gathering the ingredients during the rationing in force in the UK in two world wars.  All measurements are in imperial units (with metric measurements in brackets), generally meaning that volume measurements are 20% larger than with the Queen Anne units used in the USA.  Originally, twice or even four times these quantities would have been made.

(As an aside; Jane Grigson notes in her wonderful book &quot;English Food&quot; that Mrs Beeton's recipe for Steak and Kidney pudding was sent in by a correspondent from Sussex and mentions that by the 1850s, when Mrs Beeton was writing, that Sussex had been famous for its puddings for at least a century.  Mrs Grigson thus conjectured that steak and kidney pudding also had its origins in Sussex.  The most famous pudding indubitably linked to the county is Sussex Pond Pudding, the most magnificent of all suet puddings.)

==Ingredients==
To make '''two''' [[Cookbook:Pint|1-pint]] (0.56 litres) puddings ('''remember:''' use the same measurements throughout (imperial or metric))
*½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound (lb)]] (225g) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]]s
*¾ lb (340g) [[Cookbook:Currant|currant]]s
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultana]]s
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (or less)
*¾ lb (340g) shredded [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] (can be vegetarian; see note below)
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Bread|breadcrumb]]s
*¼ lb (110g) crystallised peel
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons (tsp)]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (55g) [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]]s (chopped, but not too small)
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (about 60g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (about 190ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s (beaten)
*[[Cookbook:Brandy|Brandy]]
*Juice and rind of 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
*1/3 of a [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Procedure==
#Mix and stir well.
#Place in pudding basins, and cover with cloths or buttered greaseproof paper, tied tightly in place with string.
#[[Cookbook:Steaming|Steam]] for 7 hours and keep till Christmas Day.
#To prepare for serving, steam for 2 hours.  Times can be reduced by using a [[Cookbook:Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]].

==Notes==

*Suet can be difficult to find in some countries, e.g. the USA.  Butter is an excellent substitute. To incorporate the butter in the mixture, melt it in a microwave or saucepan, and pour into your mixing bowl.  
*It was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them.  The usual choice was a silver 3d piece (the threepence), or a sixpence.  However this practice fell away once real silver coins were not available, as it was believed that alloy coins would taint the pudding.

*Once turned out of its basin, the Christmas pudding is traditionally decorated with a spray of holly, then dowsed in brandy, flamed, and brought to the table ceremonially - where it should be greeted with a round of applause.  It is best eaten with [[Cookbook:Brandy Butter|brandy butter]], [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (lemon cream is excellent) or [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]].  Christmas puddings have very good keeping properties and many families keep one back from Christmas to be eaten at another celebration later in the year.

Some of the discussion from [[en:Talk:Christmas pudding]]

What is crystallized peel? Orange I presume. Rmhermen 17:27, Dec 18, 2003 (UTC)

mixed citrus, I think, but I'm not sure enough to do an article on it, which is certainly needed. It comes cut into cubes about .5cm. Standard item on the UK cook's shelf but I've never seen it anywhere else (not that I've looked very hard, it's not my personal favourite). seglea 17:39, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC). Also called &quot;candied peel&quot;. seglea

:That's right. Usual recipies have a mixture of [[Orange]], [[Lemon]] and [[Lime]] peel. Candying it requires the use of boiling sugar syrup and is not very hard. In my experience (and following my usual cooking philosophy) I have found that fresh peel is actually a little bit nicer in a Christmas Pudding, but I suspect not everyone would agree. Obviously the candied peel is sweeter. [[User:Francis Davey|Francis Davey]] 16:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

Restoring &quot;the dessert&quot; in the opening sentence. Of course it is not the only dessert ever served on Christmas day, but it is the only one that is traditionally served (which is what the article says), in the sense that anyone in England (I'm never sure about the Scots) would recognise it as the traditional thing to have, even if they hated the stuff and would never serve it themselves.
----

This recipe (less the &quot;Easy White Sauce&quot;) has been in the Matfield Green Kansas USA branch of the Mercer family for at least four generations. Because the family has largely been &quot;teetotalers&quot; since coming to Kansas, brandy was omitted from the recipe several generations ago. That is about to change. In 2006 the pudding will be served at our traditional family Christmas gathering in Wichita flaming, as in Dickens's &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Complex analysis''' is the study of functions of complex variables. Complex analysis is a widely used and powerful tool in certain areas of electrical engineering, and others.

Before we begin, you may want to review [[Algebra/Complex Numbers|Complex numbers]]

==Complex Numbers==
[[Algebra/Complex Numbers|Complex Numbers]]
==Complex Functions==

A function of a complex variable is a function that can take on complex values, as well as strictly real ones. For example, suppose f(z) = z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This function sets up a correspondence between the complex number z and its square, z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, just like a function of a real variable, but with complex numbers.
Note that, for f(z) = z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, f(z) will be strictly real if z is strictly real. 

Generally we can write a function f(z) in the form f(z) = f(x+iy) = a(x,y) + ib(x,y), where a and b are real-valued functions.

== Limits and continuity ==

As with real-valued functions, we have concepts of limits and continuity with complex-valued functions also &amp;ndash; our usual delta-epsilon limit definition:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to w}f(z)=L&lt;/math&gt; iff for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|z-w|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 

Note that &amp;epsilon; and &amp;delta; are real values.  This is implicit in the use of inequalities: only real values are &quot;greater than zero&quot;.

One difference between this definition of limit and the definition for real-valued functions is the meaning of the absolute value.  Here we mean the complex absolute value instead of the real-valued one.  Another difference is that of how ''z'' approaches ''w''.  For real-valued functions, we would only be concerned about ''z'' approaching ''w'' from the left, or from the right.  In a complex setting, ''z'' can approach ''w'' from any direction in the two-dimensional complex plane: along any line passing through ''w'', along a spiral centered at ''w'', etc.

For example, let &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose we want to show that the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to i}f(z)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.  We can write ''z'' as &lt;math&gt;i+\gamma&lt;/math&gt; where we think of
''&amp;gamma;'' being a small complex quantity.  Note then that &lt;math&gt;z-i=\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, with ''L'' in our definition being -1, and ''w'' being i, we have
:&lt;math&gt;| f(z) - L | = | z^2 + 1 | = | (i + \gamma)^2 + 1 | = | 2i\gamma + \gamma;^2 |&lt;/math&gt;
By the triangle inequality, this last expression is less than
:&lt;math&gt;2 | \gamma | + | \gamma |^2&lt;/math&gt;
In order for this to be less than &amp;epsilon;, we can require that 
:&lt;math&gt;| \gamma | &lt; \frac{1}{2} \min( \frac{\epsilon}{2}, \sqrt{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,  if &lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{1}{2} \min( \frac{\epsilon}{2}, \sqrt{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;| z - i |&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;| f(z) - ( - 1) | &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, the limit of &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2&lt;/math&gt; as ''z'' approaches i is -1.

&lt;!-- needs work, come back to this --&gt;
&lt;!-- need to add examples of directional limits --&gt;

==Differentiation and Holomorphic Functions==

Since we have limits defined, we can go ahead to define the ''derivative'' of a complex function, in the usual way:
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} {f(z+\Delta z)-f(z) \over \Delta z}&lt;/math&gt;
provided that the limit is the same no matter how &amp;Delta;''z'' approaches zero (since we are working now in the complex plane, we have more freedom!).

If such a limit exists for some value ''z'', or some set of values - a ''region'', we call the function ''holomorphic'' at that point or region. Continuity and being single-valued are necessary for being analytic; however, continuity and being single-valued are not sufficient for being analytic. 

Many elementary functions of complex values have the same derivatives as those for real functions: for example D ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''z''.

=== Problem set ===
Given the above, answer the following questions.
# Find the derivative of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the limit definition.
# Write ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt; in the form a(''x'', ''y'')+b(''x'', ''y'')i

==== Answers ====
1. &lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} {(z+\Delta z)^3-z^3 \over \Delta z} = 
           \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} 3z^2+3z\Delta z +{\Delta z}^2 = 3 z^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;\ e^z = e^{x+yi} = e^xe^{yi} = e^x(\cos(y)+i \sin(y)) = e^x \cos(y) + e^x \sin(y) i\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Cauchy-Riemann Equations==

We might wonder which sorts of complex functions are in fact differentiable. It would appear that the criterion for holomorphicity is much stricter than that of differentiability for real functions, and this is indeed the case. Suppose we have a complex function
: &lt;math&gt; f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+i\; v(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''u'' and ''v'' are real functions. Assume furthermore that ''u'' and ''v'' are differentiable functions in the real sense. Then we can let &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of differentiability approach 0 by varying only ''x'' or only ''y''. Therefore ''f'' can only be differentiable in the complex sense if
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, if ''u'' and ''v'' are differentiable in the real sense and satisfy these two equations, then ''f'' is holomorphic. These two equations are known as the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

==Integration==

In single variable Calculus, integrals are typically evaluated between two real numbers

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

On the real line, there is one way to get from &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;. In the complex plane, however, there are infinitely many different paths which can be taken between two points, &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, complex integration is always done over a path, rather than between two points.

Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a path in the complex plane parametrized by &lt;math&gt;z: [a,b] \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; be a complex-valued function. Then the contour integral is defined analogously to the line integral from multivariable calculus:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''' Let &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a line from '''0''' to '''1+i'''. This curve can be parametrized by &lt;math&gt;z(t) = t(1+i)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; ranging from 0 to 1. Now we can compute

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_0^1 (t(1+i)) (1+i) dt = \frac{(1+i)^2}{2} = i &lt;/math&gt;

Note that we also have

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \frac{(1+i)^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} = i &lt;/math&gt;

This indicates that complex antiderivatives can be used to simplify the evaluation of integrals, just as real antiderivatives are used to evaluate real integrals.

===Cauchy's Theorem===

Cauchy's theorem states that if a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in the closure of an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a simple closed curve in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This can be understood in terms of Green's theorem, though this does not readily lead to a proof, since Green's theorem only applies under the assumption that f has continuous first partial derivatives...

====Contour Integration====
[[Image:ContourSinzz.gif|right|frame|Contour over which to perform the integration]]

Cauchy's theorem allows for the evaluation of many improper real integrals (improper here means that one of the limits of integration is infinite). As an example, consider

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0, R \to \infty} \int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{\sin x}{x} dx &lt;/math&gt;

Since

: &lt;math&gt; \Im(e^{i z}) = \sin z&lt;/math&gt;

we consider

: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{e^{i z}}{z} &lt;/math&gt;

We now integrate over the indented semicircle contour, pictured above. We parametrize each segment of the contour as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_1(t) = t &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; t \in [-R, -\epsilon] &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_2(t) = t &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; t \in [\epsilon, R] &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_3(t) = \epsilon e^{i t} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, \pi] &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_4(t) = R e^{i t} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, \pi] &lt;/math&gt;

By Cauchy's Theorem, the integral over the whole contour is zero. So,

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) dz + \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz - \int_{\gamma_3} f(z) dz + \int_{\gamma_4} f(z) dz &lt;/math&gt;

We now handle each of these integrals separately.

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) dz = \int_{-R}^{-\epsilon} \frac{e^{i z}}{z} dz = -\int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{e^{-i z}}{z} dz &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz = \int_{\epsilon}^{R} \frac{e^{i z}}{z} dz &lt;/math&gt;

Recalling the definition of the sine of a complex number,

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) dz + \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz = \int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{e^{i z} - e^{-i z}}{z} dz = 2i \int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{\sin x}{x} dx &lt;/math&gt;

Now we evaluate the other two integrals

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_3} f(z) dz = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{e^{- \epsilon e^{it}} i \epsilon e^{i t}}{\epsilon e^{i t}} dt = i \int_0^{\pi} e^{- \epsilon e^{it}} dt &lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the integrand approaches one, so

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{\gamma_3} f(z) dz = i \int_0^{\pi} dt = \pi i &lt;/math&gt;

The fourth integral is equal to zero, but this is somewhat more difficult to show. Its form is similar to that of the third segment:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_4} f(z) dz = \int_0^{\pi} e^{-R e^{it}} dt &lt;/math&gt;

This integrand is more difficult, since it need not approach zero everywhere. This difficulty can be overcome by splitting up the integral, but here we simply assume it to be zero.

Combining everything, we now have

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = 0 = 2 i \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx - \pi i &lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx = \frac{\pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Cauchy's Integral Formula===

Cauchy's integral formula characterizes the behavior of holomorphics functions on a set based on their behavior on the boundary of that set. If &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an open set with a piecewise smooth boundary and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{f(\zeta) d\zeta}{\zeta-z} \ \ \  \forall z \in \Omega &lt;/math&gt;

This is a remarkable fact which has no counterpart in multivariable calculus. It says that if we know the values of a holomorphic function along a closed curve, then we know its values everywhere in the interior of the curve. 

Because &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, an open set, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\zeta-z \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\zeta \in \partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the integrand in Cauchy's integral formula is infinitely differentiable with respect to z, and by repeatedly taking derivatives of both sides, we get

: &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)} (z) = \frac{n!}{2 \pi i} \int_{\partial\Omega} \frac{f(\zeta) d\zeta}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}} \ \ \ \forall z \in \Omega, n \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;

This result shows that holomorphicity is a much stronger requirement than differentiability. In the complex plane, if a function has just a single derivative in an open set, then it has infinitely many derivatives in that set.

===Corollaries of Cauchy's Theorem===

Cauchy's Theorem and integral formula have a number of powerful corollaries:

* '''Convergence of power series''' If a function is holomorphic in a disc, then its Taylor series converges in this disc.
* '''Liouville's Theorem''' If a function is bounded and holomorphic in all of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; then it is equal to a constant.
* '''Fundamental Theorem of Algebra''' All polynomials of degree greater than zero with complex coefficients have a complex root. This is a simple corollary of Liouville's theorem.
* '''Equality of functions''' If two functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are holomorphic on a connected, open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(z)=g(z)&lt;/math&gt; on any disc in this set, then &lt;math&gt;f(z)=g(z)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Do you really think that subtraction is a binary opperation? In fact, addition is an abelian (semi)group (depends if you have already negative integers or not). Minus is the the _unary_ operation of inversion, hence a+(-a)=0, where 0=zero is the unit element of the (semi)group. In the case of addition one should hence write a+(-b) and not a-b. This solves the commutativity problem, since a+(-b)=(-b)+a. The notiopn a-b can then be introduced as a shorthand. While I would not recommend to introduce abelian groups at this level, I would strictly object against the introduction of a binary operator called minus, July 26, 2004 BF.

[[User:Paul|Paul]] - What are we trying to do here with this page?  There doesn't seem to be a comprehensible focus on the page.  My take on it is that we're trying to create a maths textbook that can be used to teach someone arithmetic - if that's the case then what are all those useless bits and pieces about subtrahend and Numerical Axioms doing in there?

On the other hand, if we're trying to document Arithmetic for someone seriously studying the root of mathematics, why have exercises asking for the solution of 5-3?

It doesn't make sense that exercises as simple as 5-3=? would be on the same page as words like subtrahend.

: It was my impression that the page was for a brush-up lesson on the basics of arithmetic necessary for using algebra.  Subtrahend (and the other higher-level stuff) would therefore be the extraneous information. - [[User:Jonel|Jonel]]

Whoever posted anonymously made a very good point about the order of operations.  I've cleaned it up a little; if you think it needs more work feel free to alter it.  As for the etiquette, for the most part if you see something that needs to be fixed you should just go ahead and fix it.  If you're unsure, put a message in this talk page.  [[User:Jonel|Jonel]]

:Actually - that was me before I registered as a user :) The editing looks fine to me.  I tihnk I'm going to enjoy working on this project! - [[User:Paul|Paul]]

I don't think that this section is in keeping with the idea of this page, but it might be useful on another page for more advanced work.  So I will just leave it here on the talk page for now. [[User:Jonel|Jonel]]

== &quot;Absolute Value&quot; of Complex numbers ==
For [[Algebra/Complex Numbers|complex numbers]], the absolute value or ''modulus'' presents us with a different concept. A number in the Argand plane has a rotation from the real axis through angle &amp;theta; and a distance away from zero, r. By using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and a bit of [[trigonometry]], we can generalize the complex number to be a triangle, and we obtain that the modulus is the same as the real value squared plus the imaginary value squared (See [[Algebra/Complex Numbers]] for more detail).

:z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Re(z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+Im(z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

then
:|z|= &amp;radic;(Re(z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+Im(z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

It is important to note that if z has imaginary part zero; ie z is purely real, this method is equivalent to finding the absolute value as well.

Under '''Addition''', a &quot;previous section&quot; is referred to.  There is no previous section.  This is the first section of '''Math'''.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 12:51, 13 May 2004 (UTC)

== BODMAS ==

Hello. I'm using this Wikibook to come to grips with maths in english. In my native language (Dutch) I'm pretty clued up, but the language barrier is keeping me from understanding a lot of maths-related stuff in english. Just now I stumbled upon something which I can't quite understand:

&quot;There are a number of different abbreviations for memorizing the order. PEMDAS, BEDMAS and BODMAS (B is Brackets) are common.&quot; I can't figure out where the O in BODMAS comes from? Care to enlighten,  anybody?

[edit] The &quot;O&quot; stands for Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
       The &quot;O&quot; has also been taught simply as &quot;OF&quot;; Brackets of Divison etc.

Thanks to all contributors for taking the time to write all this. Perhaps I'm a bit simple-minded, but I feel the book could do with some graphics (even non-functional graphics), both to break the text apart in more managable chunks, and to make it more appealing from a visual point of view.

== Order of operations ==
I feel that this page is not the correct place to introduce anything to do with negative numbers, such as -2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This important concept should be introduced after the multiplication of integers.  I would rather it not be a subtraction problem from zero, but a multiplication by negative one.  --[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 22:48, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== Long multiplication? ==

Can there be some information about how to multiply large numbers, say 34 * 281 or whatever.


addition and the other operations too, for that matter. this wikibook gives excercises for them, but does not explain the method of solution. [[User:206.15.236.254|206.15.236.254]] 16:57, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

== Exercises ==

I think it would be good to add exercises to each arithmetic section. I performed all exercises so far and found some holes in my understanding that I would not get from the explanations alone. Particularly, start from simple to advanced within 25 problems so the student can get a real feel for what they are lacking. I will create some of my own and add it here in a couple of days if no one has any objections.:)

== missing pages with problems ==

I marked this page fair for completeness due to the missing pages when you try to go to the problems for each category on this page.  only the pages for addition and subtraction exist. 
[[User:Kweeks|Kweeks]] ([[User talk:Kweeks|talk]]) 11:21, 6 September 2010 (UTC)

== &quot;Addition&quot; ==

Why in quot.marks? Cause the issue is not about addition while the passage is out of there: {{quote|To define the number one is a rather difficult task, but we all have a good intuitive sense of what &quot;oneness&quot; is.}}
O'k, not a very good way...
Know what I think? I think that we '''can′t''' define ''oneness'' without ''quantity''. Moreover, the concept of quantity '''is''' of the premises to the ''oneness'' not otherwise. No oneness does exist without a quantity prior to that. The quantity is a natural concept — '''then''' somebody, planning to organise the surrounding, chooses the units.&lt;br/&gt;
You may argue that '''there is''' a natural concept of oneness - when considering some indivisible objects — for example humans etc. (apples etc.). Somebody could say that either humans or, especially, apples '''can''' be divided. To those, it will be recalled that the objects should strictly retain their immanent parameters so as to remain being considered '''equal''' or '''comparable''' '''in the same way'''.&lt;br/&gt;Well, it was an interlude. So... Somebody says &quot;what about 'natural objects'?&quot; — thus resolving the phantom paradox: saying &quot;natural&quot;.
Now, I agree that there are objects which may imply some ''natural oneness''. BUT THEY ARE ONLY &quot;NATURAL&quot;, COUNTABLE OBJECTS. Linguistics seems giving the best answer to solving such ambiguities: remember the classes of nouns in English:)
So, this way we '''have''' NATURAL DICHOTOMY between the countable and the uncountable. So we should choose the way of approach to our dilemma: either we introduce here in &quot;Arithmetics&quot; the natural numbers first — or we're defining ''the quantity'' as a prior to any units perceptional concept...

=== Logarithms ===

It is arguable that the introduction of digital technologies has largely replaced the need for logarithms at this level of mathematics. If so, is this section necessary?

This is the recipe for the traditional '''Madeira Honey Cake''', usually made on Christmas but also all year round on the island of Madeira and originally named in Portuguese ''bolo de mel''.  It is made with &quot;mel de cana&quot; which literally means &quot;cane honey,&quot; otherwise known as molasses.

==Procedure==
#One day before making the cake, buy the bread-dough at the baker's shop, sprinkle a little bit of flour on the dough, put it in a towel and keep it in a warm place until the next day.   
#Put the baking soda into the Madeira wine, dissolve. In a pan warm up the molasses, mix the butter and pork fat (if not available, just use butter), dissolve. Let this mixture cool.  
#Sift flour into a bowl, mix in the sugar, make a well and put the bread dough into it. Now work the flour-sugar mixture into the bread dough. As soon as this is well joined, start to incorporate little by little the (tepid) molasses-fat mixture.   Add some of the candied lemon peel, as well as the Madeira wine, orange juice and orange zest, anise, cinnamon, and cloves. 
#Incorporate and knead thoroughly until the dough doesn't stick to the bowl. Cover the dough with a towel and put it in a warm spot. Keep it in a warm place for 3-4 days. 
#Divide the dough into parts of 250g or 500g or 750 g, depending on the pans to put into the oven.  This cake is made in wide, round pans which are rather low.  Before going into the oven, the cake is decorated with half-walnuts, sliced almonds and the rest of the candied lemon peel.  
#Grease the baking pans. Bake about 50 minutes 355 °F (180 °C). Let cool down before taking it out of the baking pan.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*In Madeira these honey cakes are made on 8 December, which is traditionally considered the day of Mary's Immaculate Conception, because tradition says this cake is only good for Christmas if it is made on this day.
*It is a custom to make enough of this cake in order to have some during the whole year. Once cooled and thoroughly wrapped into vegetable paper it remains good until next Christmas without losing quality or taste.
*Another tradition surrounding this cake is that it is not cut with knives, but by hand, and also eaten by hand, nothing more than a tradition but very respected among Madeira locals.
*Fennel is often used instead of anise.  Raisins are sometimes added.

==Modern meat-free Christmas mince pies==
This is the recipe for fruity mince pies which we all know and love and eat at Christmas time. These typically do not contain minced beef, however they may not be completely vegetarian. Fruit mince can sometimes contain suet.

===Ingredients===
*Fruit mince, either homemade or shop bought
*Shortcrust pastry, either homemade or shop bought

===Method===
# Line greased tartlet pans with shortcrust pastry circlets.
# Spoon heaped teaspoons of mince into each pie
# Top the tartlets with slightly smaller circles of pastry, preferably cut with a fluted cutter
# Bake until golden brown.
#(Optional)  Just before serving, dust pies with a light sprinkling of icing sugar.


==Classic (with meat)==
'''Mince Pies, not very rich''' -- Take 4 pounds of beef after it has been boiled and chopped, 1 pound of suet, 2 pounds of sugar, 2 pounds of raisins, and 4 pounds of chopped apples, mix these together with a pint of wine and cider, to make it thin enough; season to your taste with mace, nutmeg, and orange-peel; if it is not sweet enough, put in more sugar. Warm the pies before they are eaten. Where persons are not fond of suet, put butter instead, and stew the apples instead of so much cider. 

{{1881}}

==Modernized (with meat)==

===Ingredients===
* 1815 g lean diced [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 454 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], or vegetable shortening.  Diced.
* 907 g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 907 g [[Cookbook:Fruit mix|fruit mix]]
* 1815 g sliced, cored [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
* 350 ml [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 250 ml [[Cookbook:Cider|cider]]
* zest and juice from one fruit citrus fruit
* A quarter of a teaspoon of Mace
* A quarter of a teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|Nutmeg]]
* Five packets of short pastry.

===Procedure===
# Sear diced beef in a pan till meat is well coloured (this can be done in batches).  Set aside till cool.
# Wash, core and slice apples.
# Combined all ingredients in a bowl.  Mix well (this step can be done in batches).
# Using three, greased, deep, pie trays (or five greased muffin trays, for tartlets), use the pastry to line the tray, to create a pie shell.   
# Place tray, with shell, into oven and set to 150 degrees Celsius.  Bake until lightly golden.  Remove from oven.  Rest pie shells till cool.
#  Fill pie shells with mixture, till level or a slight mound above the rim. Trim with excess pastry.
# Bake at 150 degrees Celsius for forty five minutes per tray (thirty five minutes per muffin tray).

Serves 15 to 20 people.

==Modernised, alternative version, also with meat==

===Ingredients===
* 1 kg lean pork mince
* 100 g butter
* 400 g sugar
* 1 kg fruit mix
* 800 g sliced, cored apples (12 large apples)

* zest and juice from one lemon
* A quarter of a teaspoon of Mace
* A quarter of a teaspoon of Nutmeg
* One vanilla pod
* One cinnamon quill
* Two packets of short pastry
* Three greased muffin tins

===Procedure===
# Pre-heat oven to 150 degrees Celsius.
# In a pot, simmer the wine, cider, orange, and lemon juice.  Add mace, nutmeg and cinnamon quill.  Slit vanilla pod and scrape seeds into pot.  Discard vanilla pod.
# Wash, core and slice apples.  Add to pot, and stir.
# Add fruit mix to pot.  Stir.
# Line grease muffin tins, with pastry to make tartlets cases.  Trim to fit. 
# Place tray, with cases, into oven and set at 150 degrees Celsius.  Bake until lightly golden.  Remove from oven.  Rest pie shells.un
# Melt butter in a pan.  Sauté minced pork till browned.
# Remove cinnamon quill from pot.  Incorporate pork and butter into the mixture in pot.
# Using a tablespoon; fill tartlet cases with filling from pot.  The filling will probably be mounded.
# (Optional)  Trim with excess pastry.
# Bake each tray at 120 degrees Celsius for half an hour.

Makes 36 tartlets.

Discussion from [[en:Talk:Mince pie]]

Couple of suggestions, since you mentioned you're not finished:

* How about using either metric or English measurements throughout, but not both?

* This isn't analytical chemistry - how about rounding off numbers like &quot;1814 g&quot; to 1.8 kg (or even 2 kg)?

* Please insert a space between a number and its unit.

Thanks!  :-)  -- [[User:Marj Tiefert|Marj Tiefert]] 18:41 Aug 2, 2002 (PDT)

A couple of responces since I've finished:

*The 'spoons are the random variable of good cooking and the metric system.  Otherwise known as &quot;Too much!&quot;, or &quot;Too little.&quot;

*The art of good desserts, MUST follow the strict standard of analytical chemistry.  No comprimises will be allowed!

*No.

Spot the sarcasm.=P

'''Guacamole Dip''' is a spicy Mexican dip made from blended avocado and cream, and seasonings like onions, peppers, garlic and cilantro (coriander). It is the perfect companion for corn chips, ''totopos'' or potato chips.

== Ingredients ==

The ingredients and quantities of this recipe are approximate, and they depend on the desired consistency and &quot;''picor''&quot;

* 1 ripe [[Cookbook:avocado|avocado]]
* 1 cup of [[Cookbook:cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] or [[Cookbook:yoghurt|yoghurt]]
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* 1/4 regular [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], cut in large pieces
* 4 [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]] stems with leaves
* 1 serrano pepper (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] to thin the dip, as needed
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste 

== Procedure ==
Put the garlic, onion pieces, cilantro and serrano pepper into a blender.  Pulse for a few seconds, don't over do it.  Halve the avocado and scoop the flesh into the bowl. Add the cream and pulse the blender for a few seconds. Taste the mixture and add salt or more seasonings as desired.  Pulse the blender a little bit more. If the mixture is too thick, add a tablespoon of milk and pulse the blender. It can be served immediately or stored by covering the mixture with plastic wrap.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alkynes are hydrogenated in generally the same way as alkenes. However, standard catalysts like Pd/C will not allow hydrogenation to stop before the alkane stage.  A &quot;poisoned catalyst&quot; will permit the reduction of a triple bond to a double bond by ''syn'' addition, but no further.  A common poisoned catalyst is Lindlar's catalyst: Pd/CaCO3 treated with quinoline and lead acetate.

''Anti'' addition of hydrogen atoms can be achieved with a dissolving metal reduction.

== Dissolving Metal Reduction ==

The dissolving metal reaction takes place in a solution of sodium or lithium metal dissolved in liquid ammonia. An alkali metal is dissolved in liquid ammonia and forms a solution containing solvated electrons.

[[Image:solution.GIF]]

Once an alkyne is added to the solution, the electrons add to the antibonding π molecular orbital and produce a radical-anion intermediate.  This intermediate has one unpaired electron and has a negative charge.

[[Image:stepone.GIF]]

The radical anion then reacts with a proton source (generally ethanol or tertiary-butyl alcohol which is added to the ammonia) to yield a vinyl radical.  The radical then accepts another electron and forms a carbanion.  

[[Image:step2&amp;3.GIF]]

The alkene is formed when the vinyl carbanion is protonated.  Protonation normally occurs from the side of the double bond that is least sterically hindered, so a trans-alkene is produced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several ways to halogenate Alkenes. The simplest is by adding appropriate hydrogen halides, where the reaction follows Markovnikov's rule.  This rule states that the halogen will become bonded to the more highly substituted carbon.  This is a result of greater carbocation stability of more highly substituted carbon atoms, which have more ability to distribute the positive charge to the attached alkyl groups.  When both carbon atoms have the same number of substituents, a mixture of products will often result.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Robert. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Robert~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Haskell''' is a [[Computer programming/Functional programming|functional programming]] language.  If you have some programming experience, see the [[/Overview|overview]] to see a bit of how Haskell works and is different from other languages.

Haskell is distinct in a few ways:

* Haskell is a ''pure'' functional programming language. If you call the same function twice in two different places with the same arguments, it will return exactly the same value both times.
* Haskell provides a modern type system with sophisticated features like typeclasses and generalized algebraic data types (soon enough, terms like those will roll smoothly off your tongue).
* Haskell is also a ''lazy'' language that does calculations only when they are needed to get a final result.

Haskell programmers enjoy their language because dealing with only pure functions makes code much easier to understand and each function's correctness much easier to analyze and even to prove. Moreover, the advanced type system helps catch mistakes, both silly and profound.

In this book we aim to introduce you both to the Haskell language, from the very basics to advanced features, and to computer programming in general.  We urge seasoned programmers to be especially patient with this process.  In all likelihood, the languages you are most familiar with differ greatly from Haskell, and habits from those languages might make it more difficult to understand how things work − they are simple, but different. Face learning to see the world through the warped mindset of a functional programmer as an adventure in a brave new world, which will bring you understanding valuable far beyond the boundaries of any language.

== Overview ==
The book is divided into a Beginner's Track, an Advanced Track, and a section called ''Haskell in Practice'' which covers more day-to-day issues and uses mostly only items from the Beginner's Track.

{{Info|Please contribute! Anyone, regardless of Haskell competency, can help out. Spend five minutes improving a module and save someone else hours of time. Check out the [[/Notes for contributors|notes for contributors]]. Even if you get confused by a page, tell us about it on the discussion page (politely, of course).}}

== Search ==
The following box can be used to search for content in the book:

{{Book search|float=center}}

== Beginner's Track ==

With the basics of the language and some of the more frequently used libraries, you will be able to build simple programs.

Most chapters contain exercises that help you test your understanding. At the end of each chapter is a link to the solutions, so you can check your accuracy or learn the answers if you are stuck.

LỜITỰA&lt;font&gt; &lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;
# The Vedas are the lighthouse of eternal wisdom leading man to salvation and inspiring him to supreme accomplishment. 
# The omnipresence of eternal Being, unmanifested and absolute; Its status as That, even in the manifested diversity of action; and the possibility of the realization of Being by any man in terms of himself—these are the great truths of the perennial philosophy of the Vedas. 
# The Vedas reveal the unchanging Unity of life which underlies the evident multiplicity of creation, for Reality is both manifest and unmanifest, and That alone is. ‘I am That, thou art That and all this is That’, is the Truth; and this is the kernel of the Vedic Teaching, which the Rishis extol as teaching ‘worthy of hearing, contemplating and realizing’. 
# The truth of Vedic Wisdom is by its very nature independent of time and can therefore never be lost When, however, man’s vision becomes one sided and he is caught by the binding influence of the phenomenal world to the exclusion of the absolute phase of Reality, when he is thus confined within the ever-changing phases of existence, his life loses stability and he begins to suffer. When suffering grows, the invincible force of Nature moves to set man’s vision right and establish a way of life which will again fulfil the high purpose of his existence. The long history of the world records many such periods in which the ideal pattern of life is first forgotten and then restored to man. 
# Veda Vyasa, the sage of enlightened vision and greatest among the historians of antiquity, records the growth of unrighteousness in the families of those who ruled the people about five thousand years ago. It was then that Lord Krishna came to remind man of the true values of life and living. He restored that direct contact with the transcendental Being which alone can give fullness to every aspect of life. He brought to light absolute Being as the basic Reality of life and established It as the foundation of all thinking, which in turn is the basis of all doing. This philosophy of Being, thinking and doing is the true philosophy of the integrated life. It not only helps the doer to gain success in his undertaking, but, at the same time, sets him free from the bondage of action, bringing fulfilment at every level. Such is the teaching of eternal Truth, given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna in the Bhagavad-Gita. 
# Gradually this teaching came to be forgotten, so that two thousand years later even the principle of Being as the absolute Reality, the source and basis of all creation, was overshadowed by misguided beliefs which glorified only the relative aspects of life. “The long lapse of time”, says Lord Krishna, is the reason for such a loss of wisdom. 
# When the philosophy of the integrated life restored by Lord Krishna was lost from view, the idea grew that everything which life can offer is present on the obvious levels of existence, and that it would therefore be useless to aspire to anything that might lie deeper than external appearances. Society became dominated by this superficial outlook, insight into Reality was lost, the right sense of values forgotten and the stability of life destroyed. Tension, confusion, superstition, unhappiness and fear prevailed. 
# Lord Buddha came to remedy this situation. Finding the field of action distorted, He came with a message of right action. Speaking from His level of consciousness established in Being, in eternal freedom (Nirvana), Lord Buddha taught the philosophy of action in freedom. He advocated meditation in order to purify the field of thought through direct contact with Being and bring about the state of right action in society. Lord Buddha’s message was complete because He incorporated the fields of Being, thinking, and doing in His theme of revival. But because his followers failed to correlate these different fields of life in a systematic manner through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, realization of Being as the basis of a good life became obscured. The whole structure of Lord Buddha”s teaching not only became distorted but was also turned upside down. The effect was mistaken for the cause. Right action came to be regarded as a means to gain Nirvana, whereas right action is in fact the result of this state of consciousness in freedom. 
# It has been the misfortune of every teacher that, while he speaks from his level of consciousness, his followers can only receive his message on their level; and the gulf between the teaching and understanding grows wider with time. 
# The teaching of right action without due emphasis on the primary necessity of realization of Being is like building a wall without a foundation. It sways with the wind and collapses before long. Within three or four hundred years all real connection between the essential teachings of Lord Buddha and the daily life of His followers had disappeared. Insight into the principle of the integrated life was again lost. Having forgotten the prime importance of realizing Being, society became immersed once more in the superficialities of life. 
# Nature will not allow humanity to be deprived of the vision of Reality for very long. A wave of revival brought Shankara to re-establish the basis of life and renew human understanding. Shankara restored the wisdom of the Absolute and established It in the daily life of the people, strengthening the fields of thought and action by the power of Being. He brought the message of fulfilment through direct realization of transcendental Being in the state of Self-consciousness, which is the basis of all good in life. 
# Shankara’s emphasis on Self-realization stems from the eternal philosophy of the integrated life expressed by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita when He asks Arjuna first to ‘be without the three Gunas’ and then to perform actions while thus established in Being That all men should at all times live the bliss-consciousness of absolute Being, and that they should live the state of fulfilment in God Consciousness throughout all thought, speech, and action; this is the essence of Shankara’s message, as it is the essence of Lord Krishna’s and of the entire Vedic Philosophy. 
# The greatest blessing that Shankara’s teaching has offered to the world is the principle of fullness of intellectual and emotional development in the state of enlightenment, based on transcendental pure consciousness, in which the heart is so pure as to be able to flow and overflow with waves of universal love and devotion to God, while the mind is so refined as to enjoy awareness of the divine nature as separate from the world of action. 
# The spontaneous expressions of Shankara’s mind and heart in this state of freedom and fulfilment have been a source of inspiration both to those who live by the heart and those who live by the mind. His consciousness exemplified the highest state of human development; his heart expressed supreme transcendental devotion to God (Para Bhakti, while his mind expressed awareness of the Self as separate from the field of action (Gyan). This it was that led Shankara’s speech to flow into ecstasies of devotion and at the same time into clear expressions of knowledge, the dry and hard-headed truths concerning divine nature as detached from the world. These are the two aspects of the living reality of a life in complete fulfilment. 
# Shankara not only revived the wisdom of integrated life and made it popular in his day, but also established four principal seats of learning in four corners of India to keep his teaching pure and to ensure that it would be propagated in its entirety generation after generation. For many centuries his teaching remained alive in his followers, who lived the ideal state of knowledge with devotion (Gyan and Bhakti). But in spite of all his foresight and endeavours, Shankara’s message inevitably suffered with time the same misfortunes as those of the other great teachers. 
# If the occupants of a house forget the foundations, it is because the foundations lie underground, hidden from view. It is no surprise that Being was lost to view, for It lies in the transcendental field of life. 
# The state of Reality, as described by the enlightened, cannot become a path for the seeker, any more than the description of a destination can replace the road that leads to it. When the truth that Being forms the basis of the state of enlightenment became obscured, Shankara’s statements about the nature of the goal were mistaken for the path to realization. 
# This misunderstanding was increased by the very beauty of Shankara’s eloquence. His expressions of deep devotion made in the state of complete surrender and oneness with God, and his intellectual clarifications made in the state of awareness of the divine nature, are both so full and complete in themselves that, seen from the ordinary level of consciousness, they appeared to present two independent paths to enlightenment: the path of knowledge and the path of devotion. 
# This is the tragedy of knowledge, the tragic fate that knowledge must meet at the hands of ignorance. It is inevitable, because the teaching comes from one level of consciousness and is received at quite a different level. The knowledge of Unity must in time shatter on the hard rocks of ignorance. History has proved this again and again. Shankara’s teaching could not prove an exception to the rule. 
# The idea of two paths became more predominant owing to the carelessness of the custodians of Shankara’s teaching. Since they followed the recluse way of life, they were naturally concerned with thoughts of the separateness of the Divine from the world; and, with the continuance of this situation generation after generation, the aspect of knowledge began to dominate Shankara’s tradition while the aspect of devotion gradually lost its importance. The teaching became one-sided and, deprived of its wholeness, eventually lost its universal appeal. It came to be regarded as Mayavada, a philosophy of illusion, holding the world to be only illusory and emphasizing the detached way of life. 
# As the principle of Being began more and more to disappear from view, the paths of devotion and knowledge became more and more separate and finally the link between them was lost. The principle of full development of heart and mind through one process (Transcendental Meditation) was lost. The integral nature of realization was lost. The true wisdom of life’s fulfilment, which lies in the simultaneous development of heart and mind, was lost. The idea that devotion and knowledge are necessarily separate was the greatest blow to Shankara’s teaching. 
# In the absence of the moon, the stars take over and provide as much light as they can. When Shankara’s high ideal of transcendental devotion disappeared from sight, Ramanuja, Madhva, and other teachers upheld the path of devotion, even though without its proper basis in Being. People followed them, and thus there arose many devotional sects all on the level of emotion and every one founded on the comfortable basis of hope that ‘some day our prayer will be heard, some day He will come to us and call us to Him’. Indeed a comfort to the heart but, alas, such devotion is on the imaginary plane of feeling! It is far, far away from the reality of actual contact between the devotee and his God. Awareness in the state of Being alone makes the whole field of devotion real. 
# All these sects hold that transcendental devotion is the last stage of a devotee’s achievement. But Shankara’s principle of devotion is founded on Transcendental Consciousness from the very beginning The first step for Shankara is the last step for these devotional sects, a step which according to their understanding is far above the reach of the ordinary man. 
# The idea that devotion must start from Transcendental Consciousness having been lost by the guardians of Shankara’s wisdom, entrance into the field of devotion was closed. Seekers of God remained seeking in thin air, and lovers of God remained weeping for Him without finding Him. 
# As devotion remained merely on the level of thinking and of assuming an attitude of feeling (mood-making), so knowledge met with the same fate once the direct way to the realization of Transcendental Consciousness had been lost. Understanding of the Unity of life cannot be significant until one has thoroughly understood, by direct experience, that one’s inner divine nature is separate from the world of action. If a man has not gained consciousness in Being through the practice of Transcendental Meditation he continues to live in ignorance and bondage. Because he has not yet opened himself to the experience of the separateness of the Divine from the world, the thought of Unity has no practical use for such a man. He bas nothing to unite. 
# On the fertile field of Transcendental Consciousness both knowledge and devotion find their fulfilment. But this principle once forgotten and the technique for developing Transcendental Consciousness lost, many, many generations have died without seeing the light of God and without gaining fulfilment. That has been the situation for more than a thousand years. Misunderstanding itself has taken the shape of a tradition, unfortunately known as Shankara’s tradition. This great loss to human life can hardly be compensated; but that has been the course of history. Time cannot be recaptured. It is no use repenting the past. 
# In our review of the rise and fall of Truth, we must not lose sight of the great impact that Shankara produced on Indian life. It was the perfection of his presentation that caused Shankara’s teaching to be accepted as the core of Vedic Wisdom and placed it at the centre of Indian culture. It became so inseparable from the Indian way of life that when, in course of time, this teaching lost its universal character and came to be interpreted as for the recluse order alone, the whole basis of Indian culture also began to be considered in terms of the recluse way of life, founded on renunciation and detachment. 
# When this detached view of life became accepted as the basis of Vedic Wisdom, the wholeness of life and fulfilment was lost. This error of understanding has dominated Indian culture for centuries and has turned the principle of life upside down. Life on the basis of detachment! This is a complete distortion of Indian philosophy. It has not only destroyed the path of realization but has led the seekers of Truth continuously astray. Indeed it has left them without the possibility of ever finding the goal. 

# Not only was the path to enlightenment lost, but the entire art of living disappeared in the clouds of ignorance which obscured every phase of life. Even religion became blind to itself. Instead of directly helping people to gain God Consciousness and act rightly on that basis, religious preachers began to teach that right action is in itself a way to purification and thereby to God Consciousness. 
# Without Being, confusion of cause and effect invaded every field of understanding. It captured even the most practical field of the philosophy of Yoga. Karma Yoga (attainment of Union by way of action) began to be understood as based on Karma (action), whereas its basis is Yoga, Union, Transcendental Consciousness. The founder of the Yoga philosophy, Patanjali, was himself misinterpreted and the order of stages on his eightfold path reversed. The practice of Yoga was understood to start with Yama, Niyama, and so on (the secular virtues), whereas in reality it should begin with Samadhi. Samadhi cannot be gained by the practice of Yama, Niyama, and so on. Proficiency in the virtues can only be gained by repeated experiences of Samadhi. It was because the effect was mistaken for the cause that this great philosophy of life became distorted and the path to Samadhi was blocked. 
# With the loss of insight into Yoga, the other five classical systems of Indian philosophy lost their power. They remained on the theoretical level of knowledge, for it is through Yoga alone that knowledge steps into practical life. 
# Thus we find that all fields of religion and philosophy have been misunderstood and wrongly interpreted for many centuries past. This has blocked the path to the fullest development of heart and mind, so precisely revived by Shankara. 
# Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and other Indian scriptures are now so full of the idea of renunciation that they are regarded with distrust by practical men in every part of the world. Many Western universities hesitate to teach Indian philosophy for this reason. The responsibility for this loss of Truth to the whole world lies with the interpretations of Shankara’s teaching; missing the essence of his wisdom, they have bean unable to save the world from falling ever deeper into ignorance and suffering. 
# This age has, however, been fortunate. It has witnessed the living example of a man inspired by Vedic Wisdom in its wholeness and thus able to revive the philosophy of the integrated life in all its truth and fullness. His Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the inspiration and guiding light of this commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita, adorned the seat of the Shankaracharya of the North and, glowing in divine radiance, embodied in himself the head and heart of Shankara. He expounded the Truth in Its all-embracing nature. His quiet words, coming from the unbounded love of his heart, pierced the hearts of all who heard him and brought enlightenment to their minds. His message was the message of fullness of heart and mind. He moved as the living embodiment of Truth and was addressed as Vedanta Incarnate by that great Indian philosopher, now President of India, Dr Radhakrishnan. 
# It was the concern of Guru Deva, His Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, to enlighten all men everywhere that resulted in the foundation of the world-wide Spiritual Regeneration Movement in 1958, five years after his departure from us. 
# India is a country where Truth matters most and Indians are a people to whom God matters most. Indian soil has witnessed many times the revival of life’s true philosophy. The people of India have never hesitated to return once more to the right path whenever it was convincingly pointed out to them that their way of life had taken a wrong course. This receptiveness to Truth of the Indian people has always been a source of inspiration and a signal of hope to all movements aiming at the revival of true life and living. 
# May the present commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita produce the desired effect in response to the historical necessity of today. 
# The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching. If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also.

This error of understanding has dominated Indian culture for centuries and has turned the principle of life upside down. Life on the basis of detachment! This is a complete distortion of Indian philosophy. It has not only destroyed the path of realization but has led the seekers of Truth continuously astray. Indeed it has left them without the possibility of ever finding the goal. 

# Not only was the path to enlightenment lost, but the entire art of living disappeared in the clouds of ignorance which obscured every phase of life. Even religion became blind to itself. Instead of directly helping people to gain God Consciousness and act rightly on that basis, religious preachers began to teach that right action is in itself a way to purification and thereby to God Consciousness. 
# Without Being, confusion of cause and effect invaded every field of understanding. It captured even the most practical field of the philosophy of Yoga. Karma Yoga (attainment of Union by way of action) began to be understood as based on Karma (action), whereas its basis is Yoga, Union, Transcendental Consciousness. The founder of the Yoga philosophy, Patanjali, was himself misinterpreted and the order of stages on his eightfold path reversed. The practice of Yoga was understood to start with Yama, Niyama, and so on (the secular virtues), whereas in reality it should begin with Samadhi. Samadhi cannot be gained by the practice of Yama, Niyama, and so on. Proficiency in the virtues can only be gained by repeated experiences of Samadhi. It was because the effect was mistaken for the cause that this great philosophy of life became distorted and the path to Samadhi was blocked. 
# With the loss of insight into Yoga, the other five classical systems of Indian philosophy lost their power. They remained on the theoretical level of knowledge, for it is through Yoga alone that knowledge steps into practical life. 
# Thus we find that all fields of religion and philosophy have been misunderstood and wrongly interpreted for many centuries past. This has blocked the path to the fullest development of heart and mind, so precisely revived by Shankara. 
# Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and other Indian scriptures are now so full of the idea of renunciation that they are regarded with distrust by practical men in every part of the world. Many Western universities hesitate to teach Indian philosophy for this reason. The responsibility for this loss of Truth to the whole world lies with the interpretations of Shankara’s teaching; missing the essence of his wisdom, they have bean unable to save the world from falling ever deeper into ignorance and suffering. 
# This age has, however, been fortunate. It has witnessed the living example of a man inspired by Vedic Wisdom in its wholeness and thus able to revive the philosophy of the integrated life in all its truth and fullness. His Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the inspiration and guiding light of this commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita, adorned the seat of the Shankaracharya of the North and, glowing in divine radiance, embodied in himself the head and heart of Shankara. He expounded the Truth in Its all-embracing nature. His quiet words, coming from the unbounded love of his heart, pierced the hearts of all who heard him and brought enlightenment to their minds. His message was the message of fullness of heart and mind. &lt;font color=blue&gt;Ngài sống như một hiệnthể của Chânlý. Dr Radhakrishnan, một đại triếtgia Ấn thờiấy, hiệnlà Tổngthống của Ấnđộ, gọi ngài là Hiệnthể của Vedanta. 
# Đây là mối quantâm của Guru Deva, Đức ThánhThần Swami Brahmananda Saraswati,&lt;/font&gt; to enlighten all men everywhere that resulted in the foundation of the world-wide Spiritual Regeneration Movement &lt;font color=blue&gt;năm 1958, năm năm sau ngày Ngài từdã chúngta. 
# Ấnđộ là một nước mà Chânlý&lt;/font&gt; matters most &lt;font color=blue&gt;và NgườiẤn là một dântộc mà ThượngĐế&lt;/font&gt; matters most. Indian soil has witnessed many times the revival of life’s true philosophy. The people of India have never hesitated to return once more to the right path whenever it was convincingly pointed out to them that their way of life had taken a wrong course. This receptiveness to Truth of the Indian people has always been a source of inspiration and a signal of hope to all movements aiming at the revival of true life and living. 
# May the present commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita produce the desired effect in response to the historical necessity of today. 
# The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching. If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also. &lt;font color=blue&gt;

Science explores into the actuality of forms and phenomena. All the branches of science are the various ways to realize the truth of existence. The approach of each of them starts from the obvious known and aims at investigating the hidden unknown. The ultimate truth of life is being approached from all directions. All the sciences are exploring the various strata of creation, from the gross to the subtler fields of existence.

The Science of Being, as does every other science, starts its investigation into the truth of existence from the gross, obvious level of life and later enters into the subtle regions of experience. The Science of Being, however, eventually transcends these subtle regions and arrives at the direct experience of the transcendental field of eternal Being.

The Science of Being is a deep and practical philosophy of life. It is a systematic investigation into the true nature of the ultimate reality. Although, like any other science, it is theoretical in its nature, its applied aspects reach much farther horizons of the supreme reality of life than those of abstract metaphysical speculations.

The field of Being or absolute existence was for many centuries considered in terms of mysticism. The present scientific age hesitates to assign value to anything shrouded in the garb of mysticism, and that is why the study of Being, the absolute field of creation, has not been a part of any branch of science until now.

A systematic method has been developed that enables an individual to experience directly the pure state of Being. It is done by consciously entering into the experience of the subtle strata of a thought, eventually arriving at the direct experience of the subtlest state of the thought, and then arriving at the very source of thought. Then the conscious mind attains the pure state of Being.

The Science of Being, which gives rise to the practical art of living, is a science which is much more valuable for human life than all the sciences known so far to the human mind. For, up to now, the basis of all the sciences has been the human mind functioning from a limited field of consciousness or limited potential. The Science of Being, through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, enlarges the conscious capacity of the mind to infinite values and therefore functions not only as the basis for the great expansion of knowledge in every field of science, but also brings to man a direct way to fulfillment.

My thanks are also due to blessed Ma from London, who, like a mother, sat with a stick over the child to get the task completed. Leona Simpson from Canada, Guri Mehellis from Norway, and Dick Bock from Los Angeles, have also been of great assistance in maintaining the breath of the writing and the writer. Jerry Jarvis and his dear wife Debby, who worked hard transcribing and editing the tapes and preparing the final manuscript, also deserve to share my feelings of appreciation and thanks for them. Certainly the warmth of the atmosphere created by love of Mother Olson and Roland Olson, Helen Lutes, and the dear Verrills and Granvilles had its own share in bringing out this book.

Section I: Science of Being

What Is Being?

...

Being, the Essential Constituent of Creation

Physical science informs us that the whole of creation is built up of layers of energy, one inside the other. The subtlest is at the innermost stratum of creation and builds up around itself different qualities, becoming bigger and bigger.

...

There was a time when physics declared the indestructibility of matter because the atom, which was thought to be the subtlest part of matter, was thought to be indestructible....

...

The Purpose of Life

Expansion of happiness is the purpose of life, and evolution is the process by which it is fulfilled. Life begins in a natural way, it evolves, and happiness expands. The expansion of happiness carries with it the growth of intelligence, power, creativity and everything that may be said to be of significance in life. 

The purpose of individual life is also the purpose of the life of the entire cosmos. The purpose of creation is the expansion of happiness which is fulfilled through the process of cosmic evolution. The significance and purpose of individual life is the same as that of the life of the cosmos. The difference lies in the scale.

The individual life is the basic unit of the life of the cosmos. Evolution of the cosmos is basically served by the evolution the individual life. Thus, if the purpose of individual life is served, the purpose of cosmic life is also served spontaneously and simultaneously to that degree and on that scale.

If one has fulfilled the purpose of his own life, he has done his best to help the cosmic purpose.

If one is not happy, one has lost the very purpose of life. If one is not constantly developing his intelligence, power, creativity, peace, and happiness, then he has lost the very purpose of life. Life is not meant to be lived in dullness, idleness, and suffering; these do not belong to the essential nature of life.

Life is dynamic, not static. It is energetic, progressing, evolving, developing through activity, and multiplying itself. The nature and purpose of life is progress, evolution, activity, and improvement.

Activity maintains the stream of evolution, and the physical vehicle that is responsible for activity is the nervous system of the individual. In species lower than man the nervous system is not so fully evolved and so the activity leading to evolution is on a much smaller scale. The activity of the lower species, while carrying out the process of evolution, does not produce a high degree of evolution. As the nervous system evolves, the rate of evolution increases.

Man's nervous system is the most highly evolved. Therefore, the scope of evolution of man is unlimited in this life. We note how, when a child is born, his intelligence, power, and creativity are low, but as he grows he indulges in the field of activity where his power is great, his intelligence is great, his creativity is great, and the degree of happiness which he experiences in himself and projects outside himself is great. The nervous system is developed to the extent that through proper activity (the revelation of which is the purpose of this book) the man can contact absolute bliss, creativity, intelligence, power, and energy. 


To live a life of freedom is the purpose of life in the human species. If one is not able to live such a life, the very purpose of life is blurred. Man is born to live a perfect life holding within its range all values of the transcendental absolute divine of unlimited energy, intelligence, power, peace and bliss along with the unlimited values of the world of multiplicity in relative existence. He is born to project the abundance of the absolute state of life into the world of relative existence.

Man's life is meant to be a bridge of abundance between divine intelligence and the whole of creation. Man's life is to cultivate and give--cultivate the divine power, intelligence, happiness and abundance, and give it out to all of creation. This is the high purpose of the life of man, and it is fortunate to find that every man is capable of reaching this by improving the conscious capacity of his mind and consciously contacting the field of the absolute energy, peace, happiness, and abundance of the eternal, divine consciousness.

Every man is capable of spreading the divine splendor in the whole creation. He is able to project all values of the absolute into the world of relative existence for all creatures to enjoy and to glorify the entire creation of God. Each man is capable of living a life of full values. If one fails to live it, it is a disgrace to oneself, and it abuses the glory of almighty God within and above us.

Here is an invitation for every man on earth to start picking up the divine consciousness of the absolute, and, bringing it through all his activity into the world of variety, enjoy it himself and project it for all others to enjoy as well.

A man projecting himself out in the world through a limited mind is not able to appreciate the real purpose of life. With a small capacity of mind, he engages himself in doing little things of which he thinks in very limited terms. He can engage himself in very limited activity. He can create only a limited number of small things of limited value. The conscious mind of an ordinary man is so limited that he is not even able to enjoy life. He is found to be suffering for the most part on many levels of his life. This state of suffering is merely due to his not using his full potential.

By not using his full potential, man is not able to fulfill the purpose of his life. He is found suffering in many ways because he is not using the full conscious capacity of his mind; he is not using the great energy he carries within himself. He is not experiencing and expressing in his life the abundance of absolute bliss that he naturally possesses, the great absolute field of creativity and power that he has within himself. He is like a millionaire who has forgotten his wealth and status and who goes begging in the street and every moment feels the lack of money.


All suffering is due to not knowing a way to unfold the divine glory present within oneself. Lack of ... Not having the capacity for divine unfoldment, the ignorance of a technique for diving within oneself is responsible for the misery in life. Without divine consciousness, man is found lacking in energy, intelligence, and clear thinking. He is tired, tense and anxious.

This state of human existence and human intelligence have come to such a deplorable condition that from the field of psychology--the great science of the mind--it is found suggested that tension is necessary for creative intelligence. What a shame it is to believe that tension is necessary to improve life!

It is said that poets and artists have created their inspiring literature and art under tension. All such statements come from ignorance and from an inability to release tensions. 

Our modern scientific age unfortunately is increasing in tension. The individual life seems to be growing in tension instead of growing in ease and comfort, even though material comforts certainly are increasing. This is only because the individuals have no way of improving their ability and efficiency through contact with the greater energy and intelligence that every man has within himself. It is only necessary to consciously contact that field of inner life and profit by it. 


The man of today is blind to the purpose of life, not able to see that he is born to enjoy, create, and live a life useful to himself and others. He plunges into whatever activity lies ahead, working hard to put forth his best effort in that field. It is commendable to work hard for things; to be creative in any aspect of life is what man is here for. But when activity increases, a man often finds himself unable to cope with the increased pressure. His efficiency declines, or he does not find energy enough to cope with the increased activity. This is why tension and strain develop.

As a man engages in greater activity he should be able to produce more energy and greater intelligence within himself to deal with this increased activity. This he does not know how to do, and, therefore, he loses the entire purpose of life.

While dealing with ...




Section III: Art of Living

...

ART OF SPEAKING 

The art of speaking obviously consists of: speaking with a minimum consumption of energy; speaking rightly; speaking harmoniously; speaking pleasingly; speaking powerfully; speaking usefully; speaking in such a manner that the speaker remains free from the binding influence of speech.

Now we shall discuss these one by one.

Speaking with a Minimum Consumption of Energy

...

Speaking Rightly

While dealing with &quot;Right and Wrong&quot;, it will be made clear that a correct evaluation of right and wrong is found in its absolute value only on the plane of Being. Therefore, the art of speaking rightly necessarily has its basis in the plane of Being.

However, the basic considerations of the relative nature of the art of speaking involve the projected art of thinking; so all that is valid for the art of thinking is valid for the art of speech. Right speech has its basis in right thinking.

Speech is the expression of both the heart and mind together. Therefore, for the speech to be right, it is necessary that the man be right in his heart and mind.

Speech is the expression of one's state of evolution. One word from the mouth of a man reveals his inner quality. The softness of speech gives an expression to the culture of the heart, and the logic, imagination, or creativity expressed through the speech reveals the culture of his mind. A man could be screened for his whole state of evolution and development through one word of his speech.

Speech is a very delicate medium between the man and his surroundings. It is highly important for the well-being of the individual and his surroundings that all the people should cultivate the art of speech, because one wrong word spoken gives wrong impressions in the atmosphere. The man may change his attitude, his decision, or his course of behavior, but the word that has gone out of his mouth can never be withdrawn. The influence that he has created in the audience and in the atmosphere around him can never be withdrawn. Therefore, it is highly important that one should know the art of speech and should know how to speak rightly.

Speech is a projection of a thought, and, while the art of speech fundamentally lies in the art of thinking, it is much finer than the art of thinking itself, because every thought that arises in the mind need not be expressed as speech.

Take the example of a businessman who is sitting with a friend in the evening, when suddenly an idea comes to his mind regarding some matter that he had to speak to his manager about the next day. It would be very odd if he began to give expression to his thought right there. This is what is meant by the art of speech being much finer and thus a more advanced art than the art of thinking.

Speech has to be in keeping with the atmosphere. The thought and its expression as speech should be such that they are welcomed by the surroundings. Hundreds of words unsuitable to the atmosphere will prove futile against one word of value.

Thus the art of speaking rightly gains fulfillment in the art of thinking, together with the skill of proper expression suitable to the atmosphere. This, as has already been said, depends upon the man being right in his heart and mind, and this, as we have seen, is only possible by the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind, which is easily accomplished through the regular practice of Transcendental Meditation.


Speaking Harmoniously


...

Speaking Pleasingly


...

ART OF ACTION


There is a common proverb in India which says that ...

...

The Art of Performing Action to Yield Maximum Results

The art of performing action to yield the maximum results rests in two factors. ...


...

This is how, by due amount of performance of Transcendental Meditation, supplemented by the power of charity and virtuous deeds of helping others, the negative influence of the past karma can be counteracted in order to smooth the path of the present karma. And then the action will be performed without resistance or obstacles, yielding maximum results. 

So, the formula for producing maximum results is not to mind the obstacles and negative influences trying to offer resistance to the performance of action. The doer should put himself in action and continue it until the desired results are achieved. The process of meditation, of bringing the conscious mind in tune with transcendental absolute eternal Being, which is the source of all life energy and intelligence, raises the standard of consciousness. When the standard of consciousness is raised, the action performed from that raised level of life energy and intelligence will certainly have an overriding influence over the karma of the past to produce maximum results. 


This is how, by the power of present action or karma, destiny is improved. Herein lies the full meaning of the proverb, &quot;Man is a master of his own destiny.&quot;

The Art of Performing an Action So That the Performance Remains a Joy and Does not Become Tiring, Tedious, or a Boring Task

The process of any action will remain joyful for the doer and for the surroundings only when the doer has very great energy and intelligence and he encounters no resistance on the way and receives all cooperation from everywhere. ...


...

ART OF BEHAVIOR


...

Really good behavior will be possible when the minds of both the parties are broadened, when they are able to see the whole situation, understand each other more thoroughly in their true perspectives, and succeed in locating the needs of the other and formulating their behavior on the basis of attempting to fulfill these needs. This naturally necessitates a fully developed consciousness and right sense of judgment and all the qualities that only a strong and clear mind possesses.

Small minds always have a very narrow vision and they fail to perceive the total situation; in their narrow vision they create imaginary obstacles and close themselves in their narrow scope of imagined forms, which are neither useful to themselves nor to anyone else. Then their behavior towards others only results in misunderstanding and increase of tension. ... Transcendental Meditation.

...

Behavior and the Surroundings


...

PATHS TO GOD REALIZATION


The conception of the word path indicates ... and ending at another. The paths to God realization mean ... in order to reach God. To understand ... and how far he is from man.

God

God is the most ...

...

God is found in two phases of reality: as a supreme Being of absolute eternal nature, and as a personal God at the top of phenomenal creation. Thus, God has two aspects, the personal and the impersonal. They are the two realities of the word God. 

Impersonal Aspect Of God


...

The impersonal God is that Being which dwells in the heart of everyone. Each individual in his true nature is the Impersonal God. That is why the Vedic philosophy of the Upanishads declares: &quot;I am That, thou art That, and all this is That&quot;. No one need be afraid of his own Self, no one need be afraid of the result of bliss, no one need be afraid of the kingdom of heaven, where there is all bliss and fulfillment.

The God almighty, impersonal unmanifested Being, is the eternal reality of life. It is imperishable, It is abundance, It is life, It is fulfillment. It is at hand for anyone to realize It. One has only to be, and the technique to be lies in Transcendental Meditation.

==Stoichiometry==
I think that stoichiometry would fit into the scope of this wikibook (it's meant to be an wide introduction). I learned about it in Chem I. If no one else can, I'll try to recollect it. [[User:Regre7|Regre7]] 20:45, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

== Naming Convention ==

This is an early Wikibook that was developed before &quot;standard&quot; naming conventions were in place.  I would like to get some input about what, if any, naming convention ought to be used to &quot;fix&quot; this Wikibook.  New contributors to Wikibooks are making mistakes and adding &quot;articles&quot; to this like if it were Wikipedia.

My preference would be to move to the standard &quot;/&quot; naming convention.  If there is no objection in about a week or so, I will be doing exactly that for this Wikibook. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:16, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== {{bad link|Screaming jelly babies}} ==

The transwikied article at {{bad link|Transwiki:Screaming_jelly_babies}} has been dewikified and I assume needs to be moved to a real name somewhere in this project. [[User:64.126.24.12|64.126.24.12]] 20:38, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== Pointless ==

Are contributors even considering the likely knowledge base of readers - this is supposed to be an introductory text in general chemistry so wherein lies the sense in assuming any reader of a text at this level would have any clue about the behaviour/attributes of 'standing waves on a a guitar string'....

I dont think this text is compehensible to its intended audience.

== more naming convention stuff ==

I made some pages, and named each module like General_Chemistry/(unit)/(subunit). I noticed that nobody else did that. Should move mine to General_Chemistry/(subunit), or change everyone else's? I personally think that the more organization, the better.
[[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 21:57, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

== Merge with &quot;High School Chemistry&quot; ==

Since [[High School Chemistry]] consists of a brief, incomplete introduction, and this book is also woefully incomplete, I vote '''yes''' to merging them.  I believe there to be little difference between a high school text and an intro level college text.  We should be erring on the side of readability anyway, I think. --[[User:Dolsson5|Dolsson5]] 16:32, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

:These two books could be merged, but may need un-merging in the future. A high school text assumes much lower ability with math, reading, familiarity of concepts, etc... Even the audience is different. High school chemistry covers the topics everyone should know, even if they never intend to use chemistry in any way. College general chemistry should be a broad overview for potential chemistry majors (as the starting point of their career), science and engineering majors (as a knowledge base for other technical pursuits), or non-science types who have a college degree and should have a more deep understanding of science than the random guy on the street.

:Long story short:, if we merge these books it will definitely end up looking like an ADVANCED high school text.[[User:Zolot|Zolot]] 00:33, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, sorry to be coming to the table late on this discussion.  I have been gathering a group of chemistry professors at major US state universities for the purpose of creating this wikibook on General Chemistry.  The group is NOT interested in merging with high school chemistry because the project will already be very large.  Including high school material could cause it to collapse under its own weight.  With the group's consent, I will begin to reorganize the chapters a bit, create an extended outline, and invite experts to start completing each chapter with content.  Thanks for your patience. --[[User:Wight|Wight]] 14:52, 20 July 2007 (UTC)

:In view of the foregoing, I change my vote to NO.  --[[User:Dolsson5|Dolsson5]] 05:53, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

Since it has been a while and all commenters are in agreement,  I am calling it consensus and removing  the merge tag.  --[[User:Dolsson5|Dolsson5]] 06:01, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

== Structure of this module ==

I am confused. The page [[General Chemistry]] has a table of contents that links to a few very poorly laid out pages. However also below this article are stuff like [[General Chemistry/Introduction]]. That has a TOC template that leads to lots of other pages. I added that template to the top of [[General Chemistry]]. It seems as if there are two structures mixed up together. What is going on? --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 04:04, 15 August 2007 (UTC)
:I've update the TOC of the book to match the structure of the modules and existing sections.  It should be much more clear now.  There's still some problems with the locations of the articles (&quot;thermodynamics&quot; gets its own directory, everything else is in the same directory as the book root? is this convention?), but otherwise it should be cleared up. [[User:VSEPR|VSEPR]] 07:46, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

== This book needs work ==

I think it's lame that such an important book is in need of so much work.
Whenever I have a chance, I'll do what I can to fill in the blanks and fix typos.
Most of the pages in this book are only a few sentences long right now.

It looks like most edits are from '06 and '07.  Is anyone out there gonna help finish this book with me?

[[User:NipplesMeCool|NipplesMeCool]] ([[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]) 01:34, 21 January 2009 (UTC)

Update: At this point, it looks very polished.  However, it needs way more examples and practice problems (with answers) to be useful.  Also, the order of the chapters is a bit unhelpful.  I think several chapters should be rearranged.  Last, it lacks details in several sections (I'm not going to list them).  -- [[User:NipplesMeCool|NipplesMeCool]] ([[User talk:NipplesMeCool|talk]]) 01:26, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

== Active Authors ==
I'd like to join any current editors on this book, are any of the past authors still active? --[[User:Btharper1221|Btharper1221]] ([[User talk:Btharper1221|talk]]) 17:12, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

== Cover picture caption ==

I changed the caption of the cover picture to read &quot;a 4f orbital&quot; rather than &quot;an atomic 4f orbital&quot;. The original is just meaningless. I presume the picture is of a one electron (hydrogenic) 4f orbital.</text>

==Ingredients==
*¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (about 170 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) roasted [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanut]]s (unsalted)
*4 cups (about 1 [[Cookbook:L|L]]) [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]] (unsweetened) 
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp.]] (about 30 mL) [[Cookbook:Red curry paste|red curry paste]]
*2 tbsp. (about 30 mL) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 tbsp. (about 45 mL) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] (about 15 mL) [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|fish sauce]]
==Procedure==
#Chop or grind peanuts into a fine meal.
#Heat half the coconut milk in a medium [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] on high heat, and add red curry paste. Stir until curry paste is dissolved and then continue to heat on high for 10 - 12 minutes (not stirring) until the oil from the coconut milk has risen to the top.
#Decrease heat to medium-high and add ground peanuts. Stir and add the rest of the coconut milk, bring to a full boil then decrease heat, add the sugar, lemon juice and fish sauce.
#Continue to cook (stirring occasionally) for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the oil has risen to the surface again.
#Take off heat and let set for about half an hour. Stir to blend in the oil that has risen, the sauce should be not quite as thick as peanut butter. If it seems too thick add about a teaspoon of water or coconut milk.

Enjoy this as a dip or sauce on most any [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], or thin with water to [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] or use as a dressing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The document I wrote was designed to ''supplement'' a particular physics textbook, and moreover, was written at a high school level.  I don't know how well it could be adapted to this project, but I will see what I can do.  Unfortunately, I am slightly burdened by (a) a summer class from 8:30AM to 5:00PM, and (b) summer reading, and most of my free time is going to the calculus textbook.

I am glad to see that you are doing organic chemistry -- I really like chemistry, but my chemistry class never made it to the chapter on organic chemistry, so this is a good oppurtunity for me to learn more about it.

I've changed some of your book title capitalizations. It seems to me that these are not Wikipedia articles. If we'd expect any of these to stand alone as a publication, then we ought to capitalize titles. OK? ....[[User:LouI|LouI]] 11:50 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Hi Karl, thanks for your excitement about the Spanish book. I am _very_ glad
to got you as a bilingual speaker interested (I am actually just starting to learn Spanish by my own and took the recommendation by heart that encourages
not just teachers but also students of any subject to write Wikibooks :). Your
organic chemistry book is nicely structured, I'll certainly browse through it
every once in a while to track the progress (maybe even contribute some stuff,
though my organic chemistry is a little bit rusty since I had it in my German
high school about six years ago...)
:Thats great man. Just to make sure, you are not copying anything directly from a published Spanish textbook right ? We have to be careful to create new content only. I will certainly lend a hand in the Spanish book and best of luck learning the language. You must already speak German then .. any other languages ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Hi Karl, I really appreciate your nice comments about the Spanish book. That really keeps me motivated. About other languages: I had French in high school for a couple of years but haven't used it since... [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]

Hi Karl. Yes, the succinct contents page looks good. I think it will be especially convenient for frequent users of the book to quickly check on certain vocabulary/grammar. [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]

Me again :) Your table of contents are definitely very helpful. I also really appreciate that it is now possible to edit just a part of a document (was this a general update of the wiki software running here?). Your pictures are nice, they should make the book more fun to read. [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]&lt;br&gt;
P.S. You should consider yourself as well to be one of the 'founders' of the Spanish/language textbooks with all the effort you have put it. Thanks so much for that!

Karl,

If you by any chance intend to do a mass import of Shakespeare plays into
Wikibooks please take a look at
http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/examples/shakespeare/. It is a repository of
Shakespeare in XML that with a small quick script can convert all Shakespeare
to Wikipedia markup.&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 06:50, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Thanks man, I couldn't get it to run in my MS browser on Mac 9.x but will check it out when I am on another machine. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::I don't know if you are familliar with XML. This is file format of tagged text and the real benefit is that it is machine-readable data and there is plethora of scripts, libraries and programs that can extract or transform the textual information any way you wish.&lt;br&gt;It is not very exciting to view in a browser but with a rather simple script you can convert '''all''' Shakespeare plays into for example Wikipedia markup in a matter of minutes.&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 22:14, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Karl when you upload a new version of an old image, you should do so with the same file name. That way the image is updated on all the pages it's linked to without any further effort on you part, plus you don't get orphan images. You don't lose the old image either, it's there on the description page, so you can just revert if you want to. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:28, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Hi,

About adding the rest of Othello. 
I have hacked up a small Perl script to turn XML into Wiki markup and it was
quite easy. I am a little hesitant to add more because I don't know if
minor glitches (like some capitalisations or some text escaping wikification)
are acceptable and if the problems with annotations have been resolved yet.
&lt;br&gt;Please give me a go-ahead and blessing and I can add all Shakespeare
plays at the rate of 2-3 a day.
&lt;br&gt;The script is not very brilliant and surely can be still improved. Even
amateurs have sometimes to have a go at coding to get things done.

===The Shakespeare plays===
&lt;br&gt;Sure I will put a long string of Shakespeare plays on Wikibooks.
&lt;br&gt;'''''Romeo and Julliet''''' is in the pipeline.
&lt;br&gt;Wikimedia servers were rather slow in the past few days.
&lt;br&gt;I have been thinking and wondering - what about navigation through
scenes and acts. What about annotations - has anything been decided yet ?
&lt;br&gt;BTW did you know that Polish transliteration of the name &quot;Shakespeare&quot; is
&quot;Szekspir&quot;.  
&lt;br&gt;[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 21:44, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Huh ... About navigations, that would be great if we could do that automatically, to at least have a link back to the contents page of the play and to the next and previous scenes. Magnus I think was writing up some code to allow for annotatios but I'm guessing it has to be approved before it is added to the official Wiki software update. That will be a great feature for the shakesperean plays as well as my textbooks .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I personally my current one better than the one on the staff lounge but if &quot;the people&quot; have another opinion the community decides.

:Lord Emsworth, Dude, you rock !! You have the notoriety of having the very first &quot;finished&quot; Wikibook. I'll look it over and keep my eyes open to learn a lot about it. Let me get back to you about related topics .. the government and political processes are not my strength. Are you a history buff ? Social sciences wizard ? You seem to work a lot faster than I do, or maybe know your material a lot better. I am going to send out an email announcing your accomplishment. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Hi,

Concerning annotation. I think you as a respected figure behind the whole idea of Wikibooks should alert developers and other good people that we need annotation badly. Without it, it hardly makes sense to flood Wikibooks pages with streams of words fine crafted by Shakespeare.
&lt;br&gt;Another thing. While Wikipedia is lovable for its content and since it is
our encyclopedia it can stand against other commercial encyclopedias (and win in the end) even without all the glamour of multimedia, I am not so sure as far as wiki textbooks go. I wish we had some software power that we could eventually use and we don't even have table wiki markup. To instruct with streams of printed words only would be enough. To assess progress of students even without Javascript capabilities ? Brainstorm... in wikitech-l ?
&lt;br&gt;Regards,
&lt;br&gt;[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 20:11, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Kpjas, I agree about getting some software backing us up. I would write some myself if I had any idea how. My hope is that with time and more content, we can attract more developer attention to the project. I have asked around about the annotation feature, and could use it myself. I'll be a bit more persistant now and see what I can get going. I think it will help when the contributions start flowing into the foundation, maybe we could hire somebody full time to write code. Although that seems like what Brion and some of these other guys do already ... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Good day.

I express my sincere thanks for adding navigational links to [[US Constitution and Government]]. I find your page on [[User:Lord Emsworth|myself]] most intriguing, as well, especially the reference to a &quot;borrowed internet browser.&quot; [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 21:59, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Sorry, I entirely overlooked the first chapter of [[US History]]. My sincere apologies, [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 23:31, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC).

-----------------
Opps! The tag is &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; not _NOTOC_ . --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:Got it. Thanks, Mav. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Good day.

Your message regarding the official California Standards interests me. I will definitely look into them and see how well they can be applied to the present textbook on US History. 

It appears that the standards can be best approached as follows: Writing the book according to present structure for the time being, but then conducting a complete revision of the book based on California's standards. The standards are very exhaustive while the book as present does not go into as much detail. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 22:39, 10 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Lord Emsworth: if you can write a book that meets the standards, you will singlehandedly put Wikibooks on the map. Well, its always a team thing I guess .. but you know what I mean. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I'm sorry, I can't find your username on the main wikipedia. I just got your email, and I'd like to know, exactly what unconstructive email are you refering to? I ''try'' to consider whether or not my emails are constructive, and often, I don't send an email because I realise that it's not constructive. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 22:11, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Karl Wick,

I have no particular expertise in history. I am just intersted in the topic. I know bits and pieces of information, and what I don't know, I merely look up. --[[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 22:52, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

==Smart quotes==
Hi :) Just a little thing, do you think using smartquotes is the best thing to use? They won't show up with non-unicode-supporting browsers/fonts. Would it be best to stick to the Wikip' smartquote policy? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:07, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Hi Dysprosia, I'm probably not the best person to know the answer to this question. I didn't know that there were browsers that did not support them, or that WP had a policy about it. You mean quotes like the one on my organic chemistry [[organic chemistry|splash page]]? M$IE, Netscape family, and Konquerer all support them right ? &amp;quot; --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Yep, on the splash page is where I saw it - as far as I know IE, Moz, Firebird all show it, not sure about Konq. The real issue is people trying to view the pages on something old like a pre-OS X Macintosh, or on many older browsers that don't support Unicode/all the little HTML doodads :) 
:: Maybe it would be best to switch to straight-quotes, a whole less trouble all round. Some educational institutions may be using older software.
:: As to WP's stance, you can see on [[en:Wikipedia:Special characters]]. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:29, 14 Oct 2003 (UTC)

== Annotation feature ==

Hi Karl, the annotation feature (well, parts of it) were deleted by accident. I'll try to get it back and working soon. --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] 17:07, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Hi Karl. 
I'm glad you missed me. I've been off work for a couple of weeks for the half term holiday. I stayed at my sister's [doesn't own a computer :-( ], but not to worry I'm back now. (refreshed after my break and ready to go).

----
Thanks for the quiz maker link, but it uses javascript :-( [which isn't parsed by the wiki software) I'll keep it in mind for the future though. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]

Hi Karl. I (sort of) finished my draft of the first [[biochemistry]] chapter and noticed that (unsurprisingly) it shares quite a few items with [[Organic Chemistry]], e.g. Gibb's free enrgy, pKa values etc. I think these are more OC than BC, so if you like anything in my text, feel free to loot :-) --[[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]] 21:18, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Karl, Thanks for the '''personalised''' welcome!!
--[[User:Noldoaran|Noldoaran]] 03:17, 21 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hello, Karl. I was merely taking a temporary break from the site, concentrating on the main Wikipedia for a while. I shall soon return. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 20:17, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Thanks for the welcome; I'm afraid I might not have a lot of time to devote, but hopefully slow and steady will get the job done. :) - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]] 06:01, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

==Picture floating==

making the text of an article float around the text is fairly easy.  Instead of just typing in the image's address, use the following table.

&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;div
&lt;style=&quot;float:right;width:XXXpx;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Name of Image.pgn]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Caption''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Obviously, change the float to where you want it on the page, left right or center, the Width:XXXpx to the image's width in pixels (I usually add 5-10 pixels to keep a border between the image and the text).

Hope this helps. :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:41, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Don't worry too much about the languages thing - I always go to the Recent Changes page straight off. So it's no extra clickyclicky for me! [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 08:40, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)

You can cry on my sholder anytime. IMO the language thing will get sorted out in time. Meanwhile your work has not been lost. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:22, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

== Spirituality? ==

What's this new page you've made?
:Just a little note to myself and for a couple of non-wiki-initiated friends .. but feel free to use it if you think it can serve you. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] P.S. Thanks for the note, just when I started to wonder if anyone would write me ever again ..</text>

==Grammar==
===Chinese Names===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | In Chinese names, the family name comes before the given name. Family names are passed down paternally and usually have only one character. Chinese given names are usually two characters long, but may also be one character.

Hence a man called 王明 (Wáng Míng) is addressed as Mr. Wang, not Mr. Ming. A woman called 李红 (Lǐ Hóng) is addressed as Mrs./Miss Li.

However, if the person has a western personal name, it is presented in the GIVEN-NAME/FAMILY-NAME format, following the Western convention. Hence if 李红 (Lǐ Hóng) has a western-style personal name of Mary, she is usually introduced as &quot;Mary Li&quot; and not &quot;Li Mary&quot;
|}&lt;br&gt;

In this lesson, we learn how to say &quot;something is something&quot; in Chinese. The first thing you need to know is that the sentence structure of Chinese is very similar to that of English in that they both follow the pattern of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). But unlike many Western languages, verbs in Chinese aren't conjugated and noun and adjective endings don't change. They are never affected by things such as time or person.

===这(/那)是什么？===
This sentence means &quot;What's this/that?&quot;:
#这是什么？(What's this?)
#那是什么？(What's that?)

The sentences, if broken down literally, shows that the ordering of words differs in English and Chinese:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|------------------------------
| 这/那      || 是 ||  什么 || ?
|------------------------------
| this/that || is || what || ?
|------------------------------
|}

The order of the sentences may seem a little bit tricky, but don't worry about that, we will discuss this later.

===A　是　B===
This sentence means &quot;A is B.&quot;

&quot;是&quot; (shì), the equational verb ''to be'', can be used as the English ''is'' or ''equals''. When used in a simple Subject-Verb-Object sentence, the subject defines the object. Since Chinese verbs never change, no other forms for shì exist such as ''was'' or ''am'' in English. Also, articles like ''a'' and ''the'' are absent in Chinese. They are not translated.

For example:
#这是书 (zhe4 shi4 shu1): this is (a) book.
#那是杂志 (na4 shi4 za2 zhi4): that is (a) magazine.

===A　不是　B===
This sentence means &quot;A is not B.&quot; in which shì is negated when preceded by &quot;不&quot; (bu). &quot;不&quot; literally means &quot;no&quot;, &quot;not&quot;.

For example: 
*这不是书 (zhè bú shì shū): this is not (a) book.

Now, we come back to the &quot;what's this/that?&quot; questions. We already see that the order is a bit tricky comparing to the English question order. But comparing to the latter pattern &quot;A　是　B&quot;, we find the similarity: their orders are identically the same. In fact, like particles, question words make statements into questions without changing the order of the sentence. To make one, simply substitute the QW in for place the subject would be in the answer.

Comparison:
#这是'''书'''。(This is (a) book.)
#这是'''什么'''？(This is '''what'''?)

#那是'''杂志'''。(That is (a) magazine.)
#那是'''什么'''？(That is '''what'''?)

===吗===
&quot;吗&quot;(ma) is a final interrogative particle used to form a question sentence. Adding this character at the end of a '''statement''' transforms the sentence into a question. 

Example 1:
*这是书 (zhe4 shi4 shu1)。(This is (a) book.)
*:::: ↓
**这是书'''吗''' (zhe4 shi4 shu1 ma)？(Is this (a) book'''?''')

Example 2:
*这不是杂志 (zhe4 bu2 shi4 za2 zhi4)。(This is not (a) magazine.)
*:::: ↓
**这不是杂志'''吗'''(zhe4 bu2 shi4 za2 zhi4 ma)？(Isn't this (a) magazine'''?''')

===是/不===
&quot;是&quot; (shi4) can be used to answer a simple yes/no question. In this case, &quot;是&quot; means ''yes'', whilst &quot;不&quot; (bu2) or &quot;不是&quot; (bu2 shi4) means ''no'' (literally, ''not is'').

How to answer yes/no questions correctly in Chinese? Usually, it's the same as in English, but pay attention if the questions are negative, like &quot;Isn't this a book?&quot;. In Chinese, you answer to the questions, not the fact. If the question itself is a negative answer, use &quot;不是&quot; or simply &quot;不&quot;, vice versa. For example:
*A: 这不是书吗？zhe4 bu2 shi4 shu1 ma?  (Isn't this (a) book? = This is not a book, right?)
**B: '''是'''，这不是书。shi4, zhe4 bu2 shi4 shu1. ('''No''', this is not (a) book. = You are right; this is not a book.)
**B: '''不'''，这是书。bu4, zhe4 shi4 shu1. ('''Yes''', this is (a) book. = You're wrong; this ''is'' a book.)

A asks if that's a book in a negative way. If the object is not a book, you should nevertheless approve A's saying first. So we use &quot;是&quot; to acknowledge that A is correct, and then say &quot;this is not (a) book&quot; to emphasis A is right; In the case of that is a book, you should deny A's saying first, using &quot;不&quot; (no) to point out A is wrong, then make a new statement by noting that &quot;这是书&quot; (this ''is'' (a) book). One more example:
*他今天晚上不来参加宴会了，对吗？(He's not going to the party tonight, is he?)
**'''不'''，他肯定要来。('''Yes''', he's definitely coming.)
**'''是''' 啊，他很忙呢！('''No''', he's so busy!)

===的===
Character &quot;的&quot; (de) indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one. In English it functions like '''s'' or like the word ''of'' but with the position of possessor and possessee switched. For example:
#史密斯(Shǐ mì Sī)的书(shū: book) &lt;-&gt; Smith's book
#王明的钢笔 &lt;-&gt; Wang Ming's pen
#约翰** (Yuēhàn: John)的朋友** (péngyǒu: friend) &lt;-&gt; John's friend or a friend of John's

==Question Words Section - Last Yellow Paragraph ==
I just added this blob as well as the brackets in examples 1 and 3 right above.  Feel free to remove or change it... I believe this generalization is correct but I am not that fluent.

==Is 他们 equivalent to 她们?==

In the 'sentences using shi' section, it's replaced, without any explanation.  Is it like French, with the ils/elles versions of 'they?'
:It is like the French ''ils/elles''; 他们 means a group of men or of men and women, while 她们 means a group of women exclusively. The example sentence is refering to a group of women.

==redundancy==

when the traditional and simplified characters are the same, i'll remove it to save space.
:Thanks for your help :) Now that lesson 1 is more or less done... time for lesson 2 I guess. How to get more people to participate though? -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 06:56, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:I would suggest advertising on the Chinese wikipedia.. or do a chinese lessons / english lessons exchange.
::I did a bit of advertising by putting the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{book}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template tag in several Wikipedia articles like [[w:standard Mandarin|standard Mandarin]], [[w:Beijing dialect|Beijing dialect]], [[w:Chinese language|Chinese language]] and [[w:Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] and then redirects to the Chinese Wikibook contents page. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 04:53, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:I've removed the Beijing dialect link... (sorry.... but it seemed a bit far-fetched to me...) Thanks for the other three, though. ;) -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 05:37, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== '我叫艾美' is not a good example ==

:In English, you can say 'I'm Called duke'.It, however, means '我被叫作&quot;公爵&quot;' instead of '我叫公爵'。
:Actually, '叫' is not a common use here.You can consider it as 'am'(or 'be') in English.
:in chinese,sb. + be + ppl. = sb. + 被 + verb.'被' is the preposition here(of course,you can regard it as the helping verb)
:Ergo, this example would lead you to the wrong road in learning Chinese.
:in the end, sorry about my lame English^_^(and I would appreciate it if you could point out my mistake^_^)--[[User:Zhouxiao|Zhouxiao]] 12:21, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::i wouldnt worry too much about it. the main thing is to get learners to say 我叫王 rather than 我是王, right? [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 07:01, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

== Tradtional and simplified characters ==

In the vocaublary lists, shouldn't the tradional and simplified words be in different columns to make it easier? -[[User:Pichu826|Pichu826]] 06:02, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:I considered that when I made the original layout for the vocabulary, but I still think the one-column design is best and least distracting. It allows the closest side-by-side comparison without making a mostly empty column that would interfere with straight-across readings.  --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 04:43, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)


I added &quot;when different&quot; just to add a little clarity (Yes, might be obvious, but this is lesson one of a language most have little to no familiarity with.  It's also unclear if the gender differences in the character for &quot;ni&quot; are only present in Traditional Chinese.  Also, with other pronouns.  Maybe that needs to be added separately as a lesson section. [[User:67.141.84.9|67.141.84.9]] 00:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== Rearranging of the dialogues ==

I'm starting to learn Chinese, and I believe it would be helpfull to me (and very likely to others) if a dialogue was presented with all the translations; that is: dialogue 1 (simplified+traditional + pinyin + english) ;
dialogue 2 (simplified+traditional+pinyin+english)

That way, it is easier to find what every character means, without having to scroll continually up and down. 

I don't know how to change that myself, but I think that would be an improvement to an otherwise excellent page.

== SVO/S是O ==

in &quot;我是中国人&quot; etc, is ''zhongguoren''really an object? it's going back a long time to 7th grade english, but i thought it was a prepositional noun phrase or something similar, not an object (a direct object would take an accusative pronoun, him/her/us, while a prepositional noun would take a nominative, he/she/we, iirc). [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 06:57, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:You're right, Nateji. &quot;Be&quot; is an exception to the standard SVO-rule. It's actually a [[:w:Copula#Chinese|complement]]. I think it's fair to say that the analysis is valid for Chinese as well, since &quot;是&quot; is used as a copula in almost the exact same manner as in English.

== 你vs.妳 ==

why does owen say 你 instead of 妳 in the traditional chinese dialogue in reference to ginny? [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 07:05, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks for pointing that out. An oversight in the writing, sorry. Now corrected. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 08:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

I'm pretty sure &quot;妳&quot; is bogus, not commonly used in modern Chinese.
Only one of the four Chinese dictionaries at hand lists it, and I don't
recall ever seeing it in any textbook (just double-checked a couple).
And my Chinese teacher, who is a native speaker, said she thinks it may
have been used in classical Chinese but not in modern Chinese.  So
lesson 1 should show 你, not 妳.
--[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 03:35, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

== Proper Nouns ==

I'm new to editing wiki stuff, sorry if I make stupid mistakes... But... In the Proper nouns section, I think it would look better if the country names had their traditional writings inside parentheses, as stated near the subtitle... E.g.: &quot;中国 (中國)&quot;.

:You're right. When I first made up the vocab list I thought it would look cluttered to list the alternate writing for one character so manyt times, but it's better to have a consistent format all the way through. Made the changes to bring it in line with the rest of the vocabulary.   --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 08:22, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== New Vocabulary Table ==

I think that we should use wikitables for the vocabulary lists. The current vocab lists are too cluttered and are hard to read. We could make a clearer division between simplified and traditional characters by putting them into separate colums, rather than parenthases. Also, this is easier to show masculine and feminine types of characters without putting them into parenthases, as those changes could be mistaken for traditional characters. I hope everyone understands what I mean.

[[User:Geoking66|Geoking66]] 07:54, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
:I personally think the current arrangement is better than it would be using the wikitable template. I originally tablified the vocab (before it was a bulleted list), and put a lot of thought into its construction. 

:The wikitable change took away the vocab numbering, decreased the contrast from the background (especially in printed versions), and spread columns apart due to the wide traditional column. I had debated having traditional in it's own column when I first made the vocab table, but ultimately decided that it would be best close to the simplified (making comparisons easier), and not taking up a whole column which also separates the characters from the pinyin and meaning columns. It's better to have them in closer proximity than that. 

:About possible masculine/feminine confusion, the current setup is technically correct, as the character 妳 does not exist in simplified, so the m./f. distinction only exists in the traditional, thus it was put in parentheses. I agree it's maybe a little more confusing than it needs to be, so I'll add a note of warning later on. In any case, no more sexed personal pronouns have to be introduced and masculine/feminine doesn't exist in Chinese, so the issue only comes up within the first lesson. So I don't think the m./f. issue should be used as a reason for effecting a change that impacts the design of vocab presentation for every lesson (someday there will be more than two :).

:Believe me that I understand your argument and had debated myself over the very same design decision. It's still debatable, granted, but from my personal experience using several Chinese textbooks, and from trying to learn traditional while using a simplified-only text, this setup would most appeal to me as a learner.

== Audio template needed ==

The audio template has to be used in some form of another. It's not so much an issue of providing a help link, but rather that the license information has to be easily available to make sure people can easily check that that files are indeed under a free license, and to make it easier to show where to upload replacement files by native speakers.

[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:40, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:I know, I'm sorry for not coming up with a replacement for the Info links right away, but I just felt using the Audio template made the vocab list look really cluttered. My thoughts for how to make a better format include:
:#adding miniature pictures alongside the pinyin sort of like '{{stage short|100%|Info page for this file}}' that leads to the file info.
:#making a small speaker icon ([[Image:Gnome-speakernotes.png|15px|(Play this file)]]) that's the Media link while the pinyin is the info page link.
:#a separate page with all the sound file Info links, sort of like the Stroke Order page
:#or a new &quot;'''Listen'''&quot; column on the right side that shows &quot;[[Image:Gnome-speakernotes.png|15px|(Play this file)]] &lt;small&gt;([[:Image:zh-ta1.ogg|info]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot; for every word

== I just wanted to say... ==
THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!
(please erase if it's inappopriate)

== Individual word meanings needed ==

I think it would be very useful in this and following lessons for learners to be able to see the meanings of the individual words that make up phrases.

For example, the meaning of &quot;Nǐ hǎo&quot; is provided as &quot;Hello.&quot; This is fine, but it doesn't let the learner know that &quot;nǐ&quot; means &quot;you&quot; and &quot;hǎo&quot; means good and that when saying &quot;hello&quot; in Chinese, one is saying literally &quot;you good.&quot;

Providing this information allows the learner to learn the meaning of individual words in a meaningful context of the phrase or sentence being learned. And it also lets the learner get a feeling for the syntax of Mandarin.

I think this could best be done by abandoning the format currently used which divides things up into four quadrants of Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Pinyin and English and instead using multiple lines of information, something like this:

Simplified Characters
Traditional Characters
Pinyin
English word meanings
English phrase/sentence meaning.

 金 妮: 你 好。
 金 妮: 你 好。
 Jīnní: Nǐ hǎo
 Ginny: you good
 Ginny: Hello.
[[User:Gary Cziko|Gary Cziko]] 14:43, 2 August 2006 (UTC)


::I agree. I think we should explain the literal meanings of words, the actual meanings, and how the literal meaning is related to the actual meaning. For example, 哪国人 literally is &quot;Which nation person?&quot;, it means &quot;Which nationality?&quot;, so it is like saying &quot;Person of which nation?&quot; or &quot;Which nation's person?&quot;. I'm learning Chinese now and I find making connections like this to be very helpful. For example, with thinking of 你好 as &quot;you good&quot;, it made it easier for me to understand that I could also say &quot;老师好&quot; or &quot;您好&quot;.

== By Lie-Hap-Po==

妳is a non standard character and should not be used.

Yes, agreed.

== Names could be localized ==
Since this is a Chinese course, names should be better as Chinese names. I proposal to use 張三 instead of 金妮 and 李四 instead of 歐文 here. The two names are like those ''foo'' and ''bar'' in English, very well suitable for this case. [[User:221.219.97.5|221.219.97.5]] 17:32, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
: I agree that the choice of names should be rethought. There are enough basic words I need to master as a beginner in Chinese, learning how to write Ginny is pretty low on my priority list. I've never even come across a Ginny in the US, it would be much more worthwhile learning names that I am actually likely to come across in Chinese.

==Moving dialogue 2 to second lesson ==

I think one dialoge is enough for the first lesson. The second lesson would make and ideal &quot;Lesson Two&quot;. Any objections to me moing it?[[User:86.137.109.142|86.137.109.142]] 11:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

==Is 麽 a character in Traditional Chinese?==
Hi,

I'm using this book to learn some Mandarin. I've never studied it before, what is written here is the first thing I'm learning about it.
I'm also trying to reproduce the characters I see with a word processor using Pinyin, and I had problems inserting the &quot;me&quot; in &quot;shénme&quot;. The text says that the traditional character for it is 麽, but Wiktionary http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BA%BC says that this symbol is simplified Chinese, ad the traditional symbol for it is 麼. In fact, using the Pinyin input method UIM-Pinyin-BIG5 with SCIM under Linux, I can't reproduce the first character, but only the second.

I would like to thank the authors for this great work! :-) [[User:83.187.196.123|83.187.196.123]] 18:08, 28 February 2007 (UTC)


:If you look at the Wiktionary for http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/么 then you see that two traditional forms are listed. I remember we learned the 'traditional' form when I was studying in Taiwan, but even there I saw people use the very simple form of it. My guess is that the very similar looking character is what came out after putting 麼 through the a strict interpretation of the simplification rules (you'll notice that many parts of different characters are the same, so a rule can simplify that part in all the characters it is present in). Guess it wasn't simple enough for some people. :)

== 什 vs. 甚 ==

Isn't 甚麽 the traditional form of 什么 ?
--[[User:Yakowenko|Yakowenko]] ([[User talk:Yakowenko|talk]]) 05:37, 17 March 2009 (UTC)
: no, the traditional form is 什麽. i dont know what's the diff between 什么 and 甚么 thou。

== Suggestions from a newbie ==

I do like this page - but as a newcomer to Chinese language I do have some suggestions.

First, there is a lot in each lesson and introducing Chinese characters so early makes everything look more difficult. My initial goal is to learn spoken Chinese to follow conversation and pinyin helps me do this. I have not tried to learn the characters as I see this as something which does not need to be attempted yet. The examples by exercise 2 have dropped pinyin altogether -I would like to use pinyin  for a while. 

I would find it useful to have practice drills in pinyin - something you could work on together with a Chinese speaker using VOIP. It is repetition and speaking which makes you at ease in a language. Once you are able to introduce yourself,count, construct simple sentences, and ask basic questions, maybe then it is time for characters.

What do others think? [[User:Herne|Herne]] ([[User talk:Herne|talk]]) 10:36, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

== Confusion about tones ==

The [[Chinese_(Mandarin)/Using_Tones|tones page]] says the 3rd tone changes when preceding other tones. In this lesson, hǎo sounds like a half-third tone but it's at the end of a sentence. Also, ní in Jīnní and wén in Ōuwén are written as 2nd tone, but sound low. Shén in Shénme sounds low as well. What am I missing? --[[User:ZBrisk|ZBrisk]] ([[User talk:ZBrisk|talk]]) 22:14, 28 October 2010 (UTC)

== Question With 是 ==

In S+是+O and S+不+是+O, does the 是 act like a linking verb (am, is, are, was, were)? --[[User:ThePCKid|ThePCKid]] ([[User talk:ThePCKid|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ThePCKid|contribs]]) 22:10, 11 March 2011 (UTC)

==Pinyin Hyperlinks To Wiktionary==

Seems to me they range from broken (relatively good) to misleading (bad). They should be erased. [[Special:Contributions/79.176.136.189|79.176.136.189]] ([[User talk:79.176.136.189|discuss]]) 21:57, 22 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Energy ==

We use the notion of energy of a body from Newton's second law, and thus total energy is conserved. Common forms of energy in physics are potential and kinetic energy.
The potential energy is usually the energy due to matter having certain position (configuration) in a field, commonly the gravitational field of Earth.
Kinetic energy is the energy due to motion relative to a frame of reference.
In thermodynamics, we deal with mainly work and heat, which are different manifestations of the energy in the universe.

== Work ==

Work is said to be done by a system if the effect on the surroundings can be reduced solely to that of lifting a weight.
Work is only ever done at the boundary of a system.
Again, we use the intuitive definition of work, and this will be complete only with the statement of the second law of thermodynamics.

Consider a piston-cylinder arrangement as found in automobile engines.
When the gas in the cylinder expands, pushing the piston outwards, it does work on the surroundings.
In this case work done is mechanical.
But how about other forms of energy like heat?
The answer is that heat cannot be completely converted into work, with no other change, due to the second law of thermodynamics.

In the case of the piston-cylinder system, the work done during a cycle is given by ''W'', where ''W = &amp;minus;&amp;int; F dx = &amp;minus;&amp;int; p dV'', where ''F = p A'', and ''p'' is the pressure on the inside of the piston (note the minus sign in this relationship).
In other words, the work done is the area under the ''p-V'' diagram.
Here, ''F'' is the external opposing force, which is equal and opposite to that exerted by the system.
A corollary of the above statement is that a system undergoing free expansion does no work.
The above definition of work will only hold for the quasi-static case, when the work done is reversible work.

[[Image:work_notstate_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Work not a State Function]]

A consequence of the above statement is that work done is not a state function, since it depends on the path (which curve you consider for integration from state 1 to 2).
For a system in a cycle which has states 1 and 2, the work done depends on the path taken during the cycle.
If, in the cycle, the movement from 1 to 2 is along ''A'' and the return is along ''C'', then the work done is the lightly shaded area.
However, if the system returns to 1 via the path ''B'', then the work done is larger, and is equal to the sum of the two areas.

[[Image:Indicator_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Indicator Diagram p vs V]]

The above image shows a typical indicator diagram as output by an automobile engine.
The shaded region is proportional to the work done by the engine, and the volume ''V'' in the ''x''-axis is obtained from the piston displacement, while the ''y''-axis is from the pressure inside the cylinder.
The work done in a cycle is given by ''W'', where

&lt;math&gt;
  W = -\oint p dV
&lt;/math&gt;

Work done by the system is negative, and work done on the system is positive, by the convention used in this book.

=== Flow Energy ===

So far we have looked at the work done to compress fluid in a system.
Suppose we have to introduce some amount of fluid into the system at a pressure ''p''.
Remember from the definition of the system that matter can enter or leave an open system.
Consider a small amount of fluid of mass ''dm'' with volume ''dV'' entering the system.
Suppose the area of cross section at the entrance is ''A''.
Then the distance the force ''pA'' has to push is ''dx = dV/A''.
Thus, the work done to introduce a small amount of fluid is given by ''pdV'', and the work done per unit mass is ''pv'', where ''v = dV/dm'' is the specific volume.
This value of ''pv'' is called the ''flow energy''.

=== Examples of Work ===

The amount of work done in a process depends on the irreversibilities present.
A complete discussion of the irreversibilities is only possible after the discussion of the second law.
The equations given above will give the values of work for quasi-static processes, and many real world processes can be approximated by this process.
However, note that work is only done if there is an opposing force in the boundary, and that a volume change is not strictly required.

=== Work in a Polytropic Process ===

Consider a polytropic process ''pV&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=C'', where ''C'' is a constant.
If the system changes its states from 1 to 2, the work done is given by

&lt;math&gt;
  W = -\int_{V_1}^{V_2}\frac{C}{V^n}dV = \frac{p_2V_2 - p_1V_1}{1 - n}
&lt;/math&gt;

And additionally, if n=1

&lt;math&gt;
  W = -\int_{V_1}^{V_2}\frac{C}{V^n}dV = -C \ln \frac{V_2}{V_1}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Heat ==

Before thermodynamics was an established science, the popular theory was that heat was a fluid, called ''caloric'',  that was stored in a body.
Thus, it was thought that a hot body transferred heat to a cold body by transferring some of this fluid to it.
However, this was soon disproved by showing that heat was generated when drilling bores of guns, where both the drill and the barrel were initially cold.

Heat is the energy exchanged due to a temperature difference.
As with work, heat is defined at the boundary of a system and is a path function.
Heat rejected by the system is negative, while the heat absorbed by the system is positive.

=== Specific Heat ===

The ''specific heat'' of a substance is the amount of heat required for a unit rise in the temperature in a unit mass of the material.
If this quantity is to be of any use, the amount of heat transferred should be a linear function of temperature.
This is certainly true for ideal gases.
This is also true for many metals and also for real gases under certain conditions.
In general, we can only talk about the average specific heat, ''c&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; = Q/m&amp;Delta;T''.
Since it was customary to give the specific heat as a property in describing a material, methods of analysis came to rely on it for routine calculations.
However, since it is only constant for some materials, older calculations became very convoluted for newer materials.
For instance, for finding the amount of heat transferred, it would have been simple to give a chart of ''Q(&amp;Delta;T)'' for that material.
However, following convention, the tables of ''c&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;Delta;T)'' were given, so that a double iterative solution over ''c&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T'' was required.

Calculating specific heat requires us to specify what we do with Volume and Pressure when we change temperature.  When Volume is fixed, it is called specific heat at constant volume (C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;).  When Pressure is fixed, it is called specific heat at constant pressure (C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Latent Heat ===

It can be seen that the specific heat as defined above will be infinitely large for a phase change, where heat is transferred without any change in temperature.
Thus, it is much more useful to define a quantity called ''latent heat'', which is the amount of energy required to change the phase of a unit mass of a substance at the phase change temperature.

=== Adiabatic Process ===

An ''adiabatic'' process is defined as one in which there is no heat transfer with the surroundings, that is, the change in amount of energy dQ=0
.
A gas contained in an insulated vessel undergoes an adiabatic process.
Adiabatic processes also take place even if the vessel is not insulated if the process is fast enough that there is not enough time for heat to escape (''e.g.'' the transmission of sound through air).
Adiabatic processes are also ideal approximations for many real processes, like expansion of a vapor in a turbine, where the heat loss is much smaller than the work done.

== First Law of Thermodynamics ==

=== Joule Experiments ===

[[File:Joule apparatus.png|Joule's Experiments for First Law]]

[[Image:joule_first_bath_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Joule's Experiments for First Law]]

It was well known that heat and work both change the energy of a system.
Joule conducted a series of experiments which showed the relationship between heat and work in a thermodynamic cycle for a system.
He used a paddle to stir an insulated vessel filled with fluid.
The amount of work done on the paddle was noted (the work was done by lowering a weight, so that work done = ''mgz'').
Later, this vessel was placed in a bath and cooled.
The energy involved in increasing the temperature of the bath was shown to be equal to that supplied by the lowered weight.
Joule also performed experiments where electrical work was converted to heat using a coil and obtained the same result.

== Statement of the First Law for a Closed System==

The first law states that ''when heat and work interactions take place between a closed system and the environment, the algebraic sum of the heat and work interactions for a cycle is zero''.

Mathematically, this is equivalent to 

 dQ + dW = 0 for any cycle closed to mass flow

Q is the heat transferred, and W is the work done on or by the system. Since these are the only ways energy can be transferred, this implies that the total energy of the system in the cycle is a constant.

One consequence of the statement is that the total energy of the system is a property of the system.
This leads us to the concept of internal energy.

=== Internal Energy ===

In thermodynamics, the ''internal energy'' is the energy of a system due to its temperature.
The statement of first law refers to thermodynamic cycles.
Using the concept of internal energy it is possible to state the first law for a non-cyclic process.
Since the first law is another way of stating the conservation of energy, the energy of the system is the sum of the heat and work input, ''i.e.'', ''&amp;Delta;E = Q + W''.
Here ''E'' represents the internal energy (U) of the system along with the kinetic energy (KE) and the potential energy (PE) and is called the ''total energy'' of the system. This is the statement of the first law for non-cyclic processes, as long as they are still closed to the flow of mass (''E = U + KE + PE''). The KE and PE terms are relative to an external reference point i.e. the system is the gas within a ball, the ball travels in a trajectory that varies in height H and velocity V and subsequently KE and PE with time, but this has no affect upon the energy of the gas molecules within the ball, which is dictated only by the internal energy of the system (U). Thermodynamics does not define the nature of the internal energy, but it can be rationalised using other theories (i.e. the gas kinetic theory), but in this case is due to the KE and PE of the gas molecules within the ball, not to be mistaken with the KE and PE of the ball itself.

For gases, the value of ''KE'' and ''PE'' is quite small, so the important term is the internal energy function ''U''.
In particular, since for an ideal gas the state can be specified using two variables, the state variable ''u'' is given by ''u(v, T)'', where ''v'' is the specific volume and ''T'' is the temperature.

Introducing this temperature dependence explicitly is important in many calculations. For this purpose, the constant-volume heat capacity is defined as follows: ''c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;part;u/&amp;part;t)&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the specific heat at constant volume. A constant-pressure heat capacity will be defined later, and it is important to keep them straight. The important point here is that the other variable that U depends on &quot;naturally&quot; is v, so to isolate the temperature dependence of U you want to take the derivative at constant v.

=== Internal Energy for an Ideal Gas ===

In the previous section, the internal energy of an ideal gas was shown to be a function of both the volume and temperature.
Joule performed an experiment where a gas at high pressure inside a bath at the same temperature was allowed to expand into a larger volume.

[[Image:joule_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Joule's Experiment Temperature Invariance]]

In the above image, two vessels, labeled A and B, are immersed in an insulated tank containing water.
A thermometer is used to measure the temperature of the water in the tank.
The two vessels A and B are connected by a tube, the flow through which is controlled by a stop.
Initially, A contains gas at high pressure, while B is nearly empty.
The stop is removed so that the vessels are connected and the final temperature of the bath is noted.

The temperature of the bath was unchanged at the end of the process, showing that the internal energy of an ideal gas was the function of temperature alone.
Thus ''Joule's law'' is stated as ''(&amp;part;u/&amp;part;v)&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''.

== Enthalpy ==

According to the first law, 
''dQ + dW = dE''

If all the work is pressure volume work, then we have

''dW = &amp;minus; p dV''

&amp;rArr; ''dQ =  dU + pdV = d(U + pV) - Vdp''

&amp;rArr; ''d(U + pV) = dQ + Vdp''

We define ''H &amp;equiv; U + pV'' as the ''enthalpy'' of the system, and ''h = u + pv'' is the specific enthalpy.
In particular, for a constant pressure process,

''&amp;Delta;Q = &amp;Delta;H''

With arguments similar to that for ''c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;part;h/&amp;part;t)&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Since ''h'', ''p'', and ''t'' are state variables, ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a state variable.
As a corollary, for ideal gases, ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; + R'', and for incompressible fluids, ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''

=== Throttling ===

[[Image:throttling_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Throttling Process]]

''Throttling'' is the process in which a fluid passing through a restriction loses pressure.
It usually occurs when fluid passes through small orifices like porous plugs.
The original throttling experiments were conducted by Joule and Thompson.
As seen in the previous section, in adiabatic throttling the enthalpy is constant.
What is significant is that for ideal gases, the enthalpy depends only on temperature, so that there is no temperature change, as there is no work done or heat supplied.
However, for real gases, below a certain temperature, called the ''inversion point'', the temperature drops with a drop in pressure, so that throttling causes cooling, ''i.e.'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rArr; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''
The amount of cooling produced is quantified by the Joule-Thomson coefficient ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;JT&lt;/sub&gt; = (&amp;part;T/&amp;part;p)&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''.
For instance, the inversion temperature for air is about 400&amp;deg;C.

=== Simple, Angiosperm Leaves ===

This page presents the terminology used to describe the shapes and forms of leaves. The following examples are all '''simple''' leaves.  All are from flowering plants (angiosperms). Descriptive terms are given for the lamina shape (that is, its overall shape in outline), the lamina margin, the form or shape of both the apex (tip) and the base (lamina junction with petiole) of the leaf, and (in some cases) other qualities evident in the example picture presented.

=== Compound, Angiosperm Leaves ===

These examples are all '''compound''' leaves. In these leaves, it is not always very instructive to describe the &quot;leaf outline&quot; and better to describe the number (or range) of leaflets. If the number is odd, there will be an unpaired leaflet at the tip.  The shape terminology can be applied to the individual leaflets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm thinking that the idea of groups (that is, sets-with-operations) should be well introduced before this section. That way, division can be described as, for a set ''S'', &lt;math&gt;f:S\times (S-\{0\})\to S&lt;/math&gt;. By suddenly assuming that operations (which, yes, are really just functions with two arguments) are known and defined, we're doing much, much more hand-waving than is healthy.

Yes, it's an intuitive idea, but one of the big parts of discrete math is formally defining things that we've learned to take for granted.

[[User:Grendelkhan|Grendelkhan]]

: I do strongly think that it's important to introduce groups ''afterward''. I mean how can one introduce something like the group ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under addition modulo 3 without having to explain the &quot;modulo 3&quot; part?

: If there's too much handwaving, we can surely put our hands down and clean up the text. Do you think that we should define things about division in '''Z''' more formally? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:20, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:: Finite groups may require a bit of handwaving (thought the group consisting of {1, -1} and multiplication is pretty intuitive), but infinite groups like ('''Z''',+) and ('''Q'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,*) can be introduced right after sets and functions.

:: I notice that there's already an in-depth treatment of groups in [[Abstract_algebra/Groups]]; maybe a quick introduction geared to the material at hand? Something like &quot;A group is a set along with an operation. An operation is a function of two arguments. An in-depth treatment of groups is over at [[Abstract_algebra/Groups]], but these are the essentials for right now.&quot; Cosets, *morphisms, order---these things don't need to get described until formal group theory.

:: It'll also depend on how much group theory's going to come up in chapters between here and its formal introduction. If you don't define the basics here, you might end up doing it piecemeal over the following bunch of chapters, all hodge-podgey. [[User:Grendelkhan|Grendelkhan]] 17:05, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:: Wouldn't it be somewhat useful to not introduce groups in this book, but give link to that Groups book entirely? After all, that is the best thing about a web book like this, linking. [[User:huopa|huopa]] 14 Jul 2004

Isn't it GCF (greatest common factor), not GCD? At least, that's the way I was always taught. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:35, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)

: It does have different names. Let's just stick with the notation that's there? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:26, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I'm surprised this isn't its own text.  Is there some reason for it to be part of Discrete Math? [[User:MikeBorkowski|MikeBorkowski]] 12:00, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Science explores into the actuality of forms and phenomena. All
the branches of science are the various ways to realize the truth of
existence. The approach of each of them starts from the obvious known and
aims at investigating the hidden unknown. The ultimate truth of life is being
approached from all directions. All the sciences are exploring the various
strata of creation, from the gross to the subtler fields of existence. &lt;/p&gt;

It is a systematic investigation into the true nature of the ultimate
reality. Although, like any other science, it is theoretical in its nature,
its applied aspects reach much farther horizons of the supreme reality of
life than those of abstract metaphysical speculations. &lt;/p&gt;

the section on “Science of Being” may at first appear to be highly abstract,

individual to experience directly the pure state of Being. It is done by
consciously entering into the experience of the subtle strata of a thought,

thought, and then arriving at the very source of thought. Then the conscious

&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;The Science of Being, which gives rise to the practical art of
living, is a science which is much more valuable for human life than all the
sciences known so far to the human mind. For, up to now, the basis of all the
sciences has been the human mind functioning from a limited field of
consciousness or limited potential. The Science of Being, through the
practice of Transcendental Meditation, enlarges the conscious capacity of the
mind to infinite values and therefore functions not only as the basis for the
great expansion of knowledge in every field of science, but also brings to
man a direct way to fulfillment. &lt;/p&gt;

==William I==

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WilliamI.JPG|frame|Figure 1-1: William I]] --&gt;


The course of English political, legal and cultural history was changed in 1066, when William, Duke of Normandy (also called William the Conqueror) successfully invaded the nation and displaced the Saxon king, Harold II.

In 1066 King Edward, also called St Edward the Confessor, died. His cousin, the Duke of Normandy, claimed that the childless King had named him heir during a visit to France, and that the other claimant to the throne, Harold Godwinson, had pledged to support William when he was shipwrecked in Normandy. The veracity of this tale, however, is doubtful, and Harold took the crown upon King Edward's death. William, however, invaded England in September, and defeated (and killed) Harold at the famous Battle of Hastings in October.

==William II==
In 1087, King William I died, and divided his lands and riches between his three sons. The eldest, Robert, became Duke of Normandy; the second, William, became King of England; the youngest, Henry, received silver. Henry, however, eventually came to possess all of his father's dominions. William II died without children, so Henry became King. Henry later invaded Normandy, imprisoned his brother, and took over the Duchy of Normandy. 

==Henry I, Stephen and Matilda==
Henry, whose sons had predeceased him, took an unprecedented step: naming a woman as his heir. He declared that his daughter Matilda would be the next Queen. However, Matilda's claim was disputed by Stephen, a grandson of William I in the female line. After Henry I died in 1135, Stephen usurped the throne, but he was defeated and imprisoned by Matilda in 1141. Later, however, Matilda was defeated, and Stephen took the throne.

Matilda, however, was not completely defeated. She escaped from Stephen's army, and her own son, Henry Plantagenet, led a military expedition against Stephen. Stephen was forced to agree to name Henry as his heir, and when Stephen died in 1154, Henry took the throne, commencing the Plantagenet dynasty.

[[UK Constitution and Government/Normans|Previous Chapter]] | [[UK Constitution and Government/Houses of Lancaster and York|Next Chapter]]
------
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Henry II==
With the death of King Stephen, Henry Plantagenet took the throne as King Henry II. He already had control over the duchy of Normandy; he had also inherited Anjou from his father Geoffrey. Furthermore, he acquired many territories from his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henry thus had a vast territory when he came to the throne; as King of England, he took over Ireland.

Henry II made other remarkable achievements in England. He established courts throughout England and introduced trial by jury. Furthermore, he reduced the power of ecclesiastical courts. The Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord High Chancellor, Thomas à Becket, opposed the King's attempt to take power from the Church. At a confrontation between the two in 1170, Henry II famously said, &quot;Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?&quot; Four of his knights took him literally, and in December murdered Becket. 

Henry, however, did not have good relations with his sons. In 1170, his eldest son Henry was crowned, and is known as Henry the Young King. In 1173, the Young King and his brothers revolted against Henry II, planning to dethrone him and leave the Young King as the sole ruler in England. In 1174, the revolt failed, and all of the brothers surrendered. Later, in 1189, Henry II's third son, Richard, attacked and defeated him. Henry II died days after his defeat, and Richard, nicknamed &quot;the Lionheart,&quot; became King.

==Richard I==
Richard the Lionheart is often portrayed as a hero, but he did not do much for England. In fact, he spent almost all of his time outside the nation, and did not even find it necessary to learn English. He is most famous for his fighting in the Crusades, a holy war seeking to assert Christian dominance over Jerusalem. 

==John==
Richard's successor was his brother, John Allin. Henry II had granted John the lands of Ireland, so when John came to the throne, the titles Lord of Ireland and King of England were united. However, though Ireland became a dominion of the Crown, several lands on the Continent, including most of Normandy, were lost during John's reign. 

King John was very unpopular with the nation's magnates, the barons, whom he taxed. A particularly resented tax was the scutage, a penalty paid by barons who failed to supply the King with military resources. In 1215, after John had been defeated in France, several barons rebelled. Later in that year, John compromised and signed the ''Magna Carta'', or Great Charter. It guaranteed political liberties and provided for a church free from domination by the monarchy. These liberties and privileges, however, were not extended to the common man; rather, they were granted to the barons. Nonetheless, the document is immensely significant in English constitutional history as it is a major indication of a limitation on the power of the Crown.

King John, however, broke the provisions of the Charter later, claiming that he agreed to it under duress. In the next year, when he was retreating from a French invasion, John lost England's most valuable treasures - the Crown Jewels - in a marsh known as The Wash. His mental and physical health deteriorated, and he later died from dysentery.

==Henry III==
John was succeeded by his son, Henry, who was only nine years old. Henry III, despite a reign that lasted over half a century, is not a particularly memorable or noteworthy monarch. Nonetheless, a very significant political development occurred during Henry III's reign. In 1258, one of Henry's opponents, Simon de Montfort, called a Parliament, the forerunner of the modern institution. It, however, bears little resemblance to the modern body, as it had little power.

Simon de Montfort, who was married to Henry III's sister, defeated and imprisoned his brother-in-law in 1264. He was originally supported by Henry's son Edward, but the latter later returned to his father's side. Edward defeated de Montfort in 1265 at the Battle of Evesham and restored Henry III. In 1270, the ageing Henry gave up most of power to his son; two years later, he died, and Edward succeeded to the throne.

==Edward I==


Edward I was the monarch who brought the entire British Isles under English domination. In order to raise money in the war against the rebellious Wales, Edward instituted a tax on Jewish moneylenders. The tax, however, was too high for the moneylenders, who eventually became too poor to pay. Edward accused them of disloyalty and abolished the right of Jews to lend money. He also ordered that all Jews wear a yellow star on their clothing; that idea was later adopted by Adolf Hitler in Germany. Edward also executed hundreds of Jews, and in 1290 banished all of them from England.

In 1291, the Scottish nobility agreed to submit to Edward. When Queen Margaret I died, the nobles allowed Edward to choose between the rival claimants to the throne. Edward installed the weak John Balliol as monarch, and easily dominated Scotland. The Scots, however, rebelled. Edward I executed the chief dissenter, William Wallace, further antagonising Scotland.

==Edward II==
When Edward I died in 1307, his son Edward became King. Edward II abandoned his father's ambitions to conquer Scotland. Furthermore, he recalled several men his father had banished. The barons, however, rebelled against Edward. In 1312, Edward agreed to hand over power to a committee of barons known as &quot;ordainers.&quot; These ordainers removed the power of representatives of commoners to advise the monarch on new laws, and concentrated all power in the nobility. Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce was slowly reconquering Scotland. In 1314, Robert's forces defeated England's in battle, and Robert gained control over most of Scotland. 

In 1321, the ordainers banished a baron allied with the King, Hugh le Despencer, along with his son. In 1322, Edward reacted by recalling them and attacking the barons. He executed the leader of the ordainers, the Earl of Lancaster, and permitted the Despencers to rule England. The Despencers declared that all statutes created by the ordainers were invalid, and that thereafter, no law would be valid unless it had received the assent of the Commons, representatives of the commoners of England. However, the Despencers became corrupt, causing them to be very unpopular, even with Edward's own wife, Isabella. In 1325, Isabella went to France, and in 1326, she returned, allied with Roger Mortimer, one of the barons Edward had defeated. The two killed the Despencers and forced Edward to resign his crown to his son, also named Edward. Edward II was imprisoned and later killed.

==Edward III==
Since Edward III was a child, Isabella and Roger Mortimer ruled England in his stead. When Edward III became eighteen, however, he had Mortimer executed and banished his mother from court. In 1328, when Charles IV, Isabella's father and King of France, died, Edward claimed France, suggesting that the kingdom should pass to him through his mother. His claim was opposed by Philip VI, who claimed that the throne could only pass in the male line. Edward declared war on Philip, setting off the Hundred Years' War. The British claim to the French throne was not abandoned until the nineteenth century.

==Richard  II==
Richard II succeeded his grandfather, Edward III, in 1377. Richard II was only about ten years old when coming to the throne. Even as an adult, Richard II was a rather weak king. In 1399, he was deposed by his cousin, Henry of Bolingbroke, and probably murdered the next year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am not an active user anymore. Feel free to change any articles that I have created or edited significantly. I'm currently (as of February 2007) a junior at [[w:Poudre High School|Poudre High School]] and so over my head with many other activities that I no longer have the time that I had back in 8th grade to create and maintain books on this site. Maybe that will change some day. But for now, I will not be able to spend time working on this site.

When I was active, back in 2004-2005, I was most noted for my work on the [[German]] Wikibook. I proposed and created the first few lessons for [[German: Level I]], but that was it. Coming back three years later, I find that there still isn't much more than what I put into it, so it would be great if someone could devote a little more than just administrative effort to the book.

I also did create a couple video game guides due to my interests at the time. However, those &quot;books&quot; became little more than introductions, and I have moved on from many of those games anyway. Again, feel free to edit or delete anything I have written on those pages.

Below is a copy of what information I had on my user page when I was active on this site.

Farewell, enjoy what I created, and improve on it. After all, that's what Wikibooks is all about.

==What my user page looked like back in 2004-2005==

I joined '''Wikibooks''' (after '''Wikipedia''') on February 5th, 2004. If you want to send me a message see my [[User talk:SamE|Talk page]].

I'm also SamE at [[w:User:SamE|Wikipedia]] and [[m:User:SamE|Meta]], but I'm one of the few who spend more time here at Wikibooks than at either of those.

I'm also [[Special:Contributions/67.176.76.147|User:67.176.76.147]] if I'm not logged on.

===Wikibooks I'm Editing===

I am currently working on the [[German]] book, specifically [[German: Level I]]. I have done most of the editing there; see the history for [[German:Beginner Lesson 2]] for example.

I've worked on the [[Chip's Challenge]] game walkthrough, but my computer crashed and I lost the game.

I am also helping write the [[Civilization]] walkthrough, as I play [[Civ:Civilization III|Civilization III]].

I'm working on the [[Super Mario World]] and [[TI-83 Plus: Phoenix|Phoenix]] game guides, but they are currently very bad.

Towards the end of 2004, I did a lot to improve the [[Main Page]] in various ways. I've also written [[Help:How to start a book]], which newbies seem to be using (they're following the directions in the order they are on the page).

I like to look into a book ([[US History]] for example) and start reading it, and of course, there are errors. Most of the time I will correct those errors.

Over the summer I hope to be editing more and more often.

===Wikibooks and Parts I've Created===

====2004====

I created [[German: Level I]] on March 6th, and [[Game Guides and Strategy]] on March 27th.

I created [[Super Mario World]] on April 11th, and [[TI-83 Plus: Phoenix|Phoenix]] on May 12th.

====2005====

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, what's on your mind on this mellow eve?

Taoster, 

You said you wanted help with the Wikibook. Well, I want to help.

I'm not fluent, but I've studied two semesters in the States, now I'm starting a third in Taipei with a new textbook, so I have some perspective and idea of what I'd like to see.

I should have a lot of free time this summer, and working on this sounds like fun. I really want to make this a comprehensive introductory course and I have a lot of ideas toward that end. I was just wondering what your ideas were for the direction and what you would do if effort was no object.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Taoster. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Taoster~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Editing Chapters==
You simply click on the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top of any page you want to edit.  You can also just edit a section or subsection - any place you see a little 'edit' to the far right above a line, click on it to edit that section.  The thoughts behind the editing process of the chapters will be documented in the &quot;discussion&quot; tab of each chapter - go there to record your intentions for your assigned chapter.

If you would like to make any suggestions to the editorial board, we welcome them.  At the top of the XML: Managing Data Exchange contents page is a tab to &quot;discussion&quot; follow that link and edit the page with your comments, be sure to follow the directions for entries.

* '''Use wiki code, not HTML code''' when you edit a page.

* how to make a link :  &lt;nowiki&gt;[[XML: Managing Data Exchange/NameOfThePage(on the page)|NameOfThePage(displayed as the link)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* no plagiarism : please use citations and references to books, articles, and websites that have helped you contribute to the book.

* All figures and graphics should be prefixed with 'xml' to avoid accidentally overwriting another file (e.g., xmldmcity defines the data model for city).

* Where possible use [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ Portable Network Graphics (PNG)] for graphics because of its superiority to GIF and JPEG. Also, PNG is Open Source. [http://www.openoffice.org/ OpenOffice.org Draw] can be used to create PNG files.

==Consistency guidelines==

''' - developed to create a consistent look and feel to the book'''

===Layout===


* '''Chapter summary required'''
The bottom of each chapter should include a chapter summary highlighting the key points of the chapter. Follow the formatting guideline detailed later on this page.

* '''Bold new words'''
As new concepts and terminology are introduced in each chapter, make sure that they are defined first before using them; so that the reader understands what the words and ideas represent.  '''Bold''' the first occurrence of the word (or preceding the definition).

* '''Use the sentence format for titles'''
Capitalize the first letter of a title and allow the rest of the letters to be lower case, as in this title.

* '''Avoid the use of underline and all capital words'''

* '''Tables, figures, and code references'''
For consistency, label all tables, figures (e.g. charts and photos), and code examples as &quot;exhibits.&quot;  Place the label for exhibits at the top of the exhibit, flush left, and enumerate the exhibits, followed by a brief caption. Examples: &quot;Exhibit 1: XML data types&quot; and &quot;Exhibit 2: Schema code example&quot; 

* '''Concept capsules and breathing room'''
Think of your chapter as a data model or a large steak.  A useful data model is broken down into its smallest attributes that require recording and maintaining for future analysis.  A large steak is best eaten in bite size pieces to prevent choking and promote good digestion.  As you revise your chapter consider the basic elements of your topic; break your topic down and present each element in a section - so that it is easy for the reader to follow and understand each part.  Feel free to use bullets to represent lists.

To continue with the steak analogy, it is also good to eat slowly, taking breaths between each bite.  Allow for spaces between each subsection and greater spaces between each section.  This opens up the text so that it does not appear to dense and compact - and therefore intimidating.

* '''NetBeans (or other XML editor) Examples'''
Scroll down the contents page to &quot;Appendices&quot;.  You will see a link to the chapter &quot;Using an XML editor&quot;.  When you open this link - go to the edit this page tab and insert a link under the NetBeans heading with the name of your chapter.  This is the format for the link:
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[XML: Managing Data Exchange/ChapterName(NetBeans)|ChapterName]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
After you save your edit, the XML Editor page will contain a link to your new NetBeans page.  It will appear red because no information has been posted to that page yet.  Click on the link and paste all the NetBeans information from your chapter into the edit box.
In your assigned chapter, at the places where there were NetBeans information (that you just cut and paste into the XML editor page) - put a link to the XML editor - your Chapter page.

* '''[[Help:Wikibooks]]''' &lt;= this link will provide several wiki guidelines - this page is also accessible from the 'help' link in the navigation box on the left bar of every one of these Wikibook pages.  It contains information on inserting pictures, creating tables using wiki language (which is much easier to write and read).
This help page also has a link to a &quot;sandbox.&quot;  This is a blank page that allows you to experiment with wiki without affecting a real page.

===Code examples===
* Make all code examples a uniform color (black)—some are all black; some are multicolored.  Please change the ones that are multicolored to all black.

* HTML code is lower case.

* Keep the comments in the code, but put a space above and bellow each comment.

* Include the file name of the code in a comments tag. If you are the author of the code, include your name and the date you authored the code in the comments. See example:


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
    &lt;!--
         Document   : city.xsd
         Created on : March 1, 2005
         Author     : Tim Jones
    --&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


* Keep all the example codes in the chapter on the same topic—the TOURGUIDE.  If there are examples in your chapter that deviate from this theme, please change them to show examples from TOURGUIDE.

* If your code contains HTML or the XML declaration then you will want to put the tags &lt;nowiki&gt;  &lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;

* In order to get those 'pre' tags to show up I had to use the tags &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt; ... &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you run into trouble while inserting code, one of the two tags mentioned above might be able to get you out.

* You do '''not''' have to create a table around samples of a code example; usually just putting a few spaces in front of each line will create the dashed blue lined box

===Spelling===

* Use the spelling &quot;stylesheet&quot; instead of &quot;style sheet.&quot;

* Use the spelling &quot;opening tag&quot; instead of &quot;opening-tag.&quot;

* '''Check your wiki text with a spellchecker''' (e.g. copy and paste in a text editor that supports spell checking).

===Exercises &amp; Answers===

Create two links at the bottom of your chapter, one to an Exercises page and one to the Answers page already made (you can find this answer page link at the bottom of the contents page).  

In the Exercises page, cut and paste your chapter exercises into a '''new page'''. An easy way to create a new page is simply to go to your main chapter page, type &quot;exercises&quot; at the end of the URL, and hit  enter. If the page does not exist, Wikipedia will ask you to create the page by going to &quot;edit this page.&quot;  

At the top and bottom of the Exercises page, provide a link to the chapter and the Answers page—and vice versa with the Answers page.

===Elements of Style - Principles of Composition===
'''taken from ''the Elements of Style'' - by William Strunk and E.B. White'''

* '''Make the paragraph the unit of composition''' - The subject will need to be broken down into topics, and topics will need to be broken down into concepts and subconcepts.  Each concept should be explored within its own paragraph.

* '''Put statements in positive form''' - &quot;Make definitive assertions.  Avoid tame, hesitating, noncommittal language.  Use the word 'not' as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as means of evasion.&quot;

* '''Use definite, specific, concrete language''' - &quot;Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.&quot;

* '''Omit needless words''' - &quot;A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences...Many expressions violate this principle: 'the fact that,' he is a man who ... - he ...&quot;

* '''Avoid a succession of loose sentences'''

* '''Express coordinate ideas in similar form'''

* '''Keep related words together'''

* '''Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end'''

==Source code==
For inserting source code (e.g., XML or Java) into the book, use the following format:


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
  &lt;country&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;au&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;country&gt;Australia&lt;/country&gt;
      &lt;flag&gt;au.gif&lt;/flag&gt;
  &lt;/country&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


Use the following wiki code:

&lt;pre&gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;
  &lt;country&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;au&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;country&gt;Australia&lt;/country&gt;
      &lt;flag&gt;au.gif&lt;/flag&gt;
  &lt;/country&gt;
&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

==Section summary==
Section summaries should appear in the following format:

{| style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;
|- 
| A chapter summary
|-
|}

Use the following wiki code:

&lt;pre&gt;
{| style=&quot;background:linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;
|- 
| A chapter summary
|-
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Story==
Stories/case studies should appear in the following format:

{| style=&quot;background: lightyellow; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;
|- 
| A story
|-
|}

Use the following wiki code:

&lt;pre&gt;
{| style=&quot;background: lightyellow; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;
|- 
| A story
|-
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm hoping to finish up the preface tonight and start to flesh out some topic sentences atleast in chapter I. It's amazing the scale of this project. I took AP European History in 10th grade as well, and I'm currently about to finish 11th. So it has been a while, which is why I have the Work Cited, I'm having to review it all before I write about it to make sure I have some form of accuracy in what I'm writing. Please keep reading it, commenting, and fixing the little problems and I will happily do the same for German. I was going to add more foods to the list but couldn't quite remember the genders. Also most of the things I was going to add were like hackfleisch and erdberren where what was on the list seemed more like prepared foods.--[[User:Alexbl|Alexbl]] 23:26, 29 May 2004 (UTC)

== Hey SamE ==

Hey SamE!

Thank you for this very warm welcome - I hope I didn't mess with the layout too much! Actually I was planning to do just the opposite of your site. I thought about creating a wikibook for my private tuition students explaining to them English grammar. I then thought it might by a good idea to have a look at what other projects have really done. So when I came by your site I found it so great that I simply had to add something to it (real great work). I know wikis are not supposed to work this way but: if the content I produced seems appropriate for you, I would like to join the group of author.

Your User:Page says you’re teaching the beginning student. That’s very interesting. Where is that course (some high school?). How do you do that and what feedback do you get? Private mail welcome (guido.bockamp@gmx.de)!

--Guido

PS.: Before I forget this again: What the hell are &quot;Dieser-forms&quot;. Being a native speaker it's sometimes very strange to learn about the grammar you use every day, but never thought about. Don’t mistake me, it may be perfectly right, I’m just curious!


Right, I got it! So you have kind of a “learning by teaching” approach. This always worked great for me. I'll see if I can help you with it, but it's always dangerous to learn from native speakers, because they often take thinks for granted that are difficult and unusual for learners Please tell me, if you don’t see the point in what I write. Regards
--- Guido

== Thanks ==
I'm working slowly on Talk:Main, too.  We need to be prepared for a new influx of interest!  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 02:07, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Final Fantasy move? ==

hi SamE - could I please draw your attention to [[talk:Final Fantasy]] i left a message for you there but you probably don't have it on your watchlist

== German ==

Hey Sam, I am really happy you are taking the time to do this German~~English Textbook. I am really taking my time to use it to its fullest. 

I just wanted to let you know that it is going into good use and I hope you are able to make/edit the lessons before I catch up to you. I do not want to rush you, I just want you to know that your work is appreciated.

Mitchowen

== why tschau? ==
Why did you switch it to Tschau in http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/German:Beginner_Lesson_3 .

This word does not exist in colloquial, &quot;normal&quot; German and it would e econfusing to German learners I think... e.g. because they wont find anybody who talks with Tschau...

:The word 'tschau' does not exist on [[German:Beginner Lesson 3]], and it never has. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 23:07, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)

hi, ah sorry I misstook it, I meant [[German:Beginner Lesson 2A]] on the likes and dislikes part...[[User:Sma|Sma]] 16:52, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I changed it back primarily because the way you suggested was inconsistent with the problems (It wasn't a blank). 'Tschau' isn't even the focus of lesson 2, because it's taught in lesson 1. The way I've been taught (in HRW's Komm mit! series), 'tschau' and 'tschüss' are both used in the familiar. I think if they included it, that it is used at least somewhere in Germany. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 01:21, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

well ok, I disagree with you on the fact that it is used in Germany (I am talking about major spreading, there might be some little regions who actually use it, but I dont think this book should teach/focus on regional differences or dialects of several areas), at least I havent heard it in my whole life, living in several federal states, but tschau is ok then with me..
:The only form I've seen used is &quot;tschüss&quot; this is the German version. &quot;Tschau&quot; is just colloquial and not used widely. You will find &quot;tschüss&quot; in a good dictionary. I have not found &quot;Tschau&quot; in any dictionary (German-English Oxford-Duden Dictionarty and German Duden Dictionary). Wikipedia does the job [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsch%C3%BCss link title]

btw. Great job SamE! Love the German wikibook.

== Question about FF games==
You're working on a Final Fantasy guide, right? Do you know of any people that could help me construct a Final Fantasy X page (I already created the page, but all in all it's a slow production). My user name is Americanidiot. Could you please contact me on my talk page? Thank you for your time.

== Greetings+ ==
Hello Sam, from another,

I wonder where you live now!  And if you'd like to come to Wikimania in August... also whether you had favorite wikibooks to suggest for this month's writing contest :)  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 8 July 2005 18:51 (UTC)</text>

'''Before we begin:''' This chapter assumes knowledge of
# Ordered selection (permutation) and unordered selection (combination) covered in [[../Supplementary/Basic Counting|Basic counting]],
# [[../Supplementary/Partial Fractions|Method of Partial Fractions]] and,
# Competence in manipulating [[../Supplementary/Summation Sign|Summation Signs]]

== Some Counting Problems ==
''..more to come''

==Generating functions==
''..some motivation to be written''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;

To understand this section you need to see why this is true:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} =  1 + \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{ 1}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt; 

For a more detailed discussion of the above, head to [[../Set Theory and Infinite Processes|Infinity and infinite processes]].

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generating functions, otherwise known as Formal Power Series, are useful for solving problems like:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 + x_2 + 2x_3 = m&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; x_n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;; n = 1, 2, 3 
how many unique solutions are there if &lt;math&gt;m = 55&lt;/math&gt;?

Before we tackle that problem, let's consider the infinite polynomial:
:&lt;math&gt;S = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^n + x^{n+1}... &lt;/math&gt;

We want to obtain a ''closed form'' of this infinite polynomial. The ''closed form'' is simply a way of expressing the polynomial so that it involves only a finite number of operations.  

To find the ''closed form '' we starting with our function:

&lt;math&gt;S = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... &lt;/math&gt;

We multiply both sides of the function by x to get:
&lt;math&gt;
xS = x + x^2 + x^3 + ...
&lt;/math&gt;

Next we subtract S-xS to get

S - xS = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 ... - x - x^2 - x^3 ...

Grouping like terms we get

(1 - x)S = 1 + (x - x) + (x^2 - x^2) + (x^3 - x^3)

Which simplifies to

(1 - x)S = 1

Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - x}&lt;/math&gt; we get
&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{1}{1 - x}
&lt;/math&gt;

So the closed form of 
:1 + x + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...
is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{1 - x}
&lt;/math&gt;

For convenience we can write, although this isn't true for any particular value of ''x''.
:&lt;math&gt;
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = \frac{1}{1 - x} \ ; \ -1 &lt; x &lt; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

==== info - Infinite sums ====
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
The two expressions are not ''equal''. It's just that for certain values of ''x'' (-1 &lt; x &lt; 1), we can approximate the right hand side ''as closely as possible'' by adding up a large number of terms on the left hand side. For example, suppose ''x'' = 1/2, RHS = 2; we approximate the LHS using only 5 terms we get LHS equals 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 1.9375, which is close to 2, as you can imagine by adding more and more terms, we will get closer and closer to 2. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anyway we really only care about its nice algebraic properties, not its numerical value. From now on we will omit the condition for equality to be true when writing out generating functions.

Consider a more general case:
:&lt;math&gt;
S = A + ABx + AB^2x^2 + AB^3x^3 + ... 
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''B'' are constants.

We can derive the ''closed-form'' as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
S &amp;=&amp; A + &amp;ABx + AB^2x^2 + AB^3x^3 + ... \\
BxS &amp;=&amp; &amp;ABx + AB^2x^2 + AB^3x^3 + ... \\
\\
(1 - Bx)S &amp;=&amp; A \\
S &amp;=&amp; \frac{A}{1 - Bx}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The following identity as derived above is worth investing time and effort memorising.
:&lt;math&gt;
A + ABx + AB^2x^2 + AB^3x^3 + ...  = \frac{A}{1 - Bx}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Exercises===
1. Find the closed-form:
:(a)&lt;math&gt; 1 - z + z^2 - z^3 + z^4 - z^5 + ...  &lt;/math&gt;

:(b)&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2z + 4z^2 + 8z^3 + 16z^4 + 32z^5 + ...  &lt;/math&gt;

:(c)&lt;math&gt; z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + z^5 + ...  &lt;/math&gt;

:(d)&lt;math&gt; 3 - 4z + 4z^2 - 4z^3 + 4z^4 - 4z^5 + ...  &lt;/math&gt;

:(e)&lt;math&gt; 1 - z^2 + z^4 - z^6 + z^8 - z^{10} + ...  &lt;/math&gt;

2. Given the closed-form, find a function f(n) for the coefficients of x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;:
:(a)&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 + z} &lt;/math&gt; (Hint: note the plus sign in the denominator)

:(b)&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - 2z} &lt;/math&gt; (Hint: substitute A=1 and B=2 into &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{1 - Bz} &lt;/math&gt;)

:(c)&lt;math&gt;\frac{z}{1 - z} &lt;/math&gt; (Hint: multiply all the terms in &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - z} &lt;/math&gt; by z)

=== Method of Substitution ===
We are given that:
:1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... = 1/(1 - z)
and we can obtain many other generating functions by substitution. For example: letting z = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; we have:
:1 + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ... = 1/(1 - x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

Similarly
:A + ABx + A(Bx)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... = A/(1 - Bx)
is obtained by letting z = Bx then multiplying the whole expression by A.

=== Linear Recurrence Relations ===
The Fibonacci series
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55...
where each and every number, except the first two, is the sum of the two preceding numbers. We say the numbers are ''related'' if the value a number takes depends on the values that come before it in the sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a recurrence relation, it is expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; x_{n-1} &amp;+&amp; \ x_{n - 2}; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 2\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the (''n''+ 1)th number in the sequence. Note that the first number in the sequence is denoted x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Given this recurrence relation, the question we want to ask is &quot;can we find a formula for the (''n''+1)th number in the sequence?&quot;. The answer is yes, but before we come to that, let's look at some examples.

==== Example 1 ====
The expressions
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; 2x_{n-1}&amp; + &amp;3x_{n-2}; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 2\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
define a recurrence relation. The sequence is: 1, 1, 5, 13, 41, 121, 365... Find a formula for the (''n''+1)th number in the sequence.

'''Solution'''
Let G(z) be generating function of the sequence, meaning the coefficient of each power (in ascending order) is the corresponding number in the sequence. So the generating functions looks like this
:&lt;math&gt;
G(z) = 1 + z + 5z^2 + 13z^3 + 41z^4 + 121z^5 + ...
&lt;/math&gt;
Now, by a series of algebraic manipulations, we can find the closed form of the generating function and from that the formula for each coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
&amp; &amp;G(z)    &amp; = &amp;x_0 + &amp;x_1z  + &amp;x_2z^2  &amp;+ &amp;x_3z^3 + x_4z^4 + x_5z^5 + ...\\
2z&amp;\times &amp;G(z)  &amp; = &amp;      &amp;2x_0z + &amp;2x_1z^2 &amp;+ &amp;...\\
3z^2&amp;\times &amp;G(z)&amp; = &amp;      &amp;        &amp;3x_0z^2 &amp;+ &amp;...\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
G(z) - 2zG(z) - 3z^2G(z) &amp;=&amp; x_0 + (x_1 - 2x_0)z    &amp; + \\
                         &amp; &amp; (x_2 - 2x_1 - 3x_0)z^2 &amp; + \\
                         &amp; &amp; (x_3 - 2x_2 - 3x_1)z^3 &amp; + &amp;...
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
by definition x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - 2x&lt;sub&gt;n - 1&lt;/sub&gt; - 3x&lt;sub&gt;n - 2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(1 - 2z - 3z^2)&amp; \times &amp; G(z)&amp; =&amp; x_0 + (x_1 - 2x_0)z\\
\\
               &amp;        &amp; G(z)&amp; =&amp; \frac {1 - z} {1 - 2z - 3z^2}\\
\\
               &amp;        &amp; G(z)&amp; =&amp; \frac {1 - z} {(1 - 3z)(1 + z)}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
by the [[HSE Partial Fractions|method of partial fractions]] we get:
:&lt;math&gt;
G(z) = \frac {1} {2} \times \frac {1} {1 - 3z} + \frac {1} {2} \times \frac {1} {1 + z}
&lt;/math&gt;
each part of the sum is in a recognisable closed-form. We can conclude that:
:&lt;math&gt;
x_n = \frac {1} {2} \times 3^n + \frac {1} {2} \times (-1)^n
&lt;/math&gt;
the reader can easily check the accuracy of the formula.

==== Example 2 ====
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; x_{n-1} &amp;+&amp; x_{n-2}&amp; -&amp; x_{n-3}; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 3\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
x_2 &amp;=&amp; 1 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Find a non-recurrent formula for x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Solution'''
Let G(z) be the generating function of the sequence described above.
:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = x_0 + x_1z + x_2z^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
G(z)(1 - z - z^2 + z^3) &amp;=&amp; x_0 &amp;+&amp; (x_1 - x_0)z + (x_2 - x_1 - x_0)z^2\\
G(z)(1 - z - z^2 + z^3) &amp;=&amp; 1 - z^2\\
\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
G(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1 - z^2}{1 - z - z^2 + z^3}\\
\\
G(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1 - z}{1 - 2z + z^2}\\
\\
G(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1} {1 - z}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, for all n.

====Example 3====
A linear recurrence relation is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; x_{n-1}&amp; + &amp; 6x_{n-2} + 1; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 2\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Find the general formula for x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Solution'''
Let G(z) be the generating function of the recurrence relation.
:&lt;math&gt;G(z)(1 - z - 6z^2) = x_0  +  (x_1 - x_0)z + (x_2 - x_1 - 6x_0)z^2  +...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z)(1 - z - 6z^2) = 1    +  z^2  + z^3   + z^4 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z)(1 - z - 6z^2) = 1    +  z^2(1 + z  +  z^2 + ...)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z)(1 - z - 6z^2) = 1    +  \frac{z^2}{1 - z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G(z)(1 - z - 6z^2) = \frac{1 - z + z^2}{1 - z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
G(z) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1 - z + z^2}{(1 - z)(1 + 2z)(1 - 3z)}\\
G(z) &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{6(1-z)} + \frac{7}{15(1 + 2z)} + \frac{7}{10(1-3z)} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt; x_n = -\frac{1}{6} + \frac{7}{15}(-2)^n + \frac{7}{10}3^n&lt;/math&gt;

==== Exercises ====
1. Derive the formula for the (''n+1'')th numbers in the sequence defined by the linear recurrence relations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; 2x_{n-1}&amp; - &amp;1; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 1\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

2. Derive the formula for the (''n+1'')th numbers in the sequence defined by the linear recurrence relations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
3x_n &amp;=&amp; -4x_{n-1}&amp; + &amp; x_{n-2}; \ \mbox{for n} \ge 2 \\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. (Optional) Derive the formula for the (''n+1'')th Fibonacci  numbers.

== Further Counting ==
Consider the equation
:a + b = n; a, b &amp;ge; 0 are integers 
For a fixed positive integer n, how many solutions are there? We can count the number of solutions:
:0 + n = n
:1 + (n - 1) = n
:2 + (n - 2) = n
:...
:n + 0 = n
As you can see there are (n + 1) solutions. Another way to solve the problem is to consider the generating function
:G(z) = 1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
Let H(z) = G(z)G(z), i.e.
:H(z) = (1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
I claim that the coefficient of z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; in H(z) is the number of solutions to a + b = n, a, b &gt; 0. The reason why lies in the fact that ''when multiplying like terms, indices add''.

Consider
:A(z) = 1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...
Let
:B(z) = A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(z)
it follows
:B(z) = (1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...) + z(1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...) + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...) + z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + ...
:B(z) = 1 + 2z + 3z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ...
Now the coefficient of z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (for n &amp;ge; 0) is clearly the number of solutions to a + b = n (a, b &gt; 0).

We are ready now to derive a very important result: let t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the number solutions to a + b = n (a, b &gt; 0). Then the generating function for the sequence t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is 
:T(z) = (1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + ...)(1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + ...)
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - z)^2} = 1 + 2z + 3z^2 + 4z^3 + ... + (n+1)z^n + ...&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Counting Solutions to a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = n ===
Consider the number of solutions to the following equation:
:a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = n
where a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 0; i = 1, 2, ... m. By applying the method discussed previously. If t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of solutions to the above equation when n = k. The generating function for t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1-z)^m}&lt;/math&gt;
but what is t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;? Unless you have learnt calculus, it's hard to derive a formula just by looking at the equation of T(z). Without assuming knowledge of calculus, we consider the following counting problem.

&quot;You have three sisters, and you have n (n &amp;ge; 3) lollies. You decide to give each of your sisters at least one lolly. In how many ways can this be done?&quot;

One way to solve the problem is to put all the lollies on the table in a straight line. Since there are ''n'' lollies there are (''n'' - 1) gaps between them (just as you have 5 fingers on each hand and 4 gaps between them). Now get 2 dividers, from the (''n'' - 1) gaps available, ''choose'' 2 and put a divider in each of the gaps you have chosen! There you have it, you have divided the ''n'' lollies into three parts, one for each sister. There are &lt;math&gt; n - 1 \choose 2 &lt;/math&gt; ways to do it! If you have 4 sisters, then there are &lt;math&gt; n - 1 \choose 3 &lt;/math&gt; ways to do it. If you have m sisters there are &lt;math&gt; n - 1 \choose m - 1&lt;/math&gt; ways to do it.

Now consider: &quot;You have three sisters, and you have n lollies. You decide to give each of your sisters some lollies (with no restriction as to how much you give to each sister). In how many ways can this be done?&quot;

Please note that you are just solving:
:a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = n
where a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 0; i = 1, 2, 3.

You can solve the problem by putting n + 3 lollies on the table in a straight line. Get two dividers and ''choose'' 2 gaps from the n + 2 gaps available. Now that you have divided n + 3 lollies into 3 parts, with each part having 1 or more lollies. Now take back 1 lollies from each part, and you have solved the problem! So the number of solutions is &lt;math&gt; n + 2 \choose 2 &lt;/math&gt;. More generally, if you have m sisters and n lollies the number of ways to share the lollies is
:&lt;math&gt; {{n + m - 1} \choose {m - 1}} = {{n + m - 1} \choose {n}} &lt;/math&gt; .

Now to the important result, as discussed above the number of solutions to 
:a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + a&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = n
where a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 0; i = 1, 2, 3 ... m
is 
:&lt;math&gt;{{n + m - 1} \choose {n}}&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - z)^m} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty {m + i - 1 \choose i}z^i&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Example 1 ====
The closed form of a generating function T(z) is
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{z}{(1-z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; in the coefficient of z&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; is T(z). Find an explicit formula for t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Solution'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^2} &amp;=&amp; \sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)z^i\\
\\
\frac{z}{(1-z)^2} &amp;=&amp; z\sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)z^i\\
\\
                  &amp;=&amp; \sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)z^{i+1}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = k

==== Example 2 ====
Find the number of solutions to:
:a + b + c + d = n
for all positive integers n (including zero) with the restriction a, b, c ,d &amp;ge; 0.

'''Solution'''
By the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^4} &amp;=&amp; \sum_{i=0}^\infty  {{n + 3}\choose {3}}z^i\\
\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
so
:the number of solutions is &lt;math&gt;{{n + 3}\choose {3}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== More Counting ===
We turn to a slightly harder problem of the same kind. Suppose we are to count the number of solutions to:
:2''a'' + 3''b'' + ''c'' = ''n''
for some integer &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, with ''a'', ''b'', also ''c'' greater than or equal zero. We can write down the closed form straight away, we note the coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of:
:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x^2 + x^4 + ...)(1 + x^3 + x^6 + ...)(1 + x + x^2 + ...) = \frac{1}{(1 - x^2)(1 - x^3)(1 - x)}&lt;/math&gt;
is the required solution. This is due to, again, the fact that when multiplying powers, indices add.

To obtain the number of solutions, we break the expression into recognisable closed-forms by method of partial fraction.

==== Example 1 ====
Let s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of solutions to the following equation:
:2a + 2b = n; a, b &amp;ge; 0
Find the generating function for s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, then find an explicit formula for s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''n''.

'''Solution'''

Let T(z) be the generating functions of t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;
:T(z) = (1 + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt; + ...)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - z^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
It's not hard to see that
:&lt;math&gt;s_n = 0 \ \mbox{if n is odd}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_n = {n/2 + 1\choose n/2} = {n/2 + 1\choose 1} = n/2 + 1 \ \mbox{if n is even}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 2 ====
Let t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of solutions to the following equation:
:a + 2b = n; a, b &amp;ge; 0
Find the generating function for t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, then find an explicit formula for t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''n''.

'''Solution'''

Let T(z) be the generating functions of t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;
:T(z) = (1 + z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + ...)(1 + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + z&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + z&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt; + ...)

:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - z)} \times \frac{1}{1 - z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - z)^2} \times \frac{1}{1 + z}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{Az + B}{(1 - z)^2} + \frac{C}{1 + z}&lt;/math&gt;

:A = -1/4, B = 3/4, C = 1/4

:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = -\frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)z^{i+1} + \frac{3}{4}\sum_{i=0}^\infty (i+1)z^i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=0}^\infty (-1)^iz^i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_k = -\frac{1}{4}k + \frac{3}{4}(k + 1) + \frac{1}{4} (-1)^k&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercises ===
1. Let 
:&lt;math&gt;T(z) = \frac{1}{(1 + z)^2} &lt;/math&gt;
be the generating functions for t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; (k = 0, 1, 2 ...). Find an explicit formula for t&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''k''.

2. How many solutions are there the following equations if ''m'' is a given constant
:&lt;math&gt;a + b + 2c = m&lt;/math&gt;
where a, b and c &amp;ge; 0



== Problem Set ==
1. A new Company has borrowed $250,000 initial capital. The monthly interest is 3%. The company plans to repay $''x'' before the end of each month. Interest is added to the debt on the last day of the month (compounded monthly).

Let D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the remaining debt after ''n'' months.

a) Define D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; recursively.

b) Find the minimum values of ''x''.

c) Find out the general formula for D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

d) Hence, determine how many months are need to repay the debt if ''x'' = 12,000.

2. A partion of ''n'' is a sequence of positive integers (&amp;lambda;1,&amp;lambda;1,..,&amp;lambda;r) such that &amp;lambda;1 &amp;ge; &amp;lambda;2 &amp;ge; .. &amp;ge; &amp;lambda;r and &amp;lambda;1 + &amp;lambda;2 + .. + &amp;lambda;r = n. For example, let ''n'' = 5, then (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1) are all the partions of 5. So we say the number of partions of 5 is 7. Derive a formula for the number of partions of a general ''n''. 

3. A binary tree is a tree where each node can have up to two child nodes. The figure below is an example of a binary tree.
[[Image:HSE_ch5_binary_tree.png]]

a) Let c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of unique arrangements of a binary tree with totally n nodes. Let C(z) be a generating function of c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

:(i) Define C(z) using recursion.

:(ii) Hence find the closed form of C(z).

b) Let &lt;math&gt;P(x)=\sqrt{1+ax}=p_0 + p_1 x + p_2 x^2 + p_3 x^3 ...&lt;/math&gt; be a power series.

:(i) By considering the n-th derivative of P(x), find a formula for p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

:(ii) Using results from a) and b)(i) , or otherwise, derive a formula for c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Hint: Instead of doing recursion of finding the change in c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; when adding nodes at the buttom, try to think in the opposite way, and direction.(And no, not deleting nodes)

== Project - Exponential generating function ==
This project assumes knowledge of differentiation.

(Optional)0.
:(a)

::(i) Differentiate log x by first principle.

::(ii)*** Show that the remaining limit in last part that can't be evaluated indeed converges. Hence finish the differentiation by assigning this number as a constant.

:(b) Hence differentiate &lt;math&gt;a^x&lt;/math&gt;.

1. Consider &lt;math&gt;E(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;
:(a) Find out the n-th derivative of E(x).

:(b) By considering the value of the ''n''-th derivative of E(''x'') at ''x'' = 0, express E(''x'') in power series/infinite polynomial form.

(Optional)2.
:(a) Find out the condition for the geometric progression(that is the ordinary generating function introduced at the begining of this chapter) to converges. (Hint: Find out the partial sum)

:(b) Hence show that E(x) in the last question converges for all real values of x. (Hint: For any fixed x, the numerator of the general term is exponential, while the denominator of the general term is factorial. Then what?)

3. The function E(x) is the most fundamental and important exponential generating function, it is similar to the ordinary generating function, but with some difference, most obviously having a fractorial fraction attached to each term.

:(a) Similar to ordinary generating function, each term of the polynomial expansion of E(x) can have number attached to it as coefficient. Now consider &lt;math&gt;A(x) = a_1 + a_2 \frac{x}{1!} + a_3 \frac{x^2}{2!} + a_4 \frac{x^3}{3!} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

:Find &lt;math&gt;A'(x)&lt;/math&gt; and compare it with A(x). What do you discover?

:(b) Substitute nz, where n is a real number and z is a free variable, into E(x), i.e. E(nz). What have you found?

4. Apart from A(x) defined in question 2, let &lt;math&gt;B(x) = b_1 + b_2 \frac{x}{1!} + b_3 \frac{x^2}{2!} + b_4 \frac{x^3}{3!} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

:(a) What is A(x) multiplied by B(x)? Compare this with ordinary generating function, what is the difference?

:(b) What if we blindly multiply A(x) with x(or x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; in general)? Will it shift coefficient like what happened in ordinary generating function?


Notes: Question with *** are difficult questions, although you're not expected to be able to answer those, feel free to try your best.

==Grammatica 4-1 ~ The indefinite articles ''een'' en ''geen''==
:...''chairs and '''a''' table'' ... ''stoelen en '''een''' tafel''
:...''has '''no''' money''... ''heeft '''geen''' geld''

In the previous lesson you were introduced to the definite articles—'the' in English and '''''het''''' or '''''de''''' in Dutch. Indefinite articles precede nouns in the same way that definite articles do, but convey a general or indefinite sense. These are 'a' or 'an' in English. Thus, 'the book' or ''het boek'' refers to a definite or specific book, whereas 'a book' or ''een boek'' is indefinite about which book is referred to. Dutch indefinite articles only come in one form (''een''), so they don't display gender.
[[Image:Aalto table.JPG|thumb|200px|de tafel [[image:nl-tafel.ogg|20px|noicon]]]]

The use of definite and indefinite articles is virtually the same as in English. The few deviations are best learned when listening to the language or speaking it.
[[Image:Aalto chair front.JPG|thumb|100px|de stoel [[image:nl-stoel.ogg|20px|noicon]]]]

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- bgcolor=#FFDEAD
|-
|'''''een''''' || ''de'' || masculine/feminine || de tafel - een tafel (the table - a table)
|-
|'''''een''''' || ''het'' || neuter || het raam - een raam (the window - a window)
|}

Please note (see also previous lesson) that the indefinite article has the same form as the numeral one (''één''). One could argue that one is a clitic form of the other. To denote the difference, one could place accents on the numeral. Also, there is a difference in pronunciation. The numeral ''één'' (one) is pronounced /e:n/, the article ''een'' (a) with a much weaker /ən/. Occasionally Dutch has one and English the other:

: op een middag - one afternoon

Notice that ''one'' is used here in the meaning of ''a certain'', not say in contrast to two or three.

There is an inflected form ''ene'' that is used independently:

:Occasionally Dutch has one, English the other.
:Soms heeft Nederlands het ''ene'', Engels het ''andere''

===Negation===
[[File:Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[image:nl-fuut.ogg|noicon|20px]] de fuut]]
[[File:Anas platyrhynchos qtl1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[image:nl-eend.ogg|noicon|20px]] de eend]]
In English a negative of an indefinite article is simply formed by adding not:

:this is a car
:this is ''not'' a car

Alternatively one can drop the article and say:

:this is ''no'' car.

In Dutch there is a special negative of een:

{|
|-
|[[image:nl-geen.ogg|20px|noicon]]
|-
|'''''{{Nlwikt|geen}}'''''.
|}

:dit is een auto
:dit is ''geen'' auto.

''Geen'' is used both with singular and with plural indefinite nouns
:dat zijn eenden   -- those are ducks
:dat zijn geen eenden -- those are not ducks

===Relation to ''niet''===
The combination '''''niet''''' + '''''een''''' is only used in contrasting things:

:dit is ''niet'' een fuut ''maar'' een eend.
:this is ''not'' a grebe ''but'' a duck.

With definite nouns negation involves adding ''niet'', usually at end:
:dat is de auto
:dat is de auto ''niet''

:Notice that ''geen'' is an article&lt;ref&gt;or indefinite pronoun in other grammars&lt;/ref&gt;. It negates the ''noun''. 
:By contrast ''niet'' is an adverb. It negates the ''verb''.

Notice also that Dutch does not use the auxiliary verb ''to do'' for negations:

:Hij zag de auto niet  - he did not see the car
:Hij zag geen eenden  - he did not see any ducks

===Relation to ''wel''===
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|niet}}||{{knp2|wel}}
|}
When a negative is negated Dutch uses the adverb ''wel'' to express that. English has to use a construction involving the verb ''to do'':

:Heb je geen geld?  -- Jawel, ik heb ''wel'' geld.
:Don't you have money  --  Yes, I ''do'' have money

This adverb is also used for contrasting:

:Hij heeft geen auto, maar ''wel'' een motor.
:He has no car, but he ''does'' have a motorbike.

Notice that the second part of the Dutch sentence does not even have a verb. Dutch is quite an 'adverbial' language. If the adverb expresses the meaning sufficiently, why bother with superfluous things like verbs?

A game of &quot;Yes, you do&quot; - &quot;No, I don't&quot; sounds like &quot;Welles!&quot; - &quot;Nietes!&quot; in Dutch

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|ja}}||{{knp2|jawel}}
|}

Much like in French, there are two words for ''yes''. A simple confirmation is ''ja'' (French: ''oui''); a negation of a negative is ''jawel'' (French: ''si'')

==Grammatica 4-2 ~ More pronouns==

===Possessives===
Recall the following from Gesprek 3-1:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|full||{{knop|mijn}} mijn||{{knop|jouw}} jouw||{{knop|zijn}} zijn||{{knop|haar}} haar
|-
|inflected||{{knop|mijne}} mijne||{{knop|jouwe}} jouwe||{{knop|zijne}} zijne||{{knop|hare}} hare
|-
|clitic||{{knop|m'n}} m'n||{{knop|je}} je||{{knop|z'n}} z'n||{{knop|d'r}} d'r
|}
::''Ja. En daarna breng je me op '''je''' motor naar huis''.

Which translates as:
::'Yes. And after that you take me home on '''your''' motorcycle'. 

The sentence demonstrates one of the '''possessive pronouns'''. In the singular these are
:'my', 'your', and 'his/her/its' in English
:''mijn'', ''jouw'' and ''zijn/haar/(zijn)'' in Dutch. 

The neuter ''zijn'' for ''its'' is not used very much in Dutch, as we shall see in [[Dutch/Lesson 8|lesson 8]] it often gets replaced by &quot;ervan&quot;.

The above pronouns like ''jouw'' often turn into a weak (clitic) form  '''''je''''' that is used when the emphasis is on something else, such as the motorcycle in this case. In the spoken language this holds for all the ones shown in the table, but in the written language ''je'' is the most generally accepted clitic. When written they are:

:''m'n'', ''je'' and ''z'n/d'r/(z'n)'' 

Dutch does not have a possessive case as English does. In English one could say ''this house of mine'', where mine (and yours, hers, his, ours, yours, theirs) is possessive case. Dutch uses objective case for this: ''dit huis van mij'' as if 'van' (''of'') is a preposition.

However, for a sentence like ''is this yours or his?'' Dutch would use nominalized pronouns (pronouns turned into nouns) with an inflection -e usually accompanied by a definite pronoun ''de'' or ''het'':

:Is dit '''het jouwe''' of '''het zijne'''? - Is this yours or his?

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style= &quot;float:right&quot;
|full||{{knop|uw}} uw||{{knop|ons}} ons||{{knop|jullie}} jullie||{{knop|hun}} hun
|-
|inflected||{{knop|uwe}} uwe||{{knop|onze}} onze|| - ||{{knop|hunne}} hunne
|}

The possessive for the polite 2nd person pronoun ''u'' is ''uw'' and in the south this same word is used to refer to the ''gij'' pronoun (but no formal usage is implied). ''Uw'' does not have a clitic form and the same can be said about the possessives of the plural. Uw does have an inflected form ''uwe'' used for nominalization.

:Dit is uw huis  - this is your house
:Dit is het uwe!  - this is yours

For the third person plural the possessive is ''hun'' and it follows the same pattern:

:Dat is hun auto  - this is their car
:Dat is het hunne! - this is theirs

For the first person plural Dutch has ''ons''. This is the only one that follows the rules for inflection of the adjectives. I.e. its inflected form is used for de-words but not for het-words:

:het huis - ons huis
:de huizen - onze huizen.
:de auto - onze auto

The inflected form is once again also used for nominalization:

:Dat is het onze! - that is ours!

For the second person plural the possessive is ''jullie'' which cannot be inflected and cannot be used as a noun, which necessitates a construction involving ''van'':

:Dat is jullie huis
:Dat is dat van jullie
:Dat is jullie auto
:Dat is die van jullie!

See [[Dutch/Appendix 3]] for a table of the possessive pronouns.

===Quizlet===
Practice the possessive pronouns at [https://quizlet.com/85608212/dutch-wikibook-possessive-pronouns-flash-cards/ Quizlet] (24 term, includes demonstrative and reciprocal pronouns)

===Demonstratives===
In English, '''''this''''' is used as '''demonstrative pronoun''' to indicate something in proximity. ''That'' indicates greater distance. In Dutch a similar distinction exists, but gender plays a role:
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|deze}} deze ||{{knop|dit}} dit
|-
|{{knop|die}} die ||{{knop|dat}} dat
|}
:de trein → '''deze''' trein - this train
:het huis → '''dit''' huis  - this house

So, one replaces 'de' by deze and 'het' by dit.

At a greater distance:

:de trein → '''die''' trein
:het huis → '''dat''' huis

Notice that often when English has '''''th''''', Dutch will have '''''d''''':

:the - de
:that - dat
:think - denk

A third, even more distant pronoun exists (gene, gindse), but it is about as common as its English equivalent ''yon'', ''yonder''.

Again, the two languages betray their kinship. In some words, a '''''g''''' in Dutch corresponds to a '''''y''''' in English.. Compare:

:gisteren - yesterday
:de gist - the yeast
:geel - yellow

===Using demonstrative pronouns instead of personal pronouns===

'''''Recall:'''''
: '''Die''' heb ik echt nodig, hoor!

As we have seen Dutch is on its way to a two-gender system. For inanimate nouns, this makes demonstrative pronouns a more attractive choice to refer things by than personal pronouns. Compare:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  !! !!close!!far!!def.!! indef.
|-
! gender !! personal !!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| demonstrative!! colspan=&quot;2&quot;| article 
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0FF&quot;| neuter||bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0FF&quot;| het||bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0FF&quot;| dit||bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0FF&quot;| dat||bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0FF&quot;|het||rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|een
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E3FFFF&quot;| masculine||bgcolor=&quot;#E3FFFF&quot;| hij ||bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFE0&quot; rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|deze ||bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFE0&quot; rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|die ||bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFE0&quot; rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|de
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E1FFD9&quot;|feminine||bgcolor=&quot;#E1FFD9&quot;|zij 
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFE0&quot;| (plural)||bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFE0&quot;| zij|| --
|}

As you see demonstratives do not distinguish whether a word is feminine or masculine and follow the same common-neuter pattern as the articles. Compare:

:Ik zie Jan. '''Hij''' is sterk - I see John. '''He''' is strong.
:Ik zie zijn auto. '''Die''' is duur. - I see his car. '''It''' is expensive.

Note: because '''''de''' auto'' is not neuter, it is not correct to say: ''Het'' is duur. But saying  ''hij'' is duur or ''zij'' is duur makes the word specifically masculine or feminine. Using '''die''' avoids the issue, because '''die''' follows the ''common gender'' pattern of the definite article.

Increasingly, personal pronouns are reserved for reference to persons (natural gender as in English). To refer to things people resort to substituting the demonstratives.

===Reflexive and Reciprocal pronouns===
In English reflexive pronouns always carry the ending -self -selves: myself, themselves etc. In Dutch that is not always so. In fact, for a verb that is ''always'' reflexive, like ''zich vergissen'' (to be mistaken) the ending ''cannot be used'':

:Ik vergis me
:Jij vergist je, u vergist '''u/zich'''
:Hij/zij vergist '''zich'''
:Wij vergissen ons
:Jullie vergissen je
:Zij vergissen '''zich'''

In other words the reflexive pronoun is identical to the clitic object form of the personal pronoun, except in the third person where it is '''zich'''. The pronoun u was originally a third person (It stems from U.E. uwe edele, something like: your nobility, your honor) which explains the zich for this pronoun.

Vergissen can only be used with zich, but some verbs can be used with or without a reflexive pronoun. In that case -zelf may be added:

Ik was me/mij/mezelf/mijzelf. - I wash myself.

This topic is revisited in [[Dutch/Lesson 16|Lesson 16]]

The most important reciprocal pronoun is '''elkaar''' - each other
:Zij ontmoeten elkaar - They met each other.

==Grammatica 4-3 Plural of nouns==

We already have seen some things about the plural above:
#the plural definite article is always '''de''' (for all genders),
#there is no indefinite article, but the negative '''geen''' can be used.
#the demonstrative pronouns are '''deze''' and '''die''' 
#the personal pronoun is '''zij''' or its weak form '''ze'''. 

Forming the plural of the noun itself is a bit more complicated. In English it is basically always done with -s, but in Dutch that is different

Recall: ''...tafel'''s''' en stoel'''en'''...''

With few exceptions like ''ox - oxen'' pretty much all words simply get an -s in English. Dutch however has '''two''' main ways to form a plural: by adding '''-s''' and by adding '''-en'''. The latter is pronounced /-ən/, /-ə/ or even as a syllabic /-n/ depending on the region.

Which plural applies is '''best learned case by case''' as gender is, although we can attempt a general rule:
{{Definition|
:''Words of more than one syllable get '''-s''', if they end in: 
#e+liquid: '''-el''', '''-em''', '''-en''', '''-er''', 
#'''-aar''', '''-ier'''
#vowels: '''-a''', '''-e''', '''-i''', '''-o''', '''-u''' and '''-y''', '''-oe''' , 

All others get '''-en'''.''
}}
The ones in '''''-a''''', '''''-o''''', '''''-i''''' and '''''-y''''' get an apostrophe before the '''-s'''

:baby - baby's

Unfortunately there are lots of exceptions. Many recent (latinate) loans from English or French and all diminutives get a '''-s'''.

:de tafel  - de tafel'''s'''
:de familie - de familie'''s'''
:het meisje - de meisje'''s'''

Words in '''''-te''''' and '''''-aar''''' usually get '''-s''':

:de hoogte - de hoogtes
:de kandelaar - de kandelaars 

Amongst the many words that get '''''-en''''' are the ones in '''-ing''':

:de helling - de hellingen 

===Vowel changes===
Most monosyllabic words have '''''-en''''' in the plural:

:de stoel  - de stoel'''en'''
:het raam  - de ram'''en'''

In the latter case, notice that one of the a's is dropped in the spelling of the plural. This difficulty is related to the fact that most Dutch vowels occur in two varieties, a closed one and an open one. Dutch spelling has a rather ingenious and systematic way of denoting which one is intended. It involves the doubling of either vowels or consonants. Compare:

:het bot /bɔt/  (the bone) has an open vowel /ɔ/ like British pot (or American paw)
:de boot /bot/ (the boat) sounds much like British boat.

In this case the vowels remain the same in the plural, but notice the doubling:

:het bot - de bot'''t'''en ['bɔtə(n)] (bot-ten) 
:de bo'''o'''t - de boten ['botə(n)]  (bo-ten)

[[image:Nl-bot-boot.ogg|30px|noicon]]

It is customary to call the first sound  [ɔ] a 'short o' and the second [o] a 'long o', but this terminology can be rather confusing. There are languages like Czech or Gàidhlig where vowels are indeed distinguished purely on their length. In Dutch, however, the difference in length (''quantity'') is actually pretty negligible, but the difference in vowel sound (''quality'') is not. This presents a problem for speakers of the many languages with a five-vowel system, like Italian, Russian, Arabic or isiXhosa whose ears are not accustomed to this kind of difference. Anglophones usually do quite well.

The following five vowels possess open ('long') and covered ('short') varieties:

{|class='wikitable'

===The Dutch spelling rule===
{{Definition|
The Dutch Spelling Rule is:

:an 'open' syllable that ends in a vowel such as ''bo-'' has an open vowel that sounds like boat /o/,
:a 'closed' one that ends in a consonant, like ''bot-'' has a covered vowel like pot (/ɔ/).

If the opposite is desired, either the vowel is doubled (→ bo'''o'''t) or the consonant (→ bo'''t'''ten).

The vowel '''i''' is an exception; its open form is written as '''ie''', not ii.
}}

===Vowel changes===
For non-native speakers a complication arises in those cases where the actual vowel changes ('lengthens') in the plural, compare:

:dat pad (/pɑt/) - die paden (/'p'''a'''dən/ - '''vowel changes''') (that path - those paths) 
:die pad (/pɑt/) - die padden (/'pɑdən/ - no vowel change) (that toad - those toads)

[[image:Nl-pad.ogg|30px|noicon]]

The vowel /ɑ/ in pad and padden is approximately as in father. Paden has a vowel /a/ like in broad American 'Oh, my God' (In Dutch the spelling would be: Gaad).  Also, notice  the gender difference of the two words.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
|{{knop|pad}} de pad||toad
|-
|{{knop|pad}} het pad||path, trail
|-
|{{knop|stad}} de stad||path, trail
|-
|{{knop|schip}} het schip||ship
|-
|{{knop|beleefdheid}} de beleefdheid||politeness
|-
|{{knop|kind}} het kind||child
|-
|{{knop|lam}} het lam||lamb
|}


Vowel change is systematic in the plural of the past of certain strong verbs (class 4 and 5; see [[Dutch/Lesson 6|6]]).

:ik zat (/zɑt/) - wij zaten (/zatən/) (I sat - we sat)

A few words show vowel changes other than between the open and closed variety of the same vowel: 

:de stad - de steden (city).
:het schip - de schepen (ship)
Words ending in '''-heid''' get '''''-heden''''':

:beleefdheid - beleefdheden

===-eren===
There are about a dozen plurals in Dutch that end in '''''-eren''''':

:het kind - de kinderen (child - child'''ren''')
:het lam  - de lammeren (lamb)

The ending -eren is essentially a double plural. It derives from a plural in -er and in some compounds that is still visible:

:de kinderkamer - the children's room
:de lammergier - a species of vulture

===-ën===

Some words in '''-ie''' have an '''''-en''''' plural that requires a diaeresis (''trema'' in Dutch). The spelling depends on where the stress falls: 

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
|{{knop|kolonie}} de kolonie||colony
|-
|{{knop|dynastie}} de dynastie||dynasty
|-
|{{knop|zee}} de zee||sea
|-
|{{knop|diatomee}} de diatomee||diatom
|-
|{{knop|museum}} het museum||museum
|-
|{{knop|chemicus}} de chemicus||chemist
|-
|{{knop|crisis}} de crisis||crisis
|}


:de kolónie - de kolóniën
:de dynastíé - de dynastíéën

Notice that in Dutch orthography the stress of a word cán be indicated with an acute accent, but this is only permitted if otherwise ambiguity might arise.

A ''trema'' (diaeresis) is also used after '''-ee''':

:de zee - de zeeën
:de diatomee - de diatomeeën

===Changes of consonants===
If the root of the word ends in a '''-z''' of '''-v''' this is both written and pronounced as '''-s''' and '''-f''' in the singular, but the voiced consonant returns in a plural on -en:

:de baas - de ba'''z'''en
:de raaf - de ra'''v'''en
:de duif - de dui'''v'''en

Such words typically have a 'long' vowel (''aa'' in this case) or diphthong.

With ''short'' vowel the consonant typically remains voiceless and is doubled in the plural

:de plas - de plassen
:de klos - de klossen

===Lieden, lui===
Some compounds of -man have a plural involving ''lieden'' or ''lui'' (people)
:de timmerman - de timmerlieden, de timmerlui

===Classical plurals===
Occasionally a Latin or Greek plural is preserved in Dutch:

:het museum - de musea
:de chemicus - de chemici
:de crisis - de crises
:het dogma - de dogmata , dogma's

== Cryptanalysis Classes ==

Four classes of '''cryptanalysis''';

A) '''Ciphertext-only'''.  Only the ciphertext is known and the key and/or message must be found from this.

B) '''Known plaintext'''.  The ciphertext and part of the message is known.  The key and/or the rest of the message must be found from this.

C) '''Chosen plaintext'''.  The analysist can chose the plaintext to encrypt.  The key must be found from this.

D) '''Chosen ciphertext'''.  Public key ciphers only, the analysist can chose the ciphertext to decrypt.  The key must be found from this.

== Backup of some prior segments ==

While this could be left to page history, for now I'll leave some bits here so that people can see what major chunks were lifted out and replaced. [[wikipedia:User:PolyGnome]]


=== Prior intro, part 1 ===
'''Cryptography''' is generally understood to be the study of the principles and techniques by which information is converted  into an encrypted version that is difficult (ideally, impossible) for any unauthorized person to convert to the original information, while still allowing the intended reader to do so. In fact, cryptography covers rather more than merely encryption and decryption. It is, in practice, a specialized branch of information theory with substantial additions from other branches of mathematics. And perspective and approaches, because of the inherent conflict between those authorized, and those not, to see the information / interfere in the exchange / pretend to be other than they are / etc, from such sources as Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Karl von Clausewitz.

Unsurprisingly, the study of hiding the meaning of messages from others by encrypting them has been accompanied by the study of how to read such messages when one is ''not'' the intended receiver; this area of study is called ''cryptanalysis''.  People involved in such work, and with cryptography in general, are known as cryptographers (or for some of those in the other lexigraphic school, '''cryptologists''').

The original unencrypted information being sent from one person (or organization) to another is usually called the ''plaintext''.  ''Encryption'' is the process of converting the plaintext into some unreadable form (ideally one undistinguisable from random gibberish), and ''decryption'' converts this back to the plaintext.  Encryption includes two major classes of technique:  '''encoding''' (yielding ''codetext'') and '''enciphering''' (yielding ''ciphertext'').  The exact operation of the encryption and decryption, for all schemes with any pretense to security, is controlled by one or more keys.
----

My intent with the introduction is to try to cover the basic understanding and texture of cryptography without bogging down the reader. Although it will obviously have to be refined after the other modules have been completed. [[wikipedia:User:PolyGnome]]

== Just a note ==

Would it be possible to cite a couple books on cryptography? There are several good ones, and I think it's a good idea to refer to something a little more concrete.


== Interesting Typos ==

I discovered some interesting typos, such as &quot;Bprivately&quot; and the like, I don't know why they were there, but it reads better now, I also changed &quot;cypher&quot; in the body to &quot;cipher&quot;, to match the introduction

There is a tendency for contributors to want to rush ahead and give lots of information in tabular form. While I believe there is a place for this, the text of a lesson book should follow a gradual program of introducing simpler concepts first and then building on these.  This page is now a good example. '''Verb conjugation''' needs to be spread out over many lessons, although the information and tables collected here make a good reference for the student to fall back on.  The layout of this book (IMHO) should allow both approaches. Therefore, I am moving this page to an Appendix to serve as a resource for developing future lessons and as a permanent part of the book intact as a reference for the student. Hope I do not step on too many toes; both approaches are valuable, but different - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:08, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)~

I agree completely that such a clump of tabular information needs to be saved for an appendix, and the work already done is excellent for an introduction. My only concern is that the tabular format for most conjugations seems incompletely labeled; without labelings for each part of speech, I'm afraid that newcomers to the language may find these tables difficult to decipher.

I'm new wiki formatting, but I hope that the 'sein' conjugation chart I modified gives a sense for what I'm talking about. It's certainly not perfect: perhaps someone with more table skills could edit the other tables to include a better set of top-line identifiers. - Saxo, 12 Feb 2004

:Sorry. I just picked up on your note.  When I move pages around I do not always mark them to be watched! You are right.  I can handle the table formatting, but you did good - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:59, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)</text>

== Grammatik 6.1 ~ Introduction to verb conjugations ==
In German, every grammatical person has, or potentially has, its own unique verb form. Describing the various verb forms is called '''verb conjugation'''. This variation in verb form is certainly one of the things that makes German grammar somewhat difficult for English speakers to learn. In English, only the 3rd person singular might differ from the verb form used with all of the other '''persons''' (see [[German/Lesson_1|Grammatik 1-3]]) and that difference is made by adding an ending of 's' or 'es'. For example: I/you/we/they 'go', but he/she/it 'goes'. 

Let us have a closer look at German verbs. Usually, the infinitive form of a verb in German ends with '''''-en'''''&amp;mdash;for examples, consider these verbs you have already learned: ''geh'''en''''' ('go'), ''hab'''en''''' ('have'), and ''studier'''en''''' ('study'). In order to &quot;build&quot; the different verb forms (that is, conjugate a verb), first cut off the '-en' ending from the infinitive. Then append a new ending according to the grammatical person. For '''regular verbs''' it works essentially as follows:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;
|-
! pronoun
! verb
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in English:
|-
| ich ||  geh'''e'''  || ||   I   ||   go      
|-
| du ||  geh'''st'''  || ||  you  ||   go      
|-
| er/sie/es ||  geh'''t'''  || || he/she/it  ||   go'''es'''      
|-
| wir ||  geh'''en'''  || ||   we  ||   go     
|-
| ihr ||  geh'''t'''  || ||  you (pl.) ||   go     
|-
| sie ||  geh'''en'''  || ||  they ||   go     
|}

As you see in this example using the verb ''gehen'', the singular 1st person ends with '''''-e''''', the 2nd person with '''''-st''''' and 3rd person (no matter what gender) ends with '''''-t'''''. As for the plural forms, note that 1st and 3rd person in plural '''number''' (see [[German/Lesson_1|Grammatik 1-3]]) are built the same way as the infinitive. Again note that, in English, only the verb form for the 3rd person singular is &quot;unique&quot;. An easy way to remember the regular verb endings is the following mnemonic &quot;'''E'''lephants '''st'''anding '''t'''ogether '''en'''joy '''t'''rumpeting '''en'''dlessly&quot;.

Seems simple enough.  However, realize we are discussing here only the regular verb forms in the '''present tense''' (''Präsens'').
You will learn quite soon that, unfortunately, there are many exceptions from these simple rules. An important one is the '''irregular verb''' ''sein'' ('to be') which is irregular in English as well (I am, you are, he is...).


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;
|-
! pronoun
! verb
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in English:
|-
| ich ||  '''bin'''  || ||   I   ||   am      
|-
| du ||  '''bist'''  || ||  you  ||   are      
|-
| er/sie/es ||  '''ist'''  || || he/she/it  ||   is      
|-
| wir ||  '''sind'''  || ||   we  ||   are      
|-
| ihr ||  '''seid'''  || ||  you (plural) ||   are     
|-
| sie ||  '''sind'''  || ||  they ||   are      
|}

At least 1st and 3rd person plural are the same.
Another important verb is ''haben'' ('to have'): 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;
|-
! pronoun
! verb
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in English:
|-
| ich ||  hab'''e'''  || ||   I   ||  have     
|-
| du ||  ha'''st'''  || ||  you  ||   have      
|-
| er/sie/es ||  ha'''t'''  || || he/she/it  ||   has      
|-
| wir ||  hab'''en'''  || ||   we  ||   have      
|-
| ihr ||  hab'''t'''  || ||  you (plural) ||   have     
|-
| sie ||  hab'''en'''  || ||  they ||   have      
|}

You see, it's not too irregular&amp;mdash;only the 2nd and 3rd person singular constitute a small exception since the 'b' has vanished.  English is somewhat curious in this respect as well: 'I have', but 'he has'.  Future lessons will introduce you to the many '''irregular''' verbs in German.  But you should now recognize what is happening to the verbs in German sentences. They are reflecting the person and number of their nominative case subjects. Recall these sentences from past lessons (verbs underlined here):

   ''Danke, es &lt;u&gt;geht&lt;/u&gt; mir gut''                 Thanks, it goes well with me (verb is ''gehen'')
   ''Ich &lt;u&gt;habe&lt;/u&gt; viel Arbeit''                   I have much work (verb is ''haben'')
   ''&lt;u&gt;Ist&lt;/u&gt; er zu Besuch?''                      Is he visiting? (verb is ''sein'')
   ''Du &lt;u&gt;bist&lt;/u&gt; ein Schwein!''                   You are a pig! (verb is ''sein'')
   ''Wie &lt;u&gt;heißen&lt;/u&gt; Sie?''                        What are you called? (verb is ''heißen'', and pronoun is formal)
   ''Wir &lt;u&gt;spielen&lt;/u&gt; eine Stunde lang!''          We play for one hour! (verb is ''spielen'')
   ''Sie &lt;u&gt;liegt&lt;/u&gt; am Ausfluss des Zürichsees.''  It lies at the outlet of Lake Zurich (verb is ''liegen'')

== Grammatik 6.2 ~ Case in German nouns ==
Through our discussions on the personal pronouns, you have learned how  pronouns have '''case'''.  Nouns also have case&amp;mdash;and in German, noun case can be expressed by the definite article (''der''). Recall this table from [[German/Lesson_3|Lektion 3]]:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''der'''''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;masculine&amp;nbsp;
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''die'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;feminine
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''das'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;neuter
|}

These ''der''-words reflect noun '''gender''' in the nominative case&amp;mdash;appropriate whenever a noun is used as the subject of a sentence. For other cases, the ''der'' words change. Expanding the table to present nominative (NOM.), accusative (ACC.), dative (DAT.), and genitive (GEN.) cases:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
! NOM.
! ACC.
&lt;th&gt;DAT.
! GEN.
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''der'''''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''den'''''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''dem'''''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''des'''''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;masculine&amp;nbsp;
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''die'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''die'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''der'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''der'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;feminine
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''das'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''das'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''dem'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''des'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;neuter
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''die'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''die'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''den'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''der'''''
!
&amp;nbsp;plural
|}

Note, there are also ''der''-word forms to be used for plural nouns. Fortunately, these are the same, no matter what the gender of the singular noun. For future reference, you can find the ''der''-words summarized in [[German/Appendix_3|Anhänge Drei]].

The following examples demonstrate the use of the definitive article in various parts of speech:

   ''Du hast &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; Wurst und &lt;u&gt;den&lt;/u&gt; Käse.''          You have &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; sausage and &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; cheese.
                                             (accusative case)
   ''&lt;u&gt;Die&lt;/u&gt; Geschäftsleute verstehen &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; Arbeit''  The business associates understand the work.
                                             (nominative and accusative cases)
   ''Sie liegt am Ausfluss &lt;u&gt;des&lt;/u&gt; Zürichsees.''    It lies at the outlet of (&lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt;) Lake Zurich.
                                             (genitive case)
   ''Zürich ist &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; größte Stadt &lt;u&gt;der&lt;/u&gt; Schweiz.'' Zurich is &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; largest city in (of &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt;) Switzerland.
                                             (nominative and genitive cases)

In the last example, remember that in both English and German, the noun (or pronoun) that follows the verb 'to be' is a predicate noun, for which the correct case is the '''nominative'''. That is why, in English, 'It is I' is grammatically correct and 'It is me' is  incorrect. So consider the following (and note that case of each definite article is the same as in the last example above):

   ''Zürich ist der Kanton der gleichnamigen Stadt.''  Zurich is the canton of the same named city.

== Grammatik 6.3 ~ Commands ==
   ''Ruf sie an, bitte!''         Call her, please.
   or ''Ruf sie bitte an!''
   ''Gehen Sie nach Hause!''      Go home (formal).
   ''Kommt mit!''                 Come with (plural)!
   ''Gib es mir!''                Give me it!

Notice that in these sentences there are no subjects (except for #2). In German, as in English, there is a ''commandative form'', a way to demand something using an understood you. In English, there is only one you-form and one command form. In German, since there are three you's, there are three ways to command.

If the subject is singular (''du''), then the verb has no ending. If it is irregular, it takes the du-form, such as in essen (Iss!) or lesen (Lies!). If there is a plural subject (''ihr''), then the verb takes the ihr-form. Nothing else is changed. Most of the time, ihr-commands are used with children, but that is not always the case. In both of these sentences, the du or ihr is omitted.

Formal is normal. The ''Sie'' stays (after the verb) and the verb is in its formal form. Although it is worded like a question, in written or spoken form, it is easy to tell the difference.

&lt;!--
I would take this out. Almost nobody uses exclamation marks in commands:

All commands in German end in an exclamation point, regardless of the context (and even if it uses ''bitte'').

This Lesson 5 is a real conglomeration of pieces contributed by several of the contributors.  Although it may (from the Page History) appear that Marshman did most of the work, this was definitely not the case.  I think this is one of the best lessons to date (February 2004) and is actually mostly the work of Hansm and SamE, with Marshman structuring their contributions. Unfortunately, that structuring (moving stuff aroud) gives me more credit than I'm due. Thanks guys - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:03, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Okay, a minor local one (but a killer), a major local (text) and a major general (vocab):

1. &quot;Gib mich es!&quot; is shocking because it contradicts the rules for word order and indirect object from the previous lesson. Correct: &quot;Gib es mir!&quot;

2. I think we do have a problem with the vocabulary lists. All of them! They are absolutely correct. But only for a very specific context. For exampel: You can translate 'office' with German 'Sitz' - possibly. The banks have their main offices in Zurich and therefore it is their 'Sitz' (site of most important building). Now imagine a student on his fifth lesson in German doing his first free translation. He has to check up the German word for 'office' (in the sense of -white collar workspace-) to form a new sentence and turns to his true and trusted Wikibook vocabulary list. Let's say the sentence is &quot;I will go to the office later today.&quot; -&gt; &quot;Ich werde später zum !Sitz! gehen.&quot; I don't think so. &quot;Na, wie war es im !Sitz! heute?&quot; No! 
The word he is looking for is 'Büro'. 

:That is the whole point. Each ''Vokabeln'' is NOT a partial German dictionary, but reflects exactly how the word or term is used in that lesson (in the material above the ''Vokabeln'') with minor &quot;the same&quot; meanings. If the word is used later with a different meaning (or a different word is introduced with a similar meaning), then it is repeated in the new ''Vokabeln'' It is worth thinking about to have an appendix that does what you are suggesting. Each word in the lessons given as in a dictionary, wirth some more detail such as you give. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:10, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC) 

I don't think we should burden expressions with highly specific meanings before their standard interpretations have been established. 

3. I wonder if the introductory text is too difficult. There is a lot of grammar in it that has not been introduced yet (passive, irregular verbs, complex side clauses). And lot of fillers muddy the waters. 

:I do agree to the extent that as much as possible the introductory passages should be simplified or (if to difficult) moved to later in the book.  This is a slow, on-going process and would be a messy one if whole passages were just thrown out.  In the beginning, it is impossible not to have grammar that hass yet to be introduced. To do so would require very preschool, then first grade, then 2nd grade, etc. apperoach to including passages.  The point uis whether the student can understand a passage given the vocabulary presented; not whether he can understand the grammar behind each sentence. Much of the latter is picked up in the review process: sentence grammar in Lesson 1 is suddenly obvious after the stuident returns from having done Lessons 2-4. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:10, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC) 

I don't know what of these issues has been discussed before and what the consensus is. Help me out there, please!

Okay I will try to list some more doubts about the vocabulary 

Take this one, No 5:

  der Ausfluss            outlet, effluence (of a stream, river, or lake) 
''' minor: only with lakes, with rivers it's 'Mündung' '''
:I will correct

  
  das Ende                end ''' now, is it 'to end' or 'an end'?'''
:It is in the &quot;noun&quot; section so it must be a noun.

  das Haus                house '''verb or noun?'''
:It is in the the noun section so it has to be a noun
  
  der Sitz                office '''see above'''
  

  nach Hause              to home 
''' 'to home' is an infinitive for an English verb. The phrase 'nach Hause' is idiomatic: &quot;Wir gehen nach Hause&quot; or &quot;Ich will nach Hause&quot;. The correct English translation would be &quot;We go home&quot; and &quot;I want to go home&quot;. It is not &quot;We go to home&quot; or &quot;Let's go to home&quot; or &quot;Do you fly to home tonight?&quot; and so on. Therefore, word for word translation in the lists is not very feasible. In those cases we need phrases to demonstarte proper usage!''' 
:This should be done like this: ''nach Hause'' = (to) home

  anrufen                 call, telephone 
'''Is 'telephone here an equivalent of anrufen or a modifier for 'to call'? Obviously the latter. So, why not &quot;jemanden anrufen      -&gt;     to call someone on the telephone, to call&quot;'''

:it is in the &quot;verb&quot; section, so it must be the verb to telephone.
:You should read the Introduction to the book as it explains this set-up of the vocabularies.  Also, Lesson 1 emphasizes this again.  - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:21, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

  kommen                  come 
''' 'come' could be commandative form. I think infinitives need to be marked as such.  '''



  liegen (lag, gelegen)   lie (lay, lain)



  am (an dem)             at the
''' How are people to know that prepositions plus articles can be contracted because that's what they need to know to get the point here. '''



  bei                     in
''' Nope, 'bei' means 'near' or 'close to'. Then again it can mean a lot of other things, none of them is close to English 'in'. '''


  beiden                  two
''' What happened to 'both'? Can you reverse it? 'Two' does not mean 'beide'. '''


  gleichnamigen           same named
''' I am not an English native-speaker but 'same named' sounds a bit weird. '''



  klein                   small
''' I love that case, because we had 'klein' already in an earlier unit and it meant 'short'. What now? '''



  neben                   besides
''' Can you realy use 'besides' spatially? Shouldn't it be 'next to'? '''



  nördlichen              northern
  schweiz                 Swiss
''' 'die nördliche Schweiz' '''


I think the word for word vocabulary lists don't answer. We need to provide aditional information about function and use of expressions. 
Infinitives need to be marked as such. Nouns likewise. 
Words have to stripped of aspect, form and tense (not Dativ/Akkusativ 'beiden' but Nominaitiv 'beide'). 
If possible, translations should be mutually entailing and reversable - work both ways.


I think that's it for the moment.

:Again, most of the problems you indicate come from your not reading the introduction and Lesson 1 examples of how the Vokabeln are set up.  While everything you say is true, it would apply only if the Vokabeln were dictionary entries, which they are not. They were set up to be simple and not confuse the learning stuident with all of the other meanings, exceptions, etc.  As they are now is very straight-forward, simple, and useful for the lesson in which they appear. You are essentially taking them out of context, and then saying: &quot;Look, there is no context here&quot; The context is there.  Irt is just not obvious when you jump into Lesson 4 from having not read all that went before - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:21, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==Moles==
The mole is a unit used to measure the number of particles in a substance (where particles can be atoms, molecules, electrons, ions etc.). One mole of something contains 6.02205 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles. This rather large quantity is a constant called ''Avogadro's Number'', which is abbreviated as ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''. It simply refers to the number of particles in one mole.

&lt;math&gt;N_A = 6.02214 \times 10^{23}\hbox{ mol}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, one mole of helium gas contains 6.022&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; atoms; 2 moles of oxygen gas contains 1.204&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; molecules.

===Moles and Mass===
It would be useful to be able to convert between the number of moles and the mass of a substance. The ''molar mass'' is the mass of one mole of a substance, measured in grams per mole or &lt;math&gt;\hbox{g}\cdot\hbox{mol}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Not by coincidence, the ''molar mass'' is the same as the ''atomic weight'' of a substance (this is how the concept of moles was originally defined).

For example, the molar mass (and atomic weight) of carbon-12 is  12 g&amp;middot;mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, so 1 mole of carbon-12 weighs 12 grams. Similarly, chlorine has a molar mass of 35.45 g·mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, so one mole of chlorine atoms weighs 35.45 g. There are two chlorine atoms in one molecule of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, so one mole of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas weighs 70.90 g.

==Measurement and Quantities==

'''Weight: 3'''

'''Description:''' 
&lt;br&gt;
Candidates should be able to perform package management using the Debian package manager. 

*Key knowledge area(s):
**Install, upgrade and uninstall Debian binary packages.
**Find packages containing specific files or libraries which may or may not be installed.
**Obtain package information like version, content, dependencies, package integrity and installation status (whether or not the package is installed).

*The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities: 
**/etc/apt/sources.list
**dpkg
**dpkg-reconfigure
**apt-get
**apt-cache
**aptitude


== Package Structure ==
In order to understand how to use Debian's package management system, it would be useful to first have an understanding of how a Debian package is named. For example, the package ncftp_3.1.3-1_i386.deb has 5 major parts:
* ncftp - the name of the program/application/library
* 3.1.3 - the version of the program/application/library assigned by the original (upstream) author(s)
* 1 - the revision number of the package assigned by the person(s) who packaged the program for a Debian system
* i386 - the architecture the packaged program is designed to run on 
* .deb - signifies this is a Debian package
Note that there is special significance to the use of underscores(_) and hyphens(-); an underscore shall separate the name of the program and its version, a hyphen shall separate a version number and the revision number, and an underscore shall separate the revision number and the architecture.

== dpkg ==

&lt;tt&gt;dpkg&lt;/tt&gt; is the &quot;grandaddy&quot; or &quot;back-end&quot; of the Debian Package Management System. Features present in the more advanced tools are not available to &lt;tt&gt;dpkg&lt;/tt&gt; but it is nevertheless a useful tool. 

Some notes:

*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg&lt;/tt&gt; keeps its record of available packages in /var/lib/dpkg/available.

Some of the more common functions used by administrators by &lt;tt&gt;dpkg&lt;/tt&gt; are:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;'''Adding, Removing, and Configuring Packages'''&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg {-i|--install} &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will install the specified package
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg {-r|--remove} &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will remove the specified package (but leave the configuration files intact)
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg {-P|--purge} &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will remove the specified package and the corresponding configuration files
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg --root /target -i &lt;package&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will install a package into a unbootable system by specifying the system root.
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg --unpack &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will unpack (but do not configure) a Debian archive into the file system of the hard disk
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg --configure &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will configure a package that already has been unpacked

&lt;tt&gt;'''Querying Package Information'''&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg --info &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will print out the control file (and other information) for a specified package
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg {-l|--list}&lt;/tt&gt; this will give you a list of installed packages.
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg {-a|--pending}&lt;/tt&gt; is given instead of a package name, then all packages unpacked, but marked to be removed or purged in file /var/lib/dpkg/status, are removed or purged, respectively.
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg -s (--status)&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;package-name&gt; will give you a description of installed package

&lt;tt&gt;'''Updating Package Information'''&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg --update-avail &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will replace old information with with new information from package.
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg --merge-avail &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will combine old information with new information from package.

== dpkg-reconfigure ==
&lt;tt&gt;dpkg-reconfigure&lt;/tt&gt; reconfigures packages after they have already been installed.

*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg-reconfigure &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to reconfigure the initial installation settings
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg-reconfigure --priority=medium package [...]&lt;/tt&gt; will set the minimum priority of question that will be displayed
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg-reconfigure --all&lt;/tt&gt; will reconfigure all packages
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg-reconfigure locales&lt;/tt&gt; will generate any extra locales
*&lt;tt&gt;dpkg-reconfigure --p=low&lt;/tt&gt; xserver-xfree86 will reconfigure X server

== Dselect ==

The utility that allows you on debian to easely add/remove packages is dselect.
* Choose the access method to use.
* Update list of available packages, if possible.
* Request which packages you want on your system.
* Install and upgrade wanted packages.
* Configure any packages that are unconfigured.
* Remove unwanted software.

There is on dselect an interactive menu that will allow you to install/remove packages.
Care must be taken with this utility.
You can damage your system.

Dselect menu example:
 Debian `dselect' package handling frontend.

 0. [A]ccess    Choose the access method to use. 
 1. [U]pdate    Update list of available packages, if possible. 
 2. [S]elect    Request which packages you want on your system.
 3. [I]nstall   Install and upgrade wanted packages. 
 4. [C]onfig    Configure any packages that are unconfigured. 
 5. [R]emove    Remove unwanted software.
 6. [Q]uit      Quit dselect.

 $ dselect - list of access methods
 Abbrev.        Descriptio  cdrom          Install from a CD-ROM.
 * multi_cd       Install from a CD-ROM set.
 nfs            Install from an NFS server (not yet mounted).
 multi_nfs      Install from an NFS server (using the CD-ROM set) (not yet mounted).
 harddisk       Install from a hard disk partition (not yet mounted).
 mounted        Install from a filesystem which is already mounted.
 multi_mount    Install from a mounted partition with changing contents.
 floppy         Install from a pile of floppy disks.
 apt            APT Acquisition [file,http,ftp]

== apt-get ==
If you know the name of a package you want to install, use apt-get. You must configure the sources.list file. This same file is used when you choose the apt access method of dselect.
The location is &lt;tt&gt;/etc/apt&lt;/tt&gt;.

*&lt;tt&gt;apt-get install &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will search its database for the most recent version of this package and will retrieve and install it from the corresponding archive as specified in sources.list. In the event that this package depends on another APT will check the dependencies and install the needed packages.
**&lt;tt&gt;apt-get install &amp;lt;package-name&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will install a package at the version specified
** &lt;tt&gt;apt-get install &amp;lt;package-name&amp;gt; -o DPkg::options::=&quot;--force-overwrite&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; installs a package ignoring &quot;error processing ..., which is also in package ...&quot; errors.
*&lt;tt&gt;apt-get remove &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will remove the specified package but keep its configuration files.
*&lt;tt&gt;apt-get --purge remove &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will remove the specified package and its configuration files.
*&lt;tt&gt;apt-get -u install &amp;lt;package-name&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will upgrade and install a specific package.
*&lt;tt&gt;apt-get -u upgrade&lt;/tt&gt; will upgrade packages within the same distribution packages except those which have been kept back because of broken dependencies or new dependencies.
*&lt;tt&gt;apt-get -u dist-upgrade&lt;/tt&gt; will upgrade an entire Debian system at once.

== apt-file ==

*&lt;tt&gt;apt-file search &lt;file-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will search for a package which includes the specified file.
*&lt;tt&gt;apt-file list &lt;package-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will list the contents of a package matching the pattern. This action is very close to the dpkg -S command except the package does not need to be installed or fetched.

== Apt-cache ==

To find the name of a package that you want to install use apt-cache. apt-cache main options are :

* add - Add a package file to the source cache
* showpkg - Show some general information for a single package
* stats - Show some basic statistics
* search - Search the package list for a regex pattern
* show - Show a readable record for the package 
* depends – Show raw dependency information for a package

 user@host:~$ apt-cache search gimp
 babygimp - An icon editor in Perl-Tk
 blackbook - GTK+ Address Book Applet
 cupsys-driver-gimpprint - Gimp-Print printer drivers for CUPS
 escputil - A maintenance utility for Epson Stylus printers
 filmgimp - A motion picture editing and retouching tool

For any triangle with vertices A, B, and C, corresponding angles A, B, and C, and corresponding opposite side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', the Law of Sines states that

:&lt;math&gt;{a \over \sin A} = {b \over \sin B} = {c \over \sin C}.&lt;/math&gt;


Each of these expressions is also equal to the diameter of the triangle's [[Trigonometry/Circles and Triangles/The Circumcircle|circumcircle]] (the circle that passes through the points A, B, and C). The law can also be written in terms of the reciprocals:

:&lt;math&gt;{\sin A \over a} = {\sin B \over b} = {\sin C \over c}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==

[[Image:Law-of-sines2.svg]]

Dropping a perpendicular ''OC'' from vertex C to intersect AB (or AB extended) at O splits this triangle into two right-angled triangles AOC and BOC.
We can calculate  the length ''h'' of the altitude OC in two different ways:

*Using the triangle AOC gives
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h=b \sin A ;&lt;/math&gt;
*and using the triangle BOC gives
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h=a \sin B .&lt;/math&gt;
*Eliminate h from these two equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a \sin B =b \sin A .&lt;/math&gt;
*Rearrange to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle {a \over \sin A} = {b \over \sin B}.&lt;/math&gt;

By using the other two perpendiculars the full law of sines can be proved. '''QED.'''

== Application ==
This formula can be used to find the other two sides of a triangle when one side and the three angles are known.  (If two angles are known, the third is easily found since the sum of the angles is 180º.)  See [[Trigonometry/Solving Triangles Given ASA|Solving Triangles Given ASA]].  It can also be used to find an angle when two sides and the angle opposite one side are known.

== Area of a triangle ==
The area of a triangle may be found in various ways.  If all three sides are known, use Heron's theorem.

If two sides and the included angle are known, consider the second diagram above.  Let the sides ''b'' and ''c'', and the angle between them &amp;alpha; be known.  From triangle ACO, the altitude ''h'' = CO is ''b''sin(&amp;alpha;) so the area is {{frac|1|2}}''cb''sin(&amp;alpha;).

If two angles and the included side are known, again consider the second diagram above.  Let the side ''c'' and the angles &amp;alpha; and &amp;gamma; be known.  Let AO =''x''.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{x}{h} = \cot(\alpha) \text {; } \frac{c-x}{h} = \cot(\gamma) \text {; adding these, } \frac{c}{h} = \cot(\alpha) + \cot(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h = \frac{c}{\cot(\alpha) + \cot(\gamma)} \text { so  area } = \frac{c^2}{2(\cot(\alpha) + \cot(\gamma))}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Law-of-cosines1.svg]]

The Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the more general theorem relating the lengths of sides in any triangle, the law of cosines:&lt;ref name=Leff1&gt;

{{cite book |title=''cited work'' |author=Lawrence S. Leff |url=http://books.google.com/?id=y_7yrqrHTb4C&amp;pg=PA326 |page=326 |isbn=0764128922 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |date=2005-05-01}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2-2ab\cos{\theta}=c^2, \,&lt;/math&gt;
where θ is the angle between sides ''a'' and ''b''.

===Does the formula make sense?===

This formula had better agree with the Pythagorean Theorem when &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.  

So try it... 

When &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos\theta=\cos 90^\circ=0&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -2ab\cos\theta=0&lt;/math&gt; and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem.

==Permutations==


For any triangle with angles A, B, and C and corresponding opposite side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', the Law of Cosines states that

:&lt;math&gt;a^2=b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot\cos A,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b^2=a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cdot\cos B,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c^2=a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot\cos C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===

[[Image:Law-of-cosines2.svg]]

Dropping a perpendicular OC from vertex C to intersect AB (or AB extended) at O splits this triangle into two right-angled triangles AOC and BOC, with altitude ''h'' from side c. 

First we will find the lengths of the other two sides of triangle AOC in terms of known quantities, using triangle BOC.

:''h''=''a'' sin ''B''
Side c is split into two segments, with total length ''c''.
:OB has length ''a'' cos ''B''
:AO has length ''c'' - ''a'' cos ''B''

Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find ''b'', since ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''AO''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}b^2 &amp; = &amp; (c-a\cos B)^2+a^2\sin^2 B \\
\ &amp;=&amp; c^2-2ac\cos B +a^2\cos^2 B+a^2\sin^2 B\\
\ &amp;=&amp; a^2+c^2-2ac\cos B\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding expressions for ''a'' and ''c'' can be proved similarly.

The formula can be rearranged:

&lt;math&gt;cos(C) = \frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for cos(A) and cos(B).

== Applications ==
This formula can be used to find the third side of a triangle if the other two sides and the angle between them are known.  The rearranged formula can be used to find the angles of a triangle if all three sides are known.  See [[Trigonometry/Solving Triangles Given SAS|Solving Triangles Given SAS]].

''England is translated as 英国 or &quot;country of the brave&quot;''? I don't know that! i think it's transliterated from '''England ['ing-]'''. it may be an abbreviation for 英格兰 or 英吉利 or something. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:28, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Well, I suppose the transliteration serves both the phonetic and semantic purposes, but you bring up a good point. --[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

== Vocabulary list and pinyin ==

1. The vocabulary list looks different to lesson 1 and 2, they should the same, i would change it, but we should choose one or the other a standard, please some suggestions.
My suggestion would be the style of lesson 1 and 2.

2. Pinyin, sometime with numbers for the tones, sometimes with tone marks, i think the tone marks are better. Suggestions are welcome here as well.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Database Programming ==

=== Introduction ===

A database is a repository of information managed by a database engine which ensures integrity of data and fast access to the data. 

A very common implementation of a database is a Relational Database Management System (RDBM). To users, the information in a database can be accessed by using Structured Query Language ([[SQL]]) a database language common to most databases. However, [[SQL]] only provides commands to access and manipulate the data in the database. 

For any complex application, there commonly is a need for conditions, branching, and loops. None of these are a part of the SQL language. In order to fill this gap, many common programming languages allow integration with SQL through a common library such as Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and sometimes with application programming interfaces or libraries supplied with the database. 

In addition, most databases now have a simple language of their own which allows simple control for applications which do not need the full power of standard languages like [[C++ Programming|C++]] and [[Pascal]]. These simple languages are used to write stored procedures and are proprietary to each database. 

An alternate approach taken by other languages like [[Programming:MUMPS|MUMPS]] is to have a data model that includes persistent variables that are shared among multiple processes.  This approach hides the database operations within the programming language instead of hiding the language within the database.

The solution is wrong! Moreover, it's obvious for any mathematician...

If something's wrong, by all means, fix it. Be bold! :) [[User:129.94.6.30|129.94.6.30]] 22:19, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC) ([[User talk:Dysprosia|User:Dysprosia]], logged out)

I concur, the solution is incorrect.  This is basic [[Probability]].  Consider:
*goat
*goat
*prize

No matter which door you select, a door with a goat will be revealed.  The fact that the door opened is one other than you choose is irrelevant.  The remaining doors contain:
*goat
*prize

While 2 of the 3 original doors remain, the odds of selecting the prize from the two remaining doors is 1:2 NOT 2:3.  

'''However''', if the chosen door is revealed you effectively have two chances to select the prize from the three doors -- the odds are 2:3.  The odds of selecting the prize from the initial round is 1:3.

== The solution is right, you are wrong ==

Your reasoning is flawed.  Read the explanation again.  For that matter, did either of you try doing a monte carlo experiment and seeing for yourself?

If this makes it clearer, suppose you choose door A.  Then:

  Star prize is in    If you stick    If you switch
  A                   Star prize      Goat
  B                   Goat            Star prize
  C                   Goat            Star prize

The same applies whichever door you pick. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 11:25, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

=== Elaboration ===

There are four (and only 4) permutations for a given door.  To illustrate, suppose you choose door A:

 Prize Door   Revealed Door   Contents   Remaining Doors   If you stay  If you switch   Prize recieved by
 A            B               Goat       A, C              A - Prize    C - Goat        Staying
              C               Goat       A, B                           B - Goat        Staying
 B            C               Goat       A, B              A - Goat     B - Prize       Switching
 C            B               Goat       A, C              A - Goat     C - Prize       Switching

Independent of whichever door is selected only two doors remain, of which only one contains the prize, 1:2.  Moreover, the odds of recieving the prize by either staying (2) or switching (2) relative to the number of permutations (4) is 2:4 or 1:2.

While there are 4 unique scenarios, staying or switching for any given door yield the same result.  Consequently, two of the four scenarios are identical and the practical odds are 2:3 in favor of switching.

Both odds are valid, but they reference the outcome from different perspectives.  2:3 is the practical odds and is the answer given the context of the question.  However, both the question and the solution could be further clarified to prevent this discrepancy while maintaining the integrity of the puzzle.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 01:58, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: What matters is not so much which possibilities are the same as their relative probabilities.  Though statement 3 below does depend on the symmetry in B and C, and hence the equivalence of the first two....

: The key statements are:
:# The prize is equally likely to be in A, B or C.
:# Hence once a door is picked, the probability of that door having the prize is 1/3.
:# Monty opening a door cannot alter the fact of statement 2, since his opening a door you didn't choose is unconditional.

: Maybe the solution can be improved.  But how would you improve the question?

== A demonstration ==

I've just written this C program for the doubters among you to try for yourself:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 #include &lt;time.h&gt;
 
 int main() {
     const int ATTEMPTS = 10000;
     int stickWins = 0, switchWins = 0, attempt;
     
     srand(time(NULL));
     
     for (attempt = 0; attempt &lt; ATTEMPTS; attempt++) {
         int prizeIn = rand() % 3;  // prize is behind this door
         int choose = rand() % 3;   // contestant's first choice of door
         int open;                  // door opened by Monty
         int switchTo;              // door that contestant switches to
         
         // now reveal a goat
         if (prizeIn == choose) {
             open = rand() % 2;
             if (open == choose) open = 2;
         } else {
             for (open = 0; open &lt; 3; open++) {
                 if (open != choose &amp;&amp; open != prizeIn) break;
             }
         }
         
         // try sticking
         if (prizeIn == choose) {
             stickWins++;
         }
         
         // try switching
         for (switchTo = 0; switchTo &lt; 3; switchTo++) {
             if (switchTo != choose &amp;&amp; switchTo != open) break;
         }
         
         if (prizeIn == switchTo) {
             switchWins++;
         }
     }
     
     // now report on result
     printf(&quot;Wins by sticking:  %5d\n&quot;, stickWins);
     printf(&quot;Wins by switching: %5d\n&quot;, switchWins);
     
     return 0;
 }

== Never mind me ==
OK, I just ran the program, modified it to make it more fair (took out some unneeded code and made the choosing algorithm more transparent. My version keeps using rand() untill it finds a valid door to open, instead of falling back to a 'default' 2 if it detects a double. It STILL ends up is 33%/66%. I was suprized... Untill I realized that the clue behind this 'riddle' is that the door that gets opened isn't a random door. If you choose a goat door the door that get's opened is non random. So I'm not sure yet how the math on this works, but because of this you chance goes up. The description on the solution page is still wrong though. However, the solution mentioned here (mapping all possibilities out if you choose door A) does privide a sufficient explanation, if you explain properly that you can see the 2 equal situations as 1 situation (resulting in 1 no switch win and 2 switch wins).

The current solution, as of june 21 2005, is correct. 

Scenario A: Select prize; Switching after goat revealed means you lose.
Scenario B: Select Goat A; Switching after goat revealed means you win.
Scenario C: Select Goat B; Switching after goat revealed means you win. 

Scenario A, B and C are equally likely; Switching means you win 2/3 times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The solution in my opinion is not correct. Even though during the juggling process, one of the apples is in the air, if you consider the man+ 3 apples as a system, this system is applying an average force of 101kg on the bridge. (actually, while throwing the apple up in the air, you exert a very large impulsive force and then you go back to your man + 2 apples weight)

I believe the solution is incorrect.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== I think the guessing part is bad mathematics ==

I think the guessing solution is bad mathematics. I dont know who came up with the idea of guessing. I know that part of the mathematics isn't guessing, it's an observation turned generalisation. Nothing is guesswork, but careful deduction and elimination.
I think it would be good to just keep it there for the moment being. But it will need to be heavily edited before the first draft.[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 22:54, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Uh, ''smart'' guessing isn't bad mathematics - if you have a problem and you have a good idea that it may lead to a positive outcome, then there's no real harm in guessing - afterward you can clean up, and ''justify'' the guess. I suppose you'd like some justification of the &quot;guess&quot;, and I should have done that earlier, so I apologise [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:20, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Yeah. Justification would be nice, but I think the idea comes from the derivation method. I dont think we should say it's guesswork, because it's something that follows naturally once you know the work. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 00:29, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:: I would argue the opposite, if, say, you were confronting the theory of linear recurrence relations for the first time. You might try polynomials at first and see that they don't work, or try something else - then see that exponentials work, then try and fiddle around with exponentials and then see that they form the general solution, then try and explain why exponentials work. It's much more difficult to come up with some general theory, and then make it more specific. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:41, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)


==== Alternate solution to example 1 ====
We have &lt;math&gt;x_n = 2x_{n-1} + 3x_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us suppose that we will have a solution will be in the form ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''r'' (Later we will show you that this is just the right form of solution to choose). If we substitute this guess in, we obtain
: ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+3''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;
Divide throughout by ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;
: ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''r''+3

But this is just a quadratic equation - we can easily solve to get roots 
: &amp;alpha;=-1, &amp;beta;=3

So we have two solutions, ''A''(-1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''B''(3&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;). We can add these solutions together to get a new solution&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, but we need to find out what coefficients ''A'' and ''B'' are. We've been given initial conditions ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. So, let's substitute ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; into ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=''A''(-1) &lt;sup&gt; n &lt;/sup&gt; +''B''(3 &lt;sup&gt; n &lt;/sup&gt;).
:1 = ''A''(-1)^0+B(3^0)
:1 = ''A''+''B''

Now substitute ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:1 = -''A''+3''B''

Solve these two to get ''A''=''B''=1/2.

So our solution is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=1/2((-1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;+3&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;), same as above.

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;We know this because,  if ''a''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; are both solutions, and we substitute into the general recurrence relation
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=''Ax''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;+''Bx''&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;
we get, for ''a''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, since they are solutions
:0=''Aa''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+''Ba''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;-''a''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
:0=''Ab''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+''Bb''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;-''b''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
Substituting their sum,
:''A''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+''b''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;)+''B''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;+''b''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;) - (''a''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;+''b''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)
::=''Aa''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+''Ba''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;-''a''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;+
:::''Ab''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+''Bb''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;-''b''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
::=0+0=0

So both the solutions and their sum satisfy the linear recurrence.

Now why is ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; such a good solution for linear recurrences? For simplicity, we'll prove this for recurrences in the form ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;+''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the proof can be extended easily to general linear recurrences like the ones you see below. 

Now ''r'' must be a solution of the quadratic equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ax''-B=0 to be a solution. Why is this so? We have the recurrence
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;+''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;
rearranging
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;=0
Substitute ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (r not zero) into the recurrence to get
:''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;-''Br''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;=0
Now factor out by ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;, the term farthest on the right
:''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;(''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-''B'')=0
We know that ''r'' isn't zero, so ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; can never be zero. So ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-B must be zero, and so ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''r'' a solution of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-''B''=0, will be a solution of the linear recurrence.

Why is this removed, now? If you don't like the approach, just say the word, but it's just a good and logical method as the ones featured in the text. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:34, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:This removal is temporary. I think what you have done there is good work. What I would like to do with is to modify it a little so that it's a demonstrastion of how this method of ''guessing'' is derived, not just an alternate solution to example 1, but something bigger and more general. The work you have done on this section isn't all that convincing, because the justification (derivation) part isn't fully complete. This will need to be modified (by you or me), before incorporating back into the main article. That's why I just copy-and-pasted it, I see value in this, but not just a solution for example 1.

== Project ==

I'm considering writing a project on power sum,it may cross this chapter and the mathematical proof chapter. Anyway here is the working draft, I'll place it in the correct location once it has been done to a certain degrees.

Note: Notation is quite a problem here, in question 1, S(z) is a generating function of square number, S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of the first n square number, and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a generating function of power sum in degrees 2, i.e. the sum of square number.

::(Hint:Reduce it into a linear generating function first)
:b) Hence find the generating function of

&amp; &amp; S(z) &amp;=&amp; 1^2 &amp; +2^{2}z &amp; +3^{2}z^{2} &amp; +4^{2}z^{3}+...\\
z &amp; \times &amp; S(z) &amp;=&amp;  &amp; 1^{2}z &amp; +2^{2}z^2 &amp; +3^{2}z^3+...\\

(1+z+z^2+z^3+...) &amp; \times &amp; S(z) &amp;=&amp; S_{1} &amp; + S_{2}z &amp; + S_{3}z^2 &amp; + S_{4}z^3+ ...\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{S(z)}{1-z} = P_{2}(z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{2}(z) = \frac{2}{(1-z)^4} - \frac{1}{(1-z)^3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} [2{4+i-1 \choose i} z^i] - \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} [{3+i-1 \choose i} z^i] = P_{2}(z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} [2{3+i \choose i} - {2+i \choose i}] z^i = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} S_{i+1} z^i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;math&gt;[2{3+i \choose i} - {2+i \choose i}] z^i = S_{i+1} z^i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2{3+i \choose i} - {2+i \choose i} = S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So n = i+1.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2{n+2 \choose n-1} - {n+1 \choose n-1} = S_{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_{n} = 2{n+2 \choose (n+2)-(n-1)} - {n+1 \choose (n+1)-(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_{n} = 2{n+2 \choose 3} - {n+1 \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_{n} = \frac{2(n+2)(n+1)n}{6} - \frac{(n+1)n}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_{n} = \frac{2(n+2)(n+1)n - 3(n+1)n}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_{n} = \frac{[2(n+2) - 3](n+1)n}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_{n} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

:::Update:It appears that power sum is a deep and difficult topic, so... I've discovered that the topic of generating function is deep and wide, that we couldn't possibly cover 'em all in those 25 pages. I propose exploring exponential generating function in the project, is it ok? Somehow it is the most common generating function right after ordinary generating function. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 10:49, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

::::Sounds good, i can't pretend to have cover everything i know about generating functions in those pages. Feel free to add your own content! It's great. But somehow i dont know how ppl will discover how to diff e^x. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:14, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::Ha! When I learn differentiating, I was told to define e so that we can differentiate log x, then went on to discover e^x is the solution of the differential equation f'(x) = f(x) lol. (Opps, I spoiled what will appear later on!) --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 14:33, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

== Generating functions and the z-transformation ==

What do the counting and generating functions have in common with the z-transformation. (The z-transformation of &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; I came across is defined by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f(n)z^n&lt;/math&gt;) It seems to me that the generating function of some series is the z-transform of the function that gives the coefficients of the polynomial. If that's the case it might be nice to inform the reader about it.


== Counting and Generating Functions ==
In the first section of &quot;Counting and Generating Functions&quot;, there is a note about it called &quot;Info - Infinite Sums&quot;. It says that the two expressions (the infinite geometric series and the formula for it) are not equal. An example was also given by adding a finite amount of terms of the series and comparing the sum with the result from the formula. I disagree with this statement that the two expressions are not equal. First, infinite sums have to be defined and it is DEFINED to be the limit of the partial sum as the number of terms go to infinity if the limit exists. So when the formula was derived, it IS equal to the geometric series according to the definition. The example is not a valid way of showing that the two things are different since it was a finite amount of terms, so of course the number will be close but not equal. According to the definition the value of the infinite series is the LIMIT defined before, so in the example it is 2 and the formula also gives 2 which are equal. Also, I am not just making up this definition, its in any rigorous calculus book such as by Spivak.</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Swing is a tool kit in Java which provides a way to build cross platform user interfaces. It is built on top of and designed as a replacement for AWT, the other UI toolkit built into  Java. SWT is a third toolkit you may hear about. SWT is an open source toolkit and is a full topic in of itself, see [http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ SWT's Homepage] for more information.

== Overview ==
[[Image:GC SwingDemo.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Figure 10.1: Example of a Swing application]]
Swing&lt;ref&gt;Swing is also referred to incorrectly as JFC (Java Foundation Classes), however the JFC includes APIs in addition to Swing, such as the Java 2D and Drag-n-Drop APIs.&lt;/ref&gt; provides many controls and widgets to build user interfaces with. Swing class names typically begin with a J such as &lt;code&gt;JButton&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JList&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;. This is mainly to differentiate them from their AWT&lt;ref&gt;AWT is the Abstract Windowing Toolkit, where the components are rendered by the native operating system&lt;/ref&gt; counterparts and in general are one-to-one replacements. Swing is built on the concept of ''Lightweight components'' vs AWT and SWT's concept of ''Heavyweight components''. The difference between the two is that the Lightweight components are rendered (drawn) using purely Java code, such as drawLine and drawImage, whereas Heavyweight components use the native operating system to render the components.

Some components in Swing are actually heavyweight components. The top-level classes and any derived from them are heavyweight as they extend the AWT versions. This is needed because at the root of the UI, the parent windows need to be provided by the OS. These top-level classes include &lt;code&gt;JWindow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JFrame&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JDialog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;JApplet&lt;/code&gt;. All Swing components to be rendered to the screen must be able to trace their way to a root window or one of those classes.
{{XNote|Generally it is not a good idea to mix heavyweight components with lightweight components (other than as previously mentioned) as you will encounter layering issues, e.g., a lightweight component that should appear &quot;on top&quot; ends up being obscured by a heavyweight component. The few exceptions to this include using heavyweight components as the root pane and for popup windows. Generally speaking, heavyweight components will render on top of lightweight components and will not be consistent with the look and feel being used in Swing. There are exceptions, but that is an advanced topic. The truly adventurous may want to consider reading this [http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/mixing/ article] from Sun on mixing heavyweight and lightweight components.}}

So what does using Swing get you? So far we've only talked about components and rendering. Well, to start with you get the following.
* Controls: Buttons, Check Boxes, Lists, Trees, Tables, Combo boxes (dropdown list), Menus, Text fields
* Displays: Labels, Progress bars, Icons, Tool Tips
* Pluggable look and feels (PLAFs): Windows, CDE/Motif, Mac. Allows for &quot;skinning&quot; the application without changing any code
{{XNote|Due to legal issues between Sun, Microsoft &amp; Apple, you are only able to use the Windows Look and Feel (LAF) on Windows and the Mac LAF on Apple computers}}
* Standard Top-Level Windows: Windows, Frames, Dialogs etc.
* Event Listener APIs
* Key bindings &amp; mnemonics: Allow keystrokes to map to specific actions.

== Parliament ==

Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom.  It is made up of two ''Houses of Parliament'', namely the ''House of Commons'' and the ''House of Lords'', as well as the Sovereign.  The Sovereign's involvement in the life and working of Parliament is purely formal.

In constitutional theory, Parliament in its strictest sense is sometimes referred to as the ''Queen-in-Parliament''; this contrasts with the more ordinary use of the term &quot;Parliament&quot;, meaning just the two Houses of Parliament.  Within the British constitutional framework, the Queen-in-Parliament is supreme (&quot;sovereign&quot;), able to make, alter, or repeal any law at will.

Both Houses of Parliament meet at the ''Palace of Westminster''.


== Parliaments and Sessions ==

As with most legislatures, Parliament does not continue in perpetual existence.  Typically, the &quot;life&quot; of a Parliament is around four years.

Parliament is initially ''summoned'' by the Sovereign.  This now always occurs after there has been a general election.  Once assembled, and a Speaker has been chosen by the House of Commons, Parliament is formally ''opened'' by the Sovereign.  The business of the two Houses is arranged into ''sessions'', which usually last a year (running from around October or November each calendar year).  However, there is usually a long ''recess'' during the summer months, when business is temporarily suspended.

The opening of each parliamentary session is conducted in accordance with a great deal of traditional ceremony.  The Sovereign takes his or her seat on the throne situated in the chamber of the House of Lords, and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod (one of that House's officers) is commanded to summon the House of Commons.  When Black Rod reaches the door of the Commons, it is slammed shut in his face, to symbolise the right of the Commons to debate without royal interference.  Black Rod then solemnly knocks on the door with his staff of office; on the third knock, the door is opened, and he is permitted to enter and deliver his message.  MPs then proceed from the Commons to the House of Lords, to hear the ''Speech from the Throne'', more commonly known as the ''Queen's Speech''.  The Speech outlines the Government's legislative proposals for the session; while worded as if it's the Sovereign's own policy, the Speech is in fact entirely drafted by Government ministers.

Each session is ended by a ''prorogation''.  The Commons are formally summoned to the House of Lords, where another formal Speech is read out, summing up the work of the two Houses of Parliament over the course of the session.  In practice the Sovereign no longer attends for the prorogation; ''Lords Commissioners'' are appointed to perform the task, and one of their number also reads out the Speech.

By law, each Parliament must come to an end no later than five years from its commencement; this is known as ''dissolution''.  The dissolution is made by royal proclamation.  The summoning, proroguing, and dissolving of Parliament are powers exercised by the Sovereign under the royal prerogative.  They are exercised in accordance with the &quot;advice&quot; of the Prime Minister.  Because a dissolution is necessary in order to trigger a general election, the Prime Minister is effectively able to choose to hold elections at a time that seems the most advantageous to his or her political party.

Although the duration of Parliament has been restricted to five years since 1911, legislation was passed during both World Wars to extend the life of the existing Parliament; this meant that the Parliament summoned in 1935 eventually continued in existence for around ten years, until 1945.


== House of Commons ==

=== Composition ===

While sometimes described as the &quot;lower house&quot;, the House of Commons is by far the most important of the two Houses of Parliament.  Members of the House of Commons are known as ''Members of Parliament'', or ''MPs''.

The entire United Kingdom is subdivided into ''constituencies'', each of which returns one MP to sit in the House of Commons.  There are presently 650 constituencies, however the exact number fluctuates over time as the boundaries of constituencies are periodically reviewed by Boundaries Commissions set up for each part of the UK.  Constituencies are intended to have roughly equal numbers of voters, but in practice the smallest and largest constituencies can have a significant difference in size.

At each ''general election'' all seats in the House of Commons become vacant.  If a seat becomes vacant during the life of a Parliament (i.e. between general elections), then a ''by-election'' is held for that constituency.  The election for each constituency is by secret ballot conducted according to the ''First-Past-the-Post'' system: the candidate with the most votes is ''returned'' as MP.

==== Qualifications of voters ====

A person must be aged at least eighteen in order to vote.

The following nationalities are entitled to vote at parliamentary elections:
*British citizens
*citizens of the Republic of Ireland
*citizens of Commonwealth countries

Irish and Commonwealth citizens must have been resident in the United Kingdom.  British citizens who are resident abroad are only able to vote if they had been resident in the United Kingdom within the previous 15 years.

Certain categories of people are unable to vote:
*the Sovereign
*members of the House of Lords
*people serving prison sentences
*persons convicted of &quot;corrupt practices&quot; (electoral malpractice) within the previous five years
*the insane

By convention, close relatives of the Sovereign also do not vote.

==== Qualifications of MPs ====

Anyone who is not disqualified to vote is also qualified to be an MP, except the following:
*undischarged bankrupts
*persons convicted of treason
*members of legislatures outside of the United Kingdom that are not in Commonwealth countries
*civil servants
*members of certain specific public bodies, and holders of certain specific statutory offices
*members of the armed forces
*judges

==== Resignation as an MP ====

Since the 17th century, the House of Commons has asserted that MPs may not resign.  However, in practice members are able to resign by the legal fiction of appointment as ''Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough, and Burnham'', or as ''Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead''.  Neither of these offices carries any duties, but have been preserved in force so that those appointed to them automatically lose their seats in the House of Commons as having accepted an ''office of profit under the Crown''.

=== Speakership and procedure ===

The House of Commons is presided over by the ''Speaker''. There are also three Deputy Speakers, with the titles of ''Chairman of Ways and Means'', ''First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means'', and ''Second Chairman of Ways and Means''.

The Speaker and his or her deputies are elected at the commencement of a Parliament, and serve until its dissolution. Following a general election, the ''Father of the House'' (the member with the longest unbroken service in the House, who is not also a Minister of the Crown) takes the chair. If the Speaker from the previous Parliament has been returned as a member of the new Parliament, and intends to continue in office, then the House votes on a motion that the member take the chair as Speaker. Otherwise, or if the motion for his or her re-election fails, then members vote by secret ballot in several rounds; after each round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The election ends when one member secures a majority of votes in a particular round. Thereafter, the Speaker-elect leads the House of Commons to the House of Lords, where the Lords Commissioners (five Lords representing the Sovereign) officially declare the Royal Approbation (approval) of the Speaker, who immediately takes office. The Speaker traditionally lays claim to all of the House's privileges, including freedom of speech in debate, which the Lords Commissioners then confirm on behalf of the Sovereign.

If a Speaker should choose to resign from his post during the course of Parliament, then he must preside over the election of his successor. The new election is otherwise conducted in the same manner as at the beginning of a Parliament.  The new Speaker-elect receives the Royal Approbation from Lords Commissioners; however, the ceremonial assertion of the rights of the Commons is not repeated.

The Speaker is expected to act impartially.  He or she is an important figure within the House of Commons, controlling the flow of debate by selecting which members get to speak in debates, and by ensuring that the customs and procedures of the House are complied with. The Speaker and his deputies do not generally speak during debates, nor vote at divisions.

The Speaker also exercises disciplinary powers. He or she may order any member to resume his or her seat if they consistently contribute irrelevant or repetitive remarks during a debate. An individual who has disregarded the Speaker's call to sit down may be requested to leave the House; if the request is declined, then the Speaker may &quot;name&quot; the member. The House then votes on whether to suspend the member in question for a certain number of days, or even, in the case of repeated breaches, for the remainder of the session. In the most serious cases, the House may vote to expel a member. In the case of grave disorder, the Speaker may adjourn the House without a vote.

The House votes on all questions by voice first. The Speaker asks all those in favour of the proposition to say &quot;Aye,&quot; and those opposed to say &quot;No&quot;. The Speaker then assesses the result, saying &quot;I think the Ayes have it&quot; or &quot;I think the Noes have it&quot;, as appropriate. Only if a member challenges the Speaker's opinion is a ''division'', or formal count, called. During a division, members file into two separate lobbies on either side of the Commons chamber. As they exit each lobby, clerks and tellers count the votes and record the names. The result is then announced by the Speaker.  In the event of a tied vote, the Speaker (or other occupant of the Chair) has a ''casting vote''; however, conventions exist restricting the way in which this vote is actually cast.

== House of Lords ==

=== Composition ===

Generally speaking, membership of the House of Lords is by appointment for life.  However, up until 1999, hereditary peers were also members of the Lords; when this right was abolished, a compromise measure allowed them to elect ninety of their number to continue as members.

Certain office-holders are also ex officio members of the House of Lords:
*the Earl Marshal
*the Lord Great Chamberlain
*the Archbishop of Canterbury
*the Archbishop of York
*the Bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester

The Earl Marshal and Lord Great Chamberlain are mostly ceremonial offices.  In addition to the three ex officio bishops, the 21 longest-serving diocesan bishops also sit in the Lords.

The general qualifications for sitting and voting in the Lords are:
*to have reached the age of 21
*to be a British citizen, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, or a citizen of a Commonwealth country
*to not have been convicted of treason
*to not have been declared insane


=== Speakership and procedure ===

The ''Lord Speaker'' is elected by the House.  Until recently his or her duties were carried out by the Lord Chancellor, a Minister of the Crown.

In contrast with the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Speaker has a relatively minor role, since the House of Lords is generally self-governing: the House itself decides upon points of order and other such matters.  The seat used by the Lord Speaker is known as ''the Woolsack''.

Similar to the House of Commons, the Lords also vote by voice first. The Lord Speaker (or whoever else is presiding) puts the question, with those in favour saying &quot;Content,&quot; and those opposed saying &quot;Not-Content.&quot; If the Lord Speaker's assessment of the result is challenged, a division follows, with members voting in the appropriate lobby just as is done in the Commons. The officer presiding may vote from his or her place in the chamber rather than from a lobby. In the case of a tie, the result depends on what type of motion is before the House. A motion that a bill be advanced to the next stage or passed is always decided in the positive, while amendments to bills or other motions are decided in the negative, if there is an equality of votes.

== Acts of Parliament ==

Legislation passed by Parliament is in the form of an ''Act of Parliament''.

A draft law is known as a ''Bill''.  A bill passes into law provided that it has either been passed by both Houses of Parliament, or the provisions of the Parliament Acts have been complied with; and provided it has received the Royal Assent.

A bill must pass through several stages in both of the two Houses.  A bill is &quot;read&quot; three times in each House.  The First Reading for Public Bills is almost always a formality.  The Second Reading is a debate on the merits of the general principles behind the bill.  Next follow the Committee and Report stages.  The Third Reading is a vote upon the bill as a whole, as amended during the Committee and Report stages.  Once the House into which the bill was first introduced has finished with it, the bill is then introduced into the other House.  Any amendments by the second House then have to be agreed to by the first before the bill can proceed.

Bills are classified as either ''Government Bills'' or as ''Private Members' Bills''. Ministers of the Crown introduce Government Bills; private members introduce Private Members' Bills.

Bills are also classified as ''Public'', ''Private'', ''Personal'' or ''Hybrid''. Public bills create laws applied generally (for instance, reforming the nation's electoral system). Private bills affect a specific named company, person or other entity (for instance, authorising major constructions on specific named public lands). Personal bills are private bills that confer specific rights to specific named individuals (for example by granting the right to marry a person one would not normally be allowed to wed). Hybrid bills are public bills that directly and specially affect private interests.

=== Public Bills ===

A Public Bill's First Reading is usually a mere formality, allowing its title to be entered in the Journals and for its text to be printed by the House's authority.

After two weeks, one of the bill's supporters moves &quot;that the bill be now read a second time&quot;. At the second reading debate, the bill's general characteristics and underlying principles, rather than the particulars, are discussed. If the vote on the Second Reading fails, the bill dies. It is, however, very rare for a Government bill to be defeated at the Second Reading; such a defeat signifies a major loss.

In the House of Commons, following the Second Reading, various procedural resolutions may need to be passed. If the bill seeks to levy or increase a tax or charge, then a ''Ways and Means Resolution'' has to be passed. If it involves significant expenditure of public funds, then a ''Money Resolution'' is necessary. Finally, the government may proceed with a ''Programme Motion'' or an ''Allocation of Time Motion''. A Programme Motion outlines a timetable for further debate on the bill and is normally passed without debate. An Allocation of Time Motion, commonly called the ''Guillotine'', limits time available for debate. Normally, a Programme motion is agreed to by both parties while an Allocation of Time Motion becomes necessary if the Opposition does not wish to cooperate with the Government. In the House of Lords, there are no Guillotines or other motions that limit the time available for debate.

Next, the bill can be committed to a committee. In the House of Commons, the bill may be sent to the ''Committee of the Whole House'', a ''Standing Committee'', a ''Special Standing Committee'' or a ''Select Committee.'' The Committee of the Whole House is a committee that includes all members of the House and meets in the regular chamber. The Speaker is normally not present during the meetings; a Deputy Speaker normally takes the chair. The procedure is used for parts of the annual Finance Bill and for bills of major constitutional importance. More often, the bill is committed to a Standing Committee. Though the name may suggest otherwise, the membership of Standing Committees is temporary. There can be from sixteen to fifty members; the strength of parties in the committee is proportional to their strengths in the whole House. It is possible for a bill to go to a Special Standing Committee, which is like a Standing Committee except that it may take evidence and conduct hearings; the procedure has not been used in several years. Finally, the bill may be sent to a Select Committee. Select Committees are permanent bodies charged with the oversight of a particular Government department. This last procedure is rarely used; the quinquennial Armed Forces Bill, however, is always referred to the Defence Select Committee.

In the House of Lords, the Bill is committed to the ''Committee of the Whole House'', a ''Public Bill Committee'', a ''Special Public Bill Committee'', a ''Select Committee'' or a ''Grand Committee''. The most common committee used is the Committee of the Whole House. Sometimes, the bill is sent to a Public Bill Committee of twelve to sixteen members (plus the Chairman of Committees) or to a Special Public Bill Committee of nine or ten members. These committees correspond in function to the Commons Standing and Special Standing Committees, but are less often utilised. Select Committees may also be used, like in the Commons, though it is rare for this to be done. The Grand Committee procedure is the only one unique to the House of Lords. The procedure is reserved for non-controversial bills that must be passed quickly; a proposal to amend the bill is defeated if a single member votes against it.

In both Houses, the committee used considers the bill clause-by-clause and may make amendments. Thereafter, the bill proceeds to the ''Consideration'' or ''Report Stage''. This stage occurs on the Floor of the House and offers it an opportunity to further amend the bill. While the committee is bound to consider every single clause of the bill, the House need only debate those clauses which members seek to amend.

Following the Report Stage, the motion ''that the bill be now read a third time'' is considered. In the House of Commons, there is a short debate followed by a vote; no further amendments are permitted. If the motion passes, then the Bill is considered passed. In the Lords, however, amendments may be moved. Following the vote on the third reading, there must be a separate vote on passage.

After one House has passed a bill, it is sent to the other for its consideration. Assuming both Houses have passed a bill, differences between their separate versions must be reconciled. Each House may accept or reject amendments made by the other House, or offer other amendments in lieu. If one House has rejected an amendment, the other House may nevertheless insist upon it. If a House insists upon an amendment that the other rejects, then the bill is lost unless the procedure set out in the Parliament Acts is complied with.

Once a bill has passed by both Houses, or has been certified by the Speaker of the Commons as having passed the House of Commons in conformity with the Parliament Acts, the bill is finally submitted to the Sovereign for ''Royal Assent''. Since 1708, no Sovereign has failed to grant Royal Assent to a bill. Assent may be given by the Sovereign in person, but is usually given in the form of letters patent read out in each of the Houses; in the House of Lords the Clerk announces the Norman French formula &quot;La Reyne le Veult&quot;, and the Bill thereupon becomes an Act of Parliament.  In 1708 the formula used for the Scottish Militia Bill was &quot;La Reyne s'avisera&quot; (however, this was on ministerial advice).

In theory the Sovereign has the right to either ''withhold'' or ''reserve'' the assent, however this right is not exercised.  If assent were withheld, then the bill would fail.  If assent were reserved, then formally a final decision on the bill has been put off until a later time; if Assent were not given before prorogation of the session, then the bill would fail.

=== Private, Personal and Hybrid Bills ===

In the nineteenth century several hundred private Acts were passed each year, dealing with such matters as the alteration of local authority powers, the setting up or alteration of turnpike trusts, etc.  A series of reforms has eliminated the necessity for much of this legislation, meaning that only a handful of private Acts are now passed each year.

A private bill is initiated when an individual petitions Parliament for its passage. After the petition is received, it is officially gazetted so that other interested parties may support or contest it. Counter-petitions objecting to the passage of the bill may also be received. To be able to file such a petition, the bill must &quot;directly and specially&quot; affect the individual. If those supporting the bill disagree that such an effect exist, then the matter is resolved by the ''Court of Referees'', a group of senior Members of Parliament.

The bill then proceeds through the same stages as public bills. Generally, no debate is held on the Floor during the Second Reading unless a Member of Parliament files a &quot;blocking motion&quot;. It is possible for a party whose petition was denied by the Court of Referees to instead lobby a Member to object to the bill on the Floor. After the bill is read a second time, it is sent to one of two committees: the ''Opposed Bill Committee'' if there are petitions against the bill, or the ''Unopposed Bill Committee'' if there aren't. After taking evidence, the committee may return a finding of ''Case Proved'' or ''Case Not Proved''. In the latter case, the bill is considered rejected, but in the former case, amendments to the bill may be considered. After consideration, third reading and passage, the bill is sent to the other House, which follows the same procedure. If necessary, the bill may have to face two different Opposed Bill Committees. After differences between the Houses are resolved, the bill is submitted for Royal Assent.

Personal bills relate to the &quot;estate, property, status, or style&quot; or other personal affairs of an individual. By convention, these bills are brought first in the House of Lords, where it is referred to a Personal Bill Committee before being read a &quot;first&quot; time. The Committee may make amendments or even reject the bill outright. If the bill is reported to the House, then it follows the same procedure as any other private bill, including going through an Unopposed or Opposed Bill Committee in both Houses. A special case involves bills that seek to enable marriages between those who are within a &quot;prohibited degree of affinity or cosanguinity&quot;. In those cases, the bill is not discussed on the Floor and is sent at the committee stage to a Select Committee that includes the Chairman of Committees, a bishop and two lay members.

Hybrid bills are public bills that have a special effect on a private interest. Prior to the second reading of any public bill, it must be submitted to the Clerk, who determines if any of the House's rules have been violated. If the Clerk finds that the bill does have such an effect on a private interest, then it is sent to the ''Examiners'', a body which then may report to the House that the bill does or does not affect private interests. If the latter, then it proceeds just like a public bill, but if the former, then it is treated as hybrid. The first and second readings are just as for public bills, but at the committee stage, if petitions have been filed against the bill, it is sent to a Select Committee, but the Committee does not have the same powers of rejection as Private Bill Committees. After the Committee reports, the bill is recommitted to another committee as if it were a public bill. Thereafter, the stages are the same as for a public bill, though, in the other chamber, the bill may have to be considered once more by a Select Committee.

=== Supremacy of the House of Commons ===

Under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons is essentially the pre-eminent chamber in Parliament. If the Lords fail to pass a bill (by rejecting it outright, insisting on amendments disagreed to by the Commons, or by failing to vote on it), and the bill has been passed by the Commons in two consecutive sessions, then the bill may be presented for Royal Assent unless the House of Commons otherwise directs, and provided that the bill was introduced in the Lords at least one month before the end of each session. However, twelve months must have passed between the Second Reading in the first session, and the final vote on passage in the second one. Also, the bill passed by the Commons in each session must be identical, except to take into account the passage of time since the bill was first proposed.

The effect of the procedure set out in the Parliament Acts is that the House of Lords may delay a bill for at least thirteen months, but would ultimately be unable to overturn the concerted will of the House of Commons. However, this procedure does not apply in the case of private or personal bills, nor to bills seeking to extend the life of Parliament beyond five years.

Under the Parliament Acts, a special procedure applies to &quot;money bills&quot;. A bill is considered a money bill if the Speaker certifies that it relates solely to national taxation or to the expenditure of public funds. The Speaker's decision is final and cannot be overturned. Following passage by the House of Commons, the bill can be considered by the House of Lords for not longer than one month. If the Lords have not passed the bill within that time, it is submitted for Royal Assent regardless. Any amendments made by the House of Lords are ignored unless accepted by the House of Commons.

In addition to the Parliament Acts, tradition and conventions limit the House of Lords. It is the privilege of the House of Commons to levy taxes and authorise expenditure of public funds. The House of Lords cannot introduce bills to do either; furthermore, they are barred from amending supply bills (bills appropriating money to expenditure). In some cases, however, the House of Lords can circumvent the rule by inserting a ''Privilege Amendment'' into a bill they have originated. The Amendment reads:

:''Nothing in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or on public funds, or vary the amount or incidence of or otherwise alter any such charge in any manner, or affect the assessment, levying, administration or application of any money raised by any such charge.''

The House of Commons then amend the bill by removing the above clause. Therefore, the privilege of the Commons is not violated as they, not the Lords, have approved the tax or public expenditure.

== Delegated legislation ==

Many Acts of Parliament authorise the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs) as a more flexible method of setting out and amending the precise details for new arrangements, such as rules and regulations.  This delegated power is given either to the Queen in Council, a Minister of the Crown, or to other named office holders.  An Act may empower the Government to make a Statutory Instrument and lay it before both Houses, the SI to take legal effect if approved by a simple vote in each House; or in other cases, if neither House objects within a set time.  In theory, Parliament does not lose control over such statutory instruments when delegating the power to make them, while being saved the necessity to debate and vote upon even quite trivial changes, unless members wish to raise objections.

== Privilege ==

Each House has a body of rights that it asserts, or which are conferred by statute, with the aim of being allowed to carry out its duties without interference. For example, members of both Houses have freedom of speech during parliamentary debates; what they have said cannot be questioned in any place outside Parliament, and so a speech made in Parliament cannot constitute slander.  These rights are collectively referred to as ''Parliamentary Privilege''.

Both Houses claim to determine their own privileges, and are acknowledged by the courts as having the authority to control their own proceedings, as well as to discipline members abusing the rules. Furthermore, each House is the sole judge of the qualifications of its members. Collectively, each House has the right of access to the Sovereign. Individually, members must be left free to attend Parliament. Therefore, the police are regularly ordered to maintain free access in the neighbouring streets, and members cannot be called on to serve on a jury or be subpoenaed as a witness while Parliament is in session. (Arrest for crime is still possible, but the relevant House must be notified of the same.) Parliament has the power to punish ''contempt of Parliament'', that is, violation of the privileges and rules of a House. Any decisions made in this regard are final and are cannot be appealed to any court. The usual modern penalty for contempt is a reprimand, or brief imprisonment in the precincts of the House, but historically large fines have been imposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Haskell is a standardized functional programming language with [[w:Functional programming#Strict_versus_non-strict_evaluation|non-strict]] semantics. Haskell features include support for recursive functions, datatypes, pattern matching, and list comprehensions. By combining these features, functions that would be difficult to write in a procedural programming language are almost trivial to implement in Haskell. The language is, as of 2011, the functional language on and in which the most research is being performed.&lt;ref&gt;Based on crude Google Scholar &quot;since 2010&quot; queries – Haskell &quot;functional programming&quot;: 2220, Scheme &quot;functional programming&quot;: 1400, ML &quot;functional programming&quot;: 1020, Lisp &quot;functional programming&quot;: 779, OCaml &quot;functional programming&quot;: 316, Scala &quot;functional programming&quot;: 290, XSLT &quot;functional programming&quot;:93, Clojure &quot;functional programming&quot;: 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The examples below give a taste of Haskell, oriented toward those familiar with other programming languages.

== Examples ==
The classic definition of the [[Wikipedia: Factorial|factorial]] function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  fac 0 = 1 
  fac n = n * fac (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

A cute definition using Haskell's built-in list notation and the standard &lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  fac n = product [1..n]
&lt;/source&gt;

Both definitions above should compile into the ''same'' efficient code via a smart compiler using equational reasoning.


A naive implementation of a function which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  fib 0 = 0
  fib 1 = 1 
  fib n = fib (n - 2) + fib (n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

A function which returns a list of the Fibonacci numbers in linear time: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
&lt;/source&gt;

The previous function defines an infinite list, which is possible because of [[#lazy evaluation|lazy evaluation]]. 

One could implement &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; as: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  fib n = fibs !! n
&lt;/source&gt;
(&lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; is an operator which gets the nth element of a list).


The Quicksort alogrithm can be expressed in Haskell concisely as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  qsort []     = [] 
  qsort (x:xs) = qsort [y | y&lt;-xs, y &lt; x ] ++ [x] ++
                 qsort [y | y&lt;-xs, y &gt;= x]
&lt;/source&gt;                                                                         
(note that true quicksort sorts in-place but Haskell's lists are immutable so have to be copied around.)


Nonskipping stable mergesort is
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  mgsort less [] = []
  mgsort less xs = head $ until (null.tail) pairs [[x] | x &lt;- xs]
    where 
      pairs (x:y:xs)    = merge x y : pairs xs
      pairs xs          = xs
      merge (x:xs) (y:ys)
            | less y x  = y : merge (x:xs) ys 
            | True      = x : merge  xs (y:ys)
      merge  xs     ys  = xs ++ ys
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;('''.''')&lt;/code&gt; is the function composition operator &lt;code&gt; (h . g) x = h (g x) &lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(\x -&gt; ...)&lt;/code&gt; is a lambda expression (a nameless function), and the predefined function &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;'''until''' ''cond'' ''fun''&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;nbsp;repeatedly applies a function ''fun'' &amp;nbsp;until a condition ''cond'' &amp;nbsp;is met; with &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; keyword introducing the local definitions showcasing the use of patterns (with &lt;code&gt;('''x:xs''')&lt;/code&gt; matching a non-empty list with the head &lt;code&gt;'''x'''&lt;/code&gt; and tail &lt;code&gt;'''xs'''&lt;/code&gt;) and guards.


The Hamming numbers sequence is just 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  hamm = 1 : map (2*) hamm `union` 
               (map (3*) hamm `union` map (5*) hamm)
  -- a union of two ordered lists:
  union (x:xs) (y:ys) = case (compare x y) of
          LT -&gt; x : union  xs  (y:ys)
          EQ -&gt; x : union  xs     ys 
          GT -&gt; y : union (x:xs)  ys 
&lt;/source&gt;

using sections (partially applied operators) and the built-in function &lt;code&gt;'''map'''&lt;/code&gt; working with lists, whether finite or not, due to lazy (i.e. ''by-need'' ) evaluation. Also, enclosing function's name into back-quotes turns it into infix operator so that sub-expressions are automatically formed as if by placing parentheses appropriately, forming a nested expression, as in 2+3+5 --&gt; ((2+3)+5) ; and a comment line is introduced by two dashes.


Finally, the infinite list of prime numbers, also using the above &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt; function, is: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
  primes = 2 : gaps 3 (join [[p*p,p*p+2*p..] | p &lt;- primes'])
   where
    primes' = 3 : gaps 5 (join [[p*p,p*p+2*p..] | p &lt;- primes'])
    join  ((x:xs):t)        = x : union xs (join (pairs t))
    pairs ((x:xs):ys:t)     = (x : union xs ys) : pairs t
    gaps k xs@(x:t) | k==x  = gaps (k+2) t 
                    | True  = k : gaps (k+2) xs 
&lt;/source&gt;

Here primes are defined corecursively as gaps between the composite numbers, i.e. the primes' multiples.

== It's not just for quicksort! ==

Haskell is also used to build &quot;real world&quot; programs, including [[../GUI/|graphical]] or web user interfaces.  To get a taste of Haskell in the real world, check out [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Web/Frameworks web frameworks in Haskell] and [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_in_industry Haskell in industry] articles on the Haskell wiki, or [http://www.darcs.net darcs], an advanced revision control system written in Haskell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Proteins''' are a primary constituent of living things and one of the chief classes of molecules studied in biochemistry. Proteins provide most of the molecular machinery of cells. Many are enzymes or subunits of enzymes. Other proteins play structural or mechanical roles, such as those that form the struts and joints of the cytoskeleton. Each protein is linear polymers built of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids amino acids]. Proteins are also nutrient sources for organisms that do not produce their own energy from sunlight and/or are unable to fix nitrogen. Proteins can interact with one another and with others molecules to form complexes.

'''Appetizers''' are dishes served before a meal or at a cocktail party or other informal occasion.  They are often referred to as ''snacks'' or ''hors d' oeuvres''.  

In general, appetizers are intended to be eaten by hand in a bite or two, or at least be capable of being cut with the side of a fork, rather than a knife.  Since appetizers are a customary course in French and Italian cooking, among other styles of cooking, it is fairly easy to find haute cuisine recipes for appetizers.  

Arguably, one fundamental, unspoken, purpose of appetizers, especially in a restaurant setting, is to keep hungry people fed until the main dish is served.  

In a home setting, people who might have trouble getting the main meal on the table in a timely fashion on a particular day, such as a holiday, might especially want to have planned in advance to serve an appetizer of some type or sort.

One of the most fundamental appetizer categories in modern times, ignoring haute cuisine, is the ''dip'' and ''carrier'' combination, of which the variations are endless.

----

== Wiederholung ==
Lesson 5 is a review (''Wiederholung'') lesson to summarize the German language lessons presented in Lessons 1 through 4. You should, then, return to [[German/Lesson_1|Lektion 1]] and review (that is, reread) each of the four lessons back up to this point.  For a more advanced course, you might now incorporate each of the advanced lessons into this &quot;review&quot; process.  That is: review Lesson 1, then do Lesson 1A, review Lesson 2, then do Lesson 2A, etc.
----

== Parts of Speech and Word Order ==
Sentences are composed of parts that perform specific functions. You have been introduced to most (but not all) the major parts of speech: pronouns/nouns, verbs, and adjectives; and how these are expressed in German compared with English.  Consider the following:

'''''Ich brauche Wurst und Käse'''''
:I (pronoun as subject) need (verb) sausage and cheese (nouns as direct objects)
'''''Haben sie zu viel Arbeit?'''''
:Have (verb) they (pronoun subject) too much (adjectives) work (noun direct object)?

Word order in a simple sentence follows that used in English. Subject and verb are reversed to form a question. In English, but not in German, the question sentence could also be stated (and, in fact, occurs more often in the US) as 'Do they have too much work?'

== Nouns ==
Nouns are words that typically occur in sentences as either subjects (performers of some action) or objects (recipients of some action). Most nouns are the name of either a &quot;person, place, or thing&quot; and, in German, are always capitalized.  Every noun in German has an &quot;assigned&quot; gender (&lt;u&gt;masculine&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;feminine&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;neuter&lt;/u&gt;), and we learn each noun with its nominative case, definite article (''der'', ''die'', ''das'', respectively) in order to also learn that gender.  Thus, a ''Vokabeln'' section for nouns is presented thusly:
 der Anhang, die Anhänge      appendix, appendices      (singular and plural)
 die Brücke                   bridge
 der Freund, die Freunde      friend, friends           (singular and plural)
 das Gespräch, die Gespräche  conversation, conversations
 die Gram'''mat'''ik                grammar                   (note irregular stress) 
 die Lek'''tion'''                  lesson                    (note irregular stress)
 die Straße                   street

Can someone guide me on how to enter letters in the Devanagari script? I can probably cover some of the basic grammar, having studied Hindi for 10 years now! [[User:Gokul madhavan|Gokul madhavan]] 13:45, 14 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Well, I'm going to bed now. :) I just wanted to say that I know the book looks like a mess but I know what I'm doing and it's gonna be great. :)

== Writing lessons ==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Hindi step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Hindi than in English), common personal names, Hindi words that have entered English, English words that are used in Hindi, words that both Hindi and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Hindi, I'd be glad to help you, even though I don't know it yet (I'd learn it though and I have learned a variety of foreign alphabets already). Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 16:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].

== Transliteration scheme ==

This book uses a ton of different [[w:Transliteration|transliteration]] schemes. It's confusing and it looks like a total mess. I suggest that [[w:ISO 15919|ISO 15919]] be used throughout the page. I'll look into doing some machine transliteration myself if I can find the proper software. [[User:Tasnu Arakun|Tasnu Arakun]] ([[User talk:Tasnu Arakun|talk]]) 18:24, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

== In e-book/pdf format ==

There are tons of free online lessons on Hindi available but I haven't ever found one that is downloadable format. So maybe we can produce the Hindi Wikibook in a pdf format. I can do the compilation and editing and producing part. And the German wikibook has a great structure that could be followed. We'd need more content as well.[[User:Shyboy16|Shyboy16]] ([[User talk:Shyboy16|talk]]) 10:14, 14 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

&lt;h2&gt;Strong Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;
This is the strong noun A-Stem section, there are other kinds of strong nouns but we will deal with those later.


&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Masculine A-Stem Nouns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Gothic has strong and weak nouns (along with strong and weak adjectives!).  There are many stems or different declensions within each class of nouns.  Here I will show you a-stem nouns.  There are three genders in Gothic:  masculine, feminine, neuter.  These are not always sex-based as in English.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ A-Stem Nouns
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -s
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -os
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -ans
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | -is
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -e
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -a
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -am
|}
&lt;p&gt;
Now onto the masculine article (definite).  Gothic has no indefinite article (a, an) but only a definite (the) which has masculine, feminine, and neuter forms.
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ Masculine Article
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | sa
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thai
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thana
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thans
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | this
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thize
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thamma
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thaim
|}
&lt;p&gt;For a while here I'm going to be basically throwing you &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of tables.  But here I'll explain the cases:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nominative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the subject of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accusative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the direct object of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genitive&lt;/b&gt;:  marks possession
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the indirect object of a sentence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Strong Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;
This is the strong noun A-Stem section, there are other kinds of strong nouns but we will deal with those later.


&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Masculine A-Stem Nouns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Gothic has strong and weak nouns (along with strong and weak adjectives!).  There are many stems or different declensions within each class of nouns.  Here I will show you a-stem nouns.  There are three genders in Gothic:  masculine, feminine, neuter.  These are not always sex-based as in English.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ A-Stem Nouns
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -s
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -os
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -ans
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | -is
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -e
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -a
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -am
|}
&lt;p&gt;
Now onto the masculine article (definite).  Gothic has no indefinite article (a, an) but only a definite (the) which has masculine, feminine, and neuter forms.
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ Masculine Article
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | sa
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thai
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thana
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thans
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | this
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thize
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thamma
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thaim
|}
&lt;p&gt;For a while here I'm going to be basically throwing you &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of tables.  But here I'll explain the cases:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nominative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the subject of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accusative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the direct object of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genitive&lt;/b&gt;:  marks possession
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the indirect object of a sentence.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rawuza. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rawuza~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Finding your family village name: 
You must find your ancestor’s community's name before you will be able to locate ancestral records that were recorded in the &quot;old country.&quot; This will usually require beginning research in the U.S., or whatever your home country, to determine the correct community.

First, begin with yourself. Gather everything you know about your own origins: where you were born, what religion you were raised in, your own civil and religious records. Then go back one generation at a time, looking for all of the available information you have. Where did your parents live? Where were they born? Gather their records. Sometimes even the smallest detail can lead you on the path to discovery. At times, you will not be able to locate a particular record for a parent or grandparent. If that is the case, look for records of their siblings. Often those will have the information you seek.

=Records to Search=

==Family documents:==

Get out those old shoe boxes, start reading and really look at the details. Old letters often contain family connections, dates, locations and hints to lead you in the right direction. The same applies to old photographs which may have names and dates, or the photograpy studio or photographer’s name. Address books, postcards and, of course, family Bibles contain information and clues. Deeds, marriage certificates, naturalization papers, social security papers, Wills, and even insurance policies can be sources for information. I found one great-great grandmother’s address in Poland in an old personal address book which was about to be thrown out when her granddaughter passed on.

Contact your relatives. Many families are large, and an aunt, great-uncle, or distant cousin may have family documents you were not even aware existed. Begin with the one who was closest to your ancestor or cared for them before they died. Often those relatives end up with the ancestor’s documents.

An important note about family Bibles: in most of the older Bibles, the family information is listed about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way toward the back of the book (unlike modern Bibles where this information is listed in the first few pages).

==Public Records==

Public records in general present some problems. Families changed their names; names were misspelled due to language barriers; phonetic spellings were used by clerks; different pronunciation of letters from one language to the next, typographical errors and poor penmanship created transcription errors, among others. Some records are missing due to misfiling, or were destroyed by fire and flood. This is as true in the U.S. as it is in other countries; the 1890 Federal Census being a prime example.

===Vital records===

Birth, marriage and death records are generally located in the county seat in which the event happened (in the USA, other arrangements apply in the rest of the world). The cost of those records vary from county to county, and often depend upon whether you ask for a certified copy of the record or just a genealogical copy (generally cost less). 

Most U.S. counties can be accessed on the web as follows:
www.co.”countyname”.”state two letter abbreviation”.us/ (omit the quotation marks in your search. If that doesn’t work, just do a web search with your favorite search engine. The information for obtaining the records should be on the county site. In the U.S. this information can be found on the USGenWeb site: http://www.usgenweb.org/. There is also a World GenWeb site that may help for researching in other countries: http://www.worldgenweb.org/.

Another source to find vital records by state in the U.S. can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/howto/w2w/w2welcom.htm. Some of these state sites give the year in which the state began to maintain the records, the locations to find earlier records, and refer to databases which are also searchable on the web.

===SSDI===

The Social Security Death Index is available free on line at  http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/  Scroll down a bit and just put the name in the search box, and a list of persons with that name will come up. The Social Security Death Index is generally updated every three months.

When a person is found, the name, date of birth, date of death, last residence, the state in which the number was issued, and the number itself is shown. If you wish to obtain a copy of the original Social Security Application, you can click on the SS-5 letter link. The following information was requested on the application: Name, current address, birthdate, birthplace (generally City and State, place of employment and business address (if applicable) and names of parents (mother’s full maiden name).

Social Security is constantly updating this file.  If the person for whom you are looking recently died, they probably won't be here.  Give it a few months before you check again.

===Obituaries===

Published obituaries can be a valuable source of information. Often parents’ names, spouses, children and surviving siblings are shown. This is especially valuable if you are unable to locate information on your ancestor and don’t have the female siblings’ married names. Generally, if listed at all, it is with their then present married name, giving you another piece of information to allow you to continue your search.

Obituaries may be found in the “morgue” of the local newspapers, historical libraries in various cities and counties, and some public libraries have film or online databases for obituaries, marriages and death notices.

===Alien Registration===

Alien registration was required beginning in 1940 for resident aliens in the USA. The records can be obtained for the years 1940-1944 from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
http://www.bcis.gov/graphics/aboutus/history/ImmRecs/AREG.htm

===Voter Registration===

Most U.S. counties and states keep voter registration records. The states’ records are generally kept in the office of the Secretary of State. You can check with the county or state departments for information. Additionally, the LDS has filmed numerous voter registration indexes for various areas of the United States. You can check their Family History Library Catalog on line to see if your location has been filmed. http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/FHLC/frameset_fhlc.asp


===WWI Draft Registration===
In 1917 and 1918 males old enough to serve in the military were required to register for the draft, whether citizen or alien. See more detailed information on Ancestry [http://images.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=list&amp;cat=WW1 WWI Draft Information at Ancestry.com]

The LDS has compiled the WWI Draft Registration on microfiche arranged by state of residence, and you can contact your local Family History Center to view the registration records. Information is available at 
[http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=titledetails&amp;titleno=995075&amp;disp=Register+of+World+War+I+draft+registrati%20%20&amp;columns=*,0,0 WWII Draft Info at FamilySearch.org]

===United States Census===

The U.S. census is an excellent source of information, although it won’t usually give you the town of origin, it will give the country and occasionally the Province, such as “Prussian Posen” or “Russian Warsawa”. Keep in mind that the reference to “Posen” and “Warsawa” in these records generally refer to the Province and not the city.

Remember that these records are organized by family group.  You will generally find parents and children, but sometime will also find grandparents and even great-grandparents living with their descendants.  This information is also valuable because it provides a fairly accurate view of where the family (including siblings) were located when the individal census was taken - given several, this can show how the family members came and went in a household.

Census films may be obtained at your local Family History Center of the LDS (see the Family History Library search page listed under voter registration above) or through the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) http://www.archives.gov/research_room/genealogy/research_topics/census_records.html.

These records are also available on line through the paid genealogical subscription sites, www.Ancestry.com and www.Genealogy.com.

===Immigration records===

There are a number of sources for ship manifests, and their availability varies with the time and port to which your ancestor immigrated. The most well-known is the Ellis Island database on line, and if your ancestors immigrated between 1892 and 1924 to the port of New York, you may find that information free online: http://www.ellisisland.org/sign/index.asp?ACT=LL&amp;login_targ=none. You must register to use the site, but it is without charge. 

There have been some problems with the Ellis Island database indexing and linking, and the usual problems with misspellings and transcription errors. Another site which can help with such problems is the Stephen P. Morse website which gives search options not available from the Ellis Island site, and a way in which to find “missing manifests.” http://stevemorse.org/

For more information on Ellis Island records, go to the Jewish GenWeb site:
http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/eidbfaq.html

The LDS has filmed numerous passengers records for many ports, and have some ports indexed so that you can find your ancestor’s name and arrival date before you order the actual manifest. Again, you can check what records they hold at http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/FHLC/frameset_fhlc.asp

NARA also has many manifests for U.S. ports: http://www.archives.gov/research_room/genealogy/immigrant_arrivals/passenger_records.html

Additional passenger arrival information can be found on the following sites:

An extensive reference for immigration to Australia, Canada, Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world is found on Mary’s Genealogy Treasures at: http://www.telusplanet.net/public/mtoll/immigr.htm.

Declarations of Intent or Citizenship Applications are generally found in the local county court of residence prior to the Federal government taking over the naturalization process. A guide to finding these records is found at: http://www.germanroots.com/naturalizationrecords.html

There are some free and paid searchable naturalization databases on the web for the U.S. and Canada at: http://www.germanroots.com/naturalization.html

These are often harder to obtain and study than other documents, but they may hold clues, if not outright references to former residence.

===Probate records===

Again, these may hold clues, if not outright references to former residence.

==Religious records==

Baptismal records and marriage applications kept by the churches often have parents’ names and place of birth. If you cannot find your ancestor’s batismal certificate, you may have be able to find a sibling’s record and locate the information indirectly.

Catholic records are generally kept in the parish in which the ceremony was performed. If a parish has closed, the records may have been sent to the Diocese or Archdiocese archives, or to the nearest church still in existence. Many local parishes are now on line in the U.S. To locate a specific church by town or city and even by foreign Language masses, this site is very helpful:  [http://www.masstimes.org/ASP/ http://www.masstimes.org/ASP/ ]. There is even a scrollable map so you can find a parish nearest your ancestors’ home.

There is no set web address for the Archidiocese in the U.S., but a web search for “catholic archdiocese” and the city or state will generally get you good results. For a Diocese, you can use a similar search. Many have information about how to obtain genealogical records.

The Evangelical(Lutheran) church of the U.S. has genealogical assistance. Their website is: [http://web.archive.org/web/20030608115537/http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html]. Genealogical information is at the top right.

Additionally, the Lutheran World Federation has information and links to their member churches throughout the world. Just click on “member churches” and scroll down to the area in which you are searching: [http://web.archive.org/web/20030608115537/http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html] .

Jewish records: Jewish Temples did not (and do not) keep records as did the Christian churches. These are family records, and were kept in the family papers. Some of the mohels who performed the bris mila kept records, but they were his personal records and would be with his family documents. Of course, many of these were lost through war and the holocaust, but there are still many ways one can search for their Jewish ancestors. Jewis GenWeb has an excellent guide to searching for family and ancestors: [http://www.jewishgen.org http://www.jewishgen.org ].</text>

Research success is more than knowing where to look. In addition to data about your family, you'll want to have maps, background information about places, material about resources and how to use them. It won't take long for you to gather so much information that you can't keep track of it all. A systematic method for handling data is crucial. A good system has these qualities:
*All materials are stored securely and redundantly
*System is easily to understand, use and maintain
*Provides the ability to transport relevant data to research sites
*Facilitates the future publication / distribution of collected information

Decide how you will store irreplaceable materials (original documents, photos). Always copy or scan originals and store the originals in a secure location (safety deposit box, safe, firesafe box, etc.) Label each newly acquired document with a source description and an ID. You may find it easiest to just number each document sequentially. It becomes almost impossible to know in advance how to organize an ID system that handles all future acquisitions. Refer to this document ID when extracting data from the document into your research system (binders, software, etc.) Most genealogy software allows you to keep a list of sources. Use this ID to file the documents, or enter you own ID as part of each source notation.

Unless you can always bring a notebook computer to every research site, you should use a binder to display the current state of your research for reference. You'll need to know what you already know as you look for new information.

A new option for those that use computers for recording their research, you can use a USB thumb drive/flashdrive/memory stick and load the entire Personal Ancestral File (PAF) program on the drive along with your database and access it at any computer that has USB capabilities.  Other computer programs may be able to do the same thing, but I am not sure.  PAF is a free computer download from www.familysearch.org that has documentaion and multimedia abilities.  The PAF program is a windows based program, but can be run on a MAC if a pc-emulator is used.</text>

When starting genealogy, you should ask yourself what you want to accomplish with your research.

Are you primarily curious about your ancestors and want to see what information is easily available? Do you want to devote your life to uncovering and preserving the past? 

What parts of your family do you wish to research? Some people prefer to focus on a few lines and mostly ignore the lines that marry in. Some people collect every person that can be tied in, including every umpteenth cousin many times removed. What about adoptions? Which line do you research? If you have a surname to research that isn't very common, will you research anyone with that name, whether there is any known connection to you or not (&quot;one-name study&quot;)?

As time goes on, your scope may change. But try to determine at the beginning what you wish to research in order to avoid re-doing previous work.</text>

Working backwards from yourself to your most distant ancestors is a critical method in tracing one's own ancestry. Although it requires discipline, it is extremely important to systematically work backwards in time through the record trail, exhausting all record sources for each person, before working on their parents and grandparents. Without working systematically backwards, it becomes more and more easy to miss a crucial piece of evidence, or to rely on a hypothesis or guess as the foundation for later efforts. Use of a checklist for every person you are researching can make this methodical task easier.

In order to properly work backwards, one should use evidence in one generation regarding the previous generation as your foundation.

Birth, marriage, and death certificates, both civil and ecclesiastic, often name, or even describe the occupation of the bride or groom's father and mother. Many times the certificate's subject's place of birth is given, and sometimes the place of the parents birth as well. For example, old civil birth records (1865-1910) in New York City, found at the Municipal Archives, have a field for Father, Father's Place of Birth, Mother (with maiden name), and Mother's Place of Birth. Similarly, Old ecclesiastic records from the villages around Kaiserslautern in southern Germany often describe the fathers of both groom and bride, the fathers' residences, and occupations. Less often in the oldest records, the mother is named. However, using either record, one would certainly establish a solid footing for looking into the previous generation.

However, a single record, such as a birth, is not enough if further records are available. If one readily find the civil birth record, it can serve as a guide for the location of the same person's ecclesiastic baptismal, christening, or circumcision records, which may confirm, conflict, or expand upon the information in the civil record.

Further research should be conducted upon your subject, however. Marriage and death certificates and records, both civil and church, land records, coroner's reports, voters rolls, census returns, and numerous other pieces can add to your understanding of a person's parents and their history.

In many cases, you will find information about several different generations at the same time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we will look at certain mathematical processes which deal with the fundamental property of '''''recursion''''' at its core.

== What is recursion? ==
Recursion, simply put, is the process of describing an action in terms of itself. This may seem a bit strange to understand, but once it &quot;clicks&quot; it can be an extremely powerful way of expressing certain ideas.

Let's look at some examples to make things clearer.

=== Exponents ===
When we calculate an exponent, say ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, we multiply ''x'' by itself three times. If we have ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, we multiply ''x'' by itself five times.

However, if we want a recursive definition of exponents, we need to define the action of taking exponents in terms of itself. So we note that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; for example, is the same as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; ''x''. But what is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;? ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; ''x''. We can continue in this fashion up to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=1. 
What can we say in general then? Recursively, 
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' &amp;times; (''x''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
with the fact that
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=1

We need the second fact because the definitions fail to make sense if we continue with negative exponents, and we would continue indefinitely!

=== Recursive definitions===
Reducing the problem into same problem by smaller inputs.
for example
             a power n
             2 power 4
    the recursion(smaller inputs) of this function is = 2.2.2.2.1
    for this we declare some recursive definitions 
   a=2
   n=4
   f(0)=1
   f(1)=2
   f(2)=2
   f(3)=2
   f(4)=2
   for this recursion we form a formula f(x)= a.f(n-1)
   by putting these samaller values we get the same answer.

== Recurrence relations ==
In mathematics, we can create recursive ''functions'', which depend on its previous values to create new ones. We often call these ''recurrence relations''.

For example, we can have the function :''f''(''x'')=2''f''(''x''-1), with ''f''(1)=1
If we calculate some of ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s values, we get
:1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

However, this sequence of numbers ''should'' look familiar to you! These values are the same as the function 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, with x = 0, 1, and so on.

What we have done is found a ''non-recursive'' function with the same values as the ''recursive'' function. We call this ''solving'' the recurrence relation.

=== Linear recurrence relations ===
We will look especially at a certain kind of recurrence relation, known as ''linear''.

Here is an example of a linear recurrence relation:
: ''f''(''x'')=3''f''(''x''-1)+12''f''(''x''-2), with f(0)=1 and f(1)=1

Instead of writing ''f''(''x''), we often use the notation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''a''(''n''), but these notations are completely interchangeable. 

Note that a linear recurrence relation should always have stopping cases, otherwise we would not be able to calculate ''f''(2), for example, since what would ''f''(1) be if we did not define it? These stopping cases when we talk about linear recurrence relations are known as ''initial conditions''.

In general, a linear recurrence relation is in the form
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;  + ... +  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-j&lt;/sub&gt;
: with ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)=''u''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; as initial conditions.
The number ''j'' is important, and it is known as the ''order'' of the linear recurrence relation. Note we always need at least ''j'' initial conditions for the recurrence relation to make sense.

Recall in the previous section we saw that we can find a nonrecursive function (a ''solution'') that will take on the same values as the recurrence relation itself. Let's see how we can solve some linear recurrence relations - we can do so in a very systematic way, but we need to establish a few theorems first.

==== Solving linear recurrence relations ====
===== Sum of solutions =====
This theorem says that:
: If ''f''(''n'') and ''g''(''n'') are both solutions to a linear recurrence relation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;+''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;, their sum is a solution also.

This is true, since if we rearrange the recurrence to have ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;=0
And we know  that ''f''(''n'') and ''g''(''n'') are solutions, so we have, on substituting into the recurrence
: ''f''(''n'')-''Af''(''n''-1)-''Bf''(n-2)=0
: ''g''(''n'')-''Ag''(''n''-1)-''Bg''(n-2)=0

If we substitute the sum ''f''(''n'')+''g''(''n'') into the recurrence, we obtain
: (''f''(''n'')+''g''(''n''))-''A''(''f''(''n''-1)+''g''(''n''-1))-''B''((''f''(''n''-2)+''g''(''n''-2))=0

On expanding out, we have
:''f''(''n'')-''Af''(''n''-1)-''Bf''(n-2)+''g''(''n'')-''Ag''(''n''-1)-''Bg''(n-2)
But using the two facts we established first, this is the same as
:0+0=0

So ''f''(''n'')+''g''(''n'') is indeed a solution to the recurrence.

=====General solution=====
The next theorem states that:
: Say we have a second-order linear recurrence relation, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;=0, with supplied initial conditions. 
&lt;BR&gt;Then &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is a solution to the recurrence, where ''r'' is a solution of the quadratic equation
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-A''x''-B=0
which we call the ''characteristic equation''.
&lt;br&gt;We guess (it doesn't matter why, accept it for now) that &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; may be a solution. We can prove that this  is a solution IF (and only if) it solves the characteristic equation ;&lt;br&gt;

We substitute &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (r not zero) into the recurrence to get
:&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-''A''&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;-''B''&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;=0
then factor out by &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;, the term farthest on the right
:&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;(''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-''B'')=0
and we know that ''r'' isn't zero, so ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; can never be zero. So ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-B must be zero, and so &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''r'' a solution of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-''B''=0, will indeed be a solution of the linear recurrence. Please note that we can easily generalize this fact to higher order linear recurrence relations.

&lt;!-- this next bit could be removed?? does it help anyone? --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt; Where did this come from? Why does it work (beyond a rote proof)?  Here's a more intuitive (but less mathematically rigorous) explanation. &lt;/B&gt; &lt;br&gt;  Solving the ''characteristic equation'' finds a function that satisfies the linear recurrence relation, and conveniently doesn't require the summation of all n terms to find the ''n''th one.&lt;br&gt;
We want :  a function F(n) such that F(n) =  A * F(n-1) + B * F(n-2) &lt;br&gt;
We solve :  x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = A* x  + B, and call the solution(s) ''r''.  There can be more than one value of r, like in the example below! &lt;br&gt;
We get :  a function F(n)  = r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;  that satisfies F(n) = A * F(n-1) + B * F(n-2)&lt;br&gt;
Let's check: Does  r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = A*r&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; + B*r&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; ? Divide both sides by r&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; and you get r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = A*r + B, which must be true because r is a solution to x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = A* x  + B &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;!-- this is bad. substituting works much better. Is not possible to prove it this way --&gt;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;B&gt;Why does ''a''*r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; also satisfy the recurrence relation? &lt;/B&gt; If F(n)is a solution to the recurrence relation, so is F(n)+ F(n), based on the &quot;Sum of Solutions&quot; theorem above.  One can then take that sum, 2*F(n), and add another F(n) to get 3*F(n), and it will still satisfy the recurrence (and so on...).  Thus any whole number multiple of F(n), such as ''a''*F(n) will satisfy the recurrence relation (''a'' can also be any fraction and probably any real number at all, but I'm too lazy to adapt the current explanation).  Because r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; satisfies the recurrence, so does ''a''*r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.  

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because we have a second order recurrence, the general solution is the sum of two solutions, corresponding to the two roots of the characteristic equation. Say these are r and s. The the general solution is  C(r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(s&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) where C,D are some constants. We find them using the two (there must be two so that we can find C and D) starting values of the relation. Substituting these into the general solution will give two equtions which we can (hopefully) solve. 
&lt;!-- 
for complex nums: CE has roots r = s \pm it = re^i\theta/GS is A(re^i\th)+B(re^-i\th), A, B in C|. if A=B*, r^n(a cos n\th+B sin n\th), a, b in |R
--&gt;

====Example====
Let's work through an example to see how we can use the above theorems to solve linear recurrence relations. Examine the function ''a''(''n'') given here
: ''a''(''n'')=''a''(''n''-1)+2''a''(''n''-2)
The characteristic equation of this recurrence relation is
: ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''r''-2 = 0  from above, as A=1 and B=2&lt;br&gt;
i.e. (''r''-2)(''r''+1)=0 which has roots 2, -1.

So the general solution is C(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(-1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.


To find C and D for this specific case, we need two starting values, let's say ''a''(''1'') = 0 and ''a''(''2'') = 2.  These give a system of two equations&lt;br&gt; 0 = C(2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(-1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;br&gt; 2 = C(2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Solving these two equations yields: C = 1/3 , D = 2/3, so the solution is 1/3*(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)+2/3*(-1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Presentation==

With the breathing reality check, you check if you can breathe underwater or with your fingers tightly sealing your nose. Always remember to concentrate on the act. When you seal your nose, don't release the air pressure when you're done with the test.

As well as doing this regularly, you could also do it every time you go swimming.


NOTE: I have had personal experience with the breathing technique. I have used it numerous times. Only until recently it has worked perfectly fine for inducing lucid dreams; however, within the last two weeks, every time I try to plug my nose and breathe in, it doesn't work even in the dream world! It may be because I do the test so often that my expectation of the result carries into the dream world, therefore giving me the result I expect no matter if I'm dreaming or not. But, I do not see why this would happen since I constantly question the reality of the world around me hoping and expecting to be in a dream. My advice is to have a variety of techniques down in your mind and test two or three of them. Sometimes, my breathing AND hand checks don't work any more! I have found that text and digital clocks are the only solid way to know for sure since I seem to have exhausted the ability to use the techniques relating to my body.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I realised that the situation was getting a bit strange and did the breathing reality check. I found that I could breathe through my nose and immediately searched for a mirror...
* I did the breathing reality check out of routine. Somehow I was uncertain whether I was dreaming - it seemed I hadn't sealed my nose tightly and I could still breathe through it. I pressed tightly and still managed to breathe. I was convinced. I went outside...
* I was pushed down into the water. I almost drowned before I tried to breathe, then I suddenly found I could breathe underwater. As I came up to the surface I realised that I was therefore dreaming.
* While using the WILD technique, I thought it might be time to perform a reality check. As I couldn't decide which one to use, I suddenly felt myself sinking through my bed. Eventually, I fell through and fell into the water. I immediately found out that I was able to breathe through my nose and realised that I was dreaming.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* My first attempt at reality checking; I found myself in a pool, and could breathe; for a moment I was lucid but then I decided that I could breathe because the pool had no chlorine, and I went on without lucidity.
* I did the reality check out of habit and I could not breathe with my nose closed.
* I breathed through a shut nose, and a dream character said that you just thought it worked. I continued on non-lucidly.
* My nose was quite greasy, so I couldn't seal my nose properly... I was breathing, but I thought it was pretty normal, as my nose wasn't shut, so no lucidity came.
* I did the breathing reality check. It didn't work. I said, &quot;that's odd - my reality check failed!&quot; I kept doing it until it worked. Only when I woke up, I realised that I just needed to do a reality check and then I would realise that I was dreaming.
* I was taking a hallucinogenic drug in my dream and my drug guide told me that I should feel as if I'm in a dream, therefore the reality checks should prove true even though I'm not really dreaming. When I woke up I soon realized I actually was.
* I tried breathing underwater at the beach when I though I was asleep, inhaled a mouthful of water, and had to be rescued by lifeguards.

==Presentation==

Also called the flying reality check; with the jumping reality check, you jump up and see if you float back down. Also try these techniques:

* While driving, try to pull the steering wheel up. You should start flying into the air if you are dreaming.
* If you are almost asleep or not sure if you are dreaming yet, try to levitate above your bed without moving or opening your eyes. This will help you continue to fall asleep if you are not dreaming, or will tell if you are dreaming already. 
* If you are riding in any vehicle, bicycle, etc, try to make it fly.



==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I did the jumping reality check but I just went down normally. I continued in my dream...
* I did the jumping reality check and floated back down. I asked a dream character about this. He said that gravity was decreasing due to global warming. I accepted this weird explanation and continued in my dream.
* I did the jumping reality check and found that I could float about a foot off the ground. It's like the sensation of standing on a balloon, except it's nothing but air. This happens all the time in my dreams, but apparently I believe that I can really do this, and the dream continues nonlucidly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This page is an addendum to [[Calculus/Formal Definition of the Limit]].''

Recall the definition of a limit:

A number ''L'' is the limit of a function ''f(x)'' as ''x'' approaches ''c'' if and only if ''for all'' numbers &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists a number &amp;delta; &gt; 0 such that

&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
whenever&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - c \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, given a number &amp;epsilon; we must construct a number &amp;delta; such that assuming&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - c \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we can prove&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
moreover, this proof must work for ''all'' values of &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0.

Note:  this definition is not constructive -- it does not tell you how to ''find'' the limit ''L'', only how to check whether a particular value is indeed the limit.  We use the informal definition of the limit, experience with similar problems, or theorems (L'Hopital's rule, for example), to determine the value, and then can prove the correctness of this value using the formal definition.

Example 1:  Suppose we want to find the limit of ''f(x)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5 as ''x'' approaches ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9.  We know that the limit ''L'' is 9+5=14, and desire to prove this.

We choose &amp;delta; = &amp;epsilon; (this will be explained later).  Then, since we assume&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 9 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we can show&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| (x + 5) - 14 \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 9 \right| \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \delta \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
which is what we wanted to prove.

We chose &amp;delta; by working backwards from the formula we are trying to prove:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
In this case, we desire to prove&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 9 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 9 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
so the easiest way to prove it is by choosing &amp;delta; = &amp;epsilon;.  This example, however, is too easy to adequately explain how to choose &amp;delta; in general.  Lets try something harder:

Example 2:
Prove that the limit of ''f(x)'' = ''x''&amp;sup2; - 9 as ''x'' approaches 2 is ''L'' = -5.

We want to prove that&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| = \left| x^2 - 4 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 2 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

We choose &amp;delta; by working backwards.  First, we need to rewrite the equation we want to prove using &amp;delta; instead of ''x'':

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| x^2 - 4 \right| &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \\
\left| x - 2 \right| \cdot \left| x + 2 \right| &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \\
(\delta) \cdot (\delta + 4) &amp; = &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note:  we used the fact that |x + 2| &lt; &amp;delta; + 4, which can be proven with the triangle inequality.

Word of caution:  the above series of equations is not a logical series of steps, and is not part of any proof, but is an informal technique used to help write the proof.  We will select a value of &amp;delta; so that the last equation is true, and then use the last equation to prove the equations above it in turn (which is what was meant earlier by ''working backwards'').

Note:  in the equations above, when &amp;delta; was substituted for ''x'', the sign &lt; was replaced with =.  This can be done (but is not necessary) because we are not told that |x-2| = &amp;delta;, but rather |x-2| &lt; &amp;delta;.  The justification for this becomes clear when the above equations are used in backwards order in the proof.

We can solve this last equation for &amp;delta; using the quadratic formula:

&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{16 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (- \epsilon) }}{2 \cdot 1} = -2 + \sqrt{4 + \epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

Note:  &amp;delta; is ''almost always'' in terms of &amp;epsilon;.  A constant value of &amp;delta; (e.g., &amp;delta; = 0.5) will not work unless the limit is of a constant function (for instance, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 3} 5 = 5&lt;/math&gt;).

Now, we have a value of &amp;delta;, and we can do our proof:

given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 2 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| f(x) - L \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x^2 - 4 \right| \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 2 \right| \cdot \left| x + 2 \right| \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\delta) \cdot (\delta + 4) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} - 2) \cdot (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} + 2) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon})^2 - (2)^2 \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here a few more examples of choosing &amp;delta;;  try to figure them out before reading the explanation.

Example 3:
Prove that the limit of ''f(x)'' = sin(''x'')/''x'' as ''x'' approaches 0 is ''L'' = 1.

Explanation:

&lt;!--

We choose &amp;delta; by working backwords, as before.  We are given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - 0 \right| = \left| x \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
and wish to prove that&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - 1 \right| = \left| \frac{sin{(x)}}{x} - 1 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

First suppose that ''x'' &gt; 0;  since we can choose &amp;delta, we can suppose that &amp;delta; is less than &amp;pi;;  then, sin(''x'') &gt; 0, and what we wish to prove can be simplified to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| \frac{sin{(x)}}{x} - 1 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-\epsilon &lt; \frac{sin{(x)}}{x} - 1 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

--&gt;

Example 4:
Prove that ''f(x)'' = 1/''x'' has no limit as ''x'' approaches 0.

&lt;!-- Example 4 isn't actually an exercise in choosing epsilon for any given delta, but of choosing a delta for which no epsilon can be given -- however, some of the same skills and processes are used.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- I have to leave, may finish work on this week (2/24/04). --&gt;

Example 5:
&lt;!-- ''Calculus/Formal Definition of the Limit'' makes specific reference to this example.  If you renumber, modify or remove this example, please update the corresponding text at that page. --&gt;
Prove that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 2} x^2 = 4 &lt;/math&gt;

Solution:
To do it, we'll look at two cases:  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\geq4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;.  The &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\geq4&lt;/math&gt; case is easy.  First let's let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=4&lt;/math&gt;.  That means we want the values chosen in the domain to map to &lt;math&gt;(0,8)&lt;/math&gt; in the range.  We want a delta such that &lt;math&gt;(2+\delta)^2=8&lt;/math&gt; so let's choose &lt;math&gt;\delta=2\sqrt2-2&lt;/math&gt;.  The chosen &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; defines the interval &lt;math&gt;(4-2\sqrt2,2\sqrt2)\approxeq(1.1716,2.8284)&lt;/math&gt; in our domain.  This gets mapped to &lt;math&gt;(24-16\sqrt2,8)\approxeq(1.3726,8)&lt;/math&gt; in our range, which is contained in &lt;math&gt;(0,8)&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice that &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  So for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, we widen the interval in the range that we are allowed to map onto, but our interval in the domain stays fixed and always maps to the same sub-interval in the range.  So &lt;math&gt;\delta=2\sqrt2-2&lt;/math&gt; works for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\geq4&lt;/math&gt;.


Now suppose &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;.  We want a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x-2|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  So let's assume &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and work backwards to find a suitable &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\epsilon&lt;x^2-4&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;4-\epsilon&lt;x^2&lt;\epsilon+4&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;4-\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since both numbers above are positive, we can take the (positive) square root of both extremes of the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4-\epsilon}&lt;x&lt;\sqrt{\epsilon+4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4-\epsilon}-2&lt;x-2&lt;\sqrt{\epsilon+4}-2&lt;/math&gt;
The above equation represents the distance, either negative or positive, that x can vary from 2 and still be within &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of 4.  We want to choose the smaller of the two extremes to construct our interval.  It turns out that &lt;math&gt;|\sqrt{\epsilon+4}-2|\leq|\sqrt{4-\epsilon}-2|&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;, so choose &lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\epsilon+4}-2&lt;/math&gt;.  As a sanity check, let's try with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0.002&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\epsilon+4}-2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{0.002+4}-2&lt;/math&gt;
which is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=0.0004999375&lt;/math&gt;
At the extreme right of the domain, this gives
:&lt;math&gt;x=2.0004999375&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=2.0004999375^2=4.00199999993750390625&lt;/math&gt;
which is within 0.002 of 4.

== Introduction ==

=== Overview ===

&lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt; is a powerful editor that is ubiquitous amongst Unix and Unix-like operating systems, but is available on many other operating systems, even on MS-DOS, Windows and the Macintosh. If not the original vi, there is usually at least a good clone available that runs on your system.  Even if you use another editor you must have a passing knowledge of vi as an administrator.  Sometimes vi is the only editor available when your computer crashes leaving a minimal system for you to repair.

vi, pronounced like 'vee eye', was originally written by Bill Joy for BSD Unix in Berkeley in 1976 and became quickly part of many vendor-specific versions of the (at that time) original AT&amp;T Unix. It was later directly added to AT&amp;T's System V Unix, too. Bill Joy later went on to co-found [http://www.sun.com Sun Microsystems], and became the company's Chief Scientist at that time. vi stands for ''visual'' and was an enormous improvement of the classic Unix editor called '''ed'''. '''ed''' is a line-editor. If you are still familiar with MS-DOS, then you may know the MS-DOS '''edlin''' editor. ed is similar, although more powerful than edlin, which doesn't mean much.

vi also has a line-mode, called '''ex'''. In fact, one can argue that the program is indeed two editors in one, one editor called vi, another called ex. It is possible to switch between line and visual mode during editing. It is also possible to choose the mode during startup. However, pure usage of ex is rare. The visual mode is the prevailing mode.

Although vi stands for ''visual'', classic vi is mainly operated via the character keys, and not via the mouse or the cursor keys. Once you are used to this, it becomes extremely convenient, because there is less movement of the hands to the cursor keys or mouse involved.

vi also served as a kind of incubator for Unix's terminal control capabilities. Because of vi's need to control the terminal and the many different types of terminals at that time, the ''termcap'' (terminal-capabilities) database was introduced (later replaced with the more flexible ''terminfo'' database). vi's internal high-level screen control library was later separated, and became ''curses'' - the Unix standard library for CRT screen handling.

=== Conventions ===

{{:Learning the vi Editor/Conventions}}

'''unix-command'''(section)
: Sometimes references to Unix commands are used in this book. On first occurrence such a name of a command is written in the typical Unix style. This style consists of the command's name followed by the section of the manual pages in which the command description can be found, in brackets. E.g. '''sed'''(1) refers to Unix's '''sed''' command which is usually documented in section 1 of the Unix manual pages (sed is the Unix stream editor; a tool for manipulating text without user interaction).

== Getting vi if you don't have it already ==
If you're running a Unix system, or a Unix-like system (for simplicity from now on we will refer to both as a &quot;Unix system&quot;), such as a BSD or Linux distribution, or even Mac OS X, you're sure to have vi or one of its variants on your system.

If you're running Windows, you can get a version of vi called [http://www.vim.org &quot;vim&quot;] or [http://elvis.the-little-red-haired-girl.org/whatiselvis/ &quot;elvis&quot;]. If you're on an older Mac OS (pre-OS X) system, you can get MacVim Classic [http://macvim.swdev.org/MacClassic/ here].

=== Noted vi variants ===

As mentioned, vi has a number of variants. They have been created because vi was only available on rather expensive Unix operating systems. Although vi itself, as well as nvi, was created in Berkeley for the free BSD Unix variant, usage of BSD Unix required an original AT&amp;T Unix license (this has later changed, see below). Original vi, for example, used code from AT&amp;T's '''ed'''''(1)'' editor. 

Over time, BSD replaced many of the original AT&amp;T code up to the point where today there is no such code any more in BSD, and an original Unix license is no longer needed. As part of the effort to replace all AT&amp;T code in BSD, Keith Bostic undertook the work to create a clone of vi that was free of AT&amp;T code, called nvi. nvi then became BSD's standard vi instead of the original vi.
Another vi clone is Elvis, which was written by Steve Kirkendal. 

Over time, nvi was enhanced &amp;ndash; for example, supporting multiple windows &amp;ndash; but originally it was not supposed to be an enhancement, 'just' a pure clone.

BSD's original vi (with the ed code inside) lives on as the vi which is distributed with System V Unix, because AT&amp;T decided a long time ago to take it from BSD and add it to the official Unix. Of course AT&amp;T didn't have a problem with an AT&amp;T Unix license, so they probably never replaced the ed code inside the original vi.

Yet, some find nvi still to be too minimal, and so vim was born. '''vim''' (vi-i''m''proved), is another effort to extend vi's capabilities. Unlike nvi, vim goes even further to extend vi's capabilities. However some find that vim is often too much. vim comes in two variants, a text-only version, and a GUI version, the latter is called '''gvim'''.

Other vi clones are the already mentioned '''elvis''' and '''stevie'''. These clones were born in the CP/M and home computer area to bring the editor to these platforms, too. Of course, they were later ported to MS-DOS and Windows. These days, however, '''vim''' seems to be the prevailing vi-clone on free/open platforms and proprietary platforms as well. 

''You should choose the version you feel most comfortable with'' &amp;ndash; if you have an editor you feel displeased with, it will affect your productivity.

== Getting around vi ==

=== Starting the editor ===

If you are running a Unix system, you can start up vi by typing

  &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;{{vi/key|CR}}

at the command line. If you are running X, with a desktop like GNOME, KDE, CDE/Motif or OpenLook you may have a launcher button handy to start the editor - if you have such a setup, you can just click the icon.

If you are running Windows or DOS with elvis, you can start up the Windows editor by double-clicking &quot;winelvis.exe&quot;, or in DOS, you can start the editor by typing in &quot;elvis&quot; at the command line.

You will be greeted with a screen similar to:

 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 &quot;No File&quot;

=== Quitting the editor ===

To quit for now, press the Escape key (the editor should beep), then enter the three characters {{vi/Ex|:q!}} and press Return:

 {{vi/key|ESC}}{{vi/Ex|:q!}}{{vi/key|CR}}

Just before you type the final {{vi/key|CR}} the screen will look similar to

 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:q!&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{vi/Ex|:q!}} is the short form of {{vi/Ex|:quit!}} which quits the editor.

You should be dropped back to your operating system (or, rather, the shell from where you started).

There are other ways to quit, e.g. pressing {{vi/key|Z}}{{vi/key|Z}} ({{vi/key|Shift-z}}{{vi/key|Shift-z}}) will save any unsaved work and quit the editor. Typing {{vi/Ex|:wq}} will always save, even if there are no unsaved changes, and then quit the editor. {{vi/Ex|:x}} will write if there are no unsaved changes, and it will quit. {{vi/Ex|:wq}} and {{vi/Ex|:x}} requires that you had previously provided a file name, so it will not work for the above simple example. Typing {{vi/Ex|:q}} will quit if there have been no changes made; if changes have been made, vi will print a warning similar to &quot;No write since last change&quot;.

=== Don't worry ===

Many first time vi users stop at this point, and never touch vi again. If you tried to enter some text after you started, you will most likely have been greeted with a series of beeps and rather erratic behavior. Don't worry. This is perfectly normal for vi, and the editor is not broken. You will soon see why this is normal vi behaviour.

== Continue ==

Now that you know how to start the editor and quit it, let's move on to getting things done in &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;: see [[Learning the vi Editor/Basic tasks]]

Now that we know how to invoke the editor and quit it, we can get acquainted with how to ''use'' the editor.

Alternatively, you can use the ViM tutor which comes with many modern vim distributions.  It contains, essentially the same information as the text below.  You can invoke the tutor by entering &lt;b&gt;vimtutor&lt;/b&gt; at your shell.

== Vi is a ''modal'' editor ==

The vi editor can do two things:
* accept a command, such as deleting a line
* accept text, written by you

In the vi editor, each of these tasks is achieved by putting the editor into a particular mode of operation (normally just called a ''mode''). When you wish to give vi a command, you enter ''command mode'', and when you want to enter text, you enter ''insert mode''. We'll cover how to do this below.

It is important to set the correct mode before you begin writing, but this is simple to do. When you first start vi, it is automatically in command mode.

== Entering text ==

Entering text is the most basic task an editor can do! From command mode (in which the editor starts), press &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; to enter ''insert mode'', and you can begin typing. You can use the backspace key to correct mistakes you make. If you make a mistake after a few sentences, leave these errors for now, we will look at correcting them later. To leave insert mode once you're done typing, and return to command mode, press the Escape key on your keyboard (or type Control-[).

=== Exercise ===

Let's have an exercise:

# Start the editor.
# Enter insert mode.
# Type some text
# Return to command mode.
# Quit the editor.

=== Solution ===

# We can start the editor as in the previous section.
# Since the editor starts in command mode, we must press the {{vi/key|i}} key before we can start typing.
# You can make some text up yourself! 
# Press the {{vi/key|Escape}} key.
# If you want to quit the editor, you need to be in command mode. Since pressing Escape puts you in command mode, you can just use the method in the previous section to exit: type {{vi/Ex|:q!}}

== Command mode ==

Command mode allows you to perform many useful tasks within vi. 

=== Moving around ===

Say you have been writing for some time, and have forgotten something. Pressing {{vi/key|Backspace}}, ''erasing'' previous work is not the best solution! We would like to move around the document freely, moving the cursor.

{{:Learning the vi Editor/Moving around}}

==== Exercise ====

You can repeat this exercise with your own sentences. Make sure you are proficient doing this before you continue.

# Start the editor.
# Enter the text: &quot;The quick fox jumps over the dog&quot;
# Insert the word &quot;brown&quot; between &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;fox&quot;.
# Insert the word &quot;lazy&quot; between &quot;the&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;.
# Quit the editor.

==== Solution ====

# Use the method in the previous section.
# Press {{vi/key|i}}, then enter &lt;tt&gt;The quick fox jumps over the dog&lt;/tt&gt; normally.
# Press {{vi/key|Escape}}, then press {{vi/key|h}} until the cursor is at the letter &quot;f&quot; of &quot;fox&quot;. Press {{vi/key|i}}, and then type &quot;brown &quot;.
# Press {{vi/key|Escape}}, then press {{vi/key|l}} until the cursor is at the letter &quot;d&quot;. Press {{vi/key|i}}, and then type &quot;lazy &quot;.
# Press {{vi/key|Escape}} again, then type {{vi/Ex|:quit!}}.

=== More on movement  ===

Using &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;j&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;k&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; is ok, but vi understands more than rows and columns.  These are some commands that move by text objects:
* &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; moves forward to the beginning of the next word.
* &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; moves backwards to the beginning of the previous word.
* &lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; move by sentences, either backward or forward.
* &lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; move by paragraphs.

=== Deleting things ===

If you have made a mistake after a few lines, for instance, pressing Backspace  until you have erased the mistake and starting again isn't always the best solution. We need a method of deleting mistakes that happen in the normal course of editing.

vi allows you several methods of deleting text, based on how much you want to remove. Now that you are familiar with moving around, once you've moved the cursor to where your error is:
* the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; key deletes ''one'' character 
* pressing &lt;tt&gt;dw&lt;/tt&gt; deletes ''one'' word.
* pressing &lt;tt&gt;dd&lt;/tt&gt; deletes ''one'' line

==== Exercise ====

From now on, we will omit the steps for you to start and quit the editor - you should be already familiar with those.

# Enter the following text: &lt;tt&gt;Sad I been here, I wouldnt ever ever leave.&lt;/tt&gt;
# Change the word &quot;Sad&quot; to &quot;Had&quot;.
# Add an apostrophe after &quot;wouldn&quot;.
# Delete the extra &quot;ever&quot;.
# Delete the line.

==== Solution ====

# Type the text normally. (You should already be familiar with entering insert mode and leaving it.)
# Enter command mode, use &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; to move to the start of the line, and then press &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; to delete the &quot;S&quot;. Press &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; to enter insert mode, insert the &quot;H&quot;, then leave insert mode by pressing Escape.
# Now position the cursor on the t, and press &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; to enter insert mode, type the &quot; ' &quot;. Leave insert mode by pressing escape.
# Position the cursor over the first &quot;e&quot; in the word &quot;ever&quot; (choose whichever one you like). Type &lt;tt&gt;dw&lt;/tt&gt; to delete the word.
# Type &lt;tt&gt;dd&lt;/tt&gt; to remove the entire line.

==The Mathematics Of Waves==

We start our discussion of waves by taking the equation for a very simple wave and describing its 
characteristics. The basic equation for such a wave is 

:&lt;math&gt;y=a\ \sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda}  - 2\pi ft +\alpha \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the wave at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This equation describes a fairly simple wave, but most complex waves are just sums of simpler ones. If we freeze this equation in time at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;y=a\ \sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} +\alpha \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which looks like this: [TODO - Add a Graph]

From the graph we can see that each of the three parameters has a meaning. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;amplitude&lt;/b&gt; of the wave, how high it is. &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;wavelength&lt;/b&gt;, the distance from a part of the wave in one cycle to the same part of the wave in the next cycle. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;phase&lt;/b&gt; of the wave, which shifts the wave to the left or right. The wavelength is a distance, and is usually measured in meters, millimeters or even nanometers depending on the wave. Phase is an angle, measured in radians.

Now that we have mapped out the wave in space, let's instead set &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and see how the wave changes over time

:&lt;math&gt;y=a\ \sin(- 2\pi ft +\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

Amplitude &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and phase &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; remain, but the wavelength is gone and a new quantity has appeared: &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is the frequency, or how rapidly the wave moves up and down. Frequency is measured in units of inverse time: in a fixed period of time, how many times does the wave move up and down? The unit usually used for this is the hertz, or inverse second.

Now let's combine these two pictures and see how the wave moves. Figure 3 is a diagram of how the wave looks like when you plot it in both space and time. The straight lines are the places where the simple wave reaches a maximum, minimum, or zero (where it crosses the x axis).

We can look at the zeros to determine the phase velocity of the wave.  The &lt;b&gt;phase velocity&lt;/b&gt; is how fast a part of the wave moves. We can think of it as the speed of the wave, but for more complicated waves it is only one type of speed - more on that in later sections.

We can get an equation for the zeros by setting our equation to zero.

:&lt;math&gt;0=a\ \sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} - 2\pi ft +\alpha \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0=\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} - 2\pi ft +\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = f \lambda t - \frac{\alpha \lambda}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

You see here that we have the equation for a straight line, describing a point that is moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This gives us the equation for the phase velocity of the wave, which is

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{velocity}=\mbox{frequency} \times \mbox{wavelength} \quad v=f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Code Generation ==
A compiler usually is designed to output an executable program that will allow the user to run your program, and to be directly run by the processor, without having an intermediary interpreter such as in the interpretation process. For your program to be run by the processor however, you will need to transform the instructions in your specific programming language into assembler code, which is then sent to an assembler tool to create object code, which is then linked together with specific libraries to create your executable code. For now, we only really need to worry about transforming the instructions into assembler code. This process is what we will deal with in this section. You will need to be well versed in the assembler language you wish to output. If you intend your programs to run on the x86 architecture, you need to be familiar with x86 assembler code, and so on.

Code generation occurs after semantic analysis is done, which gives us enough information to generate more primitive concrete code. The general idea behind code generation is decompose the tree structure of the syntax tree into a sequence of instructions, whatever an instruction set is. In this stage, since we are done with the semantic program, we are not interested in the syntactic and semantic structure of programs but in the order of executions of instructions.

Some sort of intermediate code is often produced before generating actual machine code. The benefits of this are

# it is easier to generate more abstract code, not bothering too much about things like register allocations,
# optimization independent to machine architecture can be done and
# compiler bugs can be spotted more easily.

However, it may be simpler for your program to output assembler code directly, but you lose the above advantages. See the next section for more techniques on this.

In this chapter, we shall use the three address format to represent intermediate code. The format is useful because it is analogous to actual machine instructions in some architectures and, more importantly, allows us to easily change the execution order of instructions, which is a huge advantage over stack-based intermediate code like the byte code of Java.

Although it is not a complex problem to reuse names after they have already been used, it is actually beneficial to allocate a new name every time one is needed because it allows us to form a call graph and optimize easily as we will see later. For this reason, we only briefly mention the methods to reuse names. You can find more on the optimization of allocation of names in optimization chapter.

The three address code, as the name suggests, consist of three address and opcode, which tells what kind of operation is meant to be done. For example, an expression (a + b) * 3 can be transformed into:

temp1 := a + b;
temp2 := temp1 * 3

In the first line, temp1, a and b are addresses and + is an opcode, and the second line is similar to the first one. Unlike load-store machines, it is unnecessary to load variables to registers and store them back. You see why the three address code is easy to handle.

Choosing portable, flexible and expressive instructions is critical; Not having enough instructions can complicate generated code with the combination of several instructions to achieve one operation and having too much may obviously make maintenance more daunting task. Probably the best way to do this is to examine existing machine code. It is more straightforward to transform code close to underlying machine code than abstract one.

=== Expression ===
Algebraic expressions can be translated into the three address code in a very straightforward manner. This can be done rather recursively as follows: Assume two expressions left and right with an operation op-code, then the results should be:

    code for left
    code for right
    temp = place for left + place for right

=== Control Structures ===
The general idea behind generating code for control structures is the same as coding in assembly programming. That is, an if statement, for instance, is converted into a chunk of code using conditional and unconditional jumps.

=== Assembler language techniques ===
If the output of your compiler is assembly language code, it is necessary to understand the basic techniques of assembly language programming. Most programming languages do not map easily to most assembler languages, so some techniques or skills may need to be understood before attempting to write code that will output assembler code. These techniques are not intended to create highly optimized code - you will learn optimizing techniques later - but are intended to make sure you have a good understanding of how data and instructions are managed in the process of compiler construction.

==== Managing variables====
Many programs use hundreds of different variables (not counting arrays).

Most [[w:computer architecture|computer architectures]] give you less than 32 registers ([[w:MIPS architecture|MIPS architecture]] and [[w:ARM|ARM]] give nearly 32 pointer registers; [[w:i386|i386]] gives only about 4 pointer registers; [[w:PIC microcontroller|PIC microcontroller]] only has 1 pointer register).

Since we can't squeeze 100 different variables into even 32 processor registers, we must use memory for storing most variables.

We will start by storing practically all variables in memory. Later we will cover optimizing techniques that try to keep as many variables as possible in the processor registers.
&lt;!-- This may be inefficient, but we are not currently concentrating on efficiency right now. --&gt;

==== Labeling ====
The assembler tool that you are using may reserve the names of the mnemonics.
For example, your assembler may not allow a variable named &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt;, since this is reserved for the instruction to add.

In this case, it may be important to use a ''prefix'' for your variable labels. Some compilers use a single underscore, but you can choose whichever you wish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This textbook concerns the wonderful world of '''macroeconomics''', or economics on a very large scale, concerning national and international systems. It is primarily aimed at students in their final few years of secondary education, though it could also be used by interested students younger or older than that. Having a background knowledge of [[Subject:Economics|economics]] would be useful, but grasping overall concepts should not require an in depth previous knowledge.

It is worth remembering that this textbook can be edited at any time, with the link at the top of this page. This is both good and bad - you yourself, having spotted a mistake or having noticed a poor definition, can correct it and should feel free to do so. The bad side is that anyone can edit it, so content may be inaccurate whilst the wikibook is in its infancy!

The '''Myers-Briggs Type Indicator''' (MBTI) is the name of a [[w:personality|personality]] test designed to assess [[w:psychological type|psychological type]]. It was developed by [[w:Katherine Briggs|Katherine Briggs]] and her daughter [[w:Isabel Myers|Isabel Myers]] during [[w:World War II|World War II]]. The use of type follows from the theories of [[w:Carl Jung|Carl Jung]]. The phrase is also sometimes used as a [[w:trademark|trademark]] of [[w:CPP Inc.|CPP Inc.]], formerly known as [[w:Consulting Psychologists Press|Consulting Psychologists Press]], Inc. The trademark is owned by the Myers Briggs Type Indicator Trust, and when used as a trademark it must include a registered trademark symbol after the name: ''Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&amp;reg;'' or ''MBTI&amp;reg;''.

There are a few widely used ways of interpreting the results: Jung-like methods, [[w:David Keirsey|Keirsey]]-like methods, and [[w:popular psychology|popular psychology]] methods.

The MBTI is popular with recruiters and managers, because studies using this assessment show clusters of different personality types in different professions. For instance, the proportion of [[w:Engineering|engineer]]s who are [[../INTJ/]] is higher than the 1% found in the general population.

There are significant differences by sex, especially on the [[../Dimensions)|T vs. F]] distribution.

Proponents of the system claim that almost all arguments between people tend to be manifestations of a type conflict (e.g., E vs. I,  S vs. N, T vs. F, J vs. P). The P-J conflict is said to be the clearest: one person gets mad when the rules are broken and the other gets mad when rules are made.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is perhaps the world's most popular personality type description tool. Since its inception, many people have turned to the MBTI&amp;reg; for a deeper understanding of themselves and others.

This MBTI textbook is designed to bring together general knowlege about the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and make it available for understanding and application for individuals and groups, for personal and professional lives.

The Myers-Briggs test describes four basic areas of personality:
# [[../Extraversion/]] vs. [[../Introversion/]] (E vs. I) describes how a person gets energized
# [[../Sensing/]] vs. [[../Intuitive|Intuition]] (S vs. N) describes how a person takes in information
# [[../Thinking/]] vs. [[../Feeling/]] (T vs. F) describes the means a person uses to make decisions
# [[../Judging/]] vs. [[../Perceiving/]] (J vs. P) describes the speed with which a person makes decisions

* '''Extroverts''' appear outgoing and are energized by people, and are very effective in pursuits that involve other people. Extroverts tend to be sensation-seeking, spontaneous, and gregarious. They enjoy crowds, noise, and stimulation. Extroverts also tend to have more sexual partners in the course of their life than Introverts, though this isn't to say that all Extroverts are more promiscuous than all Introverts.
* '''Introverts''' are rested and energized by solitude, and are very effective in solitary pursuits. An introvert is a person who prefers to process thoughts internally. Introverts tend to think before they speak. The word is also used informally to refer to somebody who prefers solitary activities to social ones, which is more of a behavioural than cognitive definition. Introverts tend to be seen as quiet and reserved, which is often confused with a lack of confidence by louder, more extroverted people. They often perform well in analytical roles that require intelligence or logic, but place less emphasis on social interactions and &quot;people skills&quot;. Introverts are usually a minority in the general population, and they can often be sidelined by culture or society, which in many cases favours the more common extroverted style of behaviour.

* '''Sensors''' want, trust, and remember facts, and usually describe themselves as &quot;practical&quot;. For a Sensor, intuition is untrustworthy and might seem like mental static. Sensation as a perceiving mode of consciousness focuses on heightening reality. Guardians share the combination SJ, while Artisans share the combination SP.
* '''Intuitives''' prefer metaphor, analogy, and logic, and tend to reason from first principles and hunches. While Sensors pride themselves on living in the real world, Intuitives pride themselves on seeing possibilities. This can cause conflict. Intuition as a perceiving mode of consciousness filters experience through the unconscious mind. Intuition focuses on possibilities rather than realities. Idealists share the combination NF, while Rationals share the combination NT.

* '''Thinkers''' use impersonal means of reasoning: logic and verifiable experience.
* '''Feelers''' prefer personal reasoning: value judgements and emotions. Thinkers often find Feelers muddle-headed. Feelers often find Thinkers cold and inhuman.

* '''Judgers''' prefer to come to decisions, and move on. They may feel betrayed if a decision is &quot;reopened&quot;. They are prone to hastiness, but get things done.
* '''Perceivers''' prefer to leave their options open to perceive new possibilities and processes as long as possible. They tend to mourn opportunities lost to premature decisions. They are prone to analysis paralysis, but rarely make permanent mistakes.

It is important to keep in mind that each dimension reveals a person's inborn preference with how he or she is most comfortable operating, and does not say that any person will ''always'' retain his preferred dimension.

There are four temperaments: '''SJ''', '''SP''', '''NT''', and '''NF'''.

==[[../Traditionalist|SJ]]==
'''Sensing judgers''', or '''[[../Traditionalist|traditionalists]]''', are practical people that keep the home fires burning and businesses working. They're always aware of who owns what and which social positions are held by whom. Their quest is to run everything, and they are often good at doing so.

==[[../Experiencer|SP]]==
'''Sensing perceivers''', or '''[[../Experiencer|experiencers]]''', are adventurous, fun-loving, observant, physically skillful, impatient, easily bored, and good with tools and art. They want to be happy and make others happy too.

==[[../Conceptualizer|NT]]==
'''Intuitive thinkers''', or '''[[../Conceptualizer|conceptualizers]]''', are analytical, impersonal, intellectual, rather unworldly, absent-minded, and are more likely to forget appointments. They continually seek to acquire new skills and pride themselves on their skills, logic, and efficiency.

==[[../Idealist|NF]]==
'''Intuitive feelers''', or '''[[../Idealist|idealists]]''', understand people and tend to be aware of people's feelings. They can be warm, sympathetic friends, but find offense in the smallest careless remark. They tend to be very skillful negotiators and good with words.

==The MBTI is not yet scientifically proven==

Skeptics, including many psychologists, argue that the MBTI has not been validated by double-blind tests (in which participants accept reports written for other participants, and are asked whether or not the report suits them) and thus does not qualify as a scientific assessment. Some even demonstrate that profiles can apparently seem to fit any person by confirmation bias, ambiguity of basic terms. and the Byzantine complexity that allows any kind of behavior to fit any personality type.

See [http://skepdic.com/myersb.html this extensive skeptical treatment] of the subject.

==A Temptation to Pigeonhole==

Another argument says that, while the MBTI is useful in self-understanding, it is commonly used to pigeonhole people or for self-pigeonholing. Supporting arguments include:
* It emphasizes each person ''being'' one specific type rather than each person ''using'' a certain type of thinking ''most of the time''.
* Real people often do not fit easily into one of sixteen types because they use different styles of thinking at different times. This is why there have been questions about answering the indicator (like &quot;do I answer the indicator according to how I act at work or at home&quot;). This is also why some people have trouble finding a type that really &quot;fits&quot; them.
* Predicting how a person will react based on a personality test that only measures their predominant style of thinking is foolish. Excusing your own bad or inefficient behavior based on such a test is also foolish.
* A category from one individual can not easily be related to others, since different amplitudes of the answers to the 2D-questions may generate the same type. Hence, a person of a e.g. non-emotional (i.e. thinker) category may have stronger emotionality than another person categorized as a thinker.

The Introverted Sensor Thinker Judger is a traditionally masculine personality type, detached, unexpressive, concrete, and not given to speculation.

==Famous ISTJs==
George H.W. Bush,
Harry Truman,
George Washington

==Working with an ISTJ==
ISTJ's are detail people.
You will mostly find them in technical service industries, including medical fields, accounting, police work, engineering, office managers, and so forth. 
They are keen sensors of their environments; tastes, smells, noise levels. They often prefer a quiet work environment, where they can concentrate and focus on the task at hand. They work slowly and methodically, and don't like to be rushed. They can be focused on keeping structure in order and feel most comfortable when everyone is doing what they are supposed to be doing. ISTJ's value their personal privacy, and like to remain professional. Due to their discreet and reserved nature, others may see them as snobbish or uptight. Often times they remain anonymous for achievements they have accomplished. They may be upset with people who don't follow the rules, honor their promises, or follow through, but may not say so publicly. Traits they may value among fellow coworkers are loyalty, friendliness, and a strong work ethic. They are usually willing to lend their help to others in need if they have time.

ENFPs are outgoing and talkative types who often have many diverse friends. They are naturally irreverent, curious, good with words, creative, and even a bit artsy. They favor abstraction over detail and tend to flit from one activity to the next, deriving more pleasure from starting projects than from finishing them.

==ENFPs at work==

ENFPs are sponges of knowledge. Curiously collecting information about life's experiences as fodder for their own stories, they live their lives much like a dramatic character in a movie, delighting in finding irony and drama in life situations wherever they go. They interpret the data they gather from people and the world in the form of inner meanings, relationships, and possibilities, often recounting their ideas to people though conversation. They love to spread the word!
ENFPs, [[../NF/]]s, are interested in many different things and this often leads them in multiple directions, therefore they are known for changing jobs and even careers frequently. ENFPs prefer to make work fun and have been known to put off work when there is a chance to have fun. ENFPs prefer environments which have little administrative or detailed work. Delegation to reliable support staff is important for success. ENFPs seek out jobs not confined by strict schedules and mundane tasks. According to Keirsey, the &quot;Idealists&quot; want to make the world a better place to live by helping others and are on a search for their &quot;true self&quot;. Integrity, ideals, beliefs, and values matter to ENFPs. ENFP's practice and dream about being the best at what ever they seek to achieve. They want to KNOW everything!

ENFPs generally have the following traits:

    * Project-oriented
    * Bright and capable
    * Warmly, genuinely interested in people; great people skills
    * Extremely intuitive and perceptive about people
    * Able to relate to people on their own level
    * Service-oriented; likely to put the needs of others above their own
    * Future-oriented
    * Dislike performing routine tasks
    * Need approval and appreciation from others
    * Cooperative and friendly
    * Creative and energetic
    * Well-developed verbal and written communication skills
    * Natural leaders, but do not like to control people
    * Resist being controlled by others
    * Can work logically and rationally - use their intuition to understand the goal and work backwards towards it
    * Usually able to grasp difficult concepts and theories 
(from http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP_car.html)

Common careers for ENFPs are those which allow flexibility and spontaneity while serving others. This includes teaching, general practice of medicine, medical research, religious fields, entrepreneurship, missionary work, social work, community development, creative arts, acting, broadcasting, consulting, coaching, corporate training, public relations, counseling, advertising, and marketing. They enjoy working for themselves and creating new ideas to help people. The perfect job for an ENFP is one where they would give out useful information to others and they would receive several hundred dollars per hour for that service.

==ENFPs in relationships==

'''Strengths'''

ENFPs are energized by being around people. ENFPs take their relationships very seriously. ENFPs seek and demand authenticity and depth in their personal relationships, and will put forth a lot of effort into making things work out. ENFPs are generally warm, considerate, affirming, nurturing, and highly invested in the health of the relationship. ENFPs have excellent interpersonal skills, and are able to inspire and motivate others to be the best that they can be. ENFPs are generally highly valued for their genuine warmth and high ideals.

ENFPs want to help, to be liked, and to be admired by other people on both an individual and a humanitarian level. ENFPs hold up their end of relationships, sometimes being victimized by less caring individuals.

'''Weaknesses'''

ENFPs are well aware of their weaknesses, often being their own harshest critic; they may sarcastically put themselves down before others do, because secretly they may expect to be humiliated.
Often the ENFP is reluctant to share intimate feelings unless in the company of deeply trusted relationships. Despite being extroverts, ENFPs require a great deal of alone time to center themselves. ENFPs are strongly influenced by the opinions of others. ENFPs can exhibit preoccupation in their relationships, sometimes putting &quot;all their eggs in one basket&quot; and can tend to hyper focus on the other individual, in attempts to &quot;fix&quot; the other person or pull out their &quot;real&quot; emotions, transforming them into the perfect person. ENFPs may feel very anxious and preoccupied if the other partner is silent, non expressive, or withdrawn when coping with stress, instead of talking through things. This can deeply hurt them. There often appears to be a silent pull of ENFPs to the wishes of authority figures, parents, and friends which may cause a dilemma as to loyalties and decision making. Although energetic and effervescent, the ENFP can sometimes be smothering in their enthusiasm. They do not understand why someone would not be charmed by their enthusiastic display of affection and quirky jokes, because most people find them entertaining and refreshing.
They may try too hard to be what others want them to be, play the role of actor and entertainer, and feel in danger of losing touch with their true authentic selves when they don't receive appreciation and feedback for who they really are.
ENFPs are often seen as disorganized, having a short attention span, takes on too many tasks at once, lacks structure, and all over the place.

==How to Behave Toward an ENFP==

Give ENFPs the freedom to be flexible. Realize that churning through possibilities inspires their minds and get their creative juices flowing. Don't bog the ENFP down with too many details, especially on any subject not known to be of deep interest to him or her. Involve the ENFP in the process and try to keep things fun.
When communicating with ENFPs you will find that many like to talk. Do not hesitate to interrupt and state your opinion. ENFPs enjoy speculating about ideas. They enjoy others who engage them in conversation, contribute their ideas and keep it moving in a positive direction. Overall ENFPs appreciate honesty in others, they want to know how people really feel. ENFPs are easily influenced by what other people say. It may not appear that they are listening when they are talking to you, but soon after the conversation ends they often ponder what the other person has said and incorporate those ideas into their own thinking to use the knowledge for the future.

The main points to remember, ENFPs: &lt;br&gt;
1) Want to help and please the people they are working with, so give them frequent feedback.&lt;br&gt;
2) Like to hear from their significant others that they are loved and valued, (and are willing and eager to return the favor,) so let them know what you appreciate about them. &lt;br&gt;
3) Prefer happy and upbeat relationships, nevertheless, when conflict occurs, they usually want to engage in a dialog to work it out.&lt;br&gt;
4) Are one of the most freedom orientated personality types. Give them room to have some adventures on their own.&lt;br&gt;
5) May have a difficult time staying focused and following things through to completion. Let them know clearly what your deadlines are. ENFPs want to please other people, so let them know how important it is to you and why it is important to you.&lt;br&gt;
6) Prefer a participative and collegial atmosphere in which employees are included in the decision making.

The iNtuitive side of the NF makes him or her more inclined towards the abstract and the future as opposed to the concrete present. The Feeler preference means he makes decisions based on his personal values more than on cold analytical data.

'''Extraverts''' are energized by interacting with other people. They can often appear to be outgoing and may be effective in pursuits that involve interacting with other people. Extraverts tend to be sensation-seeking, spontaneous, and gregarious. They may enjoy crowds, noise, and stimulation.

In a conversation, an extravert will tend to talk faster and louder than an introvert and to interrupt more frequently.

'''Sensors''' want, trust, and remember facts, and usually describe themselves as &quot;practical&quot;. For a Sensor, intuition is untrustworthy, and might seem like mental static. Sensation, as a perceiving mode of consciousness, focuses on heightening reality. Guardians share the combination SJ, while Artisans share the combination SP.

'''Intuitives''' prefer metaphor, analogy, and logic, and tend to reason from first principles and hunches. While Sensors pride themselves on living in the real world, Intuitives pride themselves on seeing possibilities. This can cause conflict. Intuition, as a perceiving mode of consciousness, filters experience through the unconscious mind. Intuition focuses on possibilities rather than realities. Idealists share the combination NF, while Rationals share the combination NT.

'''Judgers''' prefer to come to decisions and move on. They can feel betrayed if a decision is &quot;reopened&quot;. They are prone to hastiness, but get things done.

'''Perceivers''' prefer to leave their options open to perceive new possibilities and processes as long as possible. They tend to mourn opportunities lost to premature decisions. They are prone to analysis paralysis, but rarely make permanent mistakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hypercomplex numbers are numbers that use the square root of -1 to create more than 1 extra dimension.

The most basic Hypercomplex number is the one used most often in vector mathematics, the Quaternion, which consists of 4 dimensions.   Higher dimensions are diagrammed by adding more roots to negative 1 in a predefined relationship.

==Quaternions==

A Quaternion consists of four dimensions, one real and the other 3 imaginary.  The imaginary dimensions are represented as ''i'', ''j'' and ''k''.  Each imaginary dimension is a square root of -1 and thus it is not on the normal number line.  In practice, the ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'' are all orthogonal to each other and to the real numbers.  As such, they only intersect at the origin (0,0''i'', 0''j'', 0''k'').

The basic form of a quaternion is:
*&lt;math&gt;q = a + bi + cj + dk&lt;/math&gt;

where a, b, c and d are real number coefficients. 

For a quaternion the relationship between ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'' is defined in this simple rule:
*&lt;math&gt;i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = i \times j \times k = -1&lt;/math&gt;

From this follows:
*&lt;math&gt;i \times j = k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j \times i = -k&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;j \times k = i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k \times j = -i&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;k \times i = j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i \times k = -j&lt;/math&gt;

As you may have noticed, multiplication is not commutative in hyperdimensional mathematics.

They can also be represented as a 1 by 4 matrix in the form


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! real
! ''i''
! ''j''
! ''k''
|-
| width=&quot;20&quot; | 1 || width=&quot;20&quot; | 1 || width=&quot;20&quot; | 1
| width=&quot;20&quot; | 1
|}

...

...

The quaternion is a 4 dimensional number, but it can be used to diagram three dimensional vectors and can be used to turn them without the use of calculus.

==Octonion==

8-dimensional.  See: [[w:Octonion|Wikipedia's Article on Octonion]]

==Sedenions==
16-dimensional.  See: [[w:Sedenion|Wikipedia's Article on Sedenion]]

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Vanicat. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Vanicat~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:52, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

==INFJs at work==

==INFJs in relationships==
INFJs tend to hold back part of themselves and like most introverts it can take them a while to become comfortable around new people. Having extraverted feeling as their auxiliary function, INFJs often feel the need for verbal affirmation and support from people close to them.  Many of the INFJ's actions are dependent on the emotions or what they perceive to be the emotions of others and as result immature INFJs can neglect their own feelings and opinions when making decisions. The INFJ's focus on the emotions of others can lead to them being harmonizers or, on the other end of the same spectrum, manipulators.  It can also cause them much social anxiety if they have not properly or fully developed their auxiliary function.  INFJs are natural romantics who seek long-term or lifelong relationships. While they may not all believe in soulmates, they tend to put pressure on their partners in trying to achieve the perfect relationship.   Some theorists have suggested that INFJs are most compatible with ENTPs (the Inventor) or ENFPs (the Champion).

==Famous INFJs==
Carl Jung

George Harrison

Mahatma Gandhi

Marlon Brando, actor

Jon Crosby (VAST), musician

Edward Norton

=Fictional INFJs=
*Frodo Baggins (Lord of the Rings)

=How to deal with an INFJ=
Be honest.  Don't try and manipulate them, they will see through it and never trust you again.  INFJ's have an uncanny ability to read people's emotions and they tend to take others emotions into themselves.  They easily make connections between things by matching up pieces of conversations and visual memories and can appear to be psychic because of this.

==ISFPs at work==
ISFPs generally are underachievers and like low key, low stress, aesthetically beautiful work environments that are fun. They like to work by themselves or in small groups cooperatively, but may not like being the leader and they have a harsh inner critic. They are gentle people and don't like to pressure others into deadlines unless necessary. When forced into a position of power, they may feel cornered and very uncomfortable making decisions.  Their favorite subjects might be music, cooking, painting, drawing, gardening, musical theatre, sculpting and helping others. They are often quite talented but often quiet about showing the world. Make work a game, and they'll work happily. Many ISFPs are attracted to fine arts, which they often have hidden talent in.

==ISFPs in relationships==
ISFPs are kind, modest, quietly generous people. They like people and make true blue friends, however it may take a while. Their partners need to respect the ISFPs need for the privacy they need to recharge themselves. They like to spend time with people one-on-one or with a small group of two or three others who understand them. When the ISFP gets to know you on a personal, one-on-one basis, they are warm, affectionate, a little more talkative and even humorous, telling jokes to make friends laugh. They share opinions only with people they know very well. ISFPs like to make people happy with a smile and a song, slapstick comedy or light practical joking (ice cube down the back). If nothing works, they think it is their fault and withdraw. They often make friends with those they feel will protect and stand up for them, and usually have a small group of close (often very outgoing) friends.  For love, they want someone patient who will be there for them and also stand up for them when they can't themselves, and whom they could speak their mind with without feeling foolish. However, they do not want someone to control them, as they value their freedom highly. They can be afraid of commitment at times. They take criticism personally, and feel at fault for people's reactions toward them. To show love, ISFPs would give you something they made themselves like a painting, some homemade cookies, a song dedicated to you or something they found that just happened to remind them of you. They like to be told how special and important they are to you, be specific and truthful. They aren't wordy people but can be eloquent and descriptive in their speech when they want to be.

==How to deal with an ISFP==
*Talk to them gently and in a soft voice
*Hug them often; they prefer actions rather than words to express love
*Ask them how they feel about things and what they would like to do
*Go with them on long leisurely walks alone together
*Let them have their space
*Play gentle games with them--they like competition but prefer co-op
*They like horror films because of the adrenaline rush, but anything too sad or graphic kills their happy mood.
*Make work fun, or they won't want to do it at all.
*Let them have some me-time in which they can do anything they want
*Tell them how they're talented when they doubt themselves, which could be often
*They have an affinity for soft fabrics and long walks in natural settings away from large crowds
*They like flowers and often have a favorite kind; ask them
*As sensors, they enjoy physical activities (Archery, Sports, Hiking, etc.)

==INFPs at work==
INFPs love to work behind-the-scenes and support the group.  If they feel they are appreciated for their hard, considerate work, they often enjoy themselves immensely.  Because they are often socially unsure, many find jobs they can do from home.

==INFPs in relationships==
INFPs are very sensitive beings, and oftentimes the social scene feels extremely repressive and painful for them.  They want very much to be accepted and cared for, but sometimes they become so uncomfortable that they become very nervous and feel completely out of place.  Many try to express feelings of sadness and helplessness to those close to them for support.  For lovers, they often look for outgoing, strong,caring people who can help them feel a part of things and to whom they can give their love.

==Famous INFPs==
Fyodor Dostoevsky

==Fictional INFPs==
Nicholas Rush (Stargate Universe)

Daniel Faraday (Lost)

Will Graham (Hannibal TV series)

Remus Lupin (Harry Potter)

Annalise Keating (How to Get Away with Murder)

==How to deal with an INFP==

Because the INFP tends to extrovert their iNtuition (they can reveal out loud the possibilities that they are imagining when they imagine them) to the world yet at the same time introvert their Feeling decision-making (not reveal the values and processes they really hold), they can seem to others that the possibilities they suggest are really decisions.  Because they say things (possibilities) they don't necessarily believe, it is crucial to verify with them if some of their statements are truly decisions or judgements.

In order to help the INFP feel good about themselves, it is necessary to tell them verbally that you care about them.  They need a great deal of positive affirmation and can become very self-conscious and insecure and lost without it.  Some say that they 'can't do anything right' and feel very depressed and lonely.

In conflict, keep in mind that, if pressured, the INFP may try to change the subject and escape.  It is best to treat them very gently and lightly discuss the subject at hand without seeming angry or upset with them.  When they feel very cornered, their usually sweet exterior rapidly changes and they begin to lash out.  Do not take this behaviour harshly, for this happens only under very rare circumstances and when the INFP feels they have no other choice.  If they feel they have shared their feelings in a kind and loving environment without being criticized for them, they often feel quite content and calm.

INTPs are introverts, meaning they tend to prefer relatively solitary lives. They are often uncomfortable in social gatherings, particularly large ones, which can leave them feeling somewhat drained. Although some may have many acquaintances, INTPs usually have only a few close friends, if any at all. However, this also means they tend to be nonchalant about their public image.

INTPs favor iNtuition over Sensing. As such, they tend to be more introspective than attentive to their surroundings. It is common for an INTP to daydream, or simply become lost in his or her thoughts. INTPs often enjoy contemplating interesting ideas, concepts, and possibilities due to iNtuition—their curiosity drives them. However, their senses are somewhat less refined than in other types. They may overlook details (INTPs are prone to &quot;careless errors&quot; in math), and are not often completely attuned to what is going on around them. An INTP deep in thought can be oblivious to all sorts of things, ranging from a missed meal to a cap being stolen from his or her head.

An INTP prefers Thinking over Feeling, meaning he or she tends to value logic over feelings. Although INTPs experience emotions as powerfully as other types, they almost always must see the logic behind them before acting on them. All decisions must have good reasons behind them, and INTPs rarely make good decisions without considerable thought. It is usually very important to an INTP to be as logically and grammatically accurate as possible. However, INTPs are somewhat inept at expressing feelings outwardly, sometimes causing misunderstandings. Sarcasm and cynicism are occasionally observed in INTPs.

Since INTPs have a Perceiving preference, they don't enjoy being limited by schedules or decisions. They tend to have bursts of creative energy, which can lead to extraordinary efforts, but the energy can also be short-lived. After the energy is expired, attention may be directed elsewhere, where energy may be regenerated. In other words, INTPs may have many interests due to their preference for perceiving, and these interests may come and go, or change altogether.

Being introverts, INTPs are usually very reserved.  Their iNtuition allows them to rapidly understand new concepts and to pursue a wide variety of interests. Their Thinking helps them to find the logic in a situation from an objective point of view. INTPs' Perceiving causes them to be open-ended; often thinking about a task is more rewarding than executing the task.

INTPs often feel like misfits and are not necessarily always appreciated.  Many INTPs complain of boredom, as the real world fails to measure up to the vivid experiences of their imaginations.

==INTPs at work==

INTPs make good professors, computer programmers, photographers, mathematicians, attorneys, engineers, analysts, architects, and scientists.

==INTPs in relationships==

INTPs face many tough hurdles in their relationships. Many INTPs do not focus on developing strong social skills, but even those who do will divert much of their energy into their solitary pursuits. Characterized best by the lonely adventurer, their adventures are rarely literal trips to the end of the earth (the territory of the SPs), but instead fantastic intellectual journeys.  

One study found that INTPs tend to marry other INTPs.{{Citation needed|reason=Study not found|date=June 2015}}

==How to Interact with an INTP==

* Allow him or her time to make a decision.
* Realize that small talk is not very interesting to the INTP. However, a topic which ignites the INTP's imagination can spark a good discussion.
* Try not to be easily offended. Unless you have made an enemy of the INTP, chances are the comment was not meant to hurt you.
* Be prepared to encounter a strange sense of humor, a great curiosity, and an unusual train of thought.
* Use logic as persuasion; the INTP is likely to ignore emotional appeals.
* Hear him or her out. Most INTPs don't speak up often, and may get annoyed if ignored when they do.
* Know that the INTP's energy comes in bursts, so he or she may put off chores in favor of more interesting material and then accomplish the postponed work in an extraordinarily short amount of time.
* Be aware that the INTP is highly self-critical.

*Abraham Lincoln
*Albert Einstein
*Rene Descartes
*Blaise Pascal
*William Harvey
*William James
===Fictional===

==ESFPs at work and school==
ESFPs see work as play. They like to whistle, drum, sing, talk or joke while they are doing work to keep what they are learning fun for them. This could cause teachers, mostly SJs, to feel that they are not paying attention. It could also be disturbing to people who like quiet when they think. ESFPs learn best when they are having fun. They also look at the person who is speaking to them as they can feel sound vibrations strongly. As they work they celebrate small accomplishments in what they are doing before moving on to the next, happy for what they have done, rather then being sad at what they still have to do. 
When they work with more logical things such as mathematics, they want to know how it relates to life right now. Preferring a hands-on approach, subjects like those can bore them. 
Their favorite subjects are ones that they have an interest in and ones that they can do things with and apply to the world around them. Music, drama, dance, competitive sports and computers are among many they like. They may also go into those areas when choosing their careers. Careers that may appeal to ESFPs are: actor, musician, stand up comedian, dancer, dance instructor, their favorite position in their sport of choice, gardener, painter, sculptor and chef. Sometimes though, it's hard for them to decide.

==ESFPs in relationships==
ESFPs are warm, loving, generous and sympathetic. They especially like physical affection such as hugs, kisses, petting on the head, massages, snuggles, tickles, and just being held. They show their love through those ways as well as surprising friends and loved ones with gifts. They want fun, variety, spontaneity, travel and adventure in their relationships and are usually not keen on settling down. This could be because of fear of rejection, commitment or because they found someone else. They like to keep things light and happy and not get into anything deep and lasting unless they are sure and have thought it out, which could take a while. This could cause their mates to express impatience which would make the ESFPs nervous and withdraw from them. ESFPs do not do well with anxiety, and are highly sensitive. When they can't make people smile with their charming ways and their playfulness, they feel bad as though it was their fault and leave.
When they are in their best mood, they are seen as bouncy, hyperactive and childlike. They go from one activity to another so they won't be bored. When feeling their worst, they are moody, likely to beat themselves up (physically and/or mentally), call themselves unintelligent, think nobody takes them seriously and feel better after a good cry.

==How to deal with an ESFP==
Explain things clearly, Appeal to their common sense, Do something they enjoy with them, Discuss things over a break in the action and then get right back into the fun, give them lots of tlc.

==Recognizing an ENTP==

ENTPs are typically friendly and often charming. They usually want to be seen as clever and may try to impress others with their quick wit and incisive humor. They are curious about the world around them, and want to know how things work. However, for the ENTP, the rules of the universe are made to be broken. They like to find the loopholes and figure out how they can work the system to their advantage. This is not to say the Visionary is malicious: they simply find rules limiting, and believe there is probably a better, faster, or more interesting way to do things that hasn’t been thought of before.
The ENTP is characteristically entrepreneurial and may be quick to share a new business idea or invention. They are confident and creative, and typically excited to discuss their many ingenious ideas. The ENTP’s enthusiasm for innovation is infectious, and they are often good at getting other people on board with their schemes. However, they are fundamentally “big-picture” people, and may be at a loss when it comes to recalling or describing details. They are typically more excited about exploring a concept than they are about making it reality, and can seem unreliable if they don’t follow through with their many ideas.

==ENTP following traits==

* Project-oriented
* Enjoy generating ideas and theories
* Creative and ingenius
* Bright and capable
* Flexible and Diverse
* Excellent communication skills
* Enjoy debating issues with other people
* Excellent people skills
* Natural leaders, but do not like to control people
* Resist being controlled by people
* Lively and energetic; able to motivate others
* Highly value knowledge and competence
* Logical, rational thinkers
* Able to grasp difficult concepts and theories
* Enjoy solving difficult problems
* Dislike confining schedules and environments
* Dislike routine, detailed tasks

==Research on ENTP==

Interesting facts about the ENTP:
* On personality trait scales, scored as Enterprising, Friendly, Resourceful, Headstrong, Self-Centered, and Independent
* Least likely of all types to suffer heart disease and hypertension
* Least likely of all types to report stress associated with family and health
* Scored among highest of all types in available resources for coping with stress
* Overrepresented among those with Type A behavior
* Among highest of all types on measures of creativity
* One of two types most frequent among violators of college alcohol policy
* Among types most dissatisfied with their work, despite being among the types with highest income
* Commonly found in careers in science, management, technology, and the arts

==ENTP Personality Type Development &amp; Functional Stack==

* '''Dominant Function: Extraverted Intuition (Ne)''': Extraverted Intuition (Ne) is a novelty-seeking function. At first glance, Se and Ne types may seem fairly similar (such conflation can be seen, for instance, in the Enneagram Seven), since both ESPs and ENPs can be outwardly active, energetic, and playful. Ne differs from Se, however, in that it is more concerned with ideas, connections, and possibilities than it is with novel sensations or material goods. Extraverted Intuition can function either perceptively or expressively. The verbal expression of Ne amounts to something like “brainstorming aloud.” Although typically not to the same extent as ENFPs, when orating aloud, ENTPs may not always seem to “have a point,” quickly bouncing from one idea to the next. In many cases, “the point” is for ENTPs to find their way to a judgment, but they must first explore the options by way of their Ne. While others may distrust the seemingly arbitrary or haphazard ways of Ne, ENTPs realize its value, recognizing that in time, truth or wisdom will reveal itself. ENTPs’ primary job then, is to employ and express their Ne, trusting that it will lead them in the right direction. With that said, some ENTPs are much more cogent and streamlined in their expressions than others. Many ENTPs learn to develop and express themselves via their tertiary function, Extraverted Feeling (Fe), which is not at all random, but more direct and coherent.
Ne also works receptively, gathering information from without. Unlike Se, it does not gather overt information, but goes beyond or looks behind sensory data. It is what allows ENTPs to discern otherwise hidden patterns, possibilities, and potentials. Ne is constantly scanning for new connections and patterns. They often employ this receptive side of their Ne in activities like reading, watching movies, and conversing with others.
Because it is an extraverted function, Ne is more divergent, extensive, and open-ended than Introverted Intuition (Ni). Ni is more intensive and convergent, conferring a greater sense of conviction and closure. Once Ni has done its work, INJs are apt to feel there is a single correct solution. Ne, by contrast, is disposed to multiplying rather than reducing the number of possible options or solutions. Only through use of their auxiliary Ti can ENTPs move toward convergence. Ne also confers open-mindedness. It helps ENTPs see truth on both sides of an issue without forming unwarranted judgments or premature conclusions. It also contributes an openness to alternative or Bohemian lifestyles, allowing ENTPs to entertain options such as vegetarianism or joining a commune.
Ne also resists excessive external structuring, which can feel like an imposition to ENTPs’ sense of personal freedom and autonomy. ENTPs scoff at what they see as unnecessary or overly rigid rules, regulations, or procedures. They also dislike unchanging or sterile surroundings. When the environment is too bland or sterile, they can quickly become bored and restless. Like other NPs, ENTPs can have a love-hate relationship with their Ne. They love the fact that it helps them remain open-minded, to see the bigger picture, and to appreciate different options and perspectives. They also enjoy its attendant sense of adventure, expectancy, and wonderment toward life’s mysteries. But Ne also has its challenges. It can make it difficult for ENTPs to feel calm and satisfied, to arrive at firm conclusions, or to feel confident in their decision-making.

* '''Auxiliary Function: Introverted Thinking (Ti)''':As dominant Perceivers, ENTPs are disposed to taking a more passive approach to life, particularly with regard to the outside world. Like other EPs, they are content to remain in a mode of open Perceiving until they are prompted, whether inwardly or outwardly, to employ their auxiliary Judging function, Introverted Thinking (Ti). When ENTPs feel compelled to engage their Ti, they become more inwardly focused and intense, similar to the typical mode of operation for INTPs. But because Ti is introverted in its direction, onlookers may fail to notice this more rational side of the ENTP.
Ti involves the application of logic and reason for the sake of understanding a given situation, system, or problem. It also works to bring structure and order to the inner world. This inner structuring grants ENTPs a good sense of inner control.
When engaging their Ti, ENTPs dig into the background of their thoughts to better understand their origins and to ensure their ideas are logical. Like INTPs, they can quickly find inconsistencies or logical shortcomings in a given theory or argument. They excel at identifying exceptions or imagining scenarios in which the proposed explanation might breakdown. They find it easier to identify logical shortcomings or inconsistencies —to assert what is not true—than to confidently assert what is true.
The difference between Ti in ENTPs versus INTPs is its place in the functional stack. For INTPs, it comes first, which makes them quicker to inwardly judge. INTPs then use their auxiliary Ne to open up and further explore their initial judgments. In ENTPs, the order is reversed. Rather than starting with an initial judgment or presumption like INTPs, they approach things through the fresh eyes of Intuition. They then employ their Ti to analyze and enhance the logic and structuring of their Ne perceptions.
In addition to the different ordering of their functional stacks, ENTPs, as dominant Perceivers, can more easily leave things open-ended or ambiguous than INTPs can. Their Ne dominance also makes them more open to “playing” than INTPs are. I once administered a values inventory and was surprised when a couple ENTPs marked “having fun” as one of their top priorities in life. To most INTPs, whose dominant Ti compels them to take life seriously, such a response smacks of hedonism and would likely be among their lowest ranked values. ENTPs’ dominant Ne may also confer a greater interest in the arts and culture than typically seen among INTPs
The difference between Ti and Fi seems largely a matter of interests and emphases. Fi types (FPs) are more concerned and skilled with moral judgments (Fi) than logical ones (Ti). They judge in terms of good and bad, love and hate, like and dislike. TPs, in contrast, start out with a need for sound logic (Ti) and are generally less concerned with matters of taste or morality upfront. They think less in terms of love and hate than reasonable and unreasonable, logical and illogical. With that said, since T and F are adjacent in ENTPs’ functional stack, it can sometimes be a bit tricky, especially early in their development, to tease out their T-F preference.

* '''Tertiary Function: Extraverted Feeling (Fe)''': Fe is the most interpersonal of all the functions, striving for interpersonal peace, harmony, and understanding. This not only involves attending to what is said, but also how something is said. While ENTPs may be less disturbed by or sensitive to external disharmony than some other types, they still work, even if largely unwittingly, to cultivate good feelings in the environment.
We can also approach ENTPs’ Fe more theoretically. Namely, since Fe is their preferred extraverted Judging function and falls lower in their functional stack, ENTPs are less comfortable extroverting judgments (Fe) than keeping them to themselves (Ti). This can lead ENTPs, along with other Perceiving types, to habitually defer to others’ wishes rather than asserting their own. And because ENTPs have strong minds, they may grow inwardly resentful of those they see as trying to control them. Granted, they are generally more self-assertive than IPs are, but their discomfort in deploying Fe can still get kindle problems in ENTPs’ relationships.

* '''Inferior Function: Introverted Sensing (Si)''': As is true of other types, ENTPs can be easily blinded to the degree to which their inferior function impacts their decisions and behavior. ENTPs seeking self-knowledge and personal growth must work to understand the ways their inferior function, Introverted Sensing (Si), manifests in their personality. Introverted Sensing is best understood when juxtaposed with its functional opposite, Ne. Despite their oppositional nature, when considered together, Ne and Si constitute a meaningful whole. As we have seen, Ne explores new ideas and possibilities. Si, by contrast, is concerned with preserving the past. Ne knows no limits, seeing infinite options and possibilities, while Si sees clearly defined limits as determined by past precedent. Ne is liberal and unfettered, Si conservative and careful. What is fascinating is that all of these opposing forces can exist within the same personality type. ENTPs tend to consciously identify with the needs and values of their Ne, while their subconscious pushes for the interests of Si.
When using Ne, ENTPs can be rather oblivious to details. They may fail to effectively attend to the concrete details of daily life, such as forgetting to the bills, being careless with their diet, or not taking enough exercise. When engrossed in a creative project, however, ENTPs can look like INTJs, becoming perfectionistic and obsessive over details. As N-dominants, it can be difficult for them to accept anything less than perfection when it comes to the physical embodiment (S) of their vision or ideas (N). A most overlooked feature of Si is its perception and awareness of internal bodily sensations—the body as felt and experienced from within. But since Si is ENTPs’ inferior function, they may feel out of touch with their inner body. To compensate, they may grant too much attention to certain physical sensations, making them more susceptible to hypochondriasis or psychosomatic illnesses, in which an increased focus on bodily sensations cultivates or heightens symptoms.
N and S also have a temporal element. Si concerns itself with the past, while Ne is focused on future possibilities and potentials. ENTPs’ Si can confer an interest in the details of history. They also enjoy using their Ne to explore historical meanings, interpretations, and implications. This is why many ENTPs take up politics or journalism, careers that allow them to use their knowledge of history to analyze current events and speculate about the future. ENTPs also experience tension between the traditional (Si) and the novel or unconventional (Ne). This is especially common for ENTPs in Phases I and II of their type development. To some degree, they remain attached and drawn to their childhood traditions (Si). At the same time, however, their Ne and Ti may encourage them to deconstruct and even rebel against those traditions. This can engender identity confusion in ENTPs, unsure of the degree to which they should break from their childhood traditions versus reconceiving themselves. Such struggles can leave ENTPs with questions like: Should I opt for family life or an unconventional lifestyle? Should I pursue the security of a conventional career (Si) or something more creative and potentially risky (Ne)?    
In considering such questions, ENTPs, need to ensure they are leading with their dominant function rather than their inferior. As N-dominants, ENTPs’ best strengths involve creatively exploring ideas, theories, and connections. To best utilize these strengths, they need to ensure they are not allowing their inferior Si to impose undue limits or boundaries on their explorations. They are generally better off using their Ne, as well as the reasoning capacities of their Ti, to hash out truth, rather than deferring to Si traditions.

==ENTps at work==
ENTps have straightforward expectations in the workplace, but ones that aren't always easy to meet. Strong believers in meritocracy, people with the ENTp personality type expect their ideas to be heard by those above them, expect robust debate among their peers, and demand that those they manage offer up new solutions and ideas regardless of their positions. While this isn't always how things play out in reality, ENTPs know what to look for, and can avoid those strictly hierarchical institutions that they would otherwise struggle with.

==ENTp Subordinates==

This dynamic is clearest with ENTp subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers' ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. ENTPs back this unorthodox behavior with their keen minds and curiosity, and are as capable of adopting new methods as they are of suggesting others do so. If something can be done better, it's as simple as that, and ENTP personalities gladly take criticism, so long as it's logical and performance-oriented.

The biggest challenge for ENTp subordinates is that it is often the fate of the &quot;lower&quot; positions to implement the details, do the dirty work and follow through on plans set out by their managers. This couldn't be further from what ENTPs prefer to spend their time on – they can't stand simple, routine work, and monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. Things go over much better if managers are able to properly utilize ENTPs' preference for tackling complex challenges and diverse projects.

==ENTp Colleagues==

It is as colleagues that ENTps prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate and over-analysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues crazy, but serve as stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation ENTps bring. Nothing bothers people with the ENTp personality type more than getting out of a meeting where everyone agreed with the first plan presented, only to hear everyone complain about how stupid the plan was ten minutes later – but they &quot;didn't want to make waves&quot;. ENTps strive for honest, direct and objective assessments of these ideas, so much so that they often earn reputations for their insensitivity and condescension.

Luckily ENTps know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor and outgoing nature win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations with ENTp personalities are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to person for tough problems that stump more rote approaches. Peer-to-peer relationships with ENTPs aren't always easy, but it's tough to argue that they don't work.

ENTp Managers

While not always their goal, management is often where ENTPs are most at home, allowing them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans. ENTps are open-minded and flexible managers, not just granting but also expecting the same freedom of thought that they themselves enjoy. This can lead to disorder, conflicting ideas and approaches being put forward, but ENTps are also great at accurately and objectively assessing which plan is likely to be most effective.

This doesn't always make friends, but being liked is less ENTps' goal than being respected and seen as intelligent and capable. And liked or no, people with this personality type hold firm ground in rational debates, making them fearsome advocates for their teams. The challenge for ENTps is focus, as they may find themselves jumping from project to project in a quest for challenge and excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details of their existing goals and obligations.

==ENTps in relationships==

ENTp's love to be in relationships, and are very loyal and great at managing life, but will not just be in a relationship just to be in a relationship. ENTp's like to think they are the caretakers, and will do so for the most part, but for a true relationship with them, one needs to get past the strong exterior and nourish their underlying needs, which they may never tell you. Massage is a great way to get an ENTp comfortable. They are shy at first and never feel 100% accepted in social settings, although they tend to be the belle of the ball. They are interesting to talk to, and find the best friendship in those who have good conversation. ENTp friend are active, like going for walks, doing sports, going on adventures and trips. Love and relationships can be the best or the worst for an ENTp, as love can inspire and drive them, but can also drive them insane. Not feeling accepted can make an  ENTp shy away and hide. Happy mediums can and should be found in relationships. ENTp's get very invested in their work, ideas or passions. If something is bothering them, it never leaves their mind. If you've found an ENTp who gets inspired by you, hold on for a wild ride, your ENTp will be wildly successful and needs a sexy partner to come home to and escape with.


Loyalty, support, emotional feedback – these are not what ENTps look for in their friendships. The last thing people with the ENTp personality type want to hear is &quot;you're right&quot;, not unless they have absolutely earned the distinction in a heated round of intellectual debate. If they're wrong, ENTps want to be told so, and they want every detail of the faults in their logic to be laid bare, partly in their quest for oftentimes arbitrary truth, and partly just so they have to work to defend that logic with counterpoint and parry.

It's often easy for ENTps to test compatibility with a potential friend – they just need to test combatability. ENTp personalities are quick-witted, and their primary means of expressing this is in the form of arguments and discussions, where they will easily spend an entire evening debating an idea they may not even believe in.

These debates are never taken personally, no matter how heated they become or how striking the disagreement. Much as an athlete competes for the physical exertion and the spirit of competition itself, ENTps debate for the sake of intellectual stimulation and for the debate itself, and even in overwhelming victory or crushing defeat, it's never about dominance, only inspiration to try harder next time.

==ENTp Strengths==

* '''Knowledgeable''' – ENTps rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn't usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the ENTP personality type just find it fascinating.
* '''Quick Thinkers''' – ENTps have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents', as they see fit.
* '''Original''' – Having little attachment to tradition, ENTp personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, ENTps respond with unabashed glee.
* '''Excellent Brainstormers''' – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to ENTps as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don't work and presenting ever more possibilities, ENTPs are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.
* '''Charismatic''' – People with the ENTp personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.
* '''Energetic''' – When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, ENTps can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.

==ENTp Weaknesses==

* '''Very Argumentative''' – If there's anything ENTps enjoy, it's the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which ENTp personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.
* '''Insensitive''' – Being so rational, ENTps often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others' tolerance levels. People with this personality type don't really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.
* '''Intolerant''' – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, ENTps are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it's not worth bothering with.
* '''Can Find It Difficult to Focus''' – The same flexibility that allows ENTps to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for ENTps, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.
* '''Dislike Practical Matters''' – ENTps are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn't just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, ENTp personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.

Quick to begin planning.  They constantly scope the area for logical problems to solve.  It triggers their bank of 'ideas', allowing them to associate and classify objects.  Mostly an intuitive creature, the raw 'idea', can be used, or it can receive further stimulus from Extraverted Sensing, and lastly. Introverted Feeling. 

A complicated, genius, logical, strategy, is born!  They intensely bury their efforts into the goal at hand, and tirelessly work against it.  Those working with them, soon recognize the ENTJ's competence and importance, and rely on it for many small issues.  The ENTJ is now needed.  With the deadline of a complex project at hand, they continue to pour in more effort, struggling against the clock, and seeking closure.  

Quick to stand up for any thing they find logical, they come off opinionated, aggressive, and highly extroverted at work.  Their identity doesn't matter in the work place.  Work matters.  Production matters.  Capital matters.  Their emotions don't matter!  If they push their limits, and establish a dominant role, as a person with high influence, they are &quot;winning the fight&quot;.  Promotions are looked at as 'positive re-enforcement'.  'Good job, you are so smart!' is liable to make an ENTJ feel like a little kid, which is not what you want to do.

As the deadline of the project gets close, they push for any extra addrenaline they can find in them.  Twenty-four hours a day is a common shift length.  All in time, to finish 2 days early, in the 3 month battle.

For that moment, they have the opportunity to seize the reward they deserve for their efforts!

In general, they are too intense for standard, procedure-based, punch in, punch out, work styles.  They would much rather take on a project, establishing an impossible goal, and obtain it, whenever he/she feels like working on it. 

They want to be heard, taken seriously, believed in, and trusted.  However, don't ask them for their &quot;fully detailed plans,&quot; - only they know what they truly mean.  When working in a team, he/she'll tell you what you need to know, just believe them and be ready to give information upon request.

# Dhritarashtra said: Assembled on the field of Dharma, O Sanjaya, on the field of the Kurus, eager to fight, what did my people and the Pandavas do?
# Sanjaya said: Then Duryodhana the prince, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, approached his master and spoke these words:
# Behold, O Master, this great army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by your wise pupil, the son of Drupada.
# Here are men of valour, mighty archers, the equals of Bhima and Arjuna - in battle Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, the maharathi.
# Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kashi, aIso Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Shaibya, chief among men.
# Yudhamanyu, the brave; the valiant Uttamauja; also the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi - all of them maharathis.
# Know well, O noblest of the twice- born, those who are pre-eminent among us. I speak to you of the leaders of my army that you may know them.
# Thyself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, victor in battle; Ashvatthama and Vikarna and also the son of Somadatta.
# And many other heroes there are, armed with various weapons, all skilled in warfare, who have risked their lives for me.
# Unlimited is that army of ours commanded by Bhishma, whereas this their army commanded by Bhima is limited.
# Therefore, stationed in your respective positions on all fronts, support Bhishma alone, all of you!
# The aged Kuru, the glorious grandsire (Bhishma), gave a loud roar like a lion and blew his conch, gladdening the heart of Duryodhana.
# Then quite suddenly conches, horns, kettledrums, tabors and drums blared forth, and the sound was tumultuous.
# Then, seated in a great chariot yoked to white horses, Madhava (Lord Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) also blew their gIorious conches.
# Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna) blew Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew Devadatta, Bhima of powerful deeds blew his great conch Paundra.
# Prince Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew Sughosha and Manipushpaka.
# The King of Kashi, the great archer, and Shikhandi, the maharathi, Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unsubdued.
# Drupada, as well as the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, O Lord of earth, all blew their different conches.
# That tumultuous uproar, reverberating through earth and sky, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's men.
# Then, seeing the sons of Dhritarashtra drawn up in battle order, as missiles where about to fly, the son of Pandu (Arjuna), whose banner bore the image of Hanuman, took up his bow.
# Then, O Lord of earth, he spoke these words to Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna): Draw up my chariot between the two armies, O Achyuta.
# So that I may observe those who stand here eager for battle and know with whom I should fight in this toil of war.
# Let me look on those who are assembled here ready to fight, eager to accomplish in battle what is dear to the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.
# Sanjaya said: O Bharata, thus invoked by Gudakesha (Arjuna), Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna), having drawn up the magnificent chariot between the two armies,
# Before Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth, said: Partha (Arjuna)! behold these Kurus gathered together.
# The son of Pritha (Arjuna) saw there before him uncles and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons and grandsons and many friends as well.
# Fathers-in-law and well-wishers also in both the armies. Then that son of Kunti (Arjuna), seeing all these kinsmen thus present,
# Possessed by extreme compassion, spoke this in grief: Seeing these my kinsmen, O Krishna, gathered, eager to fight,
# My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body quivers and my hair stands on end.
# Gandiva (the bow) slips from my hand and even my skin burns all over; I am unable to stand and my mind seems to whirl.
# And I see adverse omens, O Keshava (Lord Krishna), nor can I see good from killing my kinsmen in battle.
# I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor a kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what avail will a kingdom be to us, or enjoyments, or even life, O Govinda?
# Those for whose sake we desire a kingdom, enjoyments and comforts are here on the battlefield, having resigned their lives and riches.
# Teachers, uncles, sons and likewise grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other kinsmen.
# O Madhusudana (Lord Krishna), these I do not wish to kill - though killed myself - even for the sake of sovereignty of the three worlds, how much less for this world.
# What happiness could come to us from slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana (Lord Krishna)? Only sin could come upon us through killing these aggressors.
# Therefore it would not be right for us to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our own kinsmen. How should we be happy after killing our own people, O Madhava?
# Although, their minds clouded by greed, they see no wrong in bringing destruction to the family and no sin in treachery to friends,
# How should we not know to turn away from this sin, we who clearly see the wrong in bringing destruction upon the family, O Janardana ?
# The age-old family dharmas are lost in the destruction of a family. Its dharma lost, adharma overtakes the entire family.
# When adharma prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt, and with the corruption of women, O Varshneya, intermixture of castes arises.
# This intermixture leads only to hell, both for the family and its destroyers. Their forefathers fall as well, when the offerings of the Pindodaka cease.
# Through the wrongs done by the destroyers of the family in causing the intermixing of castes, the immemorial dharmas of caste and family become extinct.
# Men whose family dharmas have lapsed, so we have heard, O Janardana (Lord Krishna), necessarily live in hell.
# Alas! We are resolved to commit great sin in that we are prepared to slay our kinsmen out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.
# It were better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, should slay me, unresisting and unarmed in battle.
# Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus at the time of battle, casting away arrows and bows, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt; 
# Dhritarashtra nói: Assembled on the field of Dharma, O Sanjaya, on the field of the Kurus, eager to fight, what did my people and the Pandavas do?

&lt;th&gt;CHAPTER VI&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;CHƯƠNG VI&lt;/th&gt;

# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; He who performs action that ought to be done, without depending on the fruit of action, he is a sanyasi and he is a yogi; not he who is without fire and without activity.
# That which they call Sanyasa, know it to be Yoga, O son of Pandu, for no one becomes a yogi who has not relinquished the incentive of desire.
# Action is said to be the means for the man of thought wishing to ascend to Yoga; for the man who has ascended to Yoga, and for him alone, calmness is said to be the means.
# Only when a man does not cling to the objects of the senses or to actions, only when he has relinquished all incentive of desire, is he said to have ascended to Yoga.
# Let a man raise his self by his Self, let him not debase his Self; he alone, indeed, is his own friend, he alone his own enemy.
# He who has conquered his self by his Self alone is himself his own friend; but the Self of him who has not conquered his self will behave with enmity like a foe.
# For him who has conquered his self, who is deep in peace, the transcendent Self is steadfast in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, in honour and disgrace.
# That yogi is said to be united who is contented in knowledge and experience, unshakeable, master of the senses, who is balanced in experiencing earth, stone or gold.
# Distinguished is he who is of even intellect among well-wishers, friends and foes, among the indifferent and the impartial, among hatefuI persons and among kinsmen, among the saints as well as the sinful.
# Let the yogi always collect himself remaining in seclusion, alone, his mind and body subdued, expecting nothing, without possessions,
# In a clean place, having set his seat firm, neither very high nor very low, having placed sacred grass, deerskin and cloth one upon the other.
# Seated there on the seat, having made the mind one-pointed, with the activity of the senses and thought subdued, let him practise Yoga for self-purification.
# Steady, keeping body, head and neck upright and still, having directed his gaze to the front of his nose, without looking in any direction,
# With his being deep in peace, freed from fear, settled in the vow of chastity, with mind subdued and thought given over to Me, let him sit united realizing Me as the Transcendent.
# Ever thus collecting himself, the yogi of disciplined mind attains to peace, the supreme liberation that abides in Me.
# Yoga, indeed, is not for him who eats too much nor for him who does not eat at all, O Arjuna; it is not for him who is too much given to sleep nor yet for him who keeps awake.
# For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate of effort in actions, moderate in sleep and waking, for him is the Yoga which destroys sorrow.
# When his mind, completely settled, is established in the Self alone, when he is free from craving for any pleasure, then is he said to be united.
# A lamp which does not flicker in a windless pIace, to such is compared the yogi of subdued thought practising Union with the Self.
# That (state) in which thought, settled through the practice of Yoga, retires, in which, seeing the Self by the Self alone, he finds contentment in the Self;
# Knowing that which is infinite joy and which, lying beyond the senses, is gained by the intellect, and wherein established, truly he does not waver;
# Having gained which he counts no other gain as higher, established in which he is not moved even by great sorrow;
# Let that disunion of the union with sorrow be known by the name of Yoga (Union). This Yoga should be practised with firm resolve and heart undismayed.
# Abandoning without reserve all desires from which the incentive (to action) is born, controlling the village of the senses on every side by the mind alone.
# Let him gradually retire through the intellect possessed of patience; having established the mind in the Self, let him not think at all.
# Whatever makes the fickle and unsteady mind wander forth, from that withdrawn, let him bring it under the sway of the Self alone.[[User:Vuara/VI.27|
# For supreme happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is deep in peace, in whom the spur to activity is stilled, who is without blemish and has become one with Brahman.]]
# Ever thus collecting himself, the yogi, freed from blemish, with ease attains contact with Brahman, which is infinite joy.
# He whose self is established in Yoga, whose vision everywhere is even, sees the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self.
# He who sees Me everywhere, and sees everything in Me, I am not lost to him nor is he lost to Me.
# Established in Unity, he who worships Me abiding in all beings, in whatever way he lives, that yogi lives in Me.
# He who sees everything with an even vision by comparison with the Self, be it pleasure or pain, he is deemed the highest yogi, O Arjuna.
# Arjuna said: This Yoga described by Thee as characterized by evenness, O Madhusudana, I do not see its steady endurance, because of wavering.
# For wavering is the mind, O Krishna, turbulent, powerful and unyielding; I consider it as difficult to control as the wind.
# The Blessed Lord said: No doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind is hard to control, it is wavering, but by practice and non-attachment it is held, O son of Kunti.
# For an undisciplined man, Yoga is hard to achieve, so I consider; but it can be gained through proper means by the man of endeavour who is disciplined.
# Arjuna said: What goal does he reach, O Krishna, who is not perfected in Yoga, being endowed with faith, yet lacking effort, his mind strayed from Yoga?
# Deluded on the path to Brahman, O mighty-armed, without foothold and fallen from both, does he not perish like a broken cloud?
# Thou art able to dispel this doubt of mine completely, O Krishna. Truly, there is none save Thee who can dispel this doubt.
# The Blessed Lord said: O Partha, there is no destruction for him in this world or hereafter; for none who acts uprightly, My son, goes the way of misfortune.
# Having attained the worlds of the righteous and dwelt there for countless years, he that strayed from Yoga is born in the house of the pure and illustrious.
# Or he is born in an actual family of yogis endowed with wisdom, though such a birth as this on earth is more difficult to attain.
# There he regains that level of Union reached by the intellect in his former body, and by virtue of this, O joy of the Kurus, he strives yet more for perfection.
# By that former practice itself he is irresistibly borne on. Even the aspirant to Yoga passes beyond the Veda.
# But the yogi who strives with zeal, purified of all sin and perfected through many births, thereupon reaches the transcendent goal.
# A yogi is superior to the austere; he is deemed superior even to men of knowledge. A yogi is superior to men of action. Therefore be a yogi, O Arjuna.
# And of all yogis, I hold him most fully united who worships Me with faith, his inmost Self absorbed in Me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">CHAPTER V


# Arjuna said: Thou praisest, O Krishna, renunciation of action and Yoga (of action) at the same time. Tell me decisively which is the better of these two.
# The Blessed Lord said: Both renunciation and the Yoga of action lead to the supreme good. But of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.
# Know him to be ever a man of renunciation who neither hates nor desires; free from the pairs of opposites, he is easily released from bondage, O mighty-armed.
# The ignorant, and not the wise, speak of the path of knowledge (Sankhya) and the path of action (Yoga) as different. He who is properly established even in one gains the fruit of both.
# The state attained by men on the path of knowledge is also reached by those on the path of action. He who sees Sankhya and Yoga to be one, verily he sees.
# Renunciation is indeed hard to attain without Yoga, O mighty-armed. The sage who is intent on Yoga comes to Brahman without long delay.
# Intent on Yoga, pure of spirit, he who has fully mastered himself and has conquered the senses, whose self has become the Self of all beings, he is not involved even while he acts.
# {Verses 8, 9 together}
# One who is in Union with the Divine and who knows the Truth will maintain 'l do not act at all'. In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing, speaking, letting go, seizing and even in opening and closing the eyes, he holds simply that the senses act among the objects of sense.
# He who acts giving over all actions to the universal Being, abandoning attachment, is untouched by sin as a lotus leaf by water.
# By means of the body, by the mind, by the intellect and even by the senses alone, yogis, abandoning attachment, perform action for self-purification.
# He who is united with the Divine, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains to lasting peace. He who is not united with the Divine, who is spurred by desire, being attached to the fruit of action, is firmly bound.
# Having renounced all action by the mind, the dweller in the body rests in happiness, in the city of nine gates, neither acting nor causing action to be done.
# The Lord creates neither the authorship of action nor the action of beings; nor does He create the link between (the doer), the action and its fruit Nature carries this out.
# The all-pervading Intelligence does not accept the sin or even the merit of anyone. Wisdom is veiled by ignorance. Thereby creatures are deluded.
# But in those in whom that ignorance is destroyed by wisdom, wisdom, like the sun, illumines That which is transcendent.
# Their intellect rooted in That, their being established in That, intent on That, wholly devoted to That, cleansed of all impurities by wisdom, they attain to a state from which there is no return.
# In a brahmin endowed with learning and humility, in a cow, in an elephant, in a dog and even in one who has lost his caste, the enlightened perceive the Same.
# Even here, in this life, the universe is conquered by those whose mind is established in equanimity. FIawless, indeed, and equally present everywhere is Brahman. Therefore they are established in Brahman.
# He who neither greatly rejoices on obtaining what is dear to him, nor grieves much on obtaining what is unpleasant, whose intellect is steady, who is free from delusion, he is a knower of Brahman, established in Brahman.
# He whose self is untouched by externaI contacts knows that happiness which is in the Self. His self joined in Union with Brahman, he enjoys eternal happiness.
# All pleasures born of contact are only sources of sorrow; they have a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti. The enlightened man does not rejoice in them.
# He who is able, even here, before liberation from the body, to resist the excitement born of desire and anger, is united with the Divine. He is a happy man.
# He whose happiness is within, whose contentment is within, whose sight is all within, that yogi, being one with Brahman, attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness.
# The seers, whose sins are destroyed, whose doubts are dispelled, who are self-controlled and take delight in doing good to all creatures, attain eternal freedom in divine consciousness.
# Disciplined men, freed from desire and anger, who have disciplined their thoughts and have realized the Self, find eternal freedom in divine consciousness everywhere.
# Having left external contacts outside; with the vision within the eyebrows; having balanced the ingoing and outgoing breaths that flow through the nostrils,
# The sage, whose senses, mind and intellect are controlled, whose aim is liberation, from whom desire, fear and anger have departed, is indeed for ever free.
# Having known Me as the enjoyer of yagyas and austerities, as the great Lord of all the world, as the friend of all beings, he attains to peace.</text>

&lt;font color=blue&gt;CHƯƠNG IV&lt;/font&gt;

# The Blessed Lord said: I proclaimed this imperishable Yoga to Vivaswat, Vivasvat declared it to Manu and Manu told it to Ikshvaku.
# Thus having received it one from another, the royal sages knew it. With the long lapse of time, O scorcher of enemies, this Yoga has been lost to the world.
# This same age-old Yoga, which is indeed the supreme secret, I have today declared to you because you are my devotee and friend.
# Arjuna said: Later was Thy birth and earlier the birth of Vivasvat: how am I to understand this saying that Thou didst proclaim it in the beginning ?
# The Blessed Lord said: Many births have passed for Me and for you also, O Arjuna. I know them all but you know them not, O scorcher of enemies.
# Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, though Lord of all beings, yet remaining in My own nature I take birth through My own power of creation.
# Whenever dharma is in decay and adharma flourishes, O Bharata, then I create Myself.
# To protect the righteous and destroy the wicked, to establish dharma firmly, I take birth age after age.
# My birth and My activity are divine. He who knows this in very essence, on leaving the body is not reborn. He comes to Me, O Arjuna. 
# Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the austerity of wisdom, many have come to My Being.
# As men approach Me, so do I favour them; in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path.
# Those who desire fulfilment of actions here on earth make offerings to the gods, for success born of action comes quickly in the world of men.
# The fourfold order was created by Me according to the division of gunas and actions. Though I am its author, know Me to be the non-doer, immutable.
# Actions do not involve Me, nor have I any longing for the fruit of action. He who truly knows Me thus is not bound by actions.
# Having known this, even the ancient seekers of liberation performed action; therefore, do you perform action as did the ancients in olden days.
# What is action, what inaction? Even the wise are bewildered here. I shall expound to you that action, knowing which you will be freed from evil.
# Action, indeed, should be understood, wrong action should also be understood and inaction should be understood as well. Unfathomable is the course of action.
# He who in action sees inaction and in inaction sees action is wise among men. He is unifed, he has accomplished all action.
# He whose every undertaking is free from desire and the incentive thereof, whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge, him the knowers of Reality call wise.
# Having cast off attachment to the fruit of action, ever contented, depending on nothing, even though fully engaged in action he does not act at all.
# Expecting nothing, his heart and mind disciplined, having relinquished all possessions, performing action by the body alone, he incurs no sin.
# Satisfied with whatever comes unasked, beyond the pairs of opposites, free from envy, balanced in success and failure, even acting he is not bound.
# He who is freed from attachment, liberated, whose mind is established in wisdom, who acts for the sake of yagya, his action is entirely dissolved.
# Brahman is the act of offering. Brahman the oblation poured by Brahman into fire that is Brahman. To Brahman alone must he go who is fixed in Brahman through action.
# Some yogis perform yagya merely by worshipping the gods, others by offering the yagya itself into the fire that is Brahman.
# Some offer hearing and other senses in the fires of control; some offer sound and other objects of the senses in the fires of the senses.
# Others offer all the activities of the senses and of the life-breath in the fire of Yoga, which is self-control kindled by enlightenment.
# Some likewise perform yagya by means of material possessions, by austerity and by the practice of Yoga; while other aspirants of rigid vows offer as yagya their scriptual learning and knowledge.
# Others again, who are devoted to breathing exercises, pour the inward into the outward breath and the outward into the inward, having restrained the course of inhalation and exhalation.
# Yet others, restricting their food, offer breaths into breaths. All these indeed are knowers of yagya, and through yagya their sins are cast away.
# Eating the remains of the yagya, which is nectar, they reach the eternal Brahman. This world, O best of Kurus, is not for him who offers no yagya, much less the world hereafter.
# In this way yagyas of many kinds are set forth in the words of the Veda. Know them all as born of action. Thus knowing you will find release.
# Better than the yagya through material means is the yagya of knowledge, O scorcher of enemies. All action without exception, O Partha, culminates in knowledge.
# Know this: through homage, repeated inquiry and service, the men of knowledge who have experienced Reality will teach you knowledge.
# Knowing this, O son of Pandu, you will no more fall into such delusion; for through this you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me.
# Even if you were the most sinful of all sinners, you would cross over all evil by the raft of knowledge alone.
# As a blazing fire turns fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge turn all actions into ashes.
# Truly there is in this world nothing so purifying as knowledge; he who is perfected in Yoga, of himself in time finds this within himself.
# He gains knowledge who is possessed of faith, is active of purpose and has subdued the senses. Having gained knowledge, swiftly he comes to the supreme peace.
# But the man who is without knowledge, without faith and of a doubting nature perishes. For the doubting mind there is neither this world nor another nor any happiness.
# He who has renounced action by virtue of Yoga, O winner of wealth, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, who is possessed of the Self, him actions do not bind.
# Therefore, having cut asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt of yours born of ignorance and rooted in the heart, resort to Yoga. Stand up, O Bharata!

# &lt;font color=blue&gt;Đấng Thiêngliêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; I proclaimed this imperishable Yoga to Vivaswat, Vivasvat declared it to Manu and Manu told it to Ikshvaku.
# Thus having received it one from another, the royal sages knew it. With the long lapse of time, O scorcher of enemies, this Yoga has been lost to the world.
# This same age-old Yoga, which is indeed the supreme secret, I have today declared to you because you are my devotee and friend.
# Arjuna said: Later was Thy birth and earlier the birth of Vivasvat: how am I to understand this saying that Thou didst proclaim it in the beginning ?
# &lt;font color=blue&gt;Đấng Thiêngliêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; Many births have passed for Me and for you also, O Arjuna. I know them all but you know them not, O scorcher of enemies.
# Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, though Lord of all beings, yet remaining in My own nature I take birth through My own power of creation.
# Whenever dharma is in decay and adharma flourishes, O Bharata, then I create Myself.
# To protect the righteous and destroy the wicked, to establish dharma firmly, I take birth age after age.
# &lt;font color=blue&gt;Đảnsinh của Ta và tácđộng của Ta ở bậc thầnlinh. Người nào mà biết rõ tườngtận điều này, lúc rời cơthể sẽ không táisinh. Người ấy đến với Ta, Arjuna ơi. &lt;/font&gt;
# Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the austerity of wisdom, many have come to My Being.
# As men approach Me, so do I favour them; in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path.
# Those who desire fulfilment of actions here on earth make offerings to the gods, for success born of action comes quickly in the world of men.
# The fourfold order was created by Me according to the division of gunas and actions. Though I am its author, know Me to be the non-doer, immutable.
# Actions do not involve Me, nor have I any longing for the fruit of action. He who truly knows Me thus is not bound by actions.
# Having known this, even the ancient seekers of liberation performed action; therefore, do you perform action as did the ancients in olden days.
# &lt;font color=blue&gt;Thếnào là động, thếnào là tĩnh? Ngay những nhà uyênbác cũng hoangmang ở điều này. Ta sẽ giảng cho ngươi rõ về động để khi biết nó ngươi sẽ thoát khỏi tộilỗi. &lt;/font&gt;
# Action, indeed, should be understood, wrong action should also be understood and inaction should be understood as well. Unfathomable is the course of action.
# He who in action sees inaction and in inaction sees action is wise among men. He is unifed, he has accomplished all action.
# He whose every undertaking is free from desire and the incentive thereof, whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge, him the knowers of Reality call wise.
# Having cast off attachment to the fruit of action, ever contented, depending on nothing, even though fully engaged in action he does not act at all.
# Expecting nothing, his heart and mind disciplined, having relinquished all possessions, performing action by the body alone, he incurs no sin.
# Satisfied with whatever comes unasked, beyond the pairs of opposites, free from envy, balanced in success and failure, even acting he is not bound.
# He who is freed from attachment, liberated, whose mind is established in wisdom, who acts for the sake of yagya, his action is entirely dissolved.
# Brahman is the act of offering. Brahman the oblation poured by Brahman into fire that is Brahman. To Brahman alone must he go who is fixed in Brahman through action.
# Some yogis perform yagya merely by worshipping the gods, others by offering the yagya itself into the fire that is Brahman.
# Some offer hearing and other senses in the fires of control; some offer sound and other objects of the senses in the fires of the senses.
# Others offer all the activities of the senses and of the life-breath in the fire of Yoga, which is self-control kindled by enlightenment.
# Some likewise perform yagya by means of material possessions, by austerity and by the practice of Yoga; while other aspirants of rigid vows offer as yagya their scriptual learning and knowledge.
# Others again, who are devoted to breathing exercises, pour the inward into the outward breath and the outward into the inward, having restrained the course of inhalation and exhalation.
# Yet others, restricting their food, offer breaths into breaths. All these indeed are knowers of yagya, and through yagya their sins are cast away.
# Eating the remains of the yagya, which is nectar, they reach the eternal Brahman. This world, O best of Kurus, is not for him who offers no yagya, much less the world hereafter.
# In this way yagyas of many kinds are set forth in the words of the Veda. Know them all as born of action. Thus knowing you will find release.
# Better than the yagya through material means is the yagya of knowledge, O scorcher of enemies. All action without exception, O Partha, culminates in knowledge.
# Know this: through homage, repeated inquiry and service, the men of knowledge who have experienced Reality will teach you knowledge.
# Knowing this, O son of Pandu, you will no more fall into such delusion; for through this you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me.
# Even if you were the most sinful of all sinners, you would cross over all evil by the raft of knowledge alone.
# As a blazing fire turns fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge turn all actions into ashes.
# Truly there is in this world nothing so purifying as knowledge; he who is perfected in Yoga, of himself in time finds this within himself.
# He gains knowledge who is possessed of faith, is active of purpose and has subdued the senses. Having gained knowledge, swiftly he comes to the supreme peace.
# But the man who is without knowledge, without faith and of a doubting nature perishes. For the doubting mind there is neither this world nor another nor any happiness.
# He who has renounced action by virtue of Yoga, O winner of wealth, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, who is possessed of the Self, him actions do not bind.
# Therefore, having cut asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt of yours born of ignorance and rooted in the heart, resort to Yoga. Stand up, O Bharata!

      <text xml:space="preserve">CHAPTER III


# Arjuna said: If Thou considerest knowledge superior to action, O Janardana, why dost Thou spur me to this terrible deed, O Keshava?
# With these apparently opposed statements Thou dost, as it were, bewilder my intelligence. So, having made Thy decision, tell me the one by which I may reach the highest good.
# The Blessed Lord said: As expounded by Me of old, O blameless one, there are in this world two paths: the Yoga of knowledge for men of contemplation and the Yoga of action for men of action.
# Not by abstaining from action does a man achieve non-action; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.
# No one, indeed, can exist even for an instant without performing action; for everyone is helplessly driven to activity by the gunas born of Nature.
# He who sits, restraining the organs of action, and dwelling in his mind on the objects of sense, self-deluded, he is said to be a hypocrite.
# But he who, controlling the senses by the mind, without attachment engages the organs of action in the Yoga of action, he excels, O Arjuna.
# Do your allotted duty. Action is indeed superior to inaction. Even the survival of your body would not be possible without action.
# Excepting actions performed for yagya, this world is in bondage to action. For the sake of yagya engage in action free from attachment.
# In the beginning, having created men along with yagya, the Lord of Creation said: By this yagya shall ye prosper and this shall bring forth the fulfilment of desires.
# Through yagya you sustain the gods and those gods will sustain you. By sustaining one another, you will attain the highest good.
# Satisfied by the yagya, the gods will certainly bestow the enjoyments you desire. But he who enjoys their gifts without offering to them is merely a thief.
# The righteous, who eat the remains of the yagya, are freed from all sins. But the unrighteous, who prepare food for themselves alone, truly, they eat sin.
# From food creatures come into being; from rain is produced food; from yagya comes forth rain and yagya is born of action.
# Know action to be born of Brahma (the Veda). Brahma springs from the Imperishable. Therefore the all-pervading Brahma is ever established in yagya.
# He who in this life does not follow the wheel thus set revolving, whose life is sinful, whose contentment lies in the senses, he lives in vain, O Partha.
# But the man whose delight is in the Self alone, who is content in the Self, who rejoices only in the Self, for him there is no action that he need do.
# Neither has he any profit to gain in this life from the actions he has done or from the actions he has not done; nor is there any living creature on whom he need rely for any purpose.
# Therefore, remaining unattached, always do the action worthy of performance. Engaging in action truly unattached, man attains to the Supreme.
# By action alone, indeed, Janaka and others gained perfection. Moreover, even looking to the welfare of the world, you should perform action.
# Whatsoever a great man does, the very same is aIso done by other men. Whatever the standard he sets, the world follows it.
# ln the three worlds there is no action which I need do, O Partha; nor is there for Me anything worth achieving unattained; even so I am engaged in action.
# What if I did not continue unwearyingly in activity, O Partha? Men in every way follow My example.
# If I did not engage in action, these worlds would perish and I would be the cause of confusion and of the destruction of these people.
# As the unwise act out of their attachment to action, O Bharata, so should the wise act, but without any attachment, desiring the welfare of the world.
# Let not the wise man create a division in the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action. Established in Being, he should direct them to perform all actions, duly engaging in them himself.
# Actions are in every case performed by the gunas of Nature. He whose mind is deluded by the sense of 'I' holds 'l am the doer'.
# But he who knows the truth about the divisions of the gunas and their actions, O mighty-armed, knowing that it is the gunas which act upon the gunas, remains unattached.
# Those deluded by the gunas of Nature are attached to the actions of the gunas. Let not him who knows the whole disturb the ignorant who know only the part.
# Surrendering all actions to Me by maintaining your consciousness in the Self, freed from longing and the sense of 'mine', fight, delivered from the fever (of delusion).
# Those men who are possessed of faith, who do not find fault and always follow this teaching of Mine, they too are liberated from action.
# But those who find fault and do not follow My teaching: know them to be deluded about all knowledge, doomed and senseless.
# Creatures follow their own nature. Even the enlightened man acts according to his own nature. What can restraint accomplish?
# The attachment and aversion of each sense are located in the object of that sense; let no man come under their sway, for both indeed are enemies besetting his path.
# Because one can perform it, one's own dharma (though) lesser in merit, is better than the dharma of another. Better is death in one's own dharma: the dharma of another brings danger.
# Arjuna said: What is it that impels a man to commit sin, even involuntarily, as if driven by force, O Varshneya?
# The Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of rajo-guna, all-consuming and most evil. Know this to be the enemy here on earth.
# As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo is covered by the amnion, so is This covered by that.
# Wisdom is veiled by this insatiable flame of desire which is the constant enemy of the wise, O son of Kunti.
# The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat. Overshadowing wisdom by means of these, it deludes the dweller in the body.
# Therefore, having first organized the senses, O best of Bharatas, shake off this evil, the destroyer of knowledge and realization.
# The senses, they say, are subtle; more subtle than the senses is mind; yet finer than mind is intellect; that which is beyond even the intellect is he.
# Thus, having known him who is beyond the intellect, having stilled the self by the Self, O mighty-armed, slay the enemy in the form of desire, difficult to subdue.</text>

&lt;th&gt;CHAPTER II&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CHƯƠNG II&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
# Sanjaya said: To him thus overcome by compassion, full of sorrow, his eyes distressed and filled with tears, Madhusudana (Lord Krishna) spoke these words:
# The Blessed Lord said: Whence has this blemish, alien to honourable men, causing disgrace and opposed to heaven, come upon you, Arjuna, at this untimely hour?
# Partha! Yield not to unmanliness. It is unworthy of you. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies!
# Arjuna said: How shall I fight Bhishma and Drona with arrows on the battlefield, O Madhusudana? Worthy of reverence are they, O slayer of enemies!
# It is surely better to live even on alms in this world than to slay these noble-minded masters; for though they are desirous of gain, having killed them I should enjoy only blood-stained pleasures in this world.
# We do not know which is better for us: that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashta stand face to face with us. If we killed them we should not wish to live.
# My nature smitten with the taint of weakness, confused in mind about dharma, I pray Thee, tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple; teach me for I have taken refuge in Thee.
# Indeed I do not see what could dispel the grief that dries up my senses, though I should obtain an unrivalled and prosperous kingdom on earth and even lordship of the gods.
# Sanjaya said: Gudakesha, oppressor of the foe, having spoken thus to Hrishikesha, said to Govinda (Lord Krishna): 'I will not fight' and fell silent.
# To him, O Bhavata (Dhritarashtra), sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, Hrishikesha smilingly spoke these words:
# The Blessed Lord said: You grieve for those for whom there should be no grief, yet speak as do the wise. Wise men grieve neither for the dead nor for the living.
# There never was a time when I was not, nor you, nor these rulers of men. Nor will there ever be a time when all of us shall cease to be.
# As the dweller in this body passes into childhood, youth and age, so also does he pass into another body. This does not bewilder the wise.
# Contacts (of the senses) with their objects, O son of Kunti, give rise to (the experience of) cold and heat, pleasure and pain. Transient, they come and go. Bear them patiently, O Bharata!
# That man indeed whom these (contacts) do not disturb, who is even-minded in pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit for immortality, O best of men!
# The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be. The final truth about them both has thus been perceived by the seers of ultimate Reality.
# Know That to be indeed indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can work the destruction of this immutable Being.
# These bodies are known to have an end; the dweller in the body is eternal, imperishable, infinite. Therefore, O Bharata, fight!
# He who understands him to be the slayer, and he who takes him to be the slain, both fail to perceive the truth. He neither slays nor is slain.
# He is never born, nor does he ever die; nor once having been, does he cease to be. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, he is not slain when the body is slain.
# One who knows him to be indestructible, everlasting, unborn, undying, how can that man, O Partha, slay or cause anyone to slay ?
# As a man casting off worn-out garments takes other new ones, so the dweller in the body casting off worn-out bodies takes others that are new.
# Weapons cannot cleave him, nor fire burn him; water cannot wet him, nor wind dry him away.
# He is uncleavable; he cannot be burned; he cannot be wetted, nor yet can he be dried. He is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, ever the same.
# He is declared to be unmanifest, unthinkable, unchangeable; therefore knowing him as such you should not grieve.
# Even if you think of him as constantly taking birth and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, you should not grieve like this.
# Certain indeed is death for the born and certain is birth for the dead; therefore over the inevitable you should not grieve.
# Creatures are unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the middle state and unmanifest again at the end, Oh Bharata! What grief is there in this?
# One sees him as a wonder, another likewise speaks of him as a wonder, and as a wonder another hears of him. Yet even on (seeing, speaking and hearing) some do not understand him.
# He who dwells in the body of everyone is eternal and invulnerable, O Bharata; therefore you should not grieve for any creature whatsoever.
# Even if you consider your own dharma you should not waver, for there is nothing better for a kshatriya than a battle in accord with dharma.
# Happy are the kshatriyas, O Partha, who find, unsought, such a battle - an open door to heaven.
# Now, if you do not engage in this battle, which is in accord with dharma, then casting away your own dharma and good fame, you will incur sin.
# Moreover men will ever tell of your disgrace, and to a man of honour ill fame is worse than death.
# The great warriors will think you fled from battle out of fear, and they who held you in esteem will belittle you.
# Your enemies will speak many ill words of you and will deride your strength. What greater pain than this!
# Slain, you will reach heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti, stand up, resolved to fight!
# Having gained equanimity in pleasure and pain, in gain and loss, in victory and defeat, then come out to fight. Thus you will not incur sin.
# This which has been set before you is understanding in terms of Sankhya; hear it now in terms of Yoga. Your intellect established through it, O Partha, you will cast away the binding influence of action.
# In this (Yoga) no effort is lost and no obstacle exists. Even a little of this dharma delivers from great fear.
# In this Yoga, O joy of the Kurus, the resolute intellect is one-pointed, but many-branched and endlessly diverse are the intellects of the irresolute.
# The undiscerning who are engrossed in the letter of the Veda, O Partha, and declare that there is nothing else, speak flowery words.
# Filled with desires, with heaven as their goal, (their words) proclaim birth as the reward of action and prescribe many special rites for the attainment of enjoyment and power.
# The resolute state of intellect does not arise in the mind of those who are deeply attached to enjoyment and power and whose thought is captivated by those (flowery words).
# The Vedas' concern is with the three gunas. Be without the three gunas, O Arjuna, freed from duality, ever firm in purity, independent of possessions, possessed of the Self.
# To the enlightened brahmin all the Vedas are of no more use then is a small well in a place flooded with water on every side.
# You have control over action alone, never over its fruits. Live not for the fruits of action, nor attach yourself to inaction.
# Established in Yoga, O winner of wealth, perform actions having abandoned attachment and having become balanced in success and failure, for balance of mind is called Yoga.
# Far away, indeed, from the balanced intellect is the action devoid of greatness, O winner of wealth. Take refuge in the intellect. Pitiful are those who live for the fruits (of action).
# He whose intellect is united (with the Self) casts off both good and evil even here. Therefore, devote yourself to Yoga. Yoga is skill in action.
# The wise, their intellect truly united with the Self, having renounced the fruits born of their actions and being liberated from the bonds of birth, arrive at a state devoid of suffering.
# When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, then will you gain indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard.
# When your intellect, bewildered by Vedic texts, shall stand unshaken, steadfast in the Self, then will you attain to Yoga.
# Arjuna said: What are the signs of a man whose intellect is steady, who is absorbed in the Self, O Keshava? How does the man of steady intellect speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?
# The Blessed Lord said: When a man completely casts off all desires that have gone (deep) into the mind, O Partha, when he is satisfied in the Self through the Self alone, then is he said to be of steady intellect.
# He whose mind is unshaken in the midst of sorrows, who amongst pleasures is free from longing, from whom attachment, fear and anger have departed, he is said to be a sage of steady intellect.
# He who has no undue fondness towards anything, who neither exults nor recoils on gaining what is good or bad, his intellect is established.
# And when such a man withdraws his senses from their objects, as a tortoise draws in its limbs from all sides, his intellect is established.
# The objects of sense turn away from him who does not feed upon them, but the taste for them persists. On seeing the Supreme even this taste ceases.
# The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, forcibly carry away the mind even of a discerning man who endeavours (to control them).
# Having brought them all under control, let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme; for his intellect is established whose senses are subdued.
# Pondering on objects of the senses, a man develops attachment for them; from attachment springs up desire, and desire gives rise to anger.
# From anger arises delusion; from delusion unsteadiness of memory; from unsteadiness of memory destruction of intellect; through the destruction of the intellect he perishes.
# But he who is self-disciplined, who moves among the objects of the senses with the senses freed from attachment and aversion and under his own control, he attains to 'grace'.
# In 'grace' is born an end to all his sorrows. Indeed the intellect of the man of exalted consciousness soon becomes firmly established.
# He who is not established has no intellect, nor has he any steady thought. The man without steady thought has no peace; for one without peace how can there be happiness?
# When a man's mind is governed by any of the wandering senses, his intellect is carried away by it as a ship by the wind on water.
# Therefore he whose senses are all withdrawn from their objects, O mighty-armed, his intellect is established.
# That which is night for all beings, therein the self-controlled is awake. That wherein beings are awake is night for the sage who sees.
# He whom all desires enter as waters enter the ever-full and unmoved sea attains peace, and not he who cherishes desires.
# When a man acts without longing, having relinquished all desires, free from the sense of 'I' and 'mine', he attains to peace.
# This is the state of Brahman, O Partha. Having attained it, a man is not deluded. Established in that, even at the last moment, he attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;
# Sanjaya nói:&lt;/font&gt; To him thus overcome by compassion, full of sorrow, his eyes distressed and filled with tears, &lt;font color=blue&gt;Madhusudana (Đấng Krishna) nói những lời này:
# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; Whence has this blemish, alien to honourable men, causing disgrace and opposed to heaven, come upon you, Arjuna, at this untimely hour?
# Partha! Yield not to unmanliness. It is unworthy of you. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies!

# My nature smitten with the taint of weakness, confused in mind about dharma, I pray Thee, tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple; teach me for I have taken refuge in Thee.
# Indeed I do not see what could dispel the grief that dries up my senses, though I should obtain an unrivalled and prosperous kingdom on earth and even lordship of the gods.&lt;font color=blue&gt;

# To him, O Bhavata (Dhritarashtra), sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, &lt;font color=blue&gt;Hrishikesha mỉmcười nói những lời này:
# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói: Ngươi tiếcthương cho những ai không nên thươngtiếc, vậy mà nói như là thôngthái lắm. Những người minhtriết không có tiếcthương cho người sống mà cũng khôngcho kẻ chết.
# Không baogiờ mà ta không có ở đây, ngươi cũngvậy, và các quânquan vuachúa này cũngvậy. Cũng như không có baogiờ tấtcả mọingười chúngta sẽ hết cómặt ở đây.&lt;/font&gt;
# As the dweller in this body passes into childhood, youth and age, so also does he pass into another body. This does not bewilder the wise.
# Contacts (of the senses) with their objects, O son of Kunti, give rise to (the experience of) cold and heat, pleasure and pain. Transient, they come and go. Bear them patiently, O Bharata!
# That man indeed whom these (contacts) do not disturb, who is even-minded in pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit for immortality, O best of men!
# The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be. The final truth about them both has thus been perceived by the seers of ultimate Reality.
# Know That to be indeed indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can work the destruction of this immutable Being.
# These bodies are known to have an end; the dweller in the body is eternal, imperishable, infinite. Therefore, O Bharata, fight!
# He who understands him to be the slayer, and he who takes him to be the slain, both fail to perceive the truth. He neither slays nor is slain.

# This which has been set before you is understanding in terms of Sankhya; hear it now in terms of Yoga. Your intellect established through it, O Partha, you will cast away the binding influence of action.
# In this (Yoga) no effort is lost and no obstacle exists. Even a little of this dharma delivers from great fear.
# In this Yoga, O joy of the Kurus, the resolute intellect is one-pointed, but many-branched and endlessly diverse are the intellects of the irresolute.
# The undiscerning who are engrossed in the letter of the Veda, O Partha, and declare that there is nothing else, speak flowery words.
# Filled with desires, with heaven as their goal, (their words) proclaim birth as the reward of action and prescribe many special rites for the attainment of enjoyment and power.
# The resolute state of intellect does not arise in the mind of those who are deeply attached to enjoyment and power and whose thought is captivated by those (flowery words).
# The Vedas' concern is with the three gunas. Be without the three gunas, O Arjuna, freed from duality, ever firm in purity, independent of possessions, possessed of the Self.
# To the enlightened brahmin all the Vedas are of no more use then is a small well in a place flooded with water on every side.
# You have control over action alone, never over its fruits. Live not for the fruits of action, nor attach yourself to inaction.
# Established in Yoga, O winner of wealth, perform actions having abandoned attachment and having become balanced in success and failure, for balance of mind is called Yoga.
# Far away, indeed, from the balanced intellect is the action devoid of greatness, O winner of wealth. Take refuge in the intellect. Pitiful are those who live for the fruits (of action).
# He whose intellect is united (with the Self) casts off both good and evil even here. &lt;font color=blue&gt;Bởivậy, ngươi hãy đểhết tâmtrí vào Yoga. Yoga là kỹnăng tại hành.&lt;/font&gt;
# The wise, their intellect truly united with the Self, having renounced the fruits born of their actions and being liberated from the bonds of birth, arrive at a state devoid of suffering.
# When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, then will you gain indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard.
# When your intellect, bewildered by Vedic texts, shall stand unshaken, steadfast in the Self, then will you attain to Yoga.
# Arjuna said: What are the signs of a man whose intellect is steady, who is absorbed in the Self, O Keshava? How does the man of steady intellect speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?
# &lt;font color=blue&gt;Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; When a man completely casts off all desires that have gone (deep) into the mind, O Partha, when he is satisfied in the Self through the Self alone, then is he said to be of steady intellect.
# He whose mind is unshaken in the midst of sorrows, who amongst pleasures is free from longing, from whom attachment, fear and anger have departed, he is said to be a sage of steady intellect.
# He who has no undue fondness towards anything, who neither exults nor recoils on gaining what is good or bad, his intellect is established.
# And when such a man withdraws his senses from their objects, as a tortoise draws in its limbs from all sides, his intellect is established.
# The objects of sense turn away from him who does not feed upon them, but the taste for them persists. On seeing the Supreme even this taste ceases.
# The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, forcibly carry away the mind even of a discerning man who endeavours (to control them).
# Having brought them all under control, let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme; for his intellect is established whose senses are subdued.
# Pondering on objects of the senses, a man develops attachment for them; from attachment springs up desire, and desire gives rise to anger.
# From anger arises delusion; from delusion unsteadiness of memory; from unsteadiness of memory destruction of intellect; through the destruction of the intellect he perishes.
# But he who is self-disciplined, who moves among the objects of the senses with the senses freed from attachment and aversion and under his own control, he attains to 'grace'.
# In 'grace' is born an end to all his sorrows. Indeed the intellect of the man of exalted consciousness soon becomes firmly established.
# He who is not established has no intellect, nor has he any steady thought. The man without steady thought has no peace; for one without peace how can there be happiness?
# When a man's mind is governed by any of the wandering senses, his intellect is carried away by it as a ship by the wind on water.
# Therefore he whose senses are all withdrawn from their objects, O mighty-armed, his intellect is established.
# That which is night for all beings, therein the self-controlled is awake. That wherein beings are awake is night for the sage who sees.
# He whom all desires enter as waters enter the ever-full and unmoved sea attains peace, and not he who cherishes desires.
# When a man acts without longing, having relinquished all desires, free from the sense of 'I' and 'mine', he attains to peace.
# This is the state of Brahman, O Partha. Having attained it, a man is not deluded. Established in that, even at the last moment, he attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness.&lt;/td&gt;</text>

== Chapter 12. Pteridology ~ The Ferns ==

''Pteridology'' is the study of ferns&amp;mdash;plants classified in the '''Division Pterophyta''' (or Filicophyta). Ferns do not have seeds the way trees and flowering plants do. Rather, they have spores the way mosses do. The haploid spores grow small haploid organisms, which then undergo fertilization and grow the diploid fern plant directly out of the haploid gametophyte, similar to the sporophyte stalk growing out of the moss. The larger part, what we think of as the fern, is the sporophyte. The gametophyte is a small green prothallus that the sporophyte grows out of. Ferns are still tied to an aquatic environment, in that once a spore grows into a prothallus, there must be moisture enough for the egg in the prothallus to be fertilized by swimming, flagellated fern sperm.

Having a large sporophyte allows ferns to produce many more spores than a moss could- recall that each sporophyte on a moss only carried one sporangia. Producing many more propagules increased fern presence and dominance.
Besides having a larger sporophyte generation, ferns have many important adaptations that increase their capabilities above the mosses. Ferns have roots, which, unlike moss rhizoids, not only anchor, but take up nutrients. Ferns are vascular plants, with lignified vascular tissues. These allow active water transport. That water transport along with the strength of the ligified cells allow ferns to be much larger than their moss ancestors.
At one point, ferns and fern trees were the most advanced plant life, and grew even larger than ferns today do, with great size and variety of ferns. There were no flowering plants in the early cretaceous- the first forests of the dinosaurs were composed of fern trees.

=== Sporophyte Structure ===

==Evolution and ferns==

Ferns have a big advantage over the mosses in their vascular tissue. They can grow taller, and can exist in more diverse environments. This is a trend that will continue in evolution, eventually leading to the rise of such large sporophyte generations as the great sequoia trees. But if ferns are so much more fit for survival, why are there still mosses? And if a larger sporophyte generation is more fit, why haven't sequoias become dominant enough to eliminate the ferns? While there are clear benefits to a larger sporophyte generation, in some recurring natural situations, natural selection favors mosses over ferns or ferns over trees. Spores are better at spreading by wind than many seeds are, for instance. So while in the long term, the protection of a seed allows seed plants  to be dominant on the planet, in many situations the lightness and transport of a spore is still efficient in spreading ferns.

There are two gena that have showed immense diversity in the division Pteridophyta.Selaginella and Equisetum have been identified to be the only gena that are heterosporous.

== Introduction ==

The first law is a statement of energy conservation.
The rise in temperature of a substance when work is done is well known.
Thus work can be completely converted to heat.
However, we observe that in nature, we don't see the conversion in the other direction spontaneously.

The statement of the second law is facilitated by using the concept of ''heat engines''.
Heat engines work in a cycle and convert heat into work.
A ''thermal reservoir'' is defined as a system which is in equilibrium and large enough so that heat transferred to and from it does not change its temperature appreciably.

=== Heat Engine ===

Heat engines work between two thermal reservoirs, the low temperature reservoir and the high temperature reservoir.
The performance of a heat engine is measured by its ''thermal efficiency'', which is defined as the ratio of work output to heat input, ''i.e.'', ''&amp;eta; = W/Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''W'' is the net work done, and ''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is heat transferred from the high temperature reservoir.

=== Heat Pumps ===

Heat pumps transfer heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature reservoir using external work, and can be considered as reversed heat engines.

== Statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics ==
=== Kelvin-Planck Statement ===

&quot;It is impossible to construct a heat engine which will operate continuously and convert all the heat it draws from a reservoir into work.&quot;

In other words,
&quot;It is impossible to have a heat engine which works in cycle and does work by exchanging heat with only one reservoir.&quot;

=== Clausius Statement ===

&quot;It is impossible to construct a heat pump which will transfer heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature reservoir without using external work.&quot;

In other words,
&quot;It is impossible for heat to flow from a low temperature (sink) to a high temperature (source) without external work.&quot;

=== PMM2 ===

A ''perpetual motion machine of the second kind'', or ''PMM2'' is one which converts all the heat input into work while working in a cycle.
A PMM2 has an ''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 1.

=== Equivalence of Clausius and Kelvin-Planck Statements ===

[[Image:clausius Engineering Thermodynamics.png|Kelvin-Planck from Clausius]]

Suppose we can construct a heat pump which transfers heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature one without using external work.
Then, we can couple it with a heat engine in such a way that the heat removed by the heat pump from the low temperature reservoir is the same as the heat rejected by the heat engine, so that the combined system is now a heat engine which converts heat to work without any external effect.
This is thus in violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law.

[[Image:kelplank Engineering Thermodynamics.png|Clausius from Kelvin-Planck]]

Now suppose we have a heat engine which can convert heat into work without rejecting heat anywhere else.
We can combine it with a heat pump so that the work produced by the engine is used by the pump.
Now the combined system is a heat pump which uses no external work, violating the Clausius statement of the second law.

Thus, we see that the Clausius and Kelvin-Planck statements are equivalent, and one necessarily implies the other.

== Carnot Cycle ==

Nicholas Sadi Carnot devised a reversible cycle in 1824 called the ''Carnot cycle'' for an engine working between two reservoirs at different temperatures.
It consists of two reversible isothermal and two reversible adiabatic processes.
For a cycle 1-2-3-4, the working material
# Undergoes isothermal expansion in 1-2 while absorbing heat from high temperature reservoir
# Undergoes adiabatic expansion in 2-3
# Undergoes isothermal compression in 3-4, and
# Undergoes adiabatic compression in 4-1.

[[Image:pvcarnot Engineering Thermodynamics.png|Carnot Cycle P-V Diagram]]

Heat is transferred to the working material during 1-2 (''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') and heat is rejected during 3-4 (''Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'').
The thermal efficiency is thus ''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = W/Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Applying first law, we have, ''W = Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', so that ''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''.

''Carnot's principle'' states that
# No heat engine working between two thermal reservoirs is more efficient than the Carnot engine, and
# All Carnot engines working between reservoirs of the same temperature have the same efficiency.

The proof by contradiction of the above statements come from the second law, by considering cases where they are violated.
For instance, if you had a Carnot engine which was more efficient than another one, we could use that as a heat pump (since processes in a Carnot cycle are reversible) and combine with the other engine to produce work without heat rejection, to violate the second law.
A corollary of the Carnot principle is that ''Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is purely a function of ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', the reservoir temperatures.
Or,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \phi
  \left(
    t_1, t_2
  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Thermodynamic Temperature Scale ==

Lord Kelvin used Carnot's principle to establish the thermodynamic temperature scale which is independent of the working material.
He considered three temperatures, ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''t&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', such that ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;gt; ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

As shown in the previous section, the ratio of heat transferred only depends on the temperatures.
Considering reservoirs 1 and 2:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \phi
  \left(
    t_1, t_2
  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Considering reservoirs 2 and 3:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_2}{Q_3} = \phi
  \left(
    t_2, t_3
  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Considering reservoirs 1 and 3:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_1}{Q_3} = \phi
  \left(
    t_1, t_3
  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating the heat transferred, we have the following condition for the function ''&amp;phi;''.

&lt;math&gt; \phi
  \left(
    t_1, t_2 
  \right) = \frac{\phi
    \left(
    t_1, t_3
    \right)}{\phi
    \left(
    t_2, t_3
    \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, it is possible to choose an arbitrary temperature for 3, so it is easy to show using elementary multivariate calculus that ''&amp;phi;'' can be represented in terms of an increasing function of temperature ''&amp;zeta;'' as follows:

&lt;math&gt;  \phi
  \left(
    t_1, t_2 
  \right) = \frac{\zeta
    \left(
    t_1
    \right)}{\zeta
    \left(
    t_2
    \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can have a one to one association of the function ''&amp;zeta;'' with a new temperature scale called the ''thermodynamic temperature scale'', ''T'', so that

&lt;math&gt;\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{T_1}{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have the thermal efficiency of a Carnot engine as

&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{T_2}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

The thermodynamic temperature scale is also known as the Kelvin scale, and it needs only one fixed point, as the other one is absolute zero.
The concept of absolute zero will be further refined during the statement of the third law of thermodynamics.

*1st  Law:  Energy can neither be created or destroyed
*2nd Law:  All spontaneous events act to increase total entropy
*3rd Law:  Absolute zero is removal of all thermal molecular motion

==Reservoir==

Reservoirs are systems of large quantity of matter which no temperature difference will occur when finite amount of heat is transferred or removed. Examples of reservoirs are atmosphere, oceans, seas etc.

== Clausius Theorem ==

''Clausius theorem'' states that any reversible process can be replaced by a combination of reversible isothermal and adiabatic processes.

[[Image:clausiusthm Engineering Thermodynamics.png|Clausius Theorem]]

Consider a reversible process ''a-b''.
A series of isothermal and adiabatic processes can replace this process if the heat and work interaction in those processes is the same as that in the process ''a-b''.
Let this process be replaced by the process ''a-c-d-b'', where ''a-c'' and ''d-b'' are reversible adiabatic processes, while ''c-d'' is a reversible isothermal process.
The isothermal line is chosen such that the area ''a-e-c'' is the same as the area ''b-e-d''.
Now, since the area under the ''p-V'' diagram is the work done for a reversible process, we have, the total work done in the cycle ''a-c-d-b-a'' is zero.
Applying the first law, we have, the total heat transferred is also zero as the process is a cycle.
Since ''a-c'' and ''d-b'' are adiabatic processes, the heat transferred in process ''c-d'' is the same as that in the process ''a-b''.
Now applying first law between the states ''a'' and ''b'' along ''a-b'' and ''a-c-d-b'', we have, the work done is the same.
Thus the heat and work in the process ''a-b'' and  ''a-c-d-b'' are the same and any reversible process ''a-b'' can be replaced with a combination of isothermal and adiabatic processes, which is the Clausius theorem.

A corollary of this theorem is that any reversible cycle can be replaced by a series of Carnot cycles.

Suppose each of these Carnot cycles absorbs heat ''dQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' at temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and rejects heat ''dQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' at ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''.
Then, for each of these engines, we have ''dQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;/dQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''.
The negative sign is included as the heat lost from the body has a negative value.
Summing over a large number of these cycles, we have, in the limit,

&lt;math&gt;\oint_R \frac{dQ}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the  quantity ''dQ/T'' is a property.
It is given the name ''entropy''.

Further, using Carnot's principle, for an irreversible cycle, the efficiency is less than that for the Carnot cycle, so that

&lt;math&gt;\eta_{irr} = 1 - \frac{dQ_2}{dQ_1} &lt; \eta_{Carnot}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ_1}{T_1} - \frac{dQ_2}{T_2} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

As the heat is transferred out of the system in the second process, we have, assuming the normal conventions for heat transfer, 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ_1}{T_1} + \frac{dQ_2}{T_2} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

So that, in the limit we have,

&lt;math&gt;\oint_{I} \frac{dQ}{T} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\oint \frac{dQ}{T_{reservoir}} \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;

The above inequality is called the ''inequality of Clausius''.
Here the equality holds in the reversible case.

== Entropy ==

Entropy is the quantitative statement of the second law of thermodynamics.
It is represented by the symbol ''S'', and is defined by 

&lt;math&gt;dS \equiv
\left(
  \frac{dQ}{T}
\right)_{rev}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that as we have used the Carnot cycle, the temperature is the reservoir temperature.
However, for a reversible process, the system temperature is the same as the reversible temperature.

Consider a system undergoing a cycle 1-2-1, where it returns to the original state along a different path.
Since entropy of the system is a property, the change in entropy of the system in 1-2 and 2-1 are numerically equal.
Suppose reversible heat transfer takes place in process 1-2 and irreversible heat transfer takes place in process 2-1.
Applying Clausius's inequality, it is easy to see that the heat transfer in process 2-1 ''dQ&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;'' is less than ''T dS''.
That is, in an irreversible process the same change in entropy takes place with a lower heat transfer.
As a corollary, the change in entropy in any process, ''dS'', is related to the heat transfer ''dQ'' as 

''dS &amp;ge; dQ/T''

For an isolated system, ''dQ = 0'', so that we have

''dS&lt;sub&gt;isolated&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 0''

This is called the ''principle of increase of entropy'' and is an alternative statement of the second law.

Further, for the whole universe, we have

''&amp;Delta;S = &amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0''

For a reversible process, 

''&amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt; = (Q/T)&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;&amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt;''

So that

''&amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;universe&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''

for a reversible process.

[[Image:tscarnot Engineering Thermodynamics.png|T-S diagram for Carnot Cycle]]

Since ''T'' and ''S'' are properties, you can use a ''T-S'' graph instead of a ''p-V'' graph to describe the change in the system undergoing a reversible cycle.
We have, from the first law, ''dQ + dW = 0''.
Thus the area under the ''T-S'' graph is the work done by the system.
Further, the reversible adiabatic processes appear as vertical lines in the graph, while the reversible isothermal processes appear as horizontal lines.

=== Entropy for an Ideal Gas ===

An ideal gas obeys the equation ''pv = RT''.
According to the first law, 

''dQ + dW = dU''

For a reversible process, according to the definition of entropy, we have 

''dQ = T dS''

Also, the work done is the pressure volume work, so that

''dW = -p dV''

The change in internal energy:

''dU = m c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; dT''

''T dS = p dV + m c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; dT''

Taking per unit quantities and applying ideal gas equation, 

''ds = R dV/v + c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; dT/T''

&lt;math&gt;\Delta s = R \ln \frac{v_2}{v_1} + c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

As a general rule, all things being equal, entropy increases as, temperature increases and as pressure and concentration decreases and energy stored as internal energy has higher entropy than energy which is stored as kinetic energy.

== Availability ==

From the second law of thermodynamics, we see that we cannot convert all the heat energy to work.
If we consider the aim of extracting useful work from heat, then only some of the heat energy is available to us.
It was previously said that an engine working with a reversible cycle was more efficient than an irreversible engine.
Now, we consider a system which interacts with a reservoir and generates work, ''i.e.'', we look for the maximum work that can be extracted from a system given that the surroundings are at a particular temperature.

Consider a system interacting with a reservoir and doing work in the process.
Suppose the system changes state from 1 to 2 while it does work.
We have, according to the first law, 

''dQ - dW = dE'',

where ''dE'' is the change in the internal energy of the system.
Since it is a property, it is the same for both the reversible and irreversible process.
For an irreversible process, it was shown in a previous section that the heat transferred is less than the product of temperature and entropy change.
Thus the work done in an irreversible process is lower, from first law.

=== Availability Function ===

The availability function is given by ''&amp;Phi;'', where 

''&amp;Phi; &amp;equiv; E &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;S''

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the reservoir with which the system interacts.
The availability function gives the effectiveness of a process in producing useful work.
The above definition is useful for a non-flow process.
For a flow process, it is given by

''&amp;Psi; &amp;equiv; H &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;S''

=== Irreversibility ===

Maximum work can be obtained from a system by a reversible process.
The work done in an actual process will be smaller due to the irreversibilities present.
The difference is called the ''irreversibility'' and is defined as 

''I &amp;equiv; W&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; W''

From the first law, we have

''W = &amp;Delta;E &amp;minus; Q''

''I = &amp;Delta;E - Q - (&amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''

As the system interacts with surroundings of temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', we have

''&amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; = Q/T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''

Also, since

''E &amp;minus; &amp;Phi; = T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt;''

we have

''I = T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Thus,

''I &amp;ge; 0''

''I'' represents increase in unavailable energy.

=== Helmholtz and Gibbs Free Energies ===

''Helmholtz Free Energy'' is defined as 

''F &amp;equiv; U &amp;minus; TS''

The Helmholtz free energy is relevant for a non-flow process.
For a flow process, we define the ''Gibbs Free Energy''

''G &amp;equiv; H &amp;minus; TS''

The Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies have applications in finding the conditions for equilibrium.

== EPub version? ==

In the past, there used to be a downloadable, .epub version. Would anybody be interested in producing such a rendering again? It's actually quite simple with e.g. pandoc, but I'm not sure what's involved in a multi-page document such as this Haskell book. I do know that I would REALLY love an updated version on my e-book reader.

As far as I know there was no epub version. There was and there is now again a pdf version that is optimized for ebook readers. I just updated this pdf with data for the current A4 pdf. The latex source code is attached to the A4 pdf. To generate the LaTeX source of the ebook reader optimized pdf version from it, you can use the following python code.

== Yet Another Haskell Tutorial ==

Why is [[Haskell/YAHT|Yet Another Haskell Tutorial]] a &quot;subbook&quot; of this book? Shouldn't it be a separate book as [[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours]]? I.e., [[Haskell/YAHT]] should be moved to [[Yet Another Haskell Tutorial]], [[Haskell/YAHT/Preamble]] should be moved to [[Yet Another Haskell Tutorial/Preamble]] etc. (It should also have it's own category.) --[[User:Cic|Cic]] ([[User talk:Cic|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cic|contribs]]) 22:32, 8 January 2015 (UTC)
:Regardless of how the YAHT is used in that case, it actually should be *removed* from the Wikibooks entirely because its content has been absorbed and mixed into the Haskell Wikibook itself and also greatly improved in the process. Nobody should read YAHT independently now. [[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 00:15, 22 September 2015 (UTC)
::{{ping|Backfromquadrangle}} Cic has already moved the pages [[Yet_Another_Haskell_Tutorial|to a separate namespace]]. Given that deleting the [[Haskell/YAHT|leftover redirects]] would cause avoidable link rot, I guess all that is left for us to do is removing the link to YAHT from the front page (by the way, the header where it is currently under should not be named &quot;Tutorials that have been incorporated into the Haskell Wikibook&quot;. It should be renamed &quot;Other books about Haskell in Wikibooks&quot; or merged with &quot;Additional resources&quot;).--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 05:14, 22 September 2015 (UTC)

== GHCi interactions are badly formatted in the pdf ==

In the pdf version, the lines entered at the GHCi prompt and their results are shown on a single line. There should be a line break between them as there is in the online version.
Is this a bug in the pdf generator?
Is it the fault of the page markup -- is there some formatting that could be added to the markup -- at least as a workaround -- that would fix the pdf version without breaking the online presentation?

== Use of term 'Variable' ==

I do feel quite uncomfortable, when 'Variable' is used in texts like this on Functional Programming (Language(s)). Most starters in this area do have some experience in other/'procedural' programming languages, where variable means something like 'an area of memory who's content may vary depending on program flow', which is strongly misleading when you try to map onto functional PLs. Maybe some early paragraph about meaning of 'Variable' would help. I hope, I did make my POV clear enough, as English's not my native language.
: I think there is explanation about this. It's still a variable in that &lt;code&gt;add4 x = x + 4&lt;/code&gt; is a function that has a *variable* x which can be substituted with any number. It varies. It just doesn't vary within the exact same scope. Once defined for a scope, it's defined. But it can be used elsewhere and defined differently there. Please feel free to read the introductory stuff and consider adding footnotes or clearer stuff, but we need to avoid getting in depth about explaining how it works in other languages, as that is not the focus here.[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 00:19, 22 September 2015 (UTC)
: We have a [[Haskell/Variables_and_functions#Variables_in_imperative_languages|brief digression about that difference]] in an early chapter. As Backfromquadrangle points out, it would be unwise to emphasise comparisons to other languages, as that would make the text less accessible to readers with no procedural programming experience.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 05:21, 22 September 2015 (UTC)

== PDF/printable version headers ==

There's a problem that topic header like &quot;Haskell Basics&quot; and all its pages (Getting set up, ...) appear on the same level of header (H1 in printable HTML). In PDF version this results in an empty &quot;chapter&quot; for &quot;Haskel Basics&quot; instead of some big section title that would be more expected. In PDF they are also both on the same numbering level, which clearly is not right. Haskel Basics either should be not numbered and promoted into some higher plane or all its content should have two level numbering already. I don't know reasons behind it (problems combining a lot of pages?) but when you look at the book from this perspective (all-in-one printable HTML, PDF, ...) it definitely doesn't feel right.

== incorporating good compatible material ==

For example, this set of lectures from a class: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi13/cse230-a/lectures.html are superb and really clearly presented. The content is all permissively licensed: https://github.com/UCSD-PL/230-web and I think adapting / mixing that material into the Wikibook would be great. There's probably other stuff too. I wasn't sure if there was a list around here of resources waiting to be incorporated. --[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 06:57, 29 January 2016 (UTC)</text>

== Grammatik 8-2 ~ Possessive Adjectives, Pronouns, and the Genitive Case ==
Recall the following from [[German/Lesson_3|Gespräch 3-1]]:

:Karl: ''Ja. Und danach bringst du mich auf &lt;u&gt;deinem&lt;/u&gt; Motorrad zu &lt;u&gt;meiner&lt;/u&gt; Wohnung''.&lt;br&gt;
Which translates:
:Carl: 'Yes. And after that take me on &lt;u&gt;your&lt;/u&gt; motorcycle to &lt;u&gt;my&lt;/u&gt; apartment'. 

The sentence demonstrates two of the '''possessive adjectives'''. These are (singular) 'my', 'your', and 'his/her/its' in English and ''mein'', ''dein'', and ''sein/ihr/sein'' in German.  Note that because these are adjectives, the word ending must reflect the case and gender of the noun being modified (see Grammatik 4-1 above). 

In German, the '''genitive case''' correspond to the English possessive case or to the objective case proceeded by ''of'' to denote possession. If the possessive is not followed by a noun, it becomes a possessive pronoun (see [[German/Appendix_3|Pronoun Tables]]).


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
|
 || NOM. || ACC. || DAT. || POSS. PRON.
|-
| I, me || ''ich'' || ''mich'' || ''mir'' || '''mein'''
|-
| you || ''du'' || ''dich'' || ''dir'' || '''dein'''
|-
| he, him || ''er'' || ''ihn'' || ''ihm'' || '''sein'''
|-
| she, her || ''sie'' || ''sie'' || ''ihr'' || '''ihr'''
|-
| it || ''es'' || ''es'' || ''ihm'' || '''sein'''
|-
| we, us || ''wir'' || ''uns'' || ''uns'' || '''unser'''
|-
| you (all) || ''ihr'' || ''euch'' || ''euch'' || '''eurer'''
|-
| they, them || ''sie'' || ''sie'' || ''ihnen'' || '''ihr'''
|-
| you (formal) || ''Sie'' || ''Sie'' || ''Ihnen'' || '''Ihr'''
|}

The pattern in the case endings of the possessive adjectives is that seen in Lektion 4 for the word ''ein''. We can generalize these endings as in the following table, where we can express plural endings because other so-called '''ein'''-words do have plurals:    


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''''Ein'''''-group Endings
|-
|
 || NOM. || ACC. || DAT. || GEN.
|-
| Masculine || '''--''' || '''--en''' || '''--em''' || '''--es'''
|-
| Feminine || '''--e''' || '''--e''' || '''--er'''  || '''--er'''
|-
| Neuter || '''--''' || '''--''' || '''--em''' || '''--es'''
|-
| Plural || '''--e''' || '''--e''' || '''--en'''  || '''--er'''
|}
The small group of words that take these endings (in addition to ''ein'') includes the possessive adjectives and ''kein'' (&quot;not any&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in the sense of none).

__NOTOC__
==Introduction==
The subject of real analysis is concerned with studying the behavior and properties of functions, sequences, and sets on the real number line, which we denote as the mathematically familiar '''R'''. Concepts that we wish to examine through real analysis include properties like Limits, Continuity, Derivatives (rates of change), and Integration (amount of change over time). Many of these ideas are, on a conceptual or practical level, dealt with at lower levels of mathematics, including a regular First-Year Calculus course, and so, to the uninitiated reader, the subject of Real Analysis may seem rather senseless and trivial. However, Real Analysis is at a depth, complexity, and arguably beauty, that it is because under the surface of everyday mathematics, there is an assurance of correctness, that we call rigor, that permeates the whole of mathematics. Thus, Real Analysis can, to some degree, be viewed as a development of a rigorous, well-proven framework to support the intuitive ideas that we frequently take for granted.

Real Analysis is a very straightforward subject, in that it is simply a nearly linear development of mathematical ideas you have come across throughout your story of mathematics. However, instead of relying on sometimes uncertain intuition (which we have all felt when we were solving a problem we did not understand), we will anchor it to a rigorous set of mathematical theorems. Throughout this book, we will begin to see that we do not need intuition to understand mathematics - we need a manual.

The overarching thesis of this book is how to define the real numbers axiomatically. How would that work? This book will read in this manner: we set down the properties which we think define the real numbers. We then prove from these properties - and these properties only - that the real numbers behave in the way which we have always imagined them to behave. We will then rework all our elementary theorems and facts we collected over our mathematical lives so that it all comes together, almost as if it always has been true before we analyzed it; that it was in fact rigorous all along - except that now we will know how it came to be.

Do not believe that once you have completed this book, mathematics is over. In other fields of academic study, there are glimpses of a strange realm of mathematics increasingly brought to the forefront of standard thought. After understanding this book, mathematics will now seem as though it is incomplete and lacking in concepts that maybe you have wondered before. In this book, we will provide glimpses of something more to mathematics than the real numbers and real analysis. After all, the mathematics we talk about here always seems to only involve one variable in a sea of numbers and operations and comparisons.

==The real numbers {{stage|50%}}==

This part of the book formalizes the various types of numbers we use in mathematics, up to the real numbers.

==Functions, Trigonometry, and Graphical Analysis {{stage|25%}}==

This part of the book formalizes the definition and usage of graphs, functions, as well as trigonometry. The most curious aspect of this section is its usage of graphics as a method of proof for certain properties, such as trigonometry. These methods of proof are mostly frowned upon (due to the inaccuracy and lack of rigorous definition when it comes to graphical proofs), but they are essential to derive the trigonometric relationships, as the analytical definition of the trigonometric functions will make using trigonometry too difficult—especially if they are described early on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I'm a wikipedian interested in working on the wiki [[Cookbook]]... I did a bunch of work on the wiktionary before I decided that it wasn't the best project in the world for a dyslexic contributor! And I've worked on the travel wiki until I ran out of useful contributions to make. So here I am... 

At the moment I'm concentrating on [[Cookbook:Fruit]] and [[Cookbook:Vegetables]] - I think there's enough material there to keep me occupied for the next few months! lol I'm trying to get a decent entry for each fruit and vegie, at least the common ones, including links to recipes that will be, and pointers on how to choose the best, how to cook them, and how not to totally wreck your meal. :)

But if I ever get tired of writing about cooking I may attempt to start a practical arts/crafts module, maybe covering papercrafts how-tos and card-making (my specialty)...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Karen :)  Nice to see Wikibooks has dragged yet another from the clutches of the Wikipedia ;)

Have fun [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:10, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

They dragged my beloved recipes, they dragged me! lol Thanks for the welcome. I'm really not sure how much is meant to be duplicated/moved/replaced from the Wikipedia food section to here. I don't want to unnecessarily duplicate other people's work... [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 05:44, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Please check the Staff Lounge again for some extra info. Thx [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:11, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

They are still arguing over there about where to put recipes.  This place seems like the logical answer.  Good luck! There is lots in need of doing in the cookbook - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:17, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I thought it was a done deal that all the recipes were coming over here... but I just got my head bitten off for daring to import the sacred French recipes via the transwiki process :( I don't think I want to do any more... I'm going to concentrate on the noncontroversial vegetables and fruits, like I've already done for [[Cookbook:Orange]]. Take the wikipedia entry and extend/modify it so it applies more to the culinary side of things, including what they look like, how to prepare them, and what sort of recipes to use them in... [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 04:24, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I think it only makes sense to bring the recipes here in a cookbook. Wikipedia can reference them.  I'll gladly give them my piece of mind on the subject, but there is rifght now a French contigent arguing to keep &quot;recipes&quot; at Wikipedia&amp;mdash;just foolishness. Say, great to have someone closer to my time zone working at Wikibooks (I'm in Hawaii) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:37, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC) 

::I'm in Australia... so I'm halfway there! Lol [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 04:44, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::I gather it is Tuesday, sometime in the day (afternoon/evening?) there. It is now dark here, but evening supper is upon us. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:50, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:::It's four pm and my brother just got home from work... it's a nice sunny day today, even if remarkably cold for mid-summer. While I've got your attention, do you know how to link to an article in the cookbook from the en wikipedia? is it Wikibooks:Cookbook:Alfalfa ? I just wrote it and I thought I'd link it to the article in the pedia because they totally ignored culinary use when they wrote it. [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 05:05, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)
::::I just put something about that under [[Cookbook:Fruit]] for you - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:09, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC) OOOpps. It is under [[Talk:Cookbook:Carrot]]. If you refer back to [[Special:Recentchanges]] you can see where I'm adding in. Just got the dinner bell! Goodonya, mate - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

Isn't this fun???  Just to let you know, I kinda forced through a naming convention for recipes in the cookbook to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Recipe Name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, with all the important words capitalized, just like in a real book :~).  I don't have any opinions on conventions for ingrediants, as so far there haven't been any multi word ingrediant pages.  Pick one and the rest of us will follow.  I don't blame you for not wanting to move articles over here, the process is a bit unwieldly and the thanks we're getting is ''SO'' rewarding.

It'll be good to have some help on this side of the move.  Might encourage me to move things over more quickly.  The Indian recipes got moved today (maybe I should spend the rest of the day here to avoid the possible wikipedia backlash). [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:41, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

LOL I don't think there are any Indian contributors to raise a ruckus... I keep forgetting to put the capital letters into page name, and putting things into the wrong place - but I'm trying to remember them. For ingredients I think that only the first letter should be capitalised eg [[Cookbook:Herb cheese]] instead of [[Cookbook:Herb Cheese]]. Or do you think it should be the other way? I don't really care either way. We'll be getting onto spice mixes soon and they have two or three word titles... [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 02:12, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)
::My vote would be &quot;Herb cheese&quot; but decide what you like - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:00, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::I like it as well, as the recipes are a title, thus a proper noun, while ingrediants are just a thing, so they don't really deserve to be capitalized.  My only issue would be something like [[cookbook:Pesto|Pesto]], which can be both a recipe and an ingrediant, but it only has one word, so nothing to worry about there (yet). [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

== arts/crafts textbook ==

If you want to take a stab at an arts and crafts book that sounds like a worthwhile goal to me ! I am glad to have you aboard. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:I think it sounds like a good idea too. One that really could go a long ways over the future years - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:17, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

==Old cookbook page==
Karen, the old cookbook page is at [[Talk:Cookbook/Planning]].  I didn't mean for the page to be changed so quickly, and was hoping to get your input before it was changed, but others seemed to like the idea of being bold, so it got changed.  If you're having problems editing tables, just let me know what you'd like on the page and I'll edit it in for you, or I could give you some pointers on the new table syntax.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Karen Johnson. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Karen Johnson~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Risotto is a traditional North Italian dish, made with a soft short-grained rice, for example, Arborio rice. This rice has a very high starch content, making for a thick and creamy texture in the finished product. You cannot make a successful risotto using long-grained rice, however hard you try. 

First the rice is sauteed in olive oil or butter to begin the cooking process, then liquid (stock and/or white wine) is added slowly, stirring continuously. The stirring helps to break down the grains and release more starch. Flavourings can be added either at the start (onions, chopped chicken, etc.) or towards the end (parmasen or grated cheese, spinach etc) depending on how long they need to cook. The actual rice will be cooked in about twenty minutes, making this a fairly quick if labour-intensive dish.

==Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions==
The release of energy in chemical reactions occurs when the reactants have higher chemical energy than the products. The chemical energy in a substance is a type of potential energy stored within the substance. This stored chemical potential energy is the ''heat content'' or '''enthalpy''' of the substance.

The collection of substances that is involved in a chemical reaction is referred to as a ''system'' and anything else around it is called the ''surroundings''.

If the enthalpy decreases during a chemical reaction, a corresponding amount of energy must be released to the surroundings.  Conversely, if the enthalpy increases during a reaction, a corresponding amount of energy must be absorbed from the surroundings.  This is simply the '''Law of Conservation of Energy'''.

'''Endothermic''' reactions increase their enthalpy by absorbing heat.  They feel cold to the touch after they have occurred.  

'''Exothermic''' reactions decrease their enthalpy by releasing heat.  They will get warm, and may even burn or explode if they release enough heat.

You are already familiar with enthalpy:  melting ice is endothermic and freezing water is exothermic.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
| width=&quot;50%&quot; | When methane burns in air the heat given off equals the decrease in enthalpy that occurs as the reactants are converted to products.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CH}_{4(g)} + 2\hbox{O}_{2(g)} \to \hbox{CO}_{2(g)} + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(g)} + energy&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The enthalpy difference between the reactants and the products is equal to the amount of energy released to the surroundings. A reaction in which energy is released to the surroundings is called an ''exothermic'' reaction. In this type of reaction the enthalpy, or stored chemical energy, is lower for the products than the reactants.
| width=&quot;50%&quot; | When ammonium nitrate is dissolved in water, energy is absorbed and the water cools.  This concept is used in &quot;cold packs&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_{4}\hbox{NO}_{3(s)} + water + energy \to \hbox{NH}^+_{4(aq)} + \hbox{NO}^-_{3(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The enthalpy difference between the reactants and the products is equal to the amount of energy absorbed from the surroundings. A reaction in which energy is absorbed from the surroundings is called an ''endothermic'' reaction. In endothermic reactions the enthalpy of the products is greater than the enthalpy of the reactants.
|}

Because reactions release or absorb energy, they affect the temperature of their surroundings. Exothermic reactions heat up their surroundings while endothermic reactions cool them down.  The study of enthalpy, along with many other energy-related topics, is covered in the [[General Chemistry/Thermodynamics|Thermodynamics]] Unit.

== Activation Energy ==
Think about the combustion of methane.  It releases enough heat energy to cause a fire.  However, the reaction does not occur automatically.  When methane and oxygen are mixed, an explosion does not instantly occur.  First, the methane must be ignited, usually with a lighter or matchstick.  This reveals something about reactions:  they will not occur unless a certain amount of '''activation energy''' is added first.  In this sense, all reactions absorb energy before they begin, but the exothermic reactions release even more energy.  This can be explained with a graph of potential energy:
[[Image:Ac com.svg|thumb|center]]
This graph shows an exothermic reaction because the products are at a lower energy than the reactants (so heat has been released).  Before that can happen, the energy must actually ''increase''.  The amount of energy added before the reaction can complete is the activation energy, symbolized '''E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Macroeconomic objectives==
Broadly, the objective of macroeconomic policies is to maximize the level of national income, providing economic growth to raise the utility and standard of living of participants in the economy. There are also a number of secondary objectives which are held to lead to the maximization of income over the long run. While there are variations between the objectives of different national and international entities, most follow the ones detailed below:
# ''' [[Macroeconomics/Sustainable Economic Growth|Sustainability]] ''' - a rate of growth which allows an increase in living standards without undue structural and environmental difficulties. 'Economic growth' will be studied later on in this book.
# '''[[w:Full employment|Full employment]]''' - where those who are able and willing to have a job can get one, given that there will be a certain amount of frictional, seasonal and structural unemployment (referred to as the natural rate of unemployment).
# ''' [[w:Price stability|Price stability]]''' - when prices remain largely stable, and there is not rapid inflation or deflation. Price stability is not necessarily the same as zero inflation, but instead steady levels of low-moderate inflation is often regarded as ideal. It is worth noting that prices of some goods and services often fall as a result of productivity improvements during periods of inflation, as inflation is only a measure of &lt;i&gt;general&lt;/i&gt; price levels. However, inflation is a good measure of 'price stability'. Zero inflation is often undesirable in an economy. (&quot;Internal Balance&quot; is used to describe a level of economic activity that results in full employment with no inflation.)
# '''External Balance''' - equilibrium in the Balance of payments without the use of artificial constraints. That is, the value of exports being roughly equal to the value of imports over the long run.
# '''Equitable distribution of income and wealth''' - a fair share of the national 'cake', more equitable than would be in the case of an entirely free market. Like the other economic objectives,  the distribution of income is a partly subjective or normative issue
# '''[[w:Productivity|Increasing Productivity]]''' - more output per unit of labour per hour. Also, since labor is but one of many inputs to produce goods and services, it could also be described as output per unit of factor inputs per hour.
# '''Thermal Equilibrium''' - equilibrium in the Balance of payments without the use of artificial constraints. That is, exports roughly equal to imports over the long run.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'Economic activity' is a very broad term, and can be measured in a number of ways. In general, it means the level of activity, the number of transactions, the value of those transactions and the overall &lt;b&gt;output&lt;/b&gt; or goods and services produced within an economy.
==Measures of Economic Activity==
===Gross Domestic Product===
The most commonly used statistic is the average &quot;[[wikipedia:Gross Domestic Product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP)&quot; . GDP is the total money value of all the final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year. However, there are difficulties associated with using GDP, such as inflation - the money value of an economy's products will increase even if there is no &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; growth, as inflation reduces the value of money. So, GDP is often adjusted for inflation, the result being called &lt;b&gt;real GDP&lt;/b&gt;.

For example, if the GDP of an economy in 2004 is 1 trillion, and the next year is 1.1 trillion, the change in GDP is 10%. However, if money inflation is 5% then the change in ''real GDP'' is somewhat less than that.

*  &lt;small&gt;see also: [[w:Gross domestic product|Gross domestic product]] on Wikipedia&lt;/small&gt;

=== Gross National Product ===

==Graphical Models of the Economy==

# Using the '''Circular Flow Diagram/Model''' (C.F.D./C.F.M.) we can &quot;top&quot; the flow using
#* [[wikipedia:Expenditure|Expenditure]]
#* [[wikipedia:Income|Income]]
#* [[wikipedia:Output|Output]]&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:circflmdl.png]] --&gt;&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:circflwmdl.png]] --&gt;
# We should obtain the same figure using any of the three methods. However there are difficulties.
#* '''Statistical''' - systematic of accidental errors in data gathering
#* The '''shadow economy''' (i.e. undeclared income) - more commonly known as the 'black market'
#* '''Tax evasion and Tax avoidance'''
#* '''Many exchanges do not use money'''
# All these methods can be used. &quot;Incomes received&quot; is most frequently used.

==Terms used in measuring economic activity==
==== Gross ====
*Total with no adjustment for inflation, taxation or wear and tear. For example, &quot;I have gross earnings of 40,000, before paying income tax.&quot;

==== Depreciation ====
*The rate at which things fall in value over time. This may be a result of wear and tear, or obscelesence. For example, cars often rapidly depreciate after a few years.

==== Net ====
*allowance has been made for wear and tear or obsolescence.
&amp;rarr; NET = GROSS - rate of DEPRECIATION
*For example: I have a car worth 20,000. If it depreciates at a rate of 10% [[w:per annum|per annum]], after one year it is worth 20,000 - 2,000 = 18,000

==== Domestic ====
*activity within a country's economy from production units located within it, regardless of ownership.

==== National ====
*activity resulting from production units owned by citizens of a country, regardless of location.
&amp;rarr; NATIONAL = DOMESTIC + NET INCOME FROM OVERSEAS

==== Market Prices ====
*The amount of money that a willing buyer pays to acquire something from a willing seller, when a buyer and seller are independent and when such an exchange is motivated by only commercial consideration. This price is also known as the equilibrium price.

==== Factor cost ====
*total cost of the factors of production to produce an item, distinct from the market price. It ignores any [[wikipedia:indirect taxes|indirect taxes]] and subsidies
&amp;rarr; FACTOR COST = MARKET PRICES - INDIRECT TAXES + SUBSIDIES

==== National Income ====
*National income is the sum of the incomes that all individuals in the economy earned in the forms of wages, interest, rents, and profits. It excludes government transfer payments and is calculated before any deductions are taken for income taxes.

==== Current prices ====
*at existing price levels, i.e. [[wikipedia:Money GDP|Money G.D.P.]]
*also known as '''nominal prices'''

==== Constant prices ====
*values taken at a base year to remove the effects of [[wikipedia:inflation|inflation]], i.e. Real G.D.P.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Macroeconomic Equilibrium==
[[wikipedia:Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] is the situation where there is no tendency for change. The [[wikipedia:economics|economy]] can be in equilibrium at any level of economic activity that is a high level ([[wikipedia:boom|boom]]) or a low level ([[wikipedia:recession|recession]]). Due to the size of many modern economies, equilibrium is a very temporary state, as changing variables shift affect the economy.

Macroeconomic Equilibrium can be shown through the C.F.M. using:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
''' S + T + M = I + G + X '''
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|} 

Savings + taxation + imports = investment + government spending + exports

This can be understood as savings approximately equal to investment, government spending to taxation, and similarly imports to exports, at least over the long run. It means that, at equilibrium, injections into the income stream equal the leakages from the income stream. 

----


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
''' &amp;sum;E = &amp;sum;O = &amp;sum;Y '''
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|} 

Total expenditure = total output = total income

It is easier to remember if you just think that they are really different ways of measuring the same thing, which is the flow of factors through the economy, which can be demonstrated with the CFM.

----


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
''' Leakages = Injections '''
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|} 

A change in the [[wikipedia:leakages|leakages]] and [[wikipedia:injections|injections]] will cause a new equilibrium to be established where total income (&amp;sum;Y), total output (&amp;sum;O), and total expenditures (&amp;sum;E) will again equate but at either a higher or lower level than the original equilibrium.

Leakages do not have to equal injections

e.g. imports constitute a leakage from the importing country's economy, but an injection to the exporting countries economy.

So looking at the world economy it is zero sum game, where Leakages = Injections, but looking at any one country's economy this need not be the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Role of Savings and Investment==
There are two views of the topic titled Savings and Investment. One is considered to apply to real physical macroeconomic activity, the &quot;Keynesian&quot;, or National Accounts view. The other is considered to apply to money and banking, the &quot;Monetarist&quot; view. They primarily differ slightly in definitions of terms, which consequently lead to different discussions about very different subject matter. The two views actually are different subject areas, making it the historical debate difficult to collate, let alone reconcile.

Keynesians start with accounting definitions, where Savings = Investment, by construction, and tend to emphasize the nonproductive (zero sum) nature of all vehicles by which savings eventually ends up as capital. Monetarists tend to focus on technical distinctions of how savings is transformed from money balances, eventually into capital, and emphasize the value of those vehicles in selecting which capital to invest in.

In a Keynesian sense, savings is whatever is left over after income is spent on consumption of goods and services, investment is what is spent on goods and services that are not 'consumed', but are durable. Since Income = Output, Savings = Investment for the total world's economy (or for a hypothetical 'closed' economy with zero foreign trade).

In a Monetarist sense, savings is the total rate at which units of account exceed expenditures, and are accumulated as unit of account (e.g. dollar) balances with financial intermediaries. Or sometimes hoarded as currency. Investment is the rate at which financial intermediaries and others expend on items &lt;i&gt;intended&lt;/i&gt; to end up as capital that directly creates value, i.e. physical capital, durable goods, human capital, etc. In general, savings does not equal investment, but differs slightly at all times, the differences constituting a behavioral relationship, rather than an accounting one, as in the Keynesian view.

The two views are just looking at very different things. The most commonly referred meaning of the phrase &quot;Savings and Investment&quot; is in first year college economics, where Keynesian and neoclassical macroeconomics are taught, and national accounts, (i.e. the identity Y = C + I + G) is explained.

===[[wikipedia:Savings|Savings]]===
Saving is what households (i.e. participants in the consumption account) do. The level of saving in the economy depends on a number of factors (incomplete list):

*A higher real interest rate will give a greater return on saving as banks offer more favourable rates.
*Poor returns on risky forms of saving, e.g. stocks and bonds, make it more advantageous to hold money savings (in contention between Keynesian and Monetarist views here, mostly because of differences in definitions).
*Poor expectation for future economic growth, increase households' savings as a precaution for a grim future.
*More disposable income after fixed expenditures (such as mortgage, heating bill, basic goods purchases) have been made (in contention between Keynesian and Monetarist views here, mostly because of differences in definitions).
*Perceived likelihood of plunder of the future value of savings, via legal or extralegal means, will make saving less attractive (in contention between Keynesian and Monetarist views here, mostly because of differences in definitions).

These factors affect the marginal propensity to save (MPS) - the greater this MPS, the more saving households will do as a proportion of each additional increment of income.

===[[wikipedia:Investment|Investment]]===
*Investment is made into capital (ie. plant and machinery, also 'human capital' - training and education), with intent to increase productivity, efficiency and output of goods and services
*In national accounting terms, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other items whose value is risky, are NOT investments. They fall into the savings account, not the investment account.
*In monetary terms, the relationship between savings and investment is modeled, rather than being an accounting identity. Stocks and bonds are considered to be important intermediary forms of savings as it gets transformed into a capital investment that produces value. Mutual funds, CDs, BICs, GICs, pension obligations, insurance annuities, and other forms of savings marketed by financial intermediaries, all &lt;i&gt;consist&lt;/i&gt; of stocks, bonds, and cash balances, which in turn pay for the capital that increases productivity, efficiency and output of goods and services.

====The 2 Forms of Investment====
a) [[wikipedia:voluntary|voluntary]]
*normal investment &amp;rarr; plant equipment etc.
b) [[wikipedia:involuntary|involuntary]]
*stockpiles or inventories, output not consumed.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note on so-called &quot;fiscal&quot; policy, i.e. marginal discretionary government spending:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

a) Planned Injections (J) and Planned Withdrawals(W)

==Consumption is:==
what households, not businesses, do. This involves expenditure on goods and services, such as petrol, shopping and a new fridge. However, consumption can be split down further into &lt;b&gt;durable&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;non-durable&lt;/b&gt; purchases.
*Durable purchases are those that are going to last a long time - often years! These include items like cars, cookers, and televisions. Fridges, cookers, washing machines etc. are all durable goods.
*Non-durable purchases are those that only last for a short period of time and are 'used up'. A good example of this is going to the shops to buy food and drink.

==Determinants==
:The level of consumption in the economy is determined by:

===1) Cost of Credit===
If credit becomes difficult, mainly through expense of interest rates, some households may postpone their credit financed purchases. There will be a reduction in consumption until circumstances change, i.e. accumulate more savings, or a fall in interest rates. on the other hand if accessing credit becomes less expensive household will increase their consumption

===2) Assets===
Most [[wikipedia:households|households]] appear to have target levels of assets/wealth at each stage of their life cycle. If assets fall unexpectedly, households will increase their [[wikipedia:saving|saving]] and reduce consumption. This works in reverse for situations like a sudden increase in [[wikipedia:wealth|wealth]].

===3) Disposable Income===
Disposable income (income is often expressed as 'Y') is income after taxes. It is the amount of total income that can be spent with reasonable freedom by the household. Thus, disposable income is total income minus taxes (and sometimes also regarded as including other fixed payments, such as mortgage repayments). It is that income which can be 'disposed of' with near freedom.

===4) Expectations===
Individuals' attitudes to the functionality of the economy effects the level of aggregate expenditure. For example, households increase purchases of [[wikipedia:consumer durables|consumer durables]] if they believe interest rates will remain low or job security improves, etc. Expectations are the source of both business and household [[wikipedia:economic indicators|economic indicators]]. Strictly speaking, an expectation is a &lt;b&gt;leading&lt;/b&gt; economic indicator, since it predicts changes in an economy and changes occur before corresponding changes in the economy.

A '''leading indicator''' is an economic statistic that suggests transactions in the future. For example, building permits suggest construction activity in the near term, and hence the hiring of construction workers and purchases of building materials. Purchases of raw materials by manufacturing industries ordinarily suggest a level of likely production. Increases in either suggest increased activity; decreases suggest decreases in near-term activity. Stock prices fit this category because high prices for corporate stocks create the impression of wealth that spurs consumption.

A '''coinciding indicator''' ordinarily indicates activity at the time. It is often a defining characteristic of the economy such as payroll or sales volume.

A '''lagging indicator''' is a statistic that ordinarily follows economic changes. Unemployment rates are a prime example; decisions by most employers to hire workers follow increases in activity and the parallel decision to lay off workers follows decreases in activity.

===5) Taxation===
A change in the level of taxation on income (income tax) will reduce the amount of disposable income available. Because of this, C could fall. However, if an equal or greater sum were given out in benefits to households, particularly to unemployed, then consumption could even rise. It is important to note that an increase in taxation will not necessarily cause a contraction in consumption. Further, if taxation and benefits were used to redistribute income/wealth from richer to poorer households, consumption might rise. This is because less wealthy households are more likely to spend a greater proportion of their disposable income than extremely rich individuals.

*Consumption varies between about 40-60% of total expenditure depending on what type of economy you are in, and the period in the economic cycle it is currently at.

==The Keynesian Consumption Function==

| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
C = a + b(&amp;Delta;Y)&lt;br&gt;
a = Autonomous Consumption
:b = Marginal Propensity to Consume
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
:[[wikipedia:Autonomous Consumption|Autonomous Consumption]] is the amount of income someone has to spend to survive (level of absolute need)
:[[wikipedia:MPC|MPC]] is the fraction/proportion of the remaining income that is spent on consumption. In reality it represents the how much of your income you are willing to spend on goods and services, as opposed to saving it for difficult times in the future or for retirement. The MPC is affected by consumer confidence and interest rates as they affect the rate of return on savings.

&lt;math&gt;MPC = {\Delta C \over \Delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Calculations===

Example 1
:C = 50 + 0.5(Y)
:B = C = Y
:Y = 50 + 0.5(Y)
:Y - 0.5(Y) = 50
:0.5(Y) = 50
:Y = 100
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
Example 2
:C = 50 + 0.9(Y)
:B = C = Y
:Y = 50 + 0.9(Y)
:Y - 0.9(Y) = 50
:0.1(Y) = 50
:Y = 500
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}

==Note:==
Saving(S) is not part of A.E. due to it being a leakage, (we analyse it because it helps us determine consumption and impacts on Y levels). The savings function &lt;big&gt;(S = Y - C)&lt;/big&gt; can be derived from the consumption function (c.f.).

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

__NOTOC__
Many French regions claim '''coq au vin''', or chicken stew, as their own, but legend has it that the recipe originated with [[w:Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s chef. Different variants exist throughout the world; the following recipe is one. Note that you can also use [[cookbook:capon|capon]].

Serves 4–6.

==Ingredients==
* 1.5 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] (about 3.5 lbs) [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]], jointed (or drumsticks, thighs, breasts); get the giblets, and the blood if you can; season beforehand; marrow is important.
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]  [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/4 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 200 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (about 1/4 lb) small [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* 240 ml (1 cup) [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]]
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 1 tsp  [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], chopped and fresh
* 1 tsp  of fresh or dried Thyme
* Olive oil for sauteing

==Gear==
Wide [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]], deep pyrex bowl with lid, and jug.

==Directions==
#Mix flour, salt and pepper. Coat chicken, onion and carrot in flour mixture and set aside.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] mushrooms, set aside.
#[[Cookbook:Browning|Brown]] the chicken pieces a few at a time, set aside.
#Brown onions and carrots. Put chicken into large [[Cookbook:Casserole (pot)|casserole]] on medium-high heat along with onions, carrots and mushrooms.
#Combine wine, garlic, and basil; pour over chicken. Cover the casserole, cook until chicken is ready (1–1.5 hours), stirring occasionally.

==Variations==
Nearly all recipes other than those altered for low-fat diets start with [[Cookbook:Lardon|lardons]], or their more available substitutes, unsmoked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]].  The lardons are cooked, and the rendered fat used for browning the other ingredients, and (with the addition of the flour) to form the ''[[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]'' which thickens the sauce.  Generally, a full bottle of red wine is used, and brandy may be added.

Porcini mushrooms, while not particularly authentic, are good in this dish.

* 1.5 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] (about 3.5 lbs) [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]], jointed (or drumsticks, thighs, breasts); get the giblets, and the blood if you can; season beforehand; marrow is important.
*1 bottle red [[cookbook:Wine|burgundy]] (or côte du Rhône/Morgon)
*8 thick slices [[cookbook:pancetta|pancetta]], cut into strips less than width of little finger
*1 strip of [[cookbook:pork|porkbelly fat]]
*250g [[cookbook:mushroom|button mushrooms]], whole
*selection of [[cookbook:mushroom|wild mushroom]]s, sliced - dried is OK (use the soaking liquor)
*2 large [[cookbook:onion|onion]]s, one for the stock, the other roughly chopped
*12 small pickling onions (fresh, not pickled), peeled and whole
*2 stalks [[cookbook:celery|celery]], roughly diced
*4 [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, cut in thick lengths
*5 cloves [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], crushed, leaving one sliced
*1/2 tsp ground [[cookbook:asafoetida|asafoetida]]
*5 sprigs [[cookbook:thyme|thyme]] (2 tsps) &amp; 5 [[cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*[[cookbook:butter|butter]], [[cookbook:salt|salt]], [[cookbook:pepper|black pepper]], [[cookbook:parsley|parsley]]
*2 measures of [[cookbook:brandy|brandy]]

For the preceding ingredients, follow this timeline:

#For chicken stock, sear the giblets in a bit of [[cookbook:oil|oil]] in a pan, and [[cookbook:simmer|simmer]] in water with an onion, a carrot and some peppercorns. For the vegetable stock, make up a cupful with ''Vegcon'', just salty (can act as the entire stock - make 1/2 pint). 
#In the skillet, fry pancetta and porkbelly fat with butter till golden brown. Remove pancetta.
#To the skillet, add the seasoned chicken pieces skin side down and fry until honey-coloured, then turn. This is vital for the flavour; the skillet must be left sticky. There won't be enough room to do it in one go, so take it in turns. Remove, leaving the porkbelly behind, snipped into pieces. (If you're doing breasts off the bone, sear on skin side only and do not put back into the dish until the oven stage - otherwise they will toughen up.)
#To the skillet add the chopped onion and the button mushrooms; fry for 5 mins, then add the sliced garlic and immediately flame off one of the measures of brandy.
#To the skillet add the chicken pieces and pancetta, then pour over all the wine and the chicken &amp; veg stocks. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and, adding the crushed garlic and herbs, simmer for 45 mins. Turn the chicken pieces twice. Remove the chicken pieces to the pyrex lid and pour the skillet sauce into the jug; put the jug in the freezer for 30 mins and then remove the fat. At this stage, it is recommended that you refrigerate the whole dish overnight.
#In the skillet, add some butter along with the wild mushrooms; then pickling onions, carrots and celery; fry till mushrooms brown. Stir in the asafoetida and flame off the second measure of brandy.
#Add the jug ingredients to the skillet sauce, along with another crushed clove of garlic, and push the veg to the edge of the skillet; reduce the sauce in the skillet until glossy (may need flour stirred in - but it shouldn't be thick): 15 mins.
#Pour half the sauce into the pyrex bowl, then place the chicken pieces in, and pour the rest of the sauce on top; put the covered pyrex bowl in an oven on 170 C for 90 mins.
#Sprinkle parsley over each portion, and serve with asparagus/green beans, and steamed potatoes/flat noodles/rice/orzo/[[Cookbook:Colcannon|colcannon]].

This is a difficult dish, but you've got to try it. The asafoetida is a novelty, but it does add pungency.

__NOTOC__
'''Ratatouille''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_France#Provence|Provençale]] stewed vegetable dish that can be served as a meal on its own, accompanied by [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or French [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], or as a side dish. It can be served hot or cold.

Recipe serves 3-4. Increase quantities to serve more, and add different vegetables as desired for variation.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Olive oil|Olive oil]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], or to taste
* 1 [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant (aubergine)]]
* 1 green, red, yellow or a combination, [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini (courgettes)]]
* 6 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]es, ripe (juicy), peeled and seeded
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Herbes de Provence|Herbes de Provence]] to taste, (optional), or
* 1 small bunch [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], chiffonéd (optional)

==Directions==

#Put a large [[Cookbook:Pots_and_Pans#Enameled_Cast_Iron|casserole]] on the stove on medium heat.
#When the casserole is hot, add enough olive oil to just cover the bottom. 
#Cut the zucchini and eggplant into ½ inch slices. Then cut these into rectangles of about 3 by 1 inches. Add to the casserole.&lt;ref name=size&gt;When ratatouille is used as a filling for savoury crêpes or to fill an omelette, the pieces are sometimes cut smaller.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sauté the slices until light brown
#[[Cookbook:Chop|Chop]] the onions and garlic.
#Cut the green pepper into strips or dice, as preferred.&lt;ref name=size/&gt;  
#Add the onions and peppers and cook slowly for about 10 minutes until tender but not brown. Stir in the garlic.&lt;ref&gt;While most recipes do not brown the onions, if you like them browned, brown them.  Food traditions have always been subject to individual interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Peel and seed the tomatoes. [[Cookbook:Dice|Dice]] them or cut them into quarters, add to the casserole. 
#Five minutes later, check to see if the tomatoes have made enough juice to almost cover the vegetables - if so, perfect. If not, add water as needed (not too much).
#Add salt, pepper and Herbes de Provence to taste. In general, 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]  of salt, 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of pepper and 1 tbsp of the herbs will suffice. 
#Cover the casserole and let simmer on low heat until the vegetables are tender but still intact, 10 to 20 minutes, or to taste.
#Remove the lid, raise the heat a little and cook uncovered for another 15 minutes, basting frequently until the liquids have mostly evaporated, leaving a small amount of juice and olive oil.&lt;ref&gt;Unnecessary moisture can also be reduced by straining the liquid into a pan, reducing it over heat, then returning the reduced liquid to the casserole.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

:N.B. It is important that each of the vegetables retain its own shape and character.  Most authorities agree that ratatouille should not be a mush. Avoid overcooking. Sautéing the eggplant and courgettes initially helps retain their shape and improves their flavour, but is optional. Of course if you personally prefer a more homogeneous dish, it may be cooked for 45 minutes to 1 hour, but this is unusual.

[[Image:Crepes dsc07085.jpg|thumb|Crêpes without any fillings]]

A '''crêpe''' is a thin [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]]. The French word is from the Latin root ''crispa'' meaning &quot;curled&quot;, from which the English word &quot;crisp&quot; is also derived. It originates from Brittany, a region in the west of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]], where it is traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Cider|cider]]. Historically, they were cooked on flat rocks (hence the name). Crêpes are usually of two types: sweet or savoury, the main difference is the [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] used (plain flour or [[Cookbook:Buckwheat|buckwheat]] flour respectively). They may then be rolled or folded, and filled with different ingredients.  Depending on the filling ingredients, filled crêpes can be either a dessert dish or a main course.

This recipe for sweet crêpes is an easy one to start with (for about 20 crêpes):

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (230 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 1/2 cup (115 mL) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] or melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 [[cookbook:pinch|pinch]] (1/4 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Variations==
{{Metricate}}
Sweeter crêpe:
Add 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] and 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

[[Cookbook:Chocolate|Chocolate]] Crêpe:
Add 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Chocolate Sauce|chocolate sauce]]
&gt;
See [[Cookbook:Crepe Making|Crepe Making]] for extra help.

An easy variation to the recipe is: 

5 eggs 
1 cup of flour
1 cup of milk

Cheesy crepe: Sprinkle Emmental evenly while in the pan.

==Procedure==
#Put the flour at the bottom of a [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]] and make a hole in the middle where you put the eggs, the melted butter, the salt and a bit of milk. 
#Mix well by hand (traditionally, you actually use your hand to avoid incorporating air) slowly combining with the flour, you should get a thick paste. Then continue mixing and slowly add the rest of the milk, mix well to avoid making lumps. You may add a bit of [[Cookbook:Liqueur|liqueur]] (traditionally [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]] or [[Cookbook:Fleur d'Oranger|fleur d'oranger]]) for more taste. Allow to stand, perhaps for several hours whilst the flour gluten rests - very important to the final texture.
#Heat a [[w:Crêpe Pan|crêpe pan]] (non-stick recommended), grease it with some butter, and pour some batter while rolling the pan to make the crêpe as thin as possible (8 finished crepe might add up to a stack 1/4&quot; or 6mm thick).  A drop of water can be used to test the pan temperature: too cold, and the water will sit on the pan, too hot and it will vanish immediately.  At the right temperature, the water will seem to &quot;dance&quot; on the pan. 
#Cooking may take 30 to 60 seconds until the cooked side looks like the surface of the moon, then turn it over to cook the other side; with some practice, you can flip it in the air by swinging the pan. See the [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat Pancakes|whole-wheat pancakes]] recipe for air-flipping instructions.

Serve with maple syrup, [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar]], jam, spreads, etc.

Crêpes can be filled and folded into triangles or rolled up.  

Some tasty fillings include:
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberry]] jam &amp; chocolate sauce
* [[Cookbook:Nutella|nutella]] &amp; sliced [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]]
* nutella &amp; chopped [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|hazelnuts]]
* [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]]
* chocolate, [[Cookbook:Caramel|caramel]] or [[w:Butterscotch|butterscotch]] sauce
* [[w:Frangipane|frangipane]]
* [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
* sugar and butter, possibly with [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] or [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]], fresh or frozen
* [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] and brown sugar
* slivers of chicken, broccoli and cheese sauce
* wrapped around a frankfurter (See cheesy crepe above)

As Provence went back forth and between Italy and France for a while, basil, the pride of neighboring Liguria, is not at all out of place.

I am sure cucumbers well but they somehow don't ring true in this dish.

n. t.

----------------

A number of the recipes in [[w:wikibooks:fr:Catégorie:Cuisine provençale|Livre de cuisine]] include basil.  So I have added this as an option although I have never tried it myself. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 19:55, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

Honest Fraise !

I hope that was a mistake. Courgettes pas concombres.

Tu parles français ?


(réponse de fraise): Oui, je parle français, et j'habite en France :) My mother-in-law, who is French, gave me the recipe. She uses cucumbers.

I never used cucumbers though I am from the south, but I guess you are talking of traditional cucumbers, not the type full of water, grown in three days in glasshouses.

Btw, I saw these recipees were on your web site. The design is indicated copyrighted. Are there copyright on these recipees as well ?

*Well, geez, how about telling us how much water to add?  A cup?  4 cups?  A tablespoon?  A &quot;lot&quot;?  A &quot;little&quot;?  That seems like a pretty vital ingredient to leave out of the measurements![[User:66.1.40.242|66.1.40.242]] 17:10, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== VfD discussion ==

This is a worthless recipe taken from a very unreliable source, apparently almost word for word from a Net source.  The quantities are approximations added by various readers and there is no quantity for the water, the most important ingredient.  I have just consulted my magisterial 1960 edition of the Larousse Gastronomique and there is no mention of this soup amongst its hundreds of soup recipes.  It is similar to various old onion soup and garlic soup recipes, but without further info about the ingredients it should be deleted.  A web search turns up a '''real''' recipe for this soup that sounds excellent, but from a restaurant in Canada.  Here is the link to that recipe. 

http://www.gumbopages.com/food/french/garlic-soup.html

Go there, then compare that version with this weird entry here  -- which almost certainly was inserted by someone out of vanity or for testing the system.[[User:66.1.40.242|66.1.40.242]] 01:19, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

**Sorry, I keep forgetting that I have to log in a second time if I go to Wikibooks from WP -- it's a dumb system....[[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 01:27, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)
**I have to disagree, I don't think this is a speedy delete candidate.  I'd like to remind our users that any module on a wiki can be edited, so if you dislike a particular incarnation of a recipe, and has find another, feel free to change the page.  Recipes are not covered by copyright; but be carefull, as any descriptive text (rather than lists of ingredients and procedural steps) is covered by copyright protection. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:40, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC) (ps: I linked to the module in question and removed descriptive narative of the location)

*Well, I could always try to fiddle the recipe to what seem to be appropriate ingredients, but I find it strange that someone would dump this useless recipe here in the first place.  And it has almost *no* history in French culinary arts that I can find.   It's really just a garlic soup recipe.  Or a quick onion soup.  Anyway, let's wait and see if there are any other comments on the situation.[[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 18:56, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== 10-12 cloves of garlic ==

I changed mention of 12 cloves of garlic to 10-12 cloves of garlic. The reason I have done so is as follow. Initially, this recipe had no mention of quantities. Later, Gentgeen added them as a guess as 10 cloves. Eadmund came along and changed the quantity of garlic from 10 to 12. He/she didn't explain why the change was made. While it's possible he/she tested the recipe and found 12 was best, this seems unlikely.

The edit which changed 10 to 12 cloves was part of a series of edits to refine recipes to a style that Eadmund prefers. Some of these were useful such as fixing spelling mistakes and changing dividers like 1/2 to the integral form, some of these were okay such as changing Tablespoon to Tbsp. but quite a number of these were disruptive, removing any metric measurements (and replacing them with imperial when the recipe did not already include imperial), removing the Fahrenheit F from degrees etc. Nearly all of these have now been reverted, one of the last was in the Pavlova recipe which I carried out and which was how I came across Eadmund's edits.

Given this history, we can expect that far more likely, Eadmund has never tried this recipe and only changed the 10 cloves to 12 cloves because he/she somehow felt that 12 cloves was more imperial then 10 cloves which I guess he/she felt was too metric... I don't know but I'm guessing Eadmund is a conservative Brit. If the original author of this recipe has specified 10 cloves, I would have completely removed the 12 cloves but since it was a guess, I decided to leave Eadmund's recommendation even though the reason most likely has nothing to do with any actual experience, simply a preference for the number 12 to 10... [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 13:24, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== results ==

I gave this a shot, and it turned out a bland.  I found that by replacing some of the water with chicken stock, and adding more salt, it was more palatable.  But it wasn't very garlicy, and it really didn't have much flavor.  The texture and appearance was good, however.  I probably over-cooked the garlic.</text>

==Presentation==

With the reading reality check, you read some text, look away, and see if you can remember the text. Then, you check if it has changed when you turn back. Do this twice. You can also actively try to change the text (note that changing text in a Wikibook is not necessarily evidence you are dreaming though!).

For example, consider this paragraph. Try to remember its text. Then reload the page. If you realise that the text is now missing, you know that you are dreaming.

This reality check works because the mind has no external input to base the text upon.

Note you will usually have no problems reading text in a dream. It is remembering the text which is hard.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I looked at some text that I found, then looked away. I couldn't remember what it said.
* I looked at some text that I found, then looked away, then looked back. The text had completely changed or is scrambled up.
* I looked at some text that I found, and it just said &quot;lucid lucid lucid...&quot;. I was surprised but understood the message.
* I dreamt I was reading a book.  I closed my eyes to sneeze, and when I looked back, the text was the same, but it was in a completely different font.
*There was a poster on a distant wall showing a spruce tree somewhere. I looked away and then back at it, where the scene changed to a small spruce tree in the middle of a city.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I looked at some text that I found, then looked away. I could perfectly remember what it said.
* I looked at some text that I found, then looked away, then looked back. The text stayed exactly the same.
* I read a book and then the text start to disappear and then on TV said all books that made in Japan after 2002 will have disappearing text. I didn't realize it was a dream until I wake up.

The greens of the '''dandelion''' plant are sometimes used raw in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]],  sautéed or steamed. They taste like chicory and endive, with an intense heartiness overlying a bitter tinge. 

Dandelion leaves are best harvested in early spring, before the flowers appear. The youngest plants are best, being the least bitter. Dandelion can also be harvested again in late fall, as a frost destroys their protective bitterness. The dandelion is unusual, being one of the few non-toxic plants with milky white sap. Dandelions make a great free meal. Not only are they high in nutrition and very good for you, they also taste great!

[[Image:Loewenzahn pae.jpg|right|thumb|Dandelions]]

== Where Do I Take Them From? ==
Find some flowers in your yard or field that are not right by the road and collecting pollution from traffic. Larger varieties of dandelions and older, tougher leaves may be cooked like any greens.  They are probably closest in character to mustard greens, though bitter. Young plants are a little less bitter; the very young ones make an excellent though slightly bitter salad. 

With a knife, cut the whole plant at the top of the root so that it comes out of the ground intact. You should snap off the yellow flowers that have already opened up but be sure to leave any unopened buds - these are the tastiest part!

== Remove The Bitterness ==
Once you have given your pickings a good washing to get off all the dirt, stick them in a pot with enough water to just cover and boil until they are nice and soft. When the water turns yellow, replace it with fresh water and re-boil. This will remove the bitterness. When they are done they will have the consistency of cooked spinach. If you have very young plants you may decide to skip this step.

== Recipes ==
* Strain and dress with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], a squeeze of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]. Optionally, add little pieces of fried [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]].
* Dandelion salad is often accompanied with [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]].
* Lightly [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] (or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roast]]) a clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], half an [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] and a quarter teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red pepper flakes]] in a tablespoon and a half of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. Add a quart of damp greens to the sautéed vegetables, cover and steam over low heat for about thirty minutes.  Season to taste and serve.

'''''Paella Valenciana''''' and its seafood variation originated in the early 1800s in Spain's Valencian region near lake Albufera. Prior to the 19th century, the ingredients for Valencian paella varied greatly with the most unusual being marsh rat.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, ''La cocina de los mediterráneos'', Ediciones B - Mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

Valencians consider Valencian paella and [[cookbook:Paella de Marisco|seafood paella]] as authentic. They view all other variations as impostors.

This recipe is based on the one that Chef Juanry Segui serves in his restaurant, with plenty of detailed explanation for those attempting this for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacocinadejuanry.es/paella-valenciana-la-cocina-de-juanry.html Valencian paella recipe by Juanry Segui]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

*A clean, white towel large enough to cover the ''paellera''
*A wide heating source such as:  
:#A stove large enough to accommodate the size of the ''paellera''
:#A [http://www.deliciasdeespana.com/store1/shopexd.asp?id=313 gas burner] designed specifically for ''paelleras'' 
:#A charcoal barbecue 
:#A low, forged steel tripod to support the ''paellera'' over a wood or charcoal fire
:#Cinder blocks or heat-resistant bricks to support the ''paellera'' over a wood or charcoal fire

* 8 to 10 threads of [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]] and/or 1.5 teaspoons yellow food coloring (See note below about saffron and food coloring.)
* 400 gr (14 ounces) [[cookbook:rice|short-grain, white rice]]
* 6 to 8 branches of fresh [[cookbook:rosemary|rosemary]]

==Procedure==
Clean the snails, poultry and rabbit thoroughly. Cut the poultry and rabbit into small pieces and salt them generously. Pour olive oil in a ''paellera'' and, when hot, [[Cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] the poultry and rabbit pieces until golden brown. Add green peppers and sauté for one minute. Add the garlic and sauté until brown. Be careful; garlic burns easily. Once the garlic is brown, add the paprika followed quickly by the tomatoes to prevent the paprika from burning. Sauté until the tomatoes become dark and pulpy and the mixture has reduced a bit. Add the water and bring it to a rolling boil. Then add the snails, fresh haricot beans (if canned, continue reading to see when to add these), runner beans (or green beans) and saffron (and/or food coloring). Allow the mixture to boil for 10 minutes over a high flame.

After 10 minutes have passed, you should have a flavorful broth. It's customary at this point to allow your dinner guests to taste it. The purpose is to determine if the broth needs more salt. If so, add more salt, a pinch at a time, until everybody is satisfied.
 
Add the rice and stir it using the rice skimmer. Then, once again with the skimmer, spread it over the bottom of the ''paellera''. The coating of rice should be one [[Cookbook:cm|centimeter]] thick. Let it cook over a high flame for 10 minutes. Then reduce the heat to medium and let it [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for four minutes. Add the canned haricot beans and reduce the heat again to low and let it simmer for another four minutes. Taste the rice about once every four to five minutes. You'll know it's done when it's slightly firm to the bite. Italians use a similar approach when cooking pasta. Italians call this texture ''[[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]]''.

At this point, there should be some toasted rice sticking to the bottom of the pan. This is a delicacy in Valencia called ''socarrat''. If no ''socarrat'' has developed, increase the flame to high and listen for the crackling sound of rice toasting at the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to low once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards.

Remove the pan from the heat when the rice is almost dry and place the rosemary branches on top. Cover with a clean, white towel (a white towel prevents dye from leeching onto the paella) and wait five minutes before serving to allow the rice to absorb the remaining broth.

French cuisine is characterised by its extreme diversity. Despite France's history of political and cultural centralization around its capital Paris, each region has its own distinctive specialities: cuisine from North-West France uses [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] and [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]; Provençal cuisine (from the southeast) favours [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and herbs; and eastern French recipes are reminiscent of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|German cuisine]], including [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]s, [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] and [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]]. [[Cookbook:Wine|Wine]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] are an integral part of French cuisine, both as ingredients and accompaniments.

==French cuisine today==
French cuisine can broadly be divided into three categories:

* ''Cuisine bourgeoise'', which includes all the classic French dishes which are not (or no longer) specifically regional, and which have been adapted over the years to suit the taste of the affluent classes. At the 'top end' of this category is what is known as ''haute cuisine'', a highly complex and refined approach to food preparation and kitchen management which developed from court cuisine.

* ''Cuisine du terroir'', which covers regional specialties with a strong focus on quality local produce and peasant tradition.

* ''Cuisine nouvelle'' or &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot;, which developed in the 1970s as a reaction to traditional cuisine, under the influence of chefs such as Michel Guérard. This type of cooking is characterized by shorter cooking times, much lighter sauces and dressings, and smaller portions presented in a refined, decorative manner. Its modern, inventive approach sometimes includes techniques and combinations from abroad (especially Asia) and has had a profound influence on cooking styles all over the world.

Today (2004) there is a distinct focus on ''cuisine du terroir'' in France, with a return to traditional rustic cooking and the flavours of local farm produce. The ''fusion'' cuisine popular in the English-speaking world is not widespread in France, though some restaurants in the capital have a ''fusion'' theme, and many modern French chefs are influenced by a variety of international cooking styles.

Vegetarianism (''végétarisme'') is not widespread in France, and few restaurants cater for vegetarians. Veganism (''végétalisme'') is hardly known or represented at all.

For French people, cooking is an immensely important part of their culture and a way of life.

PAPETON D’AUBERGINES - 
(Eggplant Mousse) - 
Why “papeton”, which means “pope” in the Provencal dialect? Here is the historical explanation: this recipe was, in fact, created in the fourteenth century by the French papal chef in Avignon. It was his response to the Italian pope’s criticism of the French cuisine. One of the surprising consequences of the holy “war” between the two popes is this spectacular vegetable dish: a delicate and unique way to serve eggplant - light and delicious.

[[Image:Daucus Carota.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Parts of a carrot]]                    

A '''carrot''' is a root [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]], typically orange
in color with a woody texture. The younger the carrot the smaller and more tender the flesh is, so 'baby carrots' are often preferred for raw use. Note that the 'baby carrots' you can buy bagged, washed and pre-peeled in US supermarkets are not actually 'babies' at all - they are larger carrots that have been mechanically shaped into stubs. True baby carrots (often known as 'Dutch carrots') are often sold by the bunch complete with tops. With a carrot that young, peeling is unnecessary - all that is needed is to scrub them under the tap to remove any dirt, and to cut off the hairy 'tail' and the leafy top. Older carrots benefit from peeling as the skin gets a lot more fibrous and hairy with age.

Carrots are often eaten raw, whole or shaved into [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]s for color, and are often cooked in [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]s and [[Cookbook:Stew|stew]]s. They are an essential ingredient in [[Cookbook:Carrot Cake|carrot cake]]. The greens are not generally eaten (though they have food benefit to humans, but often taste bitter), but they are technically edible.

Together with [[cookbook:Onion|onion]] and [[cookbook:Celery|celery]], carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a ''[[Cookbook:Mirepoix|mirepoix]]'' to make various broths.

Carrots are orange because they contain large amounts of beta carotene (a precursor to Vitamin A). This gives rise to the myth that they will improve your eyesight, by enhancing the performance of receptors on the retina in your eye. They are nevertheless good for eye health. Carrots are also rich in dietary [[Cookbook:Fiber|fiber]], [[W:Antioxidant|antioxidants]], [[w:Dietary mineral|minerals]] and are alkaline food.

[[Image:Carrots of many colors.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The variety of carrot colors]]
Carrots originally came in purple, white and yellow colours. The now standard orange carrot was developed in Holland in the 16th century. Different colored carrots are coming back in style. New yellow carrots get their color from xanthophylls, which have been linked to good eye health. Red carrots contain lycopene, also found in [[cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] and thought to guard against heart disease and some cancers. Purple carrots’ anthocyanins are regarded as powerful antioxidants that help protect cells from damage. White carrots lack any pigmentation, but do contain other health-promoting substances called phytochemicals, natural bioactive compounds found in plant foods that work with nutrients and dietary fibre to protect against disease.

:''For the long green variety of onion, see [[Cookbook:Green onion|Green onion]].''

'''Shallots''' are a very small sweet onion like bulb that forms in clusters like garlic.Shallots have a papery skin that must be removed before they can be used. They grow in clusters, similar to [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]. The taste is similar to a standard onion, but more delicate almost a blend of onion/garlic flavor. Whole immature shallots are sometimes used like [[Cookbook:Spring Onion|spring onions]]. Shallot tops are eaten much like chives, and can be dried and saved for seasoning later.

[[Image:alfalfa CDC.jpg|right|frame|alfalfa sprouts]]
'''Alfalfa''' sprouts are tiny alfalfa plants, usually grown directly in their container.  This should be — though famously has not always been — a sterile hydroponic environment, so there should be no need to wash the sprouts before using them.  Store the alfalfa in the refrigerator with the lid on so that it stays moist but not too wet, and do not put it in the &quot;quick chill zone&quot; or leave it out on the counter — if sprouts dry out or freeze, they become unpalatable.  If the conditions are right, the sprouts may continue to grow while being refrigerated, so the container can potentially refill itself as the shoots are used.  An orange LED in the refrigerator may help them grow.

Alfalfa can be used without any further treatment, or can have its seed casings washed away. A bit of underwater shaking will take off most of the seed casings. Most of these can then be floated away; the rest will remain in the rinse bowl after the sprouts are removed.

Add alfalfa sprouts to a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]], or add them to a [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] such as a [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburger]] or [[Cookbook:Taco|taco]]. Alfalfa sprouts are a good source of vitamin K and chlorophyll and are said to be an extremely healthy food. Because they are more healthy than [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], they could be used as an appropriate replacement.

Mixed sprouts have become very common. It is not unusual to see &quot;alfalfa and [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]] sprouts&quot;, &quot;alfalfa and [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] sprouts&quot;, or &quot;alfalfa and [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] sprouts&quot;. This makes for a much more spicy and pungent mix. When alfalfa sprouts are mixed with [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] sprouts, a mild mixture, although one with a more significant texture, is produced.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Alfalfa Sprouts|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3}}

Since seeds can easily be sprouted, regardless of season, alfalfa sprouts are available all year round.

[[Image:CDC_artichoke.jpg|right|artichoke]]
The '''artichoke''' is a giant thistle flower bud. It is sometimes called the '''globe artichoke''', or '''French artichoke''' to avoid confusion with the [[Cookbook:Sunchoke|sunchoke]], which is an entirely different plant that sometimes goes by the confusing name &quot;Jerusalem artichoke&quot;.

Unlike most vegetables, only a very small part of the artichoke is actually edible &amp;mdash; the very bases of the &quot;leaves&quot; and the interior heart. The heart of the flower is topped with spiky bristles or hairs that would be unpleasant to consume, and the leaves are extremely tough and fibrous.

Artichoke hearts are often sold in a [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] or preserved form, and served as part of an [[Cookbook:Antipasto|antipasto]] dish at the beginning of a meal.

==Selection and Storage==
High-quality artichokes are usually compact and heavy for their size. Squeezed, a fresh artichoke will make a squeak. The thickness of each stalk should correspond to the size of the artichoke. Thin stalks signal dehydration, so look for stalks that are firm without “give.” 

Artichokes remain fairly constant in appearance for weeks, but flavor is adversely affected from the moment they are cut from the stalk. For maximum taste and tenderness, cook as soon as possible. Do not stock up on artichokes. Refrigerate unwashed, in a plastic bag, for up to 1 week.

==Cooking==
Start by cutting the thorns off with kitchen scissors or simply take a kitchen knife and cut straight across the top part off the artichoke. This will leave a flat top on the artichoke. Note that &quot;thorn-free&quot; artichokes, besides having far less of the edible part, generally do have little hidden thorns that are hard to remove.

Artichokes should be very well cooked. This is required to soften them enough to eat. Make sure to check the water level as the artichoke will absorb water as it softens. Add more water if they are still not tender and continue to cook. Unlike most vegetables, artichokes should be cooked until they are a darker color green than when they were fresh.

Artichokes may be [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaved]], [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]], or [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooked]], although steaming is best. When steaming, spread the leaves a bit and place the artichokes stem-end-up to ensure that plenty of steam gets to the inside. Microwaving is essentially steaming; cover the artichokes and add a bit of water.

You may want to stuff the artichokes prior to cooking. They can be stuffed with ground beef, rice, or anything you prefer.

==Eating==
[[File:Cooked artichoke heart.jpg|thumb|Artichoke heart.]]
Although people from artichoke-growing regions (and many of their descendants) are very familiar with the artichoke, people from elsewhere rarely encounter this vegetable and eating one can be a trap for the inexperienced. 

After cooking, the large leathery &quot;leaves&quot; forming a tight rosette are pulled off one by one, and their soft, inner basal part (usually) is dipped in some kind of sauce, perhaps [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] or [[Cookbook:Vinaigrette|vinaigrette]]. The dipped soft part is then scraped off with the teeth and all the rest of the leaf discarded &amp;mdash; absolutely ''not'' to be eaten. The fleshy, edible part is delicious, but quite sparse in proportion to that which is discarded. 

This process continues until most of the leaves have been removed and the remaining ones are too small and delicate to eat in this manner. This point is difficult to judge and the novice artichoke eater may wish to seek guidance by discreetly watching a companion.

With the softest inner leaves, there is no need to scrape away a layer using the teeth.  Pull these leaves off in bunches of perhaps 10 to 20, folding as needed to bunch up the lower edge, then dip the lower edge in the sauce and bite it off. Discard the upper portion, which may contain thorns.

Finally, an irritating fur-like layer of thistle is exposed. This layer can be pulled out, scraped out, scooped out, or cut out. It is generally best to scrape the thistle away with a sideways motion of a dull table knife (a butter knife). Some practice will be required. If this process is difficult, it is likely that the artichoke was not cooked enough.

The remaining part, minus any stem still attached, is the artichoke heart. This is often considered the best part of the artichoke. Dip it in sauce and eat it.

It will be seen that the art of eating this food is in itself a satisfying and time-consuming matter which has wider implications than mere nourishment.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Artichokes|2|2|3|3|3|2|2|2|2|2|2|2}}

Most species of artichoke have their peak season in spring, but some species produce all year round (with some having their peak in autumn), especially in locations closer to the equator. Artichokes harvested in the winter and spring will be globe-shaped, whereas artichokes harvested in the summer and fall will be more conical.

Artichokes are common in Europe and now the UK. Fresh butter is the main dip of choice. The season starts in late autumn but is quite short. A good farmers market or greengrocer is the best place to get them in Britain. LC</text>

'''Arugula''' (also known as ''rocket'', ''rocket salad'', ''rughetta'', ''roquette'' or ''rucola''), is a leafy green vegetable with a pungent &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;stimulating&quot; flavour. It is usually eaten raw in salads but can also be steamed or cooked and served with meat or pasta. 

Arugula has been grown in the Mediterranean region since Roman times, and it was once considered to be an aphrodisiac. It was traditionally collected from the wild and not grown commercially until recent years.

[[Image:Asparagus produce-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Asparagus]]

'''Asparagus''' are the growing shoots of a fern-like plant. Asparagus has a delicate flavor and diuretic properties.

One distinctive problem with asparagus is that a constituent chemical of the plant is metabolised and excreted in the urine, giving it a distinctive, mildly unpleasant odour. Apparently not everyone who eats asparagus produces the odor, but also not everyone is able to smell the odor once it is produced. [http://my.webmd.com/content/article/43/1671_51089] Many people prefer not to eat asparagus because of this effect, as it can put a damper on an otherwise romantic evening...

There are three different common 'varieties' of asparagus sold in the markets which are actually the same plant grown under different conditions. 'Green' asparagus is left exposed to the air so that it grows normally. 'White' asparagus is piled high with straw as it grows so that the shoots remain pale. The flavour is identical, but some people believe that the white asparagus is more tender and flavourful. Finally, a 'purple' asparagus is occasionally seen, which is again the same except with purple streaks on the stem.

Almost the whole shoot is edible, but the prized portion is the tender growing end. The base of the shoot can be woody and fibrous, and it is generally discarded about a third of the way up. The traditional way to prepare asparagus for cooking is to take hold of a few shoots at a time, holding an end in each hand, and firmly but gently 'snap' it. The shoots will snap at their natural break point, which should be where the woody end meets the more tender portion. Another way to prepare asparagus for cooking is to peel the bottom end with a knife or a vegetable peeler, working from the middle towards the end. This will remove the toughest fibers from the outside although some will remain and will need to be cut an inch or so from the base of the stems.

===Cooking Asparagus===

In its simplest form, the shoots are boiled or steamed until tender and served with a light sauce or melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]. 

Asparagus is very long and narrow, and it is traditionally cooked in an 'asparagus steamer.' This is a very tall narrow pot with about an inch of [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] water in the bottom. The asparagus is tied in a bundle and stood upright in the steamer for about five minutes so that the toughest end gets the most cooking and the tips are just barely [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]]. A modern alternative is to use a frypan - put boiling water in the pan and slide the asparagus gently into the water so it can lie sideways across the pan. Asparagus is cooked when it turns bright green, which only takes a few minutes regardless of the cooking method. 

Asparagus is very good in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fries]], where it is usually cut into lengths of about an inch and added at the last minute before serving. It can also be made into [[Cookbook:Asparagus Soup|asparagus soup]], especially the older and slightly less tender shoots. 

If, as is common, the asparagus is overcooked or allowed to sit too long, [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] is a good dip to use.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Asparagus|1|1|1|2|3|3|1|1|1|1|1|1}}

Asparagus have a very specific season that starts in May and traditionally ends on the 24th of June. Out of season asparagus are grown in regions close to the equator or in greenhouses. If fresh asparagus isn't available, canned, jarred or frozen asparagus usually are.

==&quot;False&quot; Asparagus==
The shoots of a related plant, ''Ornithogalum pyrenaicum'', called Prussian asparagus, have been used for similar purposes as genuine asparagus.

Many unrelated plants are called &quot;asparagus&quot; or &quot;used as asparagus&quot; when their shoots are used in a similar way.

==Introduction==

The Korean alphabet, known commonly as [[''Hangul'']] in English but  as [[''Hangeul'']] in the official standard Romanization rule, ([[wikt:한글|한글]], &quot;great script&quot;), is considered one of the most efficient and logical writing systems in the world. While most modern alphabets evolved from earlier hieroglyphics or ideographs, 한글 (''Hangeul'') was created specifically to make it easy to read and write the Korean language.

Although the characters of 한글 (''Hangeul'') may appear to be [[w:Ideogram|ideograms]] like the traditional ''Hanja'' ([[wikt:한자|한자]], [[wikt:漢字#Korean|漢字]]), they really form an alphabet. Each block character represents one syllable and is made up of individual [[w:Hangul#Jamo|''jamo'' (자모)]], much like the letters in the Latin alphabet.  한글 (''Hangeul'') is easy to learn because it has only 24 basic jamo.

:See Wikipedia's entries on [[w:Hangul|Hangul]] and [[w:Hanja|Hanja]] for more about the history and design of the Korean writing systems.

==Consonants==
[[File:Korean consonants.svg|thumb|14 Korean consonants]]
Below are the consonant ([[wikt:자음|자음]]) letters of the Korean alphabet. You don't need to memorize them yet because individual lessons will cover each letter in detail. For now, just be aware that the Korean alphabet has ten basic consonants and nine variations on them: 

{{Korean/Consonant jamo chart}}

Notice that some consonants have two different pronunciations (e.g. ㄱ pronounced as /g/ or /k/ depending on context). Some of the alternative sounds in pronunciation of the basic consonant letters are their sound value as the final jamos when they are not altered by the initial jamo of the next syllabic character. ㅅ ㅈ ㅊ ㅎ has [t] sound as the final. Also, some are &quot;aspirated&quot; and some are &quot;tense&quot;.  Those details and more are explained in [[../Essential Pronunciation Rules/]].

==Vowels==
[[File:Korean vowels.svg|thumb|6 Korean regular vowels: diphthongs in red]]
There are 21 letters used to represent vowels: six basic vowels, nine combinations of those six basic vowels (which originally were all pronounced as diphthongs), and six vowels with an extra short dash representing the initial ''y'' [j] sound. 
{{Korean/Vowel jamo chart}}

==End of introduction==
To learn how to read, write, and pronounce each Korean letter, proceed to [[Korean/RWP|the Read, Write, and Pronounce Korean]] course.

Cooking '''oysters''' - from the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''



=== Stewed Oysters ===
''Recipe moved to [[Cookbook:Stewed Oysters]]''

=== Oysters Roasted ===
''Recipe moved to  [[Cookbook:Roasted Oysters with Madeira]]''

=== Another Mode ===
''Recipe moved to [[Cookbook:Simple Roasted Oysters]]'' 

=== Scalloped Oysters ===

One hundred oysters, a baker's loaf crumbed, four eggs boiled hard; salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Chop the eggs very fine and mix with the crumbs, which season highly with cayenne and salt. Cover the bottom of a deep pie-dish with the eggs and crumbs; then with a fork, place layer of oysters with two or three small pieces of butter, and so continue until all are in, reserving sufficient crumbs for the cover For those who like it, a little mace may be added. Bake in a quick oven three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot. 

=== Fried Oysters ===
''Recipe moved to [[Cookbook:Breaded Fried Oysters]]'' 

=== Panned Oysters ===

Take fifty large oysters, remove every particle of shell which may adhere to them, put them in to a colander and pour over a little water to rinse them. After letting them drain, put them into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter, salt' black and red pepper to taste. Put them over a clear fire, and stir while cooking. As soon as they commence to shrink remove them from the fire, and send to table hot in a well (covered) heated dish. 

=== To Pickle Oysters ===

Drain off the liquor from one hundred oysters, wash them and put to them a table-spoonful of salt and a tea-cup of vinegar; let them simmer over the fire about ten minutes, taking off the scum as it rises; then take out the oysters and put to their own liquor a tablespoonful of whole black pepper and a teaspoonful of mace and cloves; let it boil five minutes, skim and pour it over the oysters in a jar. 

=== To Spice Oysters ===

One hundred oysters, one dozen cloves, two dozen allspice, mace, cayenne pepper, and salt to taste. 

Strain the liquor through a sieve, put it in a saucepan, and add the oysters, spice, pepper, salt, and half a pint of cider vinegar. Place them over a slow fire, and as soon as they boil take them off. Pour them into a large bowl and set them away to cool. When cold cover them close.

=== Oysters Kilpatrick ===
Oysters Kilpatrick can be made in one of 2 ways. To begin you need to make the Kilpatrick sauce which is 1 part Tomato Sauce to 1 part Worcestershire Sauce which is thoroughly mixed together. The next step is to finely dice bacon into small pieces which is then placed over the raw oysters. Once the bacon pieces are placed over the oysters quite generously, then pour the Kilpatrick sauce over the top of the oysters and bacon. Now the oysters can be placed in a oven proof frying pan with a stable base for the oysters and baked at a moderate temperate (180 degrees Celsius) until the oysters are firm to the touch and bacon is crispy. The oysters can also be placed in a tray under a grill with a high heat until firm and bacon is crispy. Serve the Kilpatrick oysters with either lemon wedges or additional Kilpatrick sauce.

Placing the oysters on a generous amount of rock salt will help stand them upright, keeping the bacon and the sauce where it needs to be.</text>

This is how to cook [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], the Italian way.

Depending on your recipe, you might have to start preparing sauces or other additions before making the actual pasta. The general rule is that the sauce should wait for the pasta, not the other way around.

This method of boiling applies to most types of pasta.  On average, for every 200 grams of pasta you need 4 liters of water.
When the water boils, put in the salt; you will need about one tablespoon of salt for every two quarts of water. 
You can also put the salt when the water is cold, but the salt will take longer to dissolve, and can stain or corrode the bottom of stainless steel pots. 
Once the salt has dissolved and the water has returned to a boil, throw in your pasta and start measuring the time. 
 
The length of time differs for each kind of pasta (generally, the box suggests a boiling time), and goes from 5 minutes for thin spaghettini to 12 and up minutes for some thicker kinds. A bit less time than suggested will produce a firmer pasta (al dente - heavy to digest, however) while a bit more time causes pasta to be more flexible. It is a good idea to follow the suggestions on the box until you are sufficiently experienced in making pasta. Fresh, egg-based pasta (''pasta all'uovo'') takes very little time to cook. Fresh [[Cookbook:Noodle|noodles]] hardly need a minute after the water has returned to the boil; filled pasta like [[Cookboook:tortellini|tortellini]] need only a few minutes to cook through. Many experienced cooks like to sample a piece of the pasta while boiling it (''spizzicatura'' - they &quot;fish&quot; it out with a slotted spoon) to stop cooking just at their desired consistency. When boiling time is completed, separate pasta from water with a strainer, put in a wide dish and add everything else. A suggestion: a simple combination of butter and Parmigiano Reggiano, or some oil, parsley or basil and fresh garlic, will be as tasty as more sophisticated preparations. Serve the pasta hot, immediately, unless the recipe says differently.

Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a dynamic programming/scripting language based on concepts of Lisp, C, and Unix shells. It can be used interactively, or by running scripts (programs) which can use a package system for structuring, hence allowing to do much with little code. Tcl is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, as well as other platforms, as open-source software under BSD-like license, or as pre-built binaries.

This book also discusses the GUI toolkit Tk in considerable extent, even though it's not in the title. For most users, Tcl/Tk form a single conceptual entity.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups (480 ml) long-grain [[Cookbook:rice|rice]], cooked 
*2-1/2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 medium eggplant, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch (1cm) cubes 
*vegetable oil 
*2 Tablespoons whole coriander seeds 
*2 teaspoons yellow split peas 
*1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]] 
*1 3/4-inch (4cm) stick of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] 
*3 Tablespoons dried unsweetened [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] 
*2 Tablespoons [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] 
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]

==Procedure==
This great Indian dish should be served at room temperature. 
# Place the eggplant into a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well and allow to sit for half an hour, then rinse lightly and allow to drain. 
# Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over a medium flame. Add the coriander, seeds, split peas, cumin, and cinnamon. Stir well. When the spices have darkened, remove them and place on a plate lined with a paper towel. 
# In the same pan, fry the coconut, stirring constantly. When it turns a golden-brown, remove and place on the paper towel. 
# In another skillet, sauté the eggplant until it is cooked through. It should turn a bruised dark brown. Be careful not to add too much oil in the process. Remove, set aside, and keep warm. 
# Put the dried spices into a mortar and grind into a fine powder. You'll find that a well-cleaned coffee grinder works well as a substitute. 
# In a small pot, combine the lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and allow to simmer for 3 minutes. 
# In a skillet, add the cooked rice and the eggplant and saute with very little oil. Mix well. Allow the mixture to cool. Add 2 more tablespoons of vegetable oil; mix well. Add the coconut-spice mixture and the lemon mixture. Mix well and serve.

'''Bengal Potatoes''' is an Indian side dish.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Potato|Potatoes]] - approximately 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs]] (900g)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Panch Puran|panch puran]]
*Ground [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*[[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]] (preferably not too hot.  I use Kashmiri chili )
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] or, preferably, [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]

==Procedure==
#Put a little oil or ghee into a large heavy-bottomed pan with a good lid and put it onto a medium heat.
#Add panch puran, and let them cook gently until the seeds start to pop.
#Wash but do not peel the potatoes and cut into large bite sized chunks. Add to pan, stirring so that the seeds coat the potatoes evenly.
#Add a little ground turmeric, enough to just color the cut surfaces of all the pieces.
#Add a little chili powder.  The quantity varies depending on your palate, and the strength of the chili.   
#Stir well to distribute the spices.
#Do ''one'' of the following:
:*Put on the lid, turn down the heat, and allow the potatoes to cook in their own steam until cooked through.  A little extra water can be added if necessary, but as little as possible should be used.  The potatoes should not boil. 
:*Put the spiced potatoes on a tray in a hot oven until cooked through.

Serve as a snack food with drinks, or as part of an Indian meal.

Hello there, I thin it's great that you are stasting a book on this subject.  Now, If I may, I would like to make some recomendations, etc. Note that i'm no expert on the are, but an avid reader of anything and everything.  My recomendations might be usefull or they might just be unnecesarry that's for you to decide. 

First, I think that if you are starting by defining Paleoanthropology, you should at least give an intuitive o very simple definition of what it is as your begining sentence.  The same should be sayed about your chapter on anthropology.  You also have many typos (which I propably have too... hehe).

I didn't know if i shoudl take the liberty of changing some of the things, or letting you know so that you could make those changes you thought appropiate, as the father of this creature.

If you would like me to keep reading and make other comments, let me know please.

Take Care, and good luck with this amazing adventure.

== Paleoanthropology ==

Thank you so much for this! It's a great idea for a book, and one that I look forwarding to reading. I've already started doing some editorial proofreading on the earlier chapters, and have left a few comments in Talk for specific sections.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 02:50, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Just wanted to stand in awe for a moment at your perseverance. It looks like you've been doing a ton of work on this, and I'm tired already just after looking at the first four chapters. It exhausts me just thinking about all the typing and/or scanning you must have done to get these notes into something usable. *boggles*  --[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 04:24, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Hey, thanks a lot for the hard work you put into this book. I read through the entire thing ... and the recomended sections as well, as I am begining to develop an interest in mammalian paleontology. The only complain I can lodge is just that it was too short! It is easy to find bits and pieces on the internet, mostly from a certain point of view, but one that puts it all into context like this book does is very nice to read. I hope you will expand your book!</text>

Copied discussion from [[en:Talk:How to cook pasta]]
&lt;i&gt;
Questions for the Italian cooks: When I cook pasta, I always rinse the pasta with cold water after straining it.  The purpose is to stop the heat so that I can ensure the pasta would not continue to cook itself after removing from the fire.  The outcome is a more predictable consistency each time.  The cold pasta is heated up again just before serving.  Is such practice common in Italian cooking?  It is for Chinese.  Since Chinese and Italian cuisine are both famous for their endless choices of pasta, they both should have their tips and tricks passed down through generations.
&lt;/i&gt;

:I rinse pasta after it's done cooking too, but I always thought it was to rinse off the extra oil and salt.  My family is Italian in a way (my step-great-grandfather was Italian). I think it's probably a custom that was originated by both cultures. [[user:Dreamyshade|Dreamyshade]]

:Yes, cold water stops cooking, so pasta would not loose any more consistency. But this has to be a very quick operation, or you will eat a cold pasta, and cold pasta is not able to capture sauce (so you practically would eat pasta and sauce separately). Because of this, this operation might be useful if you have to put hot sauces on it; otherwise it is better to have pasta served within 3-4 minutes, or if you need more time to serve it, boiling one minute less than suggested (see box).

:[[User:Paolor|Paolor]] ([[User talk:Paolor|talk]]) 00:08, 21 January 2008 (UTC) '''This is absolutely not common in Italian cooking!'''  The only case where you would rinse the pasta in cold water is if to make a cold pasta salad.  Rinsing not only would cool off the pasta, it would also wash away the starch and the sauce won't stick to the pasta anymore.

I don't really think this is a recipe, but is a technique.  Perhaps it should be moved to [[Cookbook:Cooking Pasta]] and than find a place for other techniques in the cookbook.  [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:32, 24 Feb 2004 (UTC)

{{vegetable}}

'''Eggplant''' (also known as '''aubergine''') is a shiny bulbous vegetable in the nightshade family that comes in green, white, or, more commonly, purple. The eggplant itself is actually a berry, and its edible watertight skin and disc-like seeds show clearly its similarity to peppers and tomatoes. Unlike its cousins, however, the eggplant has a firm, dense flesh that is too bitter to eat raw.  Eggplants range in size from large purple gourds bigger than a person's hand to tiny marble-sized green Asian eggplants. The smaller varieties are said to be less bitter and to need less preparation. Many people find eggplant to be an acquired taste.  Its versatility leads to eggplant dishes in many different cuisines, from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]] to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]].

Eggplant can be a very bitter vegetable, requiring special preparation to minimise this bitterness (see the section on preparation below). Some modern varieties of eggplant are bred to be free from bitterness, and can be cooked without the preparatory methods. Experimentation may be needed to balance any bitterness with sweeter flavours within the same dish or meal; this is why eggplants and tomatoes work so well together.

==Preparation==

The usual preparation method for reducing the bitter taste of eggplant involves slicing, washing and then rubbing the vegetable with salt. The salt pulls out the bitter juices via osmosis, so when preparing it is often best to put the slices of eggplant on a rack over a sink or on paper towels. Wash the salt off after at least thirty minutes, dry thoroughly and cook the eggplant as desired; keep in mind that often a small amount of salt remains in the flesh, so the amount of salt added during cooking may be less than you might think. When the eggplant has been &quot;purged&quot; in this manner, the flesh becomes much more absorbent and flexible, like a sponge, and is excellent at absorbing other liquids and flavors. Be aware that the eggplant can absorb more oil than any other vegetable. Another cleaning method is to simply soak the pieces in clean cold water or milk for thirty minutes.

Once prepared, eggplant may be stuffed, [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]], [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]], [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], or [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]]. It is an essential ingredient in several savoury dishes, most notably the Greek [[Cookbook:Moussaka|moussaka]].

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Eggplant|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|3|3|3|2}}

In tropical climates, eggplants are grown all year round, with a peak season in the fall. In colder regions, they can only be grown in greenhouses or imported.

{{fruit}}

The '''avocado''', also known as the '''avocado pear''' or '''alligator pear''', is a starchy high-fat fruit. Like the [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], it is not sweet and is sometimes considered a vegetable.
The avocado is very popular in [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], making a good substitute for meats and cheeses in sandwiches because of the high fat content. The fruit is not sweet, but starchy, flavorful, and of smooth, more or less creamy, texture. Avocados have a large smooth pit and a leathery skin, both of which are easy to remove. The flesh is typically greenish yellow to golden yellow if ripe, turning dark soon after exposure to air. Mashed avocados are excellent baby food.

Avocado oil is a [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|monounsaturated fat]]. The purified oil has a very high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] of about 510°F/265°C, making it suitable for the very hottest types of frying.

Avocado varieties can be classified into two types. The type grown in dry areas has a rough dark skin which may be almost black. This type is the size of a small pear. It is the creamiest and best tasting because of its high fat content. The type grown in wet areas has a bright green skin. It is larger, perhaps 5 inches long and 3.5 in diameter. This type is commonly chosen for the more-attractive skin and for reduced calories, though it is generally inferior for eating.

Avocados ripen a few days after they are picked, but ripen faster if stored with other fruit such as [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]].

Avocados have a taste reminiscent of [[Cookbook:Century egg|Century eggs]].

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Avocado|1|2|3|3|3|2|1|1|1|1|1|1}}

The precise season for avocados depends highly on the cultivar, but nearly all varieties reach their peak season around spring. The Hass avocado is the only variety that is available all year. [http://www.avocado.org/about/about_386.php?sd=about]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Japanese counter word}}
Most Japanese nouns do not have plural forms.  Instead, when indicating a specific number or amount of a noun, the noun is followed by a '''counter''' (助数詞, じょすうし). There is a large number of these counters, each referring to a particular kind of thing to count.

For example when referring to four books: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{furi|四|よん}} || {{furi|冊|さつ}} || の || {{furi|本|ほん}}
|-
| Four || volumes || ''genitive marker'' || book
|}

Counters can also be used in adverbial or nominal manner. &quot;There are four books there&quot; can be either of the following:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Adverbial
| あそこに本が四冊あります。
|-
! Nominal
| あそこに四冊の本があります。
|}

{{Japanese related|content|
* [[Japanese/Numbers]]
}}
For the most part, two numbering systems are used: the numbers derived from Chinese (いち, に, さん, etc.) and the native Japanese counting words (ひとつ, ふたつ, みっつ, etc.).

== Common counters ==

Some of the most common &amp; basic counters:
;人 (にん)
: For counting people. One person, &quot;一人&quot;, is &quot;ひとり&quot; and two, &quot;二人&quot;, is &quot;ふたり&quot;, using the native Japanese (''kunyomi'') words for counting. From there on, the Chinese derived (''onyomi'') numbers are used, so &quot;三人&quot; is read &quot;さんにん&quot;, &quot;四人&quot; is read &quot;よにん&quot; and so on.
: There is a related counter, 名 (めい).

;枚 (まい)
: For counting flat objects (e.g. sheets of paper, plates, clothes).
: Examples: いちまい、にまい、さんまい、よんまい、...

;本 (ほん)
: For counting long slender objects, such as bottles or pencils.
: This counter, like most, uses the Chinese derived numbers straight through. But the 'h' sound (as in ''hon'' mutates into a 'b' or 'p' depending on what is put in front of it.
: Examples: いっぽん、にほん、さんぼん、よんほん、ごほん、ろっぽん、ななほん、はっぽん、きゅうほん、じゅっぽん etc.

;分 (ふん)
: For counting minutes.
: This counter uses Chinese derrived numbers, and with quite a few irregularities a bit similar to &quot;本&quot;.
: Examples: いっぷん、にふん、さんぷん、よんふん、ごふん、ろっぷん、ななふん、はっぷん、きゅうふん、じゅっぷん

;つ
: For counting generic things (basically anything that doesn't have a counter).
: This generic counter uses the Japanese native counters, up until ten, where the ''tsu'' is dropped, and Chinese derived numbers alone are used.
: Examples:ひとつ、ふたつ、みっつ、よっつ、いつつ、むっつ、ななつ、やっつ、ここのつ、とお.

匹 is often used for animals generally, but in more careful use it is restricted to small animals, such as cats and dogs.

Large animals notably include horses, cattle, elephants, also whales, dolphins.

Some kinds of animals have two or more counters.  For example, &quot;3 butteflies&quot; can be translated into 3羽 or 3匹.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As far as i am concerned this method for reality testing is misleading. I can see no reason that such a test will work other than suggestion and expectation. Why would the dreaming mind have any trouble creating a dream nose with one (dream eye) closed? 

Where is the scientific justification of this technique and what is the source?

: Admittedly, most reality checks have no scientific justification but many people have found them reliable and some have been tested by the Lucidity Institute. Most techniques, reality checks etc. now end up in online forums and therefore it is extremely hard to find the original inventor of any technique. I do not see why the source is relevant.

: It has been found helpful ''but not nessecary'' for you to already believe or be uncertain if your surroundings are a dream. Usually before you do a reality check you are uncertain.

: One possible explanation with, I stress, no ''scientific'' justification, is that your mind cannot simulate the suffocation which would occur if you were to hold your nose indefinately. Heartrate has been found to be linked to the heartrate in dreams (at least it speeds up during dreams and further during nightmares) and I cannot see why breathing can't be linked as well. Breathing does speed up in the REM state. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 12:30, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: I am sorry, I thought you were talking about the breathing reality check. I really wish this naming problem could be solved somehow :(.

: Seeing things in dreams is not quite related to your &quot;dream eyes&quot;. Every experiences third-person vision at some point in their dreams, don't they? Additionally, avid readers of manga/anime comics can sometimes dream in comic style, complete with speechbubbles!

: It is obvious that the logic part of the brain is not as active in a dream, lucid or no, compared to waking. This is a possible explanation. Different reality checks work for different people and some people find that they wear off and become less reliable. I am scared that this may happen with the breathing RC for me because it has failed once for me, luckily just doing the reailty check made me a bit lucid (see the example on [[LD RC Breathing]]).

[[Image:NCI_EatBeansAndOtherLegumesOften.jpg|right|thumb|Bean salad]]
The 'Bean' family includes many and varied varieties of legume. ([[Cookbook:Pea|pea]], [[Cookbook:Soybean|soybean]], [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentil]], etc.) The [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla bean]] is unrelated.

Beans are a valuable food for [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarians]] because they contain protein. They are also able to be dried and stored for long periods of time without harm, and then reconstituted simply by soaking and cooking. Many varieties of bean are only used in this way. Others are eaten fresh and steamed or boiled before use, needing much less preparation. 

==Soaking==

Dried legumes are almost always improved by soaking. Soaking helps to draw out lectins and phytates in legumes, as well as activating enzymes that break down indigestible starches and sugars. These starches and sugars are responsible for flatulence, as they ferment in your gut to produce gas. Additionally, soaking improves the flavour and nutrition of dried legumes.

Soaking and [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmering]] with repeated water changes is a good method for facilitating the enzyme activation and lectin and phytate extraction. Start by soaking the beans overnight in the refrigerator. Change the water, simmer for an hour, change the water, simmer for another hour, change the water... for a total of 4 to 6 hours.

Alternatively, soaking at room temperature or above (''20-30°C / 68-86°F'') for at least eight hours, or 14 hours for soybeans and red kidney beans, will achieve most of the same results and allow for significantly reduced cooking time. Always discard the soak water, and cook in fresh water. The soak water is full of nutrients, however, making it valuable food for plants.

The problem of flatulence is much more objectionable when beans (causing gas volume) are combined with a sulphur source (causing a strong smell). Sulphur sources include egg yolks and pale dried fruit.

Peas (including black-eye peas and chickpeas) are also members of the legume family, but they do not contain the indigestible sugars and starches that cause flatulence. They still do benefit from soaking, however, as this activates enzymes and improves the flavour and available nutrition of all legumes.

In regions where dried beans are uncommon, available stocks of dried beans will in all likelihood be quite old. These beans are perfectly edible, but may require drastically increased soaking and/or cooking times to become palatable and to acquire a proper texture. In any event, the cooking time of beans may be substantially shortened if one to two teaspoons of baking soda is mixed into the beans' soaking water. The beans should be rinsed afterwards. 
 
==Uses==
Legumes are used around the world, and are especially popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle-East]]. 

They can be used in a wide variety of ways, including
*Soups, such as mulligatawny and split pea soup
*Indian [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]]
*[[Cookbook:Bean salad|Bean salad]]
*Breads including [[Cookbook:Idli|idli]] and [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]]
*Fermented into products such as soy sauce, miso, [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]], and [[Cookbook:Natto|natto]]. ''See [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]].''
*[[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|sprouts]]
*They are frequently added to [[Cookbook:Rasam|rasam]]

[[Image:Courgette.jpg|right|thumb|zucchini]]

'''Zucchinis''' (also known as '''courgettes''') are a type of summer [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] (or marrow) that are harvested and used as an immature fruit. Zucchinis need to be cooked before eating, but a very light application of heat will be enough. Overcooked zucchinis become a soggy green mess, often disintegrating entirely into mush. They are excellent sliced into fingers or rounds and steamed. They can be [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] in [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. Zucchini and [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] is an excellent combination. 

Zucchinis are available year-round in most places, but they are at their best when they are not too big. As they grow they tend to become more watery, sometimes getting an unpleasant bitter taste. The zucchinis should be a tight shiny green with no dimples, wrinkles, or 'soggy bits'. If a zucchini is limp and floppy then it is much too old. 

Though rarely seen commercially, the flowers are edible too. Zucchini flowers can be picked shortly after fertilisation, then battered and lightly [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]]. They can also be stuffed. Sometimes the baby zucchinis are picked while they are the length of a finger, then treated similarly to the flowers.

Larger zucchini, generally grown to 5&quot;(12.7cm) diameter by accident in a home garden, can be stuffed. Cut the monster zucchini in half, hollow it out, and bake it with stuffing. [[Cookbook:Rice|Rice]] and tomato, topped with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], works well. 

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Zucchini|1|1|1|1|1|3|3|3|3|1|1|1}}

The zucchini season starts in early summer and end at the start of autumn. Out of season, courgettes are grown in greenhouses.

[[Image:So butternut squash.jpg|thumb|right|Butternut Squash.]]
'''Butternut squash''' is a variety of [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]. It is known in Australia as '''Butternut pumpkin'''.

Butternut Squashes are a yellowish colour and a distinctive barrel shape. The size of a butternut pumpkin is deceptive - look for butternuts with a long 'neck' and a smaller gourd rather than vice-versa. This is because the 'gourd' part is mostly air and seeds while the neck is solid flesh.

== Seasonality ==

{{Seasonality|Butternut Squash|3|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|3}}

The Butternut Squash is a winter squash, available from early fall through winter.

==Presentation==

With the nose reality check, you close one eye, and try to see your nose. If you can't, then you're dreaming.

See [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Nose]] for a discussion of this reality check's effectiveness.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I closed one eye to try and see if my nose was still there. Many people had told me that you shouldn't see your nose at all, but that wasn't true in this dream. It was smaller, and hard to look at. I became lucid.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I closed one eye to look at my nose. It was still there and looked completely normal.
* I tried to see if my nose was there. It was, but it was bent the wrong way. Unfortunately, I didn't become lucid. Instead, I carried on doing the RC over and over until it went back to normal.

&lt;!-- Eds. -- I believe I have fixed the problems that caused this note. --Hieronymous85
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Wiki-reading tip:&lt;/B&gt;
This page is short, and it has grammatical errors in the native language that are not due to regional differences. This page should be avoided.
--&gt;
==Latin Perfect Active Tense==

The perfect tense is used for action that has already been completed. English has two corresponding constructions: present perfect and simple past. The '''present perfect''' uses the present of &quot;to have&quot; plus the past participle. (&quot;I have sailed to Athens twice.&quot; &quot;These women have spoken the truth.&quot;) The '''simple past''' is a separate verb form that indicates a completed action. (&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered.&quot;) Another related form, which uses &quot;did&quot; as an auxiliary, is used for emphasis, negation or interrogation. (&quot;I did see you at the Forum, didn't I?&quot;)

In Latin, the perfect indicative is equivalent to all of these.

The perfect endings:

{| border = &quot;1&quot; cellpadding = &quot;2&quot;
|-
! Person
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| 1st || '''''-ī''''' (''egō'') || '''''-īmus''''' (''nōs'')
|-
| 2nd || '''''-istī''''' (''tu'') || '''''-istis''''' (''vōs'')
|-
| 3rd || '''''-it''''' (''is/ea/id'') || '''''-ērunt''''' &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; (''eī/eae/ea'')
|}

&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; There is an alternative third person plural ending, ''-ēre'', used mainly in poetry. For example, ''amāvēre'' = ''amāvērunt''.

Although these endings apply to all Latin verbs, each verb's stem changes differently in the perfect tense. To find the stem, use the third principal part, which is the first person singular perfect active indicative form of that verb.

*To conjugate the perfect present, attach the personal ending to the perfect stem.

===Example===
*''amō, amāre, '''amāvī''', amātum''; to love, like
:Note that ''amāvī'' is the first person singular perfect active indicative. Drop the ''-ī'' to get the stem, which is ''amāv-'', then add personal endings. 

'''Singular:'''

Basically, the Perfect indicative active is the perfect tense under a flash name.

==Rules for Finding the Perfect Stem==

The perfect stem can often be guessed by knowing the verb's first person singular and infinitive. Here are some rules that perfect stems often follow.
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| colspan=&quot;9&quot; | &lt;b&gt;Conjugation in the Perfect tense&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| Conjugation || colspan=&quot;3&quot;|Perfect First Person Singular || Notes
|-
| 1st (-are) || -avi || -i || -edi || -avi is used for the overwhelming majority of verbs. Exceptions include iuvare and lavare (iuvi, lavi) and dare (dedi).
|-
| 2nd (-eo, -ere): || -ui || -i || -si || -ui is the most common but much less so than -avi in the first conjugation. Some verbs, like videre and sedere, become vidi and sedi. . For the -si rule, the letter d at the end of the stem, if present, is dropped and cs and gs compound into x (eg. rideo -&gt; ridsi -&gt; risi).
|-
| 3rd (-o, -ere): || -i || -si || -idi || Many verbs, like defendere, keep the same perfect stem, so the first person perfect singular becomes defendi. This can create tense ambiguity in the third person singular and first person plural (defendit, defendimus). The -si rule follows the same conventions as the 2nd conjugation(eg. ludere -&gt; ludsi -&gt; lusi, regere -&gt; regsi -&gt; rexi). The -idi rule is used with compounds of dare, which are all third conjugation (eg. reddere -&gt; reddidi, credere -&gt; credidi)
|-
| mixed (-io, -ere): || -i || -ivi || -si || For the -i rule, the last vowel in the stem is often changed to e (eg. capere -&gt; cepi, facere -&gt; feci). For the ivi rule, the stem is unchanged (eg. cupere -&gt; cupivi). For the -si rule, just like in the 3rd conjugation, cs and gs compound into x and the changing vowel rule also applies (eg. conspicere -&gt; conspexi).
|-
| 4th (-io, ire) || -ivi || -ui || || Fairly straightforward. eg. audire -&gt; audivi, aperire -&gt; aperui
|-
| ire (irreg.) || -ii || || || All ire compounds (eg. transire, redire, inire) follow this rule.
|-
| esse (irreg.) || fui || || || The perfect of esse is fui, some verbs in the esse family change the perfect slightly (eg. abesse -&gt; afui, posse -&gt; potui)
|-

[[Image:ARS_breadfruit49.jpg|right|thumb|breadfruit]]
'''Breadfruit''' (''Artocarpus altilis'' in the [[Wikipedia:en:Moraceae|Family Moraceae]]) is a fruit native to East Indian and Pacific islands that has been widely planted in tropical regions everywhere. It was first collected and distributed by Lieutenant William Bligh as one of the botanical samples collected by HMS ''Bounty'' in the late 18th century.  

The breadfruit tree is one of the highest-yielding food plants, with a single tree producing 800 or more fruits per season. The grapefruit-sized ovoid fruit have a rough surface, and each fruit is divided into many achenes, each achene surrounded by a fleshy perianth and growing on a fleshy receptacle. Much of the breadfruit grown by Pacific Islanders is a seedless variety that must be distributed by cuttings.

Breadfruits are a staple food in many tropical regions. They are very rich in starch, and before being eaten they are roasted or boiled; the taste is described as potato-like.</text>

'''Watercress''' is a fast-growing, edible member of the family Brassicaceae (formerly Cruciferae), or the mustard family.  Watercress was formerly assigned the systematic name ''Nasturtium officinale'' (though it is unrelated to the Nasturtium flowers of family Tropaeolaceae).  However it is now classified as ''Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum''. Watercress is botanically related to the garden cress and to mustard plants, from which these cress obtain their peppery, tangy flavor and aroma. Watercress produces small, white and green flowers in horizontal clusters.

Watercress is a semi-aquatic perennial, and is one of the oldest known green vegetables consumed by human beings. Watercress is found to contain significant amounts of iron, calcium and folic acid, in addition to vitamins A and C. In some regions watercress is known as a weed, in other regions as an aquatic vegetable or [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herb]]. Where watercress is grown in the presence of animal waste, it is a known haven for parasites such as the liver fluke.

== Watercress in Agriculture ==
Cultivation of watercress is practical on both mass scales and on the individual scale. Being semi-aquatic, watercress is well-suited to hydroponic cultivation and thrives in water that is slightly alkaline. In many local markets the demand for hydroponically-grown watercress far exceeds available supply. This is due in part to the fact that cress leaves are unsuitable for distribution in dried form, and thus can only marginally be preserved. Unmolested watercress can grow to a height of two feet, however, the edible shoots are typically harvested just days after germination.

== Benefits of Consuming Watercress ==

Many benefits of eating watercress are claimed. Watercress is claimed to be a mild stimulant, a source of phytochemicals and antioxidants, a diuretic, an expectorant and a digestive.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi TUF-KAT :)  Nice to see Wikibooks has dragged yet another from the clutches of the Wikipedia ;)

We just write our own books/educational-material style stuff here, by the way...

Anyway, have fun [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:04, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== TUF-KAT ==
What ? Somehow I missed giving you a warm hello! Anyways, welcome to Wikibooks and may your stay here be a fulfilling and productive one. Your contributions look great and I thank you for them. If you did not notice, I already incorporated the [[Dichotomous Key]] pages into [[General Biology]]. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Could you do me a favor, and include links to any new [[Dichotomous Key]] pages on the [[General Biology]] page, or maybe to a central Dichotomous Key page so that any one who is interested in the subject can get to all of your pages from the same central page. Thanks TUF-KAT! As before, great work. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Question: How many supports does one need to be approved for adminship?  The phrasing on the adminship page leaves me wondering. Thanks [[User:Perl|Perl]] 01:16, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

OK thanks. I was just wondering because I was listed on the page and didn't know when to expect to be made an admin. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 23:29, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Issue Guide ==

* Nice work with those issue guides TUF-KAT. Do you have any plans to develop the lower tree Issue Guides page? Perhaps with information about the &quot;Issue Guide&quot; thingie in general and/or synopsis regarding the various guides...--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 07:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

* It would probably be good to make a list of all [[Issue Guide]] related stuff on the [[Issue Guide]] page. Even if the organization looks crappy now, things will develop by topic and stuff. Without a hierarchy things just kinda fall apart eventually. Unless you come out with some fancy dancy system of organizing everything I might just pop in and try to organize it in some rudimentary fashion. At the very least it would provide a working top level discussion page... This whole &quot;Issue Guide&quot; thingie might be a good candidate for a &quot;Wikibooks project&quot; eventually.--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 08:51, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== [[User:Karen Johnson]] ==

Could you make her a sysop now? Also, how would I become a bureaucrat so I wouldn't have to bother you about this type of thing in the future? [[User:Perl|Perl]] 14:08, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Merit Badges ==
Wait .. did I just understand this correctly, that you want to do work on this site to earn a merit badge? If so, that sounds like a great idea! Time to recruit the Boy Scouts of America so more decent young folks such as yourself can give to humanity in such a practical and multiplying way. I was a Boy Scout myself for a time (although not a very good one). --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==article correction==
Hello Tuf-kat, thank you for writing your name in the list of checkers of the ''Translation practice course' of wikiversity. I just want to tell you that i have translated from Spanish the page [[Wikiversity:Creating a new School]] and i´d be grateful if you, or anybody else may have a look; thanks :) bye. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 17:40, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:Thank you very much, Tuf. I didn´t expect so many mistakes. I am really grateful because now I know some mistakes I had no idea before. Some of those words that you identify as non-English words are presumably false friends (between Spanish and English), or wrongly built by my imagination ;). But I thought they existed. About the word &quot;specially&quot;, I meant &quot;particularly&quot;, and i looked up in a Dictionary and it appears, but it may be a very awkward use because it comes from latin.You did a great checking, i didn´t expect such a job. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 22:31, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Polish Wikibooks ==

Hi! I don't know, what I should do: shall I make ''pl.wikibooks.org'' and move all files or keep it sill in English Wikibooks web site. What do You think about it? Take care, [[User:Reytan|Reytan]] 06:45, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Admin bit ==

So, I've been listed on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] page for over 2 weeks now,
and have 2 of 3 votes in support. (plus my own, of course) Could you set the bit soon?
(I just found myself trying to move a page over an old redirect which unfortunately had some
trivial history blocking me. Bummer.)

== Perhaps more admins are needed... ==

Perhaps more admins are needed at wikibooks to deal with stuff like a large VFD and speedy backlog, as mentioned here.  [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-April/002379.html http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-April/002379.html] 

Note that I am not trying to put pressure to &quot;speed up the process&quot; so to say (although I have thrown my name into the hat, there are others more deserving and with more support), but as one of the two bureaucrats (and the only one with an edit in the past month), I request that something has to be done.

[[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 03:08, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== [[User:Boit]] ==

Boit seems to have disappeared from the [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship]] page. Given a bit of time, he could get some support or opposition. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:11, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Adminship ==

Oh, more things to distract me from my studies fabulous. Yeah, ive been thinking about getting more active in wikicookbook, so i should be around a bit more to watch out for vandals/spammers etc. Before i became an admin on wikinews, i never realised how much shit there is. Why, oh why do people vandalise. I just dont get it. Anyway, im willing to admin, so should i officialy but my name down again or what? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 16:35, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:cool, i'll try and help out when ever i can. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 02:38, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
Hey, can you add wikinews to the list of wikis displayed on the recent changes list. Also hows about a link to wikimania (a la the wikipedia RC page)? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 14:21, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Egads, i didnt realise mere mortals could edit things in the mediawiki namespace....  now i feel like a complete idiot. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 23:46, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Recentchanges ==
Hi TUF-KAT,
Would you add interlanguage &quot;ko&quot; in the recentchanges of Allmessages? --[[User:아흔|아흔]] 09:12, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Translation of Dichotomous keys ==

Hello, I have tried to translate your mollusc's and cephalopod's dichotomous keys to czech language. Thank you for good work. -- snek01

Name three characteristics that distinguish mammals form all other animals.
Have hair at some part of their life, Give birth to live young, and warm blooded 

2. Explain how the animal kingdom is classified.  Lion
Kingdom: The lion is an animal because it eats other organisms for sustence. Therefore, it is in the Kingdom Animalia.
Phylum: The lion has a spinal chord, and it is thus in the Phylum Chordata.
Class: The lion has hair and mammary glands, and gives birth to live young. This makes it a mammal, and a member of the Class Mammalia.
Order: The lion is a member of the Order Carnivora because it shares specific characteristics of skull and teeth shape (and not because it is a carnivore).
Family: The lion is a cat, and is thus a part of the Family Felidae (Note: all families of mammals end in -idae).
Genus: The lion has special characteristics that allow it to roar, and is therefore a member of the Genus Panthera.
Species: The lion is the species leo of the genus Panthera. The scientific name of a species is both terms combined (e.g. Panthera leo, sometimes abbreviated P. leo).
Explain where mammals fit in the classification of animals.  Kingdom: Animalia, class: Mammalia. 
Classify three mammals from phylum through species. 
Mammal 1 The domestic dog form of the gray wolf, a member of the Canidae family of the order Carnivora.
Mammal 2 The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or housecat to distinguish it from other felines and felids, is a small furry domesticated carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its companionship and for its ability to hunt household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years.
Mammal 3 The fox is a common name for many species of omnivorous mammals belonging to the Canidae family. Foxes are small to medium-sized canids (slightly smaller than the median-sized domestic dog), characterized by possessing a long narrow snout, and a bushy tail (or brush).



3. Do ONE of the following:
a. Spend 3 hours in each of two different kinds of natural habitats or at different elevation.  List the different mammal species and individual members that you identified by sight or sign.  	
	
	
	
	
	
	
		
Tell why all mammals do not live in the same kind of habitat. All Mammals don’t live in the same kind of habitat because they have different needs, some need different climates, different food, ect.  

b. Spend 3 hours on each of 5 days on at least a 25- acre area (about the size of 3 1/2 football fields). List the mammal species you identified by sight or sign.	
	
	
	
	
	
c. From study and reading, write a simple history of one non-game mammal that lives in your area. Red tail hawk 
Tell how this mammal lived before its habitat was affected in any way by humans.  The red tail hawk had an easier time finding food.  It had an huge amount of space and many places to build a nest.  And the population used to be bigger.  
Tell how it reproduces, Hawk pairs fly in large circles to attract each other so they can lay eggs together.  
what it eats, Hawks eat mice, squirrels, rabbits, ect.  It is a carnivore.   
and its natural habitat.  It’s natural habitat is the wild.  Trees, bushes, ect. 
Describe its dependency upon plants, It builds nests in trees and bushes.
upon other animals (including humans),  It eats other animals.  
and how they depend upon it.  For food  
Tell how it is helpful or harmful to humankind.  Hawks are helpful because they kill mice and we use them for hunting and food.   
4. Do ONE of the following:
a. Under the guidance of a nature center or natural history museum, make two study skins of rats or mice.  
Skin 1: 	
Skin 2: 	
Tell the uses of study skins 	
	
	
and mounted specimens respectively.	
	
	
b. Take good pictures of two kinds of mammals in the wild.  Record light conditions, film used, exposure, and other factors, including notes on the activities of the pictured animals.
Photo 1 Mammal: Dog Charlie                                                       Photo 2 Mammal: Kyle (my brother)  
Light conditions: Bright                                                                 Light conditions: Average 
Film Used: Digital                                                                           Film Used: Digital  
Exposure:	 	Exposure:	
Animal’s Activities: Sleeping on swing                                        Animal’s Activities: Sitting in chair                                                                                                      
Other factors:  Flash off                                                                Other factors: Flash off                                                                
c. Write a life history of a native game mammal that lives in your area, covering the points outlined in requirement 3C.  List sources for this information
Native Game Animal: White tailed deer   
Tell how this mammal lived before its habitat was affected in any way by man.  The White Tailed Deer lived in most forests in the U.S.  It was also more populated before it was hunted.  
Tell how it reproduces, Males are sexually active in the second year and females in their first fall.  
what it eats, Graze, northern white cede, red maple, hemlock, mountain ash, acorns, beechnuts, and fruits.  
and its natural habitat.  Brush openings, crop fields, wood lots, and wetlands.   
Describe its dependency upon plants, It eats trees and plants and also uses them as shelter and cover.  
upon other animals (including man), Man thins out the population and man plants crops that they eat.  
and how they depend upon it.  So they don’t over populate or starve.  
Tell how it is helpful or harmful to man. We thin the populated and we feed them. 
d. Make a bait and tracking pit.  Report what mammals and other animals came to the bait.
					
					
					
					
e. Visit a natural history museum.  Report on how specimens are prepared and cataloged.  	
	
	
	
Explain the purposes of museums.  Museums show history and how people before us lived.  
f. Write a report of 500 words on a book about a mammal species. Done 
g. Trace two possible food chains of carnivorous mammals from soil through four stages to the mammal.
Possible food chain 1:

5. Working with your counselor, select and carry out one project that will influence the numbers of one or more mammals.

==Requirement 2==
:''Explain how the animal kingdom is classified. Explain where mammals fit in the classification of animals. Classify three mammals from phylum through species.''

Animals (and other organisms, like plants) are classified into groups for several reasons.  First of all, the sheer number of species of animals in the world is quite large, and many are un-named or confusingly-named (for example, several different vegetables are called ''[[en:turnip|turnips]]'').  Thus, a Swedish scientist named [[Evolutionary Biology/Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] created a system to classify organisms based on recognizable traits, and used an old, extinct language (Latin) to refer to organisms.  He chose [[en:Latin|Latin]] because it was rigid in spelling and pronunciation, and so it would enable simple communication between scientists who spoke different languages or dialects.

The modern system of organism-classifying is derived from Linnaeus' system.  The science of classifying organisms is called ''[[en:taxonomy|taxonomy]]''.  The exact methods of classifying organisms can change as scientists discover new characteristics that separate and unite organisms.  For example, science used to classify all organisms into two kingdoms (a ''kingdom'' is the largest basic unit of classification), plants and animals.  This was based on a simple formulation -- anything which devoured other organisms was an animal, and anything that did not, was a plant.  Eventually, however, scientists decided that this system did not adequately describe reality, and the Fungi were added as a third kingdom.  Later still, three kingdoms have been added for various kinds of microscopic organisms like bacteria.

''[[Image:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumb|250px|These cheetahs are part of the same order, Carnivora, as wolves, raccoons and seals]]''

There are seven basic levels of classification.  They can be remembed using the [[en:mnemonic|mnemonic device]] ''King Philip Came Over For Great Soup'' (the first letter of each word is the first letter of the unit of classification, in order).
:'''Kingdom'''
:'''Phylum'''
:'''Class'''
:'''Order'''
:'''Family'''
:'''Genus'''
:'''Species'''

An example classification for the lion
:'''Kingdom''': The lion is an animal because it eats other organisms for sustence.  Therefore, it is in the Kingdom ''Animalia''.
:'''Phylum''': The lion has a spinal chord, and it is thus in the Phylum ''Chordata''.
:'''Class''': The lion has hair and mammary glands, and gives birth to live young.  This makes it a mammal, and a member of the Class ''Mammalia''.
:'''Order''': The lion is a member of the Order ''Carnivora'' because it shares specific characteristics of skull and teeth shape (and not because it is a carnivore).
:'''Family''': The lion is a cat, and is thus a part of the Family ''Felidae'' (Note: all families of mammals end in ''-idae'').
:'''Genus''': The lion has special characteristics that allow it to roar, and is therefore a member of the Genus ''Panthera''.
:'''Species''': The lion is the species ''leo'' of the genus ''Panthera''.  The scientific name of a species is both terms combined (e.g. ''Panthera leo'', sometimes abbreviated ''P. leo'').

The above process weeds out successively less similar organisms, so very similar animals like panthers and cheetahs, have the same classification until near the end.

:'''Kingdom: Animalia''' - also includes jellyfish, snakes, mice, wolves, cheetahs and tigers
:'''Phylum: Chordata''' - also includes snakes, mice, wolves, cheetahs and tigers
:'''Class: Mammalia''' - also includes mice, wolves, cheetahs and tigers
:'''Order: Carnivora''' - also includes wolves, cheetahs and tigers
:'''Family: Felidae''' - also includes cheetahs and tigers
:'''Genus: Panthera''' - also includes tigers
:'''Species: leo''' - is the lion, and includes no other organisms

==Requirement 3==
:''Spend 3 hours in each of two different kinds of natural habitats or at different elevations. List the different mammal species and individual members that you identified by sight or sign. Tell why all mammals do not live in the same kind of habitat.''
:''Spend 3 hours on each of 5 days on at least a 25-acre area. List the mammal species you identified by sight or sign.''

When making these observations, it is best to prepare.  Think about what kinds of mammals might be living in the habitat, and how you could see or otherwise find evidence of them.  You may be able to find tracks in the ground, or dens or dams or other physical evidence of mammals.

Mammals do not all live in the same habitat because each species is uniquely adapted for one [[en:niche|niche]].  For example, in a forest, squirrels perform a necessary function, spreading acorns, for example, and thus ensuring that trees' offspring can spread far from the parent plant; squirrels also provide sustenance for predators, such as snakes.  No other organism fits into the squirrel's niche, and the squirrel can not function well in any other niche.  All species in the forest have a unique niche; mammals that do not have such a niche do not live there -- for example, lions are well-adapted for their role on the savannas, but are not well-suited for a temperate forest.

:''From study and reading, write a simple history of one nongame mammal that lives in your area. Tell how this mammal lived before its habitat was affected in any way by man. Tell how it reproduces, what it eats, what eats it, and its natural habitat. Describe its dependency upon plants, upon other animals (including man), and how they depend upon it. Tell how it is helpful or harmful to man.''

A game mammal is one that is widely hunted, such as deer.  Most mammals are not game mammals.  For help in choosing a mammal, see [[Scouting:BSA - Mammal Study Merit Badge, List of mammals|the list of mammals]].

==Requirement 4==
:''Under the guidance of a nature center or natural history museum, make two study skins of rats or mice. Tell the uses of study skins and mounted specimens respectively.''
:''Take good pictures of two kinds of mammals in the wild. Record light conditions, film used, exposure, and other factors, including notes on the activities of the pictured animals.''
:''Write a life history of a native game mammal that lives in your area, covering the points outlined in requirement 3c. List sources for this information.''
:''Make and bait a tracking pit. Report what mammals and other animals came to the bait.''
:''Visit a natural history museum. Report on how specimens are prepared and cataloged. Explain the purposes of museums.''
:''Write a report of 500 words on a book about a mammal species.''

Some classic books about mammal species include:
*''[[wikipedia:en:Innocent Killers|Innocent Killers]]'' - by [[wikipedia:en:Jane Goodall|Jane Goodall]] about [[wikipedia:en:spotted hyena|spotted hyenas]].
*''[[wikipedia:en:In the Shadow of Man|In the Shadow of Man]]'' - by [[wikipedia:en:Jane Goodall|Jane Goodall]] about [[wikipedia:en:chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s

:''Trace two possible food chains of carnivorous mammals from soil through four stages to the mammal.''

A [[en:food chain|food chain]] is a hierarchy of organisms which devour each other.  Energy can be traced through a food chain, beginning with its source, plants.  The first step in a food chain is always a plant (for example, [[en:algae|algae]]), which creates energy using sunlight (see [[en:photosynthesis|photosynthesis]]).  The algae is then eaten by small microscopic organisms called [[en:protist|protists]], who are in turn eaten by a [[en:squid|squid]].  The squid is eaten by a seal, and the [[en:seal|seal]] by an [[en:orca|orca]].  The energy produced by the algae can be traced to the orca.

:algae --&gt; protists --&gt; squid --&gt; seal --&gt; orca

==Requirement 5==
:''Work with your counselor, select and carry out one project that will influence the numbers of one or more mammals.''

== Pronouncion examples ==

Hi,

I am norwegian, and thought that this book might need some audio examples of how to pronounce words and prases in norwegian. Please give me a list of words and phrases, and I will do my best in recording them all.

Please tell me how to distribute the files too!

--August 00:57, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Well, as a fan of Norwegian music, and a person who is interested in Norwegian culture, 
I'd like to know how to pronounce some basic words that you use in your everyday life.
Also, some known proverbs and even slang will be helpful. Obviously, I do not have anything in mind, but I believe that you can come up with something...

Oh, the best way to store the files would be uploading them to you Gmail account, using this FireFox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1593/</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Introduction to Philosophy]]

There are two different meanings of the term ''philosophy of science'': the first one is about the scientific method and it is the one meant in this article; the second one is about some philosophical questions that are answered by scientific discoveries. In recent decades physics have changed our concept of reality and biology changed our concept of life, philosophy of science in this meaning is treated in A scientific perspective of philosophy.

There are subdisciplines of philosophy of science which take a philosophical look at issues arising from specific scientific disciplines: for instance, philosophy of biology looks at the meaning of concepts used in evolutionary biology, while the philosophy of social sciences looks at topics like what a 'theory' is in a field like economics or sociology.

==Karl Popper==
The founding father of this field is widely considered to be Karl Popper, writing at the beginning of the 20th century. The idea that one was necessary stemmed from observation of the Freudian claims on the Oedipus complex, essentially Freud's theory cannot be proven wrong by any means. Whilst this might sound like a positive aspect of the theory, it means that there are also no tests to verify the claims the theory makes. 

Popper's proposed means of putting this right was to apply the principle of falsificationism to any one theory. To be scientific the scientist in question has to try to prove his theory wrong, or at the very least put forwards tests that can be shown to be either correct or incorrect. This led to the problem of when a theory can be known to be truly scientific and as such a correct interpretation of the natural world. Popper's answer to the criticism was that each test corroborated the theory further. This to many is simply the equivalent of the inductive &quot;All swans are white&quot; argument, i.e. the observation is correct until you happen to pass by Australia and find a black swan.

Later theories include Kuhn's theory of a scientific revolution. This proposes the theory that scientists will work within one given model, or paradigm, of the universe and make this useful and predictive until such a moment in time when a new idea or theory overthrows the old system, such as Galileo's observations of the solar system.

Feyerabend however rejected the idea that scientists are rational creatures entirely in his book &quot;Against Method&quot; where he argues that scientists do not in fact follow any one given method but are much less rational than their propaganda makes them out to be.

==Thomas Aquinas==
The ideas put forth by Popper, Kuhn, and Feyearbend, wrestle with an issue mentioned by Thomas Aquinas.  He said, &quot;...other sciences do not argue to prove their own principles, but argue from their principles to prove other things which the sciences include...&quot; (Summa Theologica article eight [http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=aquinas&amp;bookID=nature_grace&amp;page=44&amp;view=thml]or [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas1.html]). While he wasn't directly talking about the philosophy of science, his words are instructive of the present topic. If science cannot argue to prove its own principles, then something else must or science has no basis.

==Imre Lakatos==
A fourth contemporay is Imre Lakatos, what he gained most renown for in the circles of philosophy of science was his attack on what he terms as pseudo-science. His demarcation lies in whether any given program is progressing or degenerating. As such the program that is producing most new knowledge is the one that will be favoured by scientists as the one closest to the truth.

&lt;th&gt;Speaking Rightly&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Speaking Rightly&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
# While dealing with &quot;Right and Wrong&quot;, it will be made clear that a correct evaluation of right and wrong is found in its absolute value only on the plane of Being. Therefore, the art of speaking rightly necessarily has its basis in the plane of Being. 
# However, the basic considerations of the relative nature of the art of speaking involve the projected art of thinking; so all that is valid for the art of thinking is valid for the art of speech. Right speech has its basis in right thinking. 
# Speech is the expression of both the heart and mind together. Therefore, for the speech to be right, it is necessary that the man be right in his heart and mind. 
# Speech is the expression of one's state of evolution. One word from the mouth of a man reveals his inner quality. The softness of speech gives an expression to the culture of the heart, and the logic, imagination, or creativity expressed through the speech reveals the culture of his mind. A man could be screened for his whole state of evolution and development through one word of his speech. 
# Speech is a very delicate medium between the man and his surroundings. It is highly important for the well-being of the individual and his surroundings that all the people should cultivate the art of speech, because one wrong word spoken gives wrong impressions in the atmosphere. The man may change his attitude, his decision, or his course of behavior, but the word that has gone out of his mouth can never be withdrawn. The influence that he has created in the audience and in the atmosphere around him can never be withdrawn. Therefore, it is highly important that one should know the art of speech and should know how to speak rightly. 
# Speech is a projection of a thought, and, while the art of speech fundamentally lies in the art of thinking, it is much finer than the art of thinking itself, because every thought that arises in the mind need not be expressed as speech. 
# Take the example of a businessman who is sitting with a friend in the evening, when suddenly an idea comes to his mind regarding some matter that he had to speak to his manager about the next day. It would be very odd if he began to give expression to his thought right there. This is what is meant by the art of speech being much finer and thus a more advanced art than the art of thinking. 
# Speech has to be in keeping with the atmosphere. The thought and its expression as speech should be such that they are welcomed by the surroundings. Hundreds of words unsuitable to the atmosphere will prove futile against one word of value. 
# Thus the art of speaking rightly gains fulfillment in the art of thinking, together with the skill of proper expression suitable to the atmosphere. This, as has already been said, depends upon the man being right in his heart and mind, and this, as we have seen, is only possible by the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind, which is easily accomplished through the regular practice of Transcendental Meditation. &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;th&gt;The Purpose of Life&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;MụcĐích Sống&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
# Expansion of happiness is the purpose of life, and evolution is the process by which it is fulfilled. Life begins in a natural way, it evolves, and happiness expands. The expansion of happiness carries with it the growth of intelligence, power, creativity and everything that may be said to be of significance in life.  
# The purpose of individual life is also the purpose of the life of the entire cosmos. The purpose of creation is the expansion of happiness which is fulfilled through the process of cosmic evolution. The significance and purpose of individual life is the same as that of the life of the cosmos. The difference lies in the scale. 
# The individual life is the basic unit of the life of the cosmos. Evolution of the cosmos is basically served by the evolution the individual life. Thus, if the purpose of individual life is served, the purpose of cosmic life is also served spontaneously and simultaneously to that degree and on that scale. 
# If one has fulfilled the purpose of his own life, he has done his best to help the cosmic purpose. 
# If one is not happy, one has lost the very purpose of life. If one is not constantly developing his intelligence, power, creativity, peace, and happiness, then he has lost the very purpose of life. Life is not meant to be lived in dullness, idleness, and suffering; these do not belong to the essential nature of life. 
# Life is dynamic, not static. It is energetic, progressing, evolving, developing through activity, and multiplying itself. The nature and purpose of life is progress, evolution, activity, and improvement. 
# Activity maintains the stream of evolution, and the physical vehicle that is responsible for activity is the nervous system of the individual. In species lower than man the nervous system is not so fully evolved and so the activity leading to evolution is on a much smaller scale. The activity of the lower species, while carrying out the process of evolution, does not produce a high degree of evolution. As the nervous system evolves, the rate of evolution increases. 
# Man's nervous system is the most highly evolved. Therefore, the scope of evolution of man is unlimited in this life. We note how, when a child is born, his intelligence, power, and creativity are low, but as he grows he indulges in the field of activity where his power is great, his intelligence is great, his creativity is great, and the degree of happiness which he experiences in himself and projects outside himself is great. The nervous system is developed to the extent that through proper activity (the revelation of which is the purpose of this book) the man can contact absolute bliss, creativity, intelligence, power, and energy.  
# To live a life of freedom is the purpose of life in the human species. If one is not able to live such a life, the very purpose of life is blurred. Man is born to live a perfect life holding within its range all values of the transcendental absolute divine of unlimited energy, intelligence, power, peace and bliss along with the unlimited values of the world of multiplicity in relative existence. He is born to project the abundance of the absolute state of life into the world of relative existence. 
# Man's life is meant to be a bridge of abundance between divine intelligence and the whole of creation. Man's life is to cultivate and give--cultivate the divine power, intelligence, happiness and abundance, and give it out to all of creation. This is the high purpose of the life of man, and it is fortunate to find that every man is capable of reaching this by improving the conscious capacity of his mind and consciously contacting the field of the absolute energy, peace, happiness, and abundance of the eternal, divine consciousness. 
# Every man is capable of spreading the divine splendor in the whole creation. He is able to project all values of the absolute into the world of relative existence for all creatures to enjoy and to glorify the entire creation of God. Each man is capable of living a life of full values. If one fails to live it, it is a disgrace to oneself, and it abuses the glory of almighty God within and above us. 
# Here is an invitation for every man on earth to start picking up the divine consciousness of the absolute, and, bringing it through all his activity into the world of variety, enjoy it himself and project it for all others to enjoy as well. 
# A man projecting himself out in the world through a limited mind is not able to appreciate the real purpose of life. With a small capacity of mind, he engages himself in doing little things of which he thinks in very limited terms. He can engage himself in very limited activity. He can create only a limited number of small things of limited value. The conscious mind of an ordinary man is so limited that he is not even able to enjoy life. He is found to be suffering for the most part on many levels of his life. This state of suffering is merely due to his not using his full potential. 
# By not using his full potential, man is not able to fulfill the purpose of his life. He is found suffering in many ways because he is not using the full conscious capacity of his mind; he is not using the great energy he carries within himself. He is not experiencing and expressing in his life the abundance of absolute bliss that he naturally possesses, the great absolute field of creativity and power that he has within himself. He is like a millionaire who has forgotten his wealth and status and who goes begging in the street and every moment feels the lack of money. 
# All suffering is due to not knowing a way to unfold the divine glory present within oneself. Lack of ... Not having the capacity for divine unfoldment, the ignorance of a technique for diving within oneself is responsible for the misery in life. Without divine consciousness, man is found lacking in energy, intelligence, and clear thinking. He is tired, tense and anxious. 
# This state of human existence and human intelligence have come to such a deplorable condition that from the field of psychology--the great science of the mind--it is found suggested that tension is necessary for creative intelligence. What a shame it is to believe that tension is necessary to improve life! 
# It is said that poets and artists have created their inspiring literature and art under tension. All such statements come from ignorance and from an inability to release tensions. 
# Our modern scientific age unfortunately is increasing in tension. The individual life seems to be growing in tension instead of growing in ease and comfort, even though material comforts certainly are increasing. This is only because the individuals have no way of improving their ability and efficiency through contact with the greater energy and intelligence that every man has within himself. It is only necessary to consciously contact that field of inner life and profit by it.  
# The man of today is blind to the purpose of life, not able to see that he is born to enjoy, create, and live a life useful to himself and others. He plunges into whatever activity lies ahead, working hard to put forth his best effort in that field. It is commendable to work hard for things; to be creative in any aspect of life is what man is here for. But when activity increases, a man often finds himself unable to cope with the increased pressure. His efficiency declines, or he does not find energy enough to cope with the increased activity. This is why tension and strain develop. 
# As a man engages in greater activity he should be able to produce more energy and greater intelligence within himself to deal with this increased activity. This he does not know how to do, and, therefore, he loses the entire purpose of life. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt; &lt;/font&gt;
# Expansion of happiness is &lt;font color=blue&gt;mụcđích sống&lt;/font&gt;, and evolution is the process by which it is fulfilled. Life begins in a natural way, it evolves, and happiness expands. The expansion of happiness carries with it the growth of intelligence, power, creativity and everything that may be said to be of significance in life.  
# The purpose of individual life is also the purpose of the life of the entire cosmos. The purpose of creation is the expansion of happiness which is fulfilled through the process of cosmic evolution. The significance and purpose of individual life is the same as that of the life of the cosmos. The difference lies in the scale. 
# The individual life is the basic unit of the life of the cosmos. Evolution of the cosmos is basically served by the evolution the individual life. Thus, if the purpose of individual life is served, the purpose of cosmic life is also served spontaneously and simultaneously to that degree and on that scale. 
# If one has fulfilled the purpose of his own life, he has done his best to help the cosmic purpose. 
# If one is not happy, one has lost the very purpose of life. If one is not constantly developing his intelligence, power, creativity, peace, and happiness, then he has lost the very purpose of life. Life is not meant to be lived in dullness, idleness, and suffering; these do not belong to the essential nature of life. 
# Life is dynamic, not static. It is energetic, progressing, evolving, developing through activity, and multiplying itself. The nature and purpose of life is progress, evolution, activity, and improvement. 
# Activity maintains the stream of evolution, and the physical vehicle that is responsible for activity is the nervous system of the individual. In species lower than man the nervous system is not so fully evolved and so the activity leading to evolution is on a much smaller scale. The activity of the lower species, while carrying out the process of evolution, does not produce a high degree of evolution. As the nervous system evolves, the rate of evolution increases. 
# Man's nervous system is the most highly evolved. Therefore, the scope of evolution of man is unlimited in this life. We note how, when a child is born, his intelligence, power, and creativity are low, but as he grows he indulges in the field of activity where his power is great, his intelligence is great, his creativity is great, and the degree of happiness which he experiences in himself and projects outside himself is great. The nervous system is developed to the extent that through proper activity (the revelation of which is the purpose of this book) the man can contact absolute bliss, creativity, intelligence, power, and energy.  
# To live a life of freedom is &lt;font color=blue&gt;mụcđích sống&lt;/font&gt; in the human species. If one is not able to live such a life, the very purpose of life is blurred. Man is born to live a perfect life holding within its range all values of the transcendental absolute divine of unlimited energy, intelligence, power, peace and bliss along with the unlimited values of the world of multiplicity in relative existence. He is born to project the abundance of the absolute state of life into the world of relative existence.

==Grammatica 6.1 ~ Numbers==
Use the sound buttons to help you with the pronunciation.

===-teen = -tien ===
Dutch has a similar way of constructing the numbers for 13-19 as English, it is mainly the simple number (e.g. vijf, zes) followed by '''''-tien''''', which means &quot;ten&quot; and is very similar to English -teen

[[Image:nl-Dutch-ch6-13-19.ogg|40px|noicon]]
13 dertien &lt;br&gt;
14 v'''e'''ertien &lt;br&gt;
15 vijftien &lt;br&gt;
16 zestien &lt;br&gt;
17 zeventien &lt;br&gt;
18 achttien &lt;br&gt;
19 negentien

===-ty = -tig ===
As another example of the relationship between English y versus Dutch g, the English ending -ty in twen'''ty''', thirty etc., is &quot;-tig&quot; in Dutch:

20 twintig &lt;br&gt;

Starting at twenty one things get a little funny, Dutch puts the single unit before the ten-unit:

21 eenentwintig (literally: one-and-twenty)&lt;br&gt;
22 tweeëntwintig &lt;br&gt;
23 drieëntwintig &lt;br&gt;
24 vierentwintig &lt;br&gt;
25 vijfentwintig &lt;br&gt;
26 zesentwintig &lt;br&gt;
27 zevenentwintig &lt;br&gt;
28 achtentwintig &lt;br&gt;
29 negenentwintig &lt;br&gt;

Notice that one way to deal with two subsequent vowels in Dutch spelling is the diaeresis ë.

The same system goes for 30, 40, 50....
[[Image:nl-Dutch-ch6-20-90.ogg|40px|noicon]]
30 dertig &lt;br&gt;
32 tweeëndertig&lt;br&gt;
40 v'''e'''ertig &lt;br&gt;
50 vijftig&lt;br&gt;
60 zestig&lt;br&gt;
70 zeventig&lt;br&gt;
80 '''t'''achtig (!!) &lt;br&gt;
90 negentig&lt;br&gt;

The only irregular one is tachtig.&lt;br&gt;
Notice that 60 and 70 are pronounced with initial [s].

===Large numbers===
[[Image:nl-Dutch-ch6-largenumbers.ogg|40px|noicon]]
100 honderd&lt;br&gt;

Dutch does not use ''one'' as in &quot;one hundred&quot; or &quot;one thousand&quot;

101 honderdéén &lt;br&gt;
111 honderdelf &lt;br&gt;
112 honderdtwaalf &lt;br&gt;
113 honderddertien &lt;br&gt;
121 honderdéénentwintig &lt;br&gt;
957 negenhonderdzevenenvijftig &lt;br&gt;

In Dutch all numbers lower than one thousand are written as one word. There should be a space after '1000' ''(duizend)'', though. There's also a space before and after: miljoen, biljoen, miljard, biljard, etc.

1000 duizend &lt;br&gt;
1001 duizend één &lt;br&gt;
1017 duizend zeventien &lt;br&gt;
1538 duizend vijfhonderdachtendertig ''or'' vijftienhonderdachtendertig &lt;br&gt;
2000 tweeduizend &lt;br&gt;
8000 achtduizend

100.000 honderdduizend&lt;br&gt;

143.000 honderddrieënveertigduizend &lt;br&gt;

143.500 honderddrieënveertigduizend vijfhonderd &lt;br&gt;

1.000.000 één miljoen&lt;br&gt;

2.000.000 twee miljoen&lt;br&gt;

453.897.245 vierhonderddrieënvijftig miljoen achthonderdzevenennegentigduizend tweehonderdvijfenveertig &lt;br&gt;

For higher power of one thousand Dutch follows the British rather than the American system

1.000.000.000 één miljard&lt;br&gt;  (not: biljoen, see below)

1.000.000.000.000  één biljoen
1.000.000.000.000.000  één biljard

245.078.476.453.879 tweehonderdvijfenveertig biljoen achtenzeventig miljard vierhonderdzesenzeventig miljoen vierhonderddrieënvijftigduizend achthonderdnegenenzeventig &lt;br&gt;

Notice also that the interpunction is the reverse:

English: $1,324,432.93 = Dutch: $1.324.432,93

Dutch has a decimal comma, not a decimal point.

==Grammatica 6.2 ~ Past and perfect tenses==
Recall:
*  ''..'''heb''' je dat op school '''geleerd?...'''''
*  ''..wat '''gebeurde''' er ...''
*  ''Maurits '''versloeg'''...''

These are examples of past and perfect tenses. There are three kinds of verbs in Dutch when it comes to forming them.

#Weak verbs add either ''-te(n)'' or ''-de(n)'' to the stem of the verb.
#Strong verbs change the vowel of the stem.
#Irregular verbs often have a combination of the two or show other idiosyncrasies.

The numbers:
#The vast majority (thousands) of Dutch verbs are regular weak verbs. 
#There are some 150 strong roots. Derived verbs included there are some 1500 strong verbs in total.
#There are only about six irregular roots and about two dozen derivatives.

However, the strong and irregular verbs are amongst the most frequently used ones. The more specialized and recently formed ones are typically weak.

===Weak verbs===
We have seen how the present tense is formed:
{|
|[[image:nl-leren.ogg|noicon|20px]]
|-
|leren - to learn
|-
|[[image:nl-leer.ogg|noicon|20px]]
|-
|ik leer - I learn → stem is ''leer''
|}
====Past tense====
::The past tense typically has a singular and a plural form:

{|
|[[image:nl-leerde.ogg|noicon|20px]]
|-
|''ik, jij, hij'' leer'''de''' - ''I, you, he'' learned 
|-
|[[image:nl-leerden.ogg|noicon|20px]]
|-
|''wij, jullie, zij'' leer'''den''' - ''we, you, they'' learned
|}

Notice the similarity with English: the past is formed with a dental suffix: '''-de''' (Dutch) '''-ed''' (English).

However if the root ends in a voiceless consonant (t, k, f, s, ch, p and x) the endings are voiceless in Dutch ''-te'', ''-ten'':

:passen - to pass
:ik pas - I pass → stem is ''pas''
:ik pas'''te''' - I passed
:wij pas'''ten''' - we passed

This happens in about a third of the weak verbs.

{{Dutch/Exercise|Weak past
|Put the following weak verbs in the past tense:
*reizen: ik reis  - to travel
*passen: wij passen - to pass, to fit
*betalen: betaal je? - to pay
*maken: u maakt - to make
*doden: hij doodt - to kill
*leven: jullie leven - to live
*voeden: ik voed - to feed
*dansen: danst zij? - to dance
*stofzuigen: ik stofzuig - to vacuum
*verteren: het verteert - to digest, to disintegrate
*ontzeggen: ontzeggen wij? - to deny
*zakken: u zakt: to descend, to fail
*werken: werkt Jan? - to work
*vergaderen: vergaderen zij? - to gather, to be in a meeting
|
*reizen: ik reis - ik reisde
*passen: wij passen - wij pasten
*betalen: betaal je? - betaalde je?
*maken: u maakt - u maakte
*doden: hij doodt - hij doodde
*leven: jullie leven - jullie leefden
*voeden: ik voed - ik voedde
*dansen: danst zij? - danste zij?
*stofzuigen: ik stofzuig - ik stofzuigde
*verteren: het verteert - het verteerde
*ontzeggen: ontzeggen wij? - ontzegden wij?
*zakken: u zakt: u zakte
*werken: werkt Jan? - werkte Jan
*vergaderen: vergaderen zij? - vergaderden zij?

Notice that the root of rei'''z'''en is rei'''z'''-, resulting in a -de ending even though the ''stem'' is written (and pronounced) as rei'''s'''. The -de ending is added to the stem (not the root). This idiosyncrasy of Dutch orthography gives many school children great headaches.
}}

====Perfect tense====
The perfect uses an ''auxiliary'' + ''the past participle''. For a weak verb is formed by prefixing ''ge-'' and suffixing an ending -d, or -t.

====Inseperable verbs====
If the verb already has a prefix like ''be-'', ''ont-'' or ''ver-'' or ''ge-'' itself, the ''ge-'' prefix is omitted:

:Wat bedoel je? - What do you mean?
:Ik '''heb''' dat zo niet '''bedoeld'''. - I did not mean it that way.

:Wat gebeurt er?
::Wat '''gebeurde''' er?
:::Wat '''is''' er '''gebeurd'''?

These verbs are called '''inseparable verbs''' to distinguish them from a group of verbs that have a prefix that can be separated. We will revisit those in a later lesson. The inseparable ones are relatively simple. Apart from the suppression of the ge- prefix they behave like normal verbs.

====The past participle on -d and -t====
The suffix of the participle is ''-d'' in the case of ''leren'':

the perfect
:ik heb '''ge'''leer'''d''' - I have learned

This is by far the most common way to form the past participle. However, if the root ends in a ''voiceless'' consonant (t, k, f, s, ch, p and x) the ending is a ''voiceless -t'':

:passen - to pass, to fit
:ik pas - I pass → stem is ''pas''
:ik heb '''ge'''pas'''t''' - I have passed

Dutch has &quot;final obstruent devoicing&quot;, a fancy term for the fact that a consonant at the end of a word is always pronounced as voiceless. That means that both the -d of &quot;geleerd&quot; and the -t of &quot;gepast&quot; as actually pronounced the same, as [t].

However, as in English the participle can also be used as an adjective. As such it also has an inflected form with -e:

:De geleerde les - the lesson learned
:Gepaste eerbied - fitting reverence

In this case the /d/ of geleer'''d'''e is actually  also pronounced [d] and the /t/ of gepas'''t'''e as [t].

If the root already ends in -d or -t the ending is omitted:

:feesten - gefeest
:baden - gebaad

=====Word order=====
In contrast to English the '''participle''' is put at the '''end''' of the sentence:

:Ik '''heb''' dat op school '''geleerd'''.

=====Primitive tenses=====
Most Dutch verbs can be fully reconstructed in all their forms if you know three primitive tenses, de ''stamtijden'':

'''''infinitive''''' - '''''past tense singular''''' - '''''perfect participle'''''
: leren - leerde - geleerd
: passen - paste - gepast
: bedoelen - bedoelde - bedoeld
: gebeuren - gebeurde - gebeurd

This is why verbs are often represented this way in dictionaries, including in WikiWoordenboek. If you want a complete table of all possible forms, this becomes rather large especially if you list all the compound tenses. 

Take a look at the page ''{{Nlwikt|toekennen}}'' and compare it with the full conjugation at ''{{Nlwikt|toekennen/vervoeging}}''.

=====Auxiliaries=====
The '''auxiliary''' is usually a form of ''hebben'' like it is ''to have'' in English (see below for its forms). However, unlike English there is a group of verbs (ergative verbs) that take ''zijn'' (to be) instead. 

Notice that ''gebeuren'' (to happen) is one such case: It is an '''ergative''' verb. Instead of an action such verbs express either a '''process or a movement'''. Compare:
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;  margin: 0.5em 0 0 0; border-style: solid; border: 1px solid #AAAAAA; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 100%;&quot;

*vergaderen: vergaderen zij? - hebben zij vergaderd?

Notice that the root of rei'''z'''en is rei'''z'''-, resulting in a -d ending even though the ''stem'' is written (and pronounced) as rei'''s'''. The -d ending is added to the stem (not the root). This idiosyncrasy of Dutch orthography gives many school children great headaches even more so because the final -d is pronounced devoiced as [t]. In &quot;gereisde&quot; however the [d] does return in the spoken language.

===Strong verbs===
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|lopen}}||{{knp2|liep}}||{{knp2|gelopen}}
|}
:lopen    - to walk (cf. leap)
:Ik loop  - I walk
:Ik l'''ie'''p - I walked (notice the vowel change)
:Ik heb '''ge'''lop'''en'''

The participle ends in '''-en''' in the case of strong verbs.
====Which verbs are strong?====
There are more than 150 strong roots and including all derived forms lopen, ''be''lopen, ''ver''lopen etc. there are more than 1500 strong verbs in Dutch. And you will just have to learn them. Few rules can be given which verbs are weak and which are strong, but we can try:
#All verbs borrowed from Latin or French are ''weak''. 
#All strong verbs have the basic structure root-ending, e.g. ''lopen'', or (prefix)-root-ending, e.g. ''beginnen''. Verbs with more syllables, like kantelen, begoochelen are always weak. 
#Many strong verbs have cognates that are irregular verbs in English. E.g. zingen - zong - gezongen has to sing - sang - sung as cognate. The cognate sometimes has a different meaning, e.g. ''rijden'' is cognate with ''to ride'' but can mean ''to drive a car''. If you know any German: most strong verbs in Dutch are strong in German as well.

====The seven classes====
There are '''seven distinct patterns''' (classes) of vowel change. These patterns are exceedingly old. They come from the Indo-European
language and are much better preserved  in Dutch than they are in English.

The most common one (Class I) has ..ij... - ..ee.. - ..e..:
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|schrijven}}||{{knp2|schreef}}||{{knp2|geschreven}}
|-
|{{knp2|blijven}}||{{knp2|bleef}}||{{knp2|gebleven}}
|-
|{{knp2|lijden}}||{{knp2|leed}}||{{knp2|geleden}}
|}

:schrijven - schreef - geschreven
:blijven - bleef - gebleven
:lijden - leed - geleden

English has far fewer strong verbs left and they have become ''irregular'', i.e. the patterns are no longer very recognizable, although sometimes the resemblance is still striking, compare:

:spreken - to speak
:sprak - spoke
:gesproken - spoken

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|spreken}}||{{knp2|sprak}}&lt;br/&gt;{{knp2|spraken}}||{{knp2|gesproken}}
|}
We will come back to strong verbs later, particularly in the practice lessons 6A and 7A. Fortunately for all Dutch verbs except a handful it is enough to memorize ''de stamtijden'' (the primitive times):

:lopen-liep-gelopen  (infinitive - past tense - past participle)

If you are uncertain about the primitive tenses of a verb, a trip to WikiWoordenboek will easily remedy that. The primitive tenses are typically given in a small table on the right of the screen. Have a look at {{Nlwikt|lopen}}.

Lopen is a verb of movement. This is why is uses ''to be'' as auxiliary if a direction of the movement process is specified. Compare:

:Ik ben naar huis gelopen - I walked home
:Ik heb altijd veel gelopen - I always did a lot of walking

In the latter case the verb takes &quot;hebben&quot; because the emphasis is not on the movement process but on the activity (action).  

Notice that Dutch often uses the perfect tense where English uses a simple past. The past tense corresponds more to the past continuous in English, although the division of labor between the tenses is different in the two languages.

:Ik liep naar huis - I was walking home


The past of some of the strong verbs has a plural that undergoes lengthening of the vowel:

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|breken}}||{{knp2|brak}}&lt;br/&gt;{{knp2|braken}}||{{knp2|gebroken}}
|}

:breken-brak-gebroken

:ik brak (as in father)
:wij braken (as in Gaad)

(Thus the verb has four stages of vowel change. This is also a very ancient aspect of the language. It stems straight out of Indo-European. Anglo-Saxon had something similar.)

====Past continuous====

Dutch does not have a past (or present) continuous as such, although there is a construction using ''aan het'' + infinitive that can be used to describe continuity rather emphatically:

:Ik was naar huis '''aan het lopen''', toen ik hem zag
:::I was (busy) walking home when I saw him

Verbs like lopen, staan, zitten, liggen (walk, stand, sit and lie) can also be used to express continuous action. They take ''te'' + infinitive:

:Ik '''zat te''' denken - I was thinking (while sitting)
:Ik '''stond te''' bellen - I was on the phone (while standing)

===Irregular verbs===

There are only a few verbs (actually 6) that demand more knowledge than that which is contained in the three ''stamtijden'' (primitive tenses)

They are: ''zijn'', ''hebben'', ''zullen'', ''mogen'', ''kunnen'' and ''willen'' 

====The auxiliary ''to have''====
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|hebben}}||{{knp2|heb}}||{{knp2|hebt}}||{{knp2|heeft}}||{{knp2|hebben}}||{{knp2|had}}||{{knp2|gehad}}
|}

The most important irregular verbs are ''hebben'' and ''zijn'':

:hebben-had-gehad

:hebben                   - to have
:ik heb                   - I have
:jij hebt                 - you have
:hij ''heeft''            - he has
:wij, jullie, zij hebben  - we, you, they have

=====Past tense=====
:ik, jij, hij '''had''' - I, you, he had
:wij, jullie, zij hadden - we, you, they had

=====Perfect=====
:ik heb '''gehad'''

====The auxiliary ''to be''====
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|zijn}}||{{knp2|ben}}||{{knp2|bent}}||{{knp2|is}}||{{knp2|was}}||{{knp2|waren}}||{{knp2|geweest}}
|}

:zijn-was-geweest

:zijn, wezen              - to be
:ik  ben                  - I am
:jij bent                 - you are
:hij is                   - he is
:wij, jullie, zij zijn    - we, you, they are

=====Past tense=====
:ik was
:wij waren

=====Perfect=====
:ik '''ben''' geweest - I have been

Notice that to be is seen as an ergative: it is not an action, but a 'process'.
=====Infinitive=====
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|wezen}}||{{knp2|wees}}||{{knp2|weest}}||{{knp2|zij}}||{{knp2|ware}}
|}
:zijn
:wezen

Wezen is quite common in certain parts of the Netherlands, but frowned upon in other regions.
=====Imperative=====
:wees!
:weest!
:weest u!
=====Subjunctive=====
:het zij
:''past'': het ware

Both are archaic but they are still be seen in certain expressions.

===Strong and weak verbs with irregularities===
Some strong and weak verbs do not completely follow any of the regular patterns. We have seen one:
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|verslaan}}||{{knp2|versloeg}}||{{knp2|verslagen}}
|}

:verslaan
:ik versla
:ik versloeg
:ik heb verslagen

Notice that the present tense and the infinitive do not have a &quot;g&quot;.

There is also a group of weak verbs ends in -cht rather than just -t:

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|brengen}}||{{knp2|bracht}}||{{knp2|gebracht}}
|-
|{{knp2|denken}}||{{knp2|dacht}}||{{knp2|gedacht}}
|}
:brengen - bracht - gebracht
:denken - dacht - gedacht

The vowel of these roots also changes, but historically these verbs are weak. Notice that English has something similar (brought, thought).

In these cases it is still enough to know the three primitive tenses to reconstruct the entire verb. As this is the case for all Dutch verbs bar six it is customary to represent a verb whether weak, strong or irregular by these primitive tenses and reserve the term ''irregular'' for the handful cases where this does not suffice.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Copying and Pasting ==
Copying and pasting tasks are done with three keys, {{Vi/key|y}} (for &quot;yank&quot;), {{Vi/key|d}}  (for &quot;delete&quot;), and {{Vi/key|p}} (for &quot;paste&quot;).  In general, you type {{Vi/key|y}} or {{Vi/key|d}} to tell vi that you're at the position where you want to start yanking or deleting some text.  Then you need to tell vi where to stop, using cursor movement or other commands.

You can also simply use key {{Vi/key|v}} to enter a visual mode. Then you can highlight text by moving cursor keys. And finally press {{Vi/key|y}} to copy text to clipboard. And {{Vi/key|p}} for paste.

=== A Word ===

To delete a single word, move your cursor to the first letter, then type {{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|w}}.
To yank a single word, move your cursor to the first letter, then type {{Vi/key|y}}{{Vi/key|w}}.

==== Other Methods ====

Move to the character past the last letter and type {{Vi/key|d}} {{Vi/key|b}}.

To delete a word like &quot;can't&quot;, which has an apostrophe, move to the first character and type {{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|W}}.  Note the capital W.  This tells vi to go all the way to the first whitespace character after the word.

Likewise, try dB.

=== A Line ===

To delete a single line, type {{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|d}}.

=== Other Amounts ===
One of the great things about vi is that it lets you select a bunch of text without having to move your hand to your mouse.

Type {{Vi/key|m}}{{Vi/key|a}}.  This will mark the current position that your cursor is at as mark '''a'''.  You can go back to this position anytime you want from now on by typing {{Vi/key|`}}{{Vi/key|a}}.  (`a means &quot;move to the character that has been marked as '''a'''&quot;)

Now move to some other position.  Type {{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|`}}{{Vi/key|a}}.  This will delete everything from the current position to the position you marked as '''a'''.

Note that you can use nearly any key in place of the {{Vi/key|a}} used in this example.  For instance, you might use {{Vi/key|m}}{{Vi/key|t}} to mark the ''top'' of a section, or {{Vi/key|m}}{{Vi/key|b}} to mark the ''bottom''.  These mnemonics are strictly in the user's head - vi doesn't care that ''t'' means ''top'' or ''b'' means bottom.  Vi will remember all unique bookmarks, allowing the user to easily and quickly jump between them.  Some users find using {{Vi/key|m}}{{Vi/key|m}} to be a convenient temporary bookmark, because it can be typed so quickly.

==== To the end or beginning of a line ====

{{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|$}} or {{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|^}}

==== To the end or beginning of the file ====

{{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|G}} or {{Vi/key|d}}{{Vi/key|1}}{{Vi/key|G}}

==== To the next occurrence of a pattern ====

{{Vi/key|d}}/myPattern

This is particularly useful when editing HTML files with d/&lt;

== Adjusting the Screen ==

vi, as a visual screen-oriented editor has a number of useful commands to redraw or adjust the screen in case you find yourself somewhere where you don't want to be.

If you run in a Unix shell, it is possible that some background process writes to the same terminal. This will disturb vi's screen layout. In order to force vi to redraw the complete screen, press {{Vi/key|Ctrl-L}} or {{Vi/key|Ctrl-R}}. Both commands do the same.

If you want to adjust what is currently displayed, then the {{Vi/key|z}} command is rather useful. It's a kind of Swiss army knife, and has a rather complex syntax:

    [/''pattern''/][''m'']&lt;tt&gt;z&lt;/tt&gt;[''n''](&lt;CR&gt;|.|-)

([ ... ] denotes optional items, (...|...) denotes alternatives)

Before we explain the syntax in detail, here are some common applications of the command:

Scroll the screen so the current line becomes the middle line of the screen. The cursor remains on that line:

    {{Vi/key|z}}{{Vi/key|.}}   

Scroll the screen so the current line becomes the top line on the screen:

    {{Vi/key|z}}{{Vi/key|CR}}

Scroll the screen, so the current line becomes the bottom line of the screen

    {{Vi/key|z}}{{Vi/key|-}}

If a &lt;tt&gt;/''pattern''/&lt;/tt&gt; or a number ''m'' is given the cursor is moved further after the adjustment. &lt;tt&gt;/''pattern''/&lt;/tt&gt; indicates to move the cursor to the first match of that pattern. ''m'' indicates to move the cursor to the ''m''th line on the screen. So, for example,

    &lt;tt&gt;/while/z&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

would first scroll the screen so the current line becomes the top line on the screen, and then move the cursor to the first 'while' in the text from that position on.

The number ''n'' is a rather obscure parameter. If provided, it tells vi to behave as if the screen is just ''n'' lines high. The result is that only ''n'' number of lines are adjusted, and the rest of the screen is either ignored or cleared, presumably useful on slow terminals to avoid redrawing the screen unneccessarily.

'''Pico de Gallo''' has two meanings in Mexican cuisine.  The most familiar to North Americans is a fresh, tomato-based salad. It is what North Americans usually mean when talking about &quot;ensalada&quot; or &quot;tomato ensalada.&quot;  This ensalada is never cooked.  

The second meaning, more common in some regions of Mexico, is a spice mixture including salt and dried chiles which is served, often with lime juice, over fresh fruit.    If you are unfamiliar with the regional origin of a recipe involving pico de gallo, context may be the only way to determine which meaning is intended, though for US-Mex dishes the &quot;uncooked salsa&quot; meaning will almost always be correct.

== Ingredients ==

*2 cups chopped fresh tomato
*&amp;frac12; cup chopped white or yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 teaspoons freshly squeezed Lime juice
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 &amp;frac12; tablespoons stemmed, seeded, and minced [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]] or other chiles
*1 small clove of garlic, minced
*[[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]], to taste

== Procedure ==

#Wash the vegetables and cilantro.
#Dice the vegetables.
#Combine them, mixing well. 
#Add salt, pepper, chiles, lime juice, and garlic.
#Add hot sauce if desired.
#Let stand 30 minutes to allow ingredients to mesh.

'''Tomato Concassé''' (French ''tomates concassées'') is skinned, de-seeded, and diced tomato.

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]

== Procedure ==
# Boil a large pot of water and prepare a large bowl with ice water for refreshing the tomatoes. 
# Remove the stem and core of the tomatoes by cutting a cone shaped piece out of the stem-end of each tomato. Then score a large X (arms about 1 inch (2.5cm) long) centered on the other end of the tomato. 
# Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for about 30-45 seconds then immediately refresh in the ice water bath. 
# Once cool, peel the skin off the tomatoes. Then slice the tomatoes in half around the circumference, not through the stem.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:en:Mastering the Art of French Cooking|''Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'' by Julia Child ''et al''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Squeeze  out the juice and seeds, scraping with a spoon. 
# Lay the tomato carcasses flat on a cutting board and dice into ⅜ inch (0.75cm) pieces.&lt;ref&gt; ''If you don't care that much, you can skip the skinning and seeding part and just chop the tomatoes into ⅜-inch pieces, but that's not really tomato concassé, just diced tomatoes.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seafood''' is derived from aquatic animals, such as fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. These animals provide protein in many diets around the world. The harvesting of seafood is called &quot;fishing. &quot; 

The term is not restricted to sea creatures, but may include fresh-water animals as well. This class of foods, perhaps unexpectedly to some, may also include land snails.  

The plants of the sea are often also edible, including [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]], which is actually a type of algae, and is usually classified as a vegetable, rather than a seafood.

Would it be possible to get a brief description of what different types of fish taste like, why you would want to choose one over another, etc? --[[User:NeuronExMachina|NeuronExMachina]] 02:51, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Oyster(L).jpg|thumb|300px|A shucked raw oyster on the half-shell]]
The name '''Oyster''' is used for a number of different groups of molluscs which grow for the most part in marine or brackish water.

The &quot;true oysters&quot; are the members of the family Ostreidae, and this includes the edible oysters, which mainly belong to the genera  ''Ostrea'', ''Crassostrea'', ''Ostreola'' or ''Saccostrea''.  Examples are the Edible Oyster, ''Ostrea edulis,'' the Olympia Oyster ''Ostreola conchaphila,'' and the Eastern Oyster ''Crassostrea virginica''.

Oysters can be canned, eaten raw or cooked. When caught, like all shellfish they have an extremely short shelf-life.  They should be fresh when consumed or serious illness can result.  Additionally, oysters can host various illness-causing pathogens.  Therefore, consumption of raw oysters should be done with caution. Researchers in Oregon have invented a self-shucking oyster.

Farm raised oysters are listed as a &quot;Best Choice&quot; by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's [http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/seafoodwatch.asp Seafood Watch Program] (non farm raised wild oysters are only list as a &quot;Good Alternative&quot;).

Ah, I wanted to know how to cook my SIX oysters. If I had fifty I would have a chef to cook them for me.
